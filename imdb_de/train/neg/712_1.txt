When I started watching this movie, I saw the guy from Buffy, Xander, and realized how nice it is that he still earns his living in movies. Well, a strange movie I can stand, considering it's a good dose of weird stuff, like David Lynch movies, Gemini's summit, lost country road, etc. And you have to be in the mood somehow. This, however, made me mockingly reminiscent of the crazy websites about conspiracy theories that make absolutely no sense. I mean, do people come to Nazis who conspire with America to create an unholy trinity of evil forces? I was surprised that they did not mention the hollow earth in this movie with Hitler's flying saucers and lizardmen. If you had 60 grams of heroine with this movie, that might make sense, but in an emergency, I do not accept drugs like this movie. It should be burned, shredded and forgotten, so that good old Xander might get another acting job. It was not his acting, that was fine, but the script just did not make sense. We are sorry.
