Worse than the rating there has been. This is a typical sci-fi movie these days: bad to horrible drama, poorly written script and bad direction. From the opening scene, in which DeMille buries his set to the end, this movie is terrible. In the opening scenes of this film, Moses (Charlton Heston in the DeMille film), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) are visible with a view of a boy burying a box in the sand. The characters that were to represent the three icons mentioned were terrible and had to resemble the people they were supposed to be "alleged". The fact that it is in the desert outside of civilization is funny when someone gets hurt and everyone calls for an ambulance. Of course, the writer does not know that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed that Morena Baccarin chose a film of such low quality.
