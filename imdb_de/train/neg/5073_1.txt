The teasers for Tree of Palm try to give it as a sort of allegory for a fairytale with real meaning, and immediately rave about the animation. I should have known what that meant. <br /> <br /> The main character Palme is a good example of the problem of the entire film. One minute, Palme is a humble hero in search of himself, the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he used to care about. <br /> <br /> Like all characters in the movie, Palm is poorly defined. You do not connect with the characters at all, though Shatta has won some fan girls. It seems that the author was more interested in drama and complexity than moving in this film, rather than exploring the motives and personalities of his characters. <br /> <br /> In the last 15 years, new, useless storylines have been introduced minutes of the movie. The writer had to seriously rationalize his story. Maybe he was trying to be epic, but it was just too much information for a two-hour movie. But I wonder if an action with so many dimensions and characters would be better for a television series or a comic book novel. In the last five minutes of the movie, I could have simply done so, no longer enduring the sheer lack of quality and laughed at how much the characters, the relationships and the whole conspiracy were. I touched my companion and he also started to break, just like a young man sitting behind us. We tried so hard to control ourselves, but we just could not stand the awful quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> The animation is incredible and the viewers will admire the lush backgrounds and the charming character designs. The animation almost takes you through; If you are not interested in the characters, learn how you feel.
