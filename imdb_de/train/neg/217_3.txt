This is a film based solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to attract attention. That's it. The dialogues are pitiful and the sensuality of the "sex scenes" is absolutely absent schoolchildren, but the subject is intended for adults. It is a discouraged and shallow movie. It could have been much better if it had a story and more drama. Ah, and moreover: Why are internal monologues used so excessively? Makes it seem so cheap. All in all an embarrassing movie for the Romanian cinema as well as for the mature audience trying to view it start using some good actors in their films and stop recycleing them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can do not act!
