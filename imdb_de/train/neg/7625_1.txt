This is your only spoiler warning. What a sad state of our cinema, when unprofessional garbage like this is considered "Oscar worthy". <br /> <br /> I divide the material into three levels. The first is the stage theater. Here, the viewer stagnates and the power lies in the representation of the actor and above all in the power of the writer. A good playwright is better than a good scriptwriter because he or she knows the word ways better. The best playwrights know how to create images that the infertile stage can not portray. <br /> <br /> The second stage is the movie. A weaker author can be used in this medium, but the viewer does not sit in one place all the time. In the context of film, the context can take on strong writing as well as the qualities of visual poetry and meaning. In addition, the film can manipulate everyday elements such as sound and color in an almost surreal way. <br /> <br /> The last level is literature. In this context everything is presented by the author, translated on paper and then reinvented by the reader. A novel can be far more detailed than a movie studio can imagine. <br /> <br /> That's why adjustments can go up, but never down. New developments are never better than the base film (see the dime-a-dozen films in your local bookstore), while the film can not provide the same performance as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR). Films can rarely be turned into plays, and plays can always be turned into films. <br /> <br /> As with 'The Last Picture Show' it fails. It's a movie that should stay on stage because the director is too stupid to do anything right. The characters talk the same way and behave the same way, it's just futility. Add to that a disgusting soundtrack, and you have a totally unsurpassable movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in my high school acting class with about 20 other would-be theaters. The teacher raved about how sad the movie was. What is sad is how such stagnant work is perceived as depressing when the material itself is funny. If this had been colored, the scenes of powerlessness, the pool party and the old hooker would be a big comedy. Take a look at what Lucas did with "American Graffiti" a few years later. <br /> <br /> The American secondary school system has to start teaching ABOUT film instead of trying to teach WITH film. Two visually strong downbeat films: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Rely on them, not this one. It's the last thing I want to see. 1 out of 5.
