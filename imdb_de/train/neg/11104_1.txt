I'm not one of those people who just go online after seeing a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made. If you doubt me, please take a look at my other reviews. For the first time, though, I've seen a movie so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was even before it was over. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. For me Ed Wood is a genius, I thought Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and the worst horror movies were good. However, I can not say anything good about this film. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically nonexistent. If someone who reads my review wastes his money to see him, he can find out for himself what the story might be, but I advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie. The special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is bad. <br /> <br /> The two leads are attractive, but that's all there is. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to spoil a movie for anyone, but I invite everyone to send me an email at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a penny for it. I will tell you everything. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies and I love horror and I love new imaginative movies. I even love horror porn stuff like hostel (which some critics said was so, but obviously they only thought because Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2). But this could be number 1, which has made the most worthless, stupid and stupid movie of all time. <br /> <br /> And before you ignore this criticism, it comes from someone who not only played the entire premiere of the House of the Dead, but actually bought a copy of it.
