SPOILERS THROUGHOUT !!!! <br /> <br /> I had read the book "1st to die" and wanted to see if the movie followed the book, so I saw it. Mostly it did. There were some minor differences (for example, the location of the last violent scene), but not many, and the film remained largely faithful to the book, as was the case with most films. <br /> <br /> This could have been a mistake - Although the movie was perfectly populated - especially with pollen and bellows - I was not impressed with the book. Or let me take that back. I started very impressed, gradually becoming more disillusioned and in the end I was completely dissatisfied and almost caught myself. No difference to the movie. Here is the reason. <br /> <br /> There is no "reward" in the book or the movie. Rarely have I read a who-it-thriller that has made such a fallacy with its final release, and I had hoped the movie would vary a bit. <br /> <br /> The whole thing (he did it, NO she did it.), NO, they did - was not interesting, not intriguing and confusing, annoying and depressing than anything else. In addition, the love of Lindsay's life dies in the end (after HER illness has cleared and she cries at his grave) .. and then move on to the point where she thinks about suicide ... and suddenly she fights for her Living with the REAL villain who was evicted after the arrest .. but it turns out he and his wife were in it together ... HELLO !!! The whole thing is now "GENERAL HOSPITAL" instead of a good, old-fashioned thriller. I felt cheated and torn from the book and watched the movie (I have to admit my attention was good - acting was very good for a TV movie). I hoped that he would not follow the book that did it /> <br /> I still think that the movie is on display and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in the mouth as the book (or maybe it is just so that I knew what would happen). But I have to say it by the way Story riddling was not well done at all.
