Years have passed since Alex Rain (played in the first film by Olivier Gruner) came across the terrible conspiracy of replacing people with machines. Since then, there has been a war between cyborgs and humans, and we've lost a kind of superwoman daughter of Olivier Gruner's character (she also inherits only half of his minimal acting ability), which in my opinion is the film's minimal connection to the first, but as The Super Woman is created, she hides in 1980, while a future bounty hunter chases her this confusing sci-fi clunker. Nemesis became a cult hit, and I can see why people liked it, even though I was not a fan of that movie. Nemesis was very ambitious trying to come up with different ideas, get a nice look and a lot of action, it almost worked. Nemesis 2 does not even have that ambition, it's a cheap rip-off of The Terminator with a muscular woman who does so little acting that Olivier Gruner looks like a master and the action sequences lack the explosive play selling point of the original. I admit I was not a fan of the original, but it deserves a better post. The original also featured a good cast such as Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley. No one is here, and this time it's just a boring movie with a presumptuous atmosphere. After seeing that, it actually helped add half a star to the original. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bath)
