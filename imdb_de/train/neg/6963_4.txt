The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy films. They were always ready to destroy cities with giant plastic monsters that came from space and elsewhere. The problem is that they never had the money to make a compelling special effect. This film, published in France under the title "Les envahisseurs de l'espace", is no exception. His goal is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster who are trying to prevail over humans. It is extremely cumbersome and ridiculous, but also very pleasing. We like these creatures and these movies, right?
