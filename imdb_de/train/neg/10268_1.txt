No doubt this is one of the worst movies I've ever spent money on! The action is, um, did I say that there was an action? The scariest moment was when ... Nowhere does one fall! The best special effect of hiding under the quilts was ..., nobody can come up with that. They knew from the beginning who the killer was. There was nothing scary about the whole movie, in fact, the only two interesting places were when you saw little sister Misty in the shower and when you saw Sister Toppan taking off her top. This movie should only be watched to get an idea of ​​how to make NO horror movie !!!
