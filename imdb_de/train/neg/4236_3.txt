If you like pop / punk, punk, ska and a bit of modern psycho-billy, then live performance is the only thing worth seeing. There are plenty of band cams in this film, along with the president of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman's semi-major role, and many silly death scenes. Sounds like it could be good, right? Well, the dead come again and again to many different bands of the Warp Tour and the fans of the event. Some of the deaths begin in style, but then they are recycled time and again until they completely recur. Almost everyone dies of having their heads smashed or intestines pulled out of their bellies. It looks like it comes from Andreas Schnaa's "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence"; with this "watered-down" blood, but now this movie is really decent and has humor - something that's terribly lacking in this movie. Sure, the movie was made by Doug Sakmann of Troma, he has a lot of budget potential and he tries ... but just too hard. Everything in this movie is supposed to be overly funny, and that's what's upset him. Everything is trying to be funny and stupid, deliberately using bad behavior, overusing unnecessary deaths and doing the same ... over and over again. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ace Kicker," "Chairman of the Board," or any movie you made with your friends: it's funny for those who made it, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Great potential, great idea, great use of effects - but it's the same ... over and over again: a band plays, a band dies, fans die. Everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process repeats itself. <br /> <br /> The question is for these types of films - which is basically a 'bad baton' - they're trying too hard or not at all?
