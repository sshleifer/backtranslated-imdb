I saw it on a whim because it was available and I heard that the Thumb movies were funny. This one was not. The majority of the jokes were based on "Geranium" and again on Kate Winslets. I think it's really pathetic when the "Thumbtanic" creators bend so low to prank a respected actress just because she (the sky forbids) does not starve to the model of ideal modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was the line that looks something like, "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's swim to this makeshift raft that nobody else seems to see!" A 30-minute conversation from a 26-minute movie does not trigger the value.
