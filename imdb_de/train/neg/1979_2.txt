Hmm, hip hop music to a western period. Modern phrases like "cool" and too many others to track. "The sistahs are in this house" !? French manicured nails on hard riding girl. Microphone packs will be visible on the back of Li'l Kim CLEARLY. I simply can not continue with the litany of mistakes of the director and the editors. <br /> <br /> Acting is not as bad as I've ever seen. The women were good enough with a bad script. <br /> <br /> It was strange how Louis Mandylor spoke in his native accent. The costumes are fantastic, if totally wrong. I just can not believe that they are twisting things that could have been a great story. I would feel offended to believe that this movie was loaded with such traps that it would run well downtown. <br /> <br />
