I've seen 8 or 9 Duke movies, and none of them had any influence on me. <br /> <br /> I have seen several documentary films about him. He is obviously an intelligent man with a great knowledge of films and his passion for producing these films. But that makes him a good director. NO! An absolute anti-talent. He can make a good documentary because of the features already mentioned, but a movie with actors? No way! <br /> <br /> He can neither conduct nor write. His scripts are full of ill-conceived situations, and many of the situations / dialogues in his films are so childish and bad that they can not hide behind the word "art" in any way. Under no circumstance. Not to mention the awkward direction, so amateurish. To say that he wants to direct and write crap is a lie. <br /> <br /> Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the shop. WHO CAN PROTECT IT? <br /> <br /> He is a scammer. He knows what false intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to include in the script to get your attention and empty praise. The rest of the script and the sloppy direction do not matter. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a movie like Medem, I could re-examine his old films and try to find talents in them.
