It seems that the purpose of the film was to show the aggressive (maffia-like) character of the Russians, or at least of the Russians who can travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and this British police is so inefficient that they can not find the person who robbed the bank, even if those people leave the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and the alleged Russian colleagues spoke a language that is nowhere to be known, probably from aliens in the Urals, but far from being Russian. So if you really want to speak Russian, go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and learn to learn Russian grammar and pronunciation.
