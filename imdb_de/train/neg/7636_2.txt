I wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy that recognizes this country is slapstick and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course it was the other way around - let's be cool and nervous - and came out to show the other side with little. I bet One Small Seed went crazy for it. I know that SL did it. <br /> <br /> No one of the main characters has the comedic kicks to make it. Even Danny K had a better timing. I'm really serious. Every time they introduced a bit of character, I always thought, "Damn, that person should have been the main character!". Independence does not mean that the camera work has to be terrible. Black and white did not do anything for this film - actually it hurt even more with such shallow conversations, bringing boredom into sharp relief. The black and white was not crisp. The composition was terrible. The use of music was terrible. Oddly, I saw Little Miss Sunshine after this movie, and the composition was great - maybe the flaws in this movie are in my head. <br /> <br /> I think Corne (who was funnier than the lead role) before he even said anything) spoke to this movie and not David - see it and you will understand. I bet the people organizing Oppikoppi were upset. You would think that nothing happens. I felt like it might have been filmed in someone else's garden. I know ordinary people who have much funnier, sharper and funnier conversations than any of these "comics". The guy they connected with the end was fine. <br /> <br /> Guess SA Comedy will stay in the Stone Age for a bit longer. Good job people.
