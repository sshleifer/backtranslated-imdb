Wonderful actor. <br /> <br /> Lousy script and not too good a direction. My main problem was that I just did not deal with these people. Not the murderer, not the victims. The settings were pretty dull. The character of Dennis Quaid was so badly inscribed that I did not even care when the end came. He got his child back. Big thing! I wanted my money back.
