This movie was almost unbearable. I can go beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot on a home video camera, and this movie should last for several weeks, but the characters do not change their outfits, but acting has broken the 4th wall for me , I saw better acting in a fourth grade. Apart from that, the plot is unrealistic. If the man suspected the guy, he would have delivered him. I was also very disappointed that all killings were carried out with a weapon. This is not a copycat that the zodiac did not kill with a weapon the authorities would have known was not him. Another thing that really bothered me was that it was called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4, if that's the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders, not the name of the disorder. Overall, I think that this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done on a low budget, at least not as low as it did, or they could have made them have better actors or more gore. Many people have taken the low-budget path without terrible actors having to watch Easy Rider with Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson on a low budget.
