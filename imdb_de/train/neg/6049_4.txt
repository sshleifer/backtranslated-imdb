First of all, who thinks the sequel to William Friedkin's "The French Connection" is definitely crazy or moronic, or both. The problem with discussing this movie is, a.) It's a sequel to a brilliant movie that makes watching the movie always difficult, and b.) Directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors I've ever wanted , William Friendkin was the perfect person to make a movie about drug trafficking in dilapidated New York City. Frankenhimer is one of the most stylish directors of all time, ie "The Manchurian." Candidate "and" Seconds ", and with" French Connection 2 "it feels like someone is trying to be gloomy and not having the right understanding of it - the fact that Frankenhimer himself is the director of the sequel to Gene Hackman It is well known that Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and vowed never to work with him again, and it was also known that he imagined that the character would be one-dimensional, weight-bearing and trying to make him look like a straight character, it shows you that Hackman, though he was a great actor, had no idea who was going to make the movie and the story great, the plot of Doyle becoming addictive is interesting, but the rest of the film is not compulsory - an unfortunate low point in Frankenhimer's filmography.
