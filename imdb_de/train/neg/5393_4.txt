I'm a fan of Shakespeare and can understand what Ken Branagh has done to get Shakespeare back for a new generation of viewers. However, this film does not convey the overall intentions of the game with the ridiculous music sequences. In addition, Alicia Silverstone stumbles across the dialogue (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in Much Ado About Nothing) and other poorly cast roles.
