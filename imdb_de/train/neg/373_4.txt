Blank Check is a film that I saw one day on television and how most of the films are also broadcast on television. Blank check was not so good. First and foremost, no one I've ever met saw Blank Check, and that includes people who grew up in the 1990s. Even blank check will not be remembered in the '00s, just because it is overshadowed by Pixar films. I would not call Blankcheck a bad movie, but it's not really entertaining either. (Or it is not over 6 years old for anyone.) Blank Check is not an entertaining movie because none of it is original. Everything brings you to "what have I not seen yet?" Blank Check rips off, trying to redeem everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (which strangely includes both Macaulay Culkin). Blank Check is not a bad movie, but it deserves to be in the dark.
