Has anyone stopped to understand what kind of movie they produced here? Now a former naval officer is being drawn to a group of children in a cadet school, so this should be a family comedy, right? Not correct . This is just a rough comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad tastes. It was possibly stupid at the time, but I found Damon Wayan's voice irritating beyond belief. Does he speak that way in real life? If he does that, he has my sympathy, but he does not get any of my money when he sees his films
