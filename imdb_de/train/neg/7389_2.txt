I buy or watch every Seagall movie. He came out with a handful of good movies, which then plunged into poor stories, bad camerawork and a people search. He almost lost me. A few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now he is forgotten again. This movie is seriously dark (at every level you want to name). There's a lot of Slash & Gash for no obvious purpose, unless it's meant as a warning to the military. Seagall may have had a substitute for many of his scenes, as was often the case too dark to say so, and someone else's voice was mostly used. Unfortunately, the only interesting character was the villain who had killed his guard to escape custody and then messed up everywhere. Okay, since when do we put an armed guard with a prisoner in the waiting room? Anyway, this villain was at least colorful and very focused. There is a lot of gore if you like this king of the thing. It looked to me like the bad guys doing the same cut every time. I'm just glad they did not suck blood to their hapless victims. I go back to my summary. Basically, it's a horror movie, disguised as an action movie. Dec 6,2006
