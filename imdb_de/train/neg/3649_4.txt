This is a fair little show about the paranormal, though it feels like Art Bell and his people have figured out how to break a career out of the attitude that Carl Kolchak exemplified. Of course, there probably would not be any X-Files if that show did not prepare this audience so well. Darren McGavin is not exactly the superhero, but he is a plausible (enough) man to perform heroic deeds. Check out his work on some of these old Alfred Hitchcock gifts. Here he is the main attraction, there seems to be no girlfriend or wife that is a distraction. In fact, there is not much sex appeal for the show. I also notice that the tempo is not typically exciting. There is a lot of groundbreaking humor in this show. Sometimes it's just pokey to get to the climax. There is a thread from this show that stretches stylistically to the current MAD MEN show. Not that David Chase writes Mad Men, but the people who worked under The Sopranos under him have definitely imitated and inherited his serio-comic tone.
