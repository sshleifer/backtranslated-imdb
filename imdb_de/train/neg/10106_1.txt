Yes, I'm sure it could really be a nation. , , If four of them were all in the four corners of the world, and the other two cloned billions of times. Man, I'm really glad I saw this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it. I'm a big fan of the George Romero movies, and I'm pretty sure he would probably laugh too much if he saw this movie. I mean, what about the raccoon girls posing as zombies and running around like Charlie's devil? It also really helped that the music composer chose the shitty fashion show music when the zombies came to their killer, especially the part where they went to the warehouse and turned out to be a furniture store / police station / apartment / apartment / in which Room was always in the background with the gong, and the living woman was discussing the closed furniture business. I could not even say what nationality the killer was, and the fact that his accent pointed to several nations did not help either. Well, what can I expect from a movie in which they throw a random fight scene into a warehouse for no good reason, apparently delivering air boxes all over the world? For anyone who admires Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you like to burn bad C movies (C for Craptastic) then this is the movie for you. , , or not.
