I was so excited when I discovered it was available! I could not wait to see it. What a waste of energy! It's a kind of rarity CD of your favorite band that you found in the back of the shelf at your local music store. As a hardcore fan you were sure it was a valuable find. But when you heard it, it became clear why these dogs never made it to a real album. This DVD is only recommended for "completionists" who need to have everything Lynch has done. "Six Men Getting Sick" is a bit visually interesting, but short and repetitive. It lacks the power of Lynch's later work "The Grandmother," which is simply an immature job. It's boring and looks like a student movie. But it was the 70s ... It's only interesting if you hope to make the director psychoanalytic. But you can briefly see the seed of some of his brand images and sounds. "The Alpahabet" is forgotten (No, I do not remember it at all!) "The Amputee" is futile. "The Cowboy and the Frenchman" is just stupid. "Lumiere" is the only one worth it. Without dialogue, Lynch tells a disturbing story that is comparable to his best work. I had to see this several times. But it takes less than 2 minutes. It is hardly worth renting or buying the DVD.
