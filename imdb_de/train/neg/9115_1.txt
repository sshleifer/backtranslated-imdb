If you ask me, the first one was really better. Look at Sarah M. G., she's real, mean, cruel girl, look at Amy Adams, she's just a fool. She is nothing! People do not love them! Second, Sebastian was sweet and hot in the first movie, now he is "baby face". The story is not so good and I do not understand it. Why did not they do that first, it's the beginning. Lots of actors, nothing with history. That's not cruel, it does. First, you have better actors, a better story, and their mean. I think that the music is better in the cruel intentions 1 and the music in the cruel intentions.
