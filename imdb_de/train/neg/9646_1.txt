The lack of content in this movie surprised me the most. At first, I thought people would compare it to Rock On! but I'm really surprised that this was worst than Rock On! Story So terribly busy Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin, you have to kidnap me. The music was okay. Khanabadosh was the track of the movie, the rest was bad! Vipul Shah has not learned from Singh anymore, is King's critically beaten comedy. Well, Asin ... where is she from, sorry for Asin's fan out there? My last verdict is that you are watching Aladin with your family instead of wasting your time here.
