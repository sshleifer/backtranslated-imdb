Because that's all she does through the movie. She undresses for no good reason. When Tarzan is bitten by a snake, she suddenly takes off her clothes. Since when is a Boa Constrictor toxic? How was Tarzan poisoned by the way? This whole movie is messed up. They could not properly understand the animal species for this film. What is an orangutang doing around these chimpanzees? He must have departed from the set of a much better movie. The Cannibal Tribal Men's Group Looks Like Why? And why did Bo and her father paint if they were to be eaten later? It was probably just a lame excuse to show her breasts and curves again. Her father hunts, approaches, and stupidly behaves like an elephant bull. A real African elephant bull who was not from the circus would have kicked the butt of this moron. Every clever hunter would have shot the moment he saw him. And I can not wonder If the camera was on LSD, because it was always showing different scenes that were running in slow motion, for no good reason. It made no sense at all. The Boa Constrictor, who wrestled with Tarzan in the water, looks like one of them. You can buy 12 Ft rubber bands from a local Spencer Gifts. Tarzan was strangely sp Eechless in this movie, possibly by Bo, who is flashing himself so much. I'm sorry, but this is a rip off of a classic black and white Tarzan movie, with a similar but better story. Not to mention that there is a scene I have seen that everyone forgot to mention. * (SPOILER'S ALERT) * The scene in which he tries to save Jane and her father puts him too close to a stream. It seems he urinates on someone under him. Besides, he and Jane are walking on a beach with perverted monkeys jumping and clapping. She has endured the death of her father really well. * (END OF SPOILERS) * There should be a warning from a surgeon general in this movie If you see Bo naked in this movie, you'll be blind.
