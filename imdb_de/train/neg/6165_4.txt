Allen goes to the countryside (somewhere he does not really hate) and has a weekend with his friends. These are the usual, successful white middle-class Bellys featured in many of his films. <br /> <br /> I usually find amusing amusement in Woody Allen comedies, but here he really falls flat on his face. Even the one-liners seem to have left him. This really is not a conspiracy (bits and pieces of cod-Shakespeare) - but Allen seems to be using the situation to allow a semi-mystical atmosphere that makes the thing even funnier and half-baked. > It just does not work on any level and is just a giant bore. The best part about this movie (aside from the upcoming theses) is that the bad reviews cause it to wake up and realize that simply throwing a slapdash script and ejecting your colleagues is not a conversation in it.
