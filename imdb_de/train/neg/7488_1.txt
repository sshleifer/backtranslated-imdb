Anyone who has seen the original film from 1970 knows how a great cast, a script and a director can put together a comedy masterpiece. On the other hand, it's easy to see how the opposite can lead to another bland Hollywood mess! This movie was pathetic! If John Cleese (a weird genius) had not been, I would have gone into that terrible waste of celluloid for about 15 minutes. Neil Simon would not write another script for this version (he said he could not do better), and I'm surprised he would not be sued for defamation of the humor after this cinematic fiasco, what did the producers think about, when they occupied this plant? How could the director and the editor look at these scenes and think that some of them were funny? I do not know, but I know one thing - it's no surprise why foreign and independent films are becoming increasingly popular.
