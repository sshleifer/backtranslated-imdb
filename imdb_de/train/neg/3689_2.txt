The main aspect of the superstar's films in his later stages was the frequency and gap between one movie and the next. As an established star of South Indian cinema, the feedback he received before Baba was magnificent. <br /> <br /> Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films he has played in Tamil as a mass hero in 11 years has been just 11 at exactly the rate of 1 per year. Everyone was a great success. He had a picture that many thought was not easy to break. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999) he got into a hibernation. His fans around the world, especially in South India, were ready to see films of all kinds in action with their superstar. So the Tamil cinema industry chose Baba. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers thought the fans would take anything they showed with Superstar. But that clearly did not work in this movie. As usual, the media hype and the expectations of the fans were far beyond the borders. <br /> <br /> The image of Rajinikanth has been totally damaged. The fans have gone crazy. The film collection did not meet the expected level. The call of great people went down. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this movie was the songs of A.R.Rehman. Rehman has been known to have composed good music for some of the worst films such as Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu and others. Well, I never thought that this movie would join this league. > <br /> It feels very depressing, not because the movie was bad, it's the image of the superstar. It took five full years before he was fully recovered with two films, Chandramukhi and Sivaji, and gave the fans what they really wanted in a superstar movie.
