Months ago, before the release of this film, you saw that it was being advertised in all sorts of print media. That's why I patiently waited for the release of the video to see what this hype is all about. After it was over, I had to apologize to my roommate for having occupied the VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. It essentially fails because it is a character-based movie that deals with characters that can not be erased. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only solvable feature is that she is Amanda Peet), you can not stand any of them. The film relies on his dialogue, which is sophomoric, feeble-minded and crude. The only somewhat amusing character is Eric, whose portrayal of the only married member of a group of friends is dead. The last phrase that makes you laugh about the three main characters, instead, inspires the same kind of resentment against Peet. All in all, rent only if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
