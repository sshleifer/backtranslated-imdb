Is not it funny when an average man who leads a miserable life suddenly experiences something outrageously magical, turns his life upside down and leads him to learn some valuable lessons along the way? This formula never gets old, right? It's a sure way to make a classic movie! Just look at the big hits like Liar Liar and Big! ... This had to have been Rob Schneider's mindset when he made Deuce Bigalow, the male gigolo, successful and followed with The Animal. Since I've been following the conspiracy with sarcasm, I can color it a bit: Schneider plays a policeman who is suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is rescued by an operation ... by a veterinarian who has loaded him with animal parts He lulls himself into an inappropriate time like a horse, running like a cheetah, etc. This movie is a bit more congenial than other tailor-made thrusts (like another lame follow-up movie The Hot Chick), but it almost feels as though he wanted They hate the public by playing a romantic reality star as a romantic star (Colleen Haskell of "Survivor") and inserting a cameo from Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene ... just does not exist. I'm sorry - nothing outside the production value. I just want to end this review by saying that minor references to other movies in a movie can be okay, but when it comes to delivering lines the same way ("You can do it!"), Is there a word for it - "milking." Actually, here is another word - "cheap".
