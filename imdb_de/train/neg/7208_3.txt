I grew up with the old Inspector Gadget as a child. It was like Get Smart for kids. Bumbling boob can not solve a case, and all the work is done by the talking talking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard that the live action movie was decent, so I looked at it in the library. I rented this movie for free and felt I had to be paid to see it. <br /> <br /> Broderick does not come close to the caliber of acting that Don Adams had as the voice of the gadget. His voice was completely wrong. The girl Penny played did not look like the cartoon Penny. She is brunette, where the cartoon version was blond with pigtails. But she does a decent job when it comes to what she has to work with. Dabney Coleman performs well as Cheif Quimby. Still, he never hid in a strange place or thrown exploding messages from Gadget by accident. <br /> <br /> The gadget phone was wrong. It never talked in the series and it worked well. Why did you do that? <br /> <br /> Gadget was too intelligent in this movie. He was a total idiot on the show. Here he had a reasonably decent intellect. It would have been better if he had been an idiot. <br /> <br /> The bat has slaughtered the catchword completely. Borderick says "Wowser." It is and should always be "wowsers". It sounds lame, without the 's'. I was upset when they showed the previews, and they did not have the right phrase. <br /> <br /> The ONLY decent gags were during the credits. The lack of Claw is facing a support group for the recovery of followers / Sidekicks. The audience includes Mr. T, Richard Keil, also known as Jaws of Bond, a Herve Villacheze look, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is about the only part I laughed at. <br /> <br /> The other part is at the end, where Penny checks out the gadget clock and tells the brain to say something. Don Adams says to the dog, "Brain is not here now, please leave your name at the sound of the cheek." Woof. " Of course that's not funny, just a nice nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. He should have at least expressed the stupid car. <br /> <br /> Children will like that, but everyone over 13 will not. <br /> <br />
