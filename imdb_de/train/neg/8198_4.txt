Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or does any film that starts to suck in Roswell, New Mexico. Mix alien with The Thing, mixed with Contact, mixed with all things On the Beach, The Andromeda Strain, the classroom scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark, and a cast in a small Stargate. <br /> <br /> Derivation does not even describe this movie. Of course, with nothing original plot they make the sex and sex right? Nope Gore is in the blink of an eye and you miss it affair and sex is all teasing. (James Spader mentions that he needs a shower, and the delicious Leslie Stefanson asks him to join him, he rejects her.) AGGH!) <br /> <br /> In fact, when a movie is ever a shower scene needed to revive things up that's it. I mean, if you have unbelievably good looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an Antarctic research station, why not go bankrupt. <br /> <br /> With about 30 seconds of real thrills throughout the movie, Alien Hunter is remarkably serious and slow for a sci-fi adventure. I needed a much better plot to liven things up. By the way, Alien itself is a terribly clich√©d instrument and has virtually no screen time for someone sharing half the title. <br /> <br /> I also asked, while looking, what has to do with the children of maize in outer space. (Note that since Jason was on Friday, 13th fame, Pinhead by Hellraiser, and the goblin all went into space to kill teenage teens, why not the cornfield?) The characters in the cornfield dress like Logan's runners. Extras and I just waited for the stalks to get alive and attack them. <br /> <br /> That would have been exciting and seemingly against this film. Acting is mostly good as Spader repeats his Stargate role, while Stefanson and Janine Eser are the newest in Antarctic beachwear. However, John Lynch read the entire script and behaves like the insane villain long before the story suggests it. Alien Hunter is a disappointingly derived Slog that makes me a real children's movie of The Corn in England.
