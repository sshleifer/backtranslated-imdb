If I had not read Pat Barker's "Union Street" before watching this movie, I would have liked it. Unfortunately this is not the case. It's actually my kind of movie, it's done well, and I do not want to say anything else, but as an adaptation it fails in every way. <br /> <br /> The shocking novel about the reality of I lived in a working-class neighborhood in the north of England, took hold of my heart and refused to let go weeks after I graduated. When I read about the women in Union Street, tears, repulsion, shock, anger, compassion and misery were imposed on me. Excellent. A novel that I sometimes felt I could not read, but I just could not take it off. Depressive yes, but absolutely thrilling. <br /> <br /> The movie. Oh man. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality and poured a layer of sweet powdered sugar over it. A beautiful movie, an inspirational soundtrack, outstanding performances, a story of hope and romance ... yes. An adaptation of 'Union Street' ... no. <br /> <br /> The women of Union Street and their stories are condensed into Fonda's character, their stories are touched, but many are rejected. I accept that some of Barker's stories are sensitive issues and are too terrible for mass viewing and that a movie with some 7 leading protagonists is simply not practical, but the content is not my main theme. The essence and the real belly of the novel are lost - darkness and rain, broken windows with cardboard and the graphically described stink of poverty is replaced by sunshine, pretty houses and a sparkling William score. <br /> <br /> If you liked the movie for its positivity and hope for "reality," I advise you to read the book without first getting ready for something like "Schindler's list" ... but without the happy ending.
