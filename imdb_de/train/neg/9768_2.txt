When I first appeared on Happy Birthday to Me, I checked the timer to see how long the movie was. I was amazed at the length. Both animation and horror films have a common base: the attention span of the selected audience should be about 90 minutes. Everything else, and you lose most of your audience. <br /> <br /> These 110 minutes or 20 minutes after their best end were a big problem for me. I'd like to say half of this movie could have been cut out, but I'm too generous to say so. Watch the video and tell me how many scenes could have been edited, even without being a major. <br /> <br /> Despite the excessive visit, the film was below average. It has spent all its time being this huge mystery where the "Elite 10" kills the remaining friends. Most of the time they do not just do it exaggerating, but they zoom in on a face and say pretty much "It's that guy! No, it's that girl!" You spend more time letting the camera mislead you than actually enjoying the movie. And do not let me start acting. <br /> <br /> Okay, that started me. I had to laugh in the beginning when I tried to remember if Melissa Sue Anderson played the character who became blind at Little House in the Prairie (later my investigation confirmed my suspicion), because she really looked blind throughout the movie out. Strange, as an established actress she should have been the best in the group, but proved to be the worst. The rest of the staff, apart from Ann (Bregman), was also damn bad, but she took the cake. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a group of ten friends and one is killed instantly. Hardly anyone thinks twice about the disappearance of this "dear" friend, so they continue their happy journey. Slowly, then faster, there are revelations about Virginia's (Anderson), the main character, the past and her psychologist, who is a bit more personal (AND ON CALL 24/7, apparently) than most. Meanwhile, more and more deaths occur. <br /> <br /> Whatever is funny is just like the first "disappearance", "the more" best buds "disappear, the less will be the rest of the worry - sure, they give a few seconds to air say "wow (that person) just would not run away" etc, but then they go back to their sexual ways and if you talk about it, it's probably the terrible screenplay or maybe it was the minute 30 interest lost, but it was really hard to know who the group liked, because they all seemed to be sexual partners next or someone would be freaked out by either another and the best friends in the next scene to MAX SEE: the scary guy who had a mouse / rat in his pocket? literally? and was the most obvious suspect.I give the film too much credit (and time), but as he became part of the "Elite 10," I'll never know. > <br /> But I digress, here's a ra Why are these children goals? Why does Virginia think she killed someone when it was never proven that any of them were actually slaughtered? And why should the trailer and the poster claim these killings as "Six of the most bizarre murderers you'll ever see?" Hell, even for 1981, most of these films were shown in the first two friday of the thirteenth movies. Coincidentally, Friday's 13th Part 2 was released 2 weeks before the birthday of Happy Birthday to Me. Maybe they talk about it when they filmed it months ago, but they were late for the party. <br /> <br /> When the "secrets" are revealed, trust me, you have to rewind 3 -4x to actually get the ridiculous and incoherent motives, and even then put the subtitles to all the words of the mumbling victim / Killers to get. Even if you get it for the first time, it's an incredibly disgusting and funny finale. It's almost worth to watch the whole movie again, but as a drinking game. <br /> <br /> This birthday party should be avoided. It is a terrible and illogical first draft? Please, please know that it requires several repetitions before the camera's role. It either involves a certain way or an extreme negotiation, and it is 100% unrealistic how people react in exceptional circumstances. Note: When was I A kid, or say 10-11 years old, I loved horror movies. (Still, strangely, definite guilty pleasure, but over the years it gets harder to look at it.) We got our first VCR and I've recorded so many horror movies from the Network (or EDITED VERSIONS) TV. All I remember from Happy Birthday to Me is getting the band tied up for the last 10 minutes, which scared me to death. and apparently the big riddle betrayed who the killer was. Although I've seen other clips from this movie, I think this is the first full-length I've ever had. Luckily, this terrible movie did not hurt me as a kid. I am older now and can take this garbage with me. But never again. <br /> <br /> Side Note 2: The crazy "Happy Birthday to Me" song, played in the credits (and as an overall grade), still scares me a lot. I think this movie (or the last few minutes) has influenced my childhood. Shame on you, Melissa Sue Anderson!
