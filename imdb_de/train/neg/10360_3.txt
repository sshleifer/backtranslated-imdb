I was very excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The film did not meet my expectations. After reading the book recently, it was preparing me for great disappointments. The characters did not seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was weak. It was hard for me to deal with the characters. There was no real connection with the viewer, which was going on. The dialogue did not adequately explain what happened. It just seemed to have collapsed and rushed through. All in all, I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose, if you did not read the book, it might be fine by itself. At the very least, it might tempt you to read the book that you're likely to enjoy more. <br /> <br />
