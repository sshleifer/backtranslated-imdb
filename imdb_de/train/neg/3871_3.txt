I try to be very objective when I see a low budget movie. I also attach less importance to independent and low-budget productions than to the big budget productions. I expect almost immaculate from big budget productions and their studios. Therefore, I apply stricter criteria for the major studio releases. But this movie was just a jerk. Period. The premise was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was incredible as a high school student with an insatiable desire to solve crime. There was not enough depth in her character or acting that drew you into her world. To make this film more mysterious, the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood, especially in the warehouse. <br /> <br /> Yet another disappointing movie, which I could only name three points.
