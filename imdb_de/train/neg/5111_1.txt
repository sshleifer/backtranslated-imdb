I was an avid onlooker until I personally spent long, cold hours building a house for the White Family and then seeing the house a year later. All the beautiful rocks were removed, the beautiful sidewalk and the front well were removed, all pines and pecans in the front were felled, the sprinkler system was torn out. It now looks like a disaster area. They do not even live there anymore ... they live "in the city" and come out only for the weekend. It makes me sick to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma have donated to these people and see the result. The story we all saw on TV was not quite the truth ... do not believe everything you see and hear.
