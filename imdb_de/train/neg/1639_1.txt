"Whipped" is 82 minutes long. This review is 82 words long. Three unlikely New Yorker Lotharios, reckless "cheats", vie with the devastating consequences of the same woman being played by Amanda Peet. That goes for the story and the movie. Too uncompromising to be misogynistic, flabby and ridiculous, "Whipped" blends the philosophy of the shock jock Tom Lycian with penthouse-letter fantasies. Although technically savvy, it is outdated, scratchy, poorly written, mean and obvious. People do not behave that way. People do not talk like that. Really.
