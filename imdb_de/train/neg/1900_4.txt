Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired master car thief who is forced back into the "game" when his younger brother threatens to die because he has not placed an order for British criminal chief Raymond Calitri. The task is to lift 50 cars in 24 hours, otherwise Calitri will impose his penalty. So Raines quickly assembles a crew he can trust and tackles the task. But the police are focused on him and some of the cars on the list are not easy to take. It seems like an almost impossible job. <br /> <br /> There's been a full cast in just 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant , Everyone deserves better. Enough performance to drive a Porsche 998 Turbo. The only problem is that these are too many cars that overload the parking lot, many characters, too little zeal. From the off we are undoubtedly that this is a Bruckheimer / Simpson production, a Bonkers script that is criss-crossed with loud noises and whip cheese, a stray lock editing and a sledgehammer subtly directed by Dominic Sena. It's essentially a big budget remake of H.B. Halickis indie film of 1974 of the same name, with the premise of the potential for an adrenalin-based, car-based film. Potential that is unfortunately never realized. There are one or two moments of high impact, stupid, of course, but still enjoyable. But if you forgive the pun, the movie never gets off the first gear, it's happier working with its many characters trying to get the bad script {Scott Rosenberg} working. <br /> <br /> Car fans will get some of this (the cars are an ace in the eye) as well as fans of unintentional comedy movies (see Ecclestones Carpenter's Mourning Moment). But no, it's pretty poor overall. 4.10
