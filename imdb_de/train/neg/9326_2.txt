Me and a group of friends borrow terrible videos to laugh at. Trust me that this has led to terribly spent money, but also to great laughter. SICK. is one of the better horror-but-funny movies we've rented. The plot is done, the whole brings your friends in the forest and never back something that is very old. The hottest part of the movie looks like you're visiting the local butcher shop, except for a bit of dirty and spicy meat on the dough. And if anyone ever got scared of this movie, if he was to spend the rest of his life with Cartoon Network, that's pathetic. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls are pretty hot, one better than the other and you both see them naked during the movie. The other good aspect is that this movie is sometimes so bad that you will laugh until you cry. I do not like to watch terrible plays or lend these horrible videos. I do not think that's funny, but seeing the effort these people make and getting out so bad is hilarious and rewarding laughter about the drawbacks of a person I would recommend. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy it to laugh about, I would give it an 8.5.
