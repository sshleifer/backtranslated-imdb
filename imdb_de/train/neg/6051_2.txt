uh! 3 things a movie needs: a good script, a good plot and a good casting. I saw this movie in the expectation hilarious horrible and unfortunately was disappointed when he was just terrible. I have lost the will to live halfway. The only thing that kept me from stabbing my eyes with a fork was Rose Byrne (which was why I even saw her). She did a good job as a Rastus and her appearance has not changed significantly since she was 13. It was a fantastic first effort in a movie. The dog was also very good. Both have done a great job with such terrible material. Sandra Bernhard, I think, was the biggest mistake of the movie. She was completely miscast, and I do not think she ever got the character. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 2 out of 10 - and that's just because of Rose.
