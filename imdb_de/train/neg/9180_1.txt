Okay, let me start by saying that none of this is surprising to anyone who has read the other comments. That being said, my G-D, THIS FILM REEKED! I mean, WOW, I did not know that it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did in something and still come out worse than any Roger Corman movie! Corman probably had this movie open at some point, but declined because of the poor quality of the script! The only reason this movie was even made is that someone said, 'Hey, zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What kind of game can we get that contains zombies? Resident Evil? No, someone else was there first. Silent Hill? No, too quiet. People will never sit in a dark room just to be stupid. Hey, did not Sega have a game where people went around shooting zombies? They are out of the platform, we could get that for a few cents! '<br /> <br /> Basically, they tried to make a movie that felt like a video game, even shooting the fight like that was the case. The characters actually played the game. <br /> <br /> The first and biggest problem is that the original game was awful. I mean, <br /> <br /> Bad-Movie merchandising-made-in-a-worse-in-two-weeks-and-then-shif-D-out-and-buy-by-Morons - and her parents terrible for Christmas. The graphics were boring. The monsters were boring. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. The case was boring. In other words, that was a boring game. And that was the ARCADE version. The home version was even worse! With the Home version, you did not even hold the gun in your hand while you were bored silly by this pointless game! But I digress. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they actually went so far as to cut scenes from the actual gameplay during the fight scenes. HUH ??? Did not the editor have enough confidence in the implications to suggest that a fight actually took place? Not to mention that EVERY fight was shot from the perspective of a video game, which could explain the tedious use of Matrix effects. The problem is that the game was an ego shooter (the player starts from the character's POV). Maybe that's why they've added game graphics to let you know they alluded to the game ... Right, whatever ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the only thing that made this ENTIRE experience It was the fact that everyone in the theater made fun of the movie, so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general disbelief were considered commonplace and did not kick me out. <br /> <br /> In summary, DO NOT GO THE FILM! Do not even decide to rent it when it appears on video in a few weeks. Run. Just run.
