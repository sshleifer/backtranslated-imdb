How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminds us of the similarity with the other better Flemish movie "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also some characters in Congo Express that are not related: Jean (de Congolees), the worker, the two taxi drivers, the street singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels is not. That should not be a reason to excuse the script errors (if there is a script) from Anyway that the wind is blowing. The joke (the only one!) At the party about the ice in the fridge comes from the big Flemish movie "De Witte (1934)", in which De Witte gives the potatoes too much salt. Some accidents happen in the movie, but there is no explanation. Tom Barman gives us a movie here, which is more like an experiment on television than a movie for the theater. Another missed opportunity for the Flemish cinema.
