When I watch a movie, I realize it's a movie, but I still allow myself to be as deep as possible under the circumstances. I think that's what causes us viewers to cry, scream, laugh, or otherwise emotionally react, even though we know it's "just a movie." What I do not want is that the movie reminds me that it's just a movie, so I can not get into the above, regardless of the quality of the movie. The director of this film decided to frequently use multiple camera shots simultaneously on the screen. Maybe it's just me, but I find that terribly distracting and downright irritating. You might also see a solid banner at the bottom of the screen: "Caution: This is just a movie, do not allow yourself to be too interested or engrossed." If I want "picture-in-picture," I will activate my TV remote, but never during a movie I want to enjoy.
