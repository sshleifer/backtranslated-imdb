What else can I say? The drama was almost without exception amateurish. The direction and continuity were pitiful. The scene was foreseeable until the last scene and the dialogue was boring. One of the features on the DVD was labeled "Gag Reel," but this could have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most amusing was the DVD in the comments of the director. He said with a clear face that he had decided to make a film with high production values ​​and a name cast - and that he had succeeded. With such delusions it is easy to understand how the film has developed. <br /> <br /> Maybe the monster was the most disappointing. The Darkwolf suit was a modified monkey suit (by "Making of" on the DVD) and looked rather. The mask and claws were barely better than the jobs of every costume shop. The CGI effects were painfully obvious and of the quality of a cheap video game.
