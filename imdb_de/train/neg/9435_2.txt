I had never heard of it before the owner of my local DVD rental mentioned it to me. I was a horror movie of the 1980s with the notorious distinction of being banned in the UK. I decided to give it a try. The film turned out to be boring, amateurish and ugly-looking; The sound recording is so bad that the dialogue is incomprehensible half the time, while the acting gives a new meaning to the inappropriate word! Worse still, the film follows the awful tired formula of a trio of teenage girls involved in an accident, being rescued by a dysfunctional family living in a remote area. Soon one of the girls will seek help and will never be heard again; another, still bedridden, is quickly disposed of (after being forgotten most of the time). The heroine is the one who has the most to do with the three occupants of the house: a Harridan of a bible-tapping mother (abominably exaggerating behavior), her repressed (and boring) daughter and her strange brother who occasionally appears on the scene, about the sleeping ones Drooling female guests. <br /> <br /> Often she resorts to the recollection of the reigning mother (as a means of filling the desolate, not to mention unoriginal, backstory) and the movie always has an ace up its sleeve - the twist end is like that unexpected as well as ingenious, but it helps a little to remove the bad taste that the film leaves in the mouth (so much by the lameness as intermittent gore) or by the inevitable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time ...
