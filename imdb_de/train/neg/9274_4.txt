This sequel is a complete reissue of the first movie. A completely pointless movie. It basically took every single sceanrio of the first movie and they rewrote it in Omen IV, except this time with a female antichrist. It even ends in the same way as the first! The music is too busy and disturbing, and because it's pretty much a copy of Omen I, it's extremely predictable. It's not a horrible movie, it's not terrible, there are far worse movies out there, there just was no reason to be done. The 2006 Omen remake is a lot worse, even more meaningless than this, so I think that's it. If you've had a gun on someone's head and you had to decide to watch this sequel or the 2006 Reamke, I think I would choose that.
