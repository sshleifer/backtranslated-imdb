Apart from dirt cheap prices, this exercise was difficult to survive with the inclusion of videos in disgrace. It has the typical anger you would expect in a zombie movie, but not the atmosphere required to be worth it. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that it is a German amateur video and the version I saw is in English! The Dubbers are apparently American fans (pen pals of the Germans?!) Who can not decide whether they want to play it or turn it into a comedy. A character (a white German, of course) is apparently baptized by a black guy who talks to fat ebonics! "Kno Wahm," Comrad?
