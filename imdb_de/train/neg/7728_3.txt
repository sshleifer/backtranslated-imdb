.... this mini does not get better with age. I saw that, and it's the sequel to what it was originally broadcast, and like so many others were blown away. In early 2002, I borrowed the novels for WOW and W and R and was even more impressed. I then decided that I had to see both again and invested $ 200 plus in the DVD sets. I took a close look at both minis again and realized that I had made things backwards - I should have bought the novels and borrowed the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Do not think it's a miserable failure? Read the novels and see for yourself. I do not think that's outdated. Think of it as someone who is not old enough to have originally aired it and watch the reaction you receive (warning - reactions from such persons range from horror gazes to the stomach laugh). <br /> <br /> According to the little things for This Mini - Dan Curtis has chosen Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes !! Production quality, music scoring, dialogue - a great story was turned into a soap opera from the late 70s by an over-ambitious producer / director who stood above his head. This thing was dated the moment it was finished. <br /> <br /> These two minis were great when the original show aired, and for those of us who saw them at the time, they were tugging at a nostalgic string reminiscent of younger days. IMO - This Mini is not nearly fair and disappointing.
