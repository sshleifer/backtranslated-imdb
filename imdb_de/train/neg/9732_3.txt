First of all, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you try to take this movie seriously, then I guarantee that it will ruin it for you. If you do not take him too seriously, it's really fun to look at him. Like another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif declare their love for each other - dodging in between the flames of flame shooting from his arm in the car. Another great camping scene saw John Landis as a snotty radio station, which was roasted and fidgeted in the room. I found the last 15 minutes of the movie for a perpetual laugh-uprising - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it that way.
