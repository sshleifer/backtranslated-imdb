Only a handful of segments are involved here. A segment with a garage guard from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins puts it in a nutshell, spin by Wendel, until the last shot surpasses everything. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that only a few clips call Paris. The others are so scattered in terms of theme, tone, willpower and production that you might also see "The Years Best Commercials, 2006". It is really everywhere. It does not develop over the term, and the directors rule nothing. No construct suits the pieces successfully - commercial, overproduced vampire shtick. It has about as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in the Antarctic. Fantasie shows up first in the Coen Brothers segment (um, thank J & E for destroying another movie) and then makes far too many appearances. The point in Paris is that you do not need a goddamn to make your days extraordinary. Why should one share it through the neighborhood if the Quartier de la Madeleine is equated with vampires for a loser director? Has there ever been a genre that is over-represented as the vampire movie? Every three years we get the same lamp-like vampire clich√©s. Worse, assume that the change from segment to segment is quite inelastic. The transitions are lost. This does not feel intentional, it feels sloppy.
