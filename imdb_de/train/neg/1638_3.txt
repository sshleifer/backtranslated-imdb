I looked forward to seeing Amanda Peet in another good role after lately renting "The Whole Nine Yards" - by the way worth the rent - but that was not it. <br /> <br /> I recalled that the trailer for "Whipped" was a bit funny and the conspiracy of three scrapped New York twenty stages, all of which fell on and were manipulated by the charming Mrs. Peet, was an attempt value. So I convinced two friends one afternoon to watch this movie with me. This criticism is my penance. <br /> <br /> In the first act we have the three lead studs telling their conquests in a diner. What should be funny or at least tell, seems rather pathetic. Was there any redeeming quality in the three men and their encounters that we should get out of here? <br /> <br /> [Although I do not mind movies that are cheeky, I was always wondering why no one in the diner turned around as the stallions talked vociferously about sexual and Scandinavian details. Do you do this every week in the same diner? They would think someone complained. Oh, wait, I forgot: Two other guests notice it in one scene. However, this is just a setup for a punch line. Everyone else in the diner is deaf.] <br /> <br /> In the second act, the three stallions fall on Mia and then develop brain rot. You do not ask yourself what really happens between the fours. And I kept wondering how the studs always behave as they were, what redeeming qualities does they see in keeping them with them longer than a date? Does she start with brain rot? I kept hoping that Erik's character, the married buddy, became more than just the annoying punching bag. His role is clearly to give advice on marriage. But why are they even talking to him if they do not talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third act resolves the story, but at that point I looked at my watch. My friends told me that they were still waiting for something really funny to happen, and I had to agree. The scene explaining everything was appropriate, and it succeeded in explaining all the questions and mysterious dialogue parts of the film, but we just deleted them from a list. ("Oh, okay, that's why Brad had that happen and Jonathan says this and ...") <br /> <br /> What made us laugh was because of the stupidity of the conspiracy, as something amusing. Even the payouts during the credits were not very funny. Ultimately, I had no choice but to keep people away from the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
