I have given this movie an increased rating of 2 stars as I personally turn up in minutes 42 and 43 of the movie ... the street bar scene in Russia. In this scene, the director of the film offered me the immortal line "50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk", but I felt that my Polish colleague could speak with a more convincing Russian accent than I could, so I rejected that from speaking part on. I was a bit dumbfounded as this was my first movie experience ... and who knows, those lines might be there with lines like "I'll be back" and "Honestly my love, not me." Anyway. "Had I spoken that one line, my name would appear in the list of Rancid Aluminum as" Heavy 1 "instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /> <br /> Over time I count myself lucky My name is in no way related to this movie. <br /> <br /> Although I spent a whole day on set, in Barry Island, the hot spot in South Wales, I could not tell what the real plot was. The caterers and the dressing gown lady agreed that there seemed to be a lot of oath and nudity ... things could have been worse if I'd ended up nude in those dreadful movies ... <br /> Still, on the positive side ... I talked to Rhys Ifans during a break, and I had no idea who he was because "Notting Hill" was not yet to be released, and no idea that he could be Welsh. I have various inappropriate comments there Over what has been a terrible pit Barry Island since my visits in the 70's and 80's. It was not until Keith Allen showed up that I realized I was in quality production.
