Let's see where to start ... bad acting; I'm not sure I would call it that because it's more of a cumbersome script. The actors did not even seem to be in their roles and seemed pretty lifeless and listless. Sure, there were one or two scenes of nudity, but that could not save the movie from its lifeless characters. <br /> <br /> Calling the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do it. The lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed to be pointless. <br /> <br /> Budget? Did this movie have any budget at all? It seemed like they were using less money than I saw in a YouTube video. Poor lighting, props, bad sound production. Bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them that. The story could have been good if people actually seemed interested, but there was no life for this movie; I do not care who directed it. <br /> <br /> I've seen some really bad streaks over the last year and this one is definitely down. Do not waste your time, otherwise you would like to have listened to this unbiased evaluation. Check the reviews. You will notice that the 1 Series quickly surpass the flaky 10 and barely anything in between. I wish I had looked a little closer before I wasted my time. What a crapfest!
