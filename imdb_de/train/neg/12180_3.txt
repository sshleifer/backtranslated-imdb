This movie is absolutely terrible, but still it can be funny sometimes, though this humor is completely unintentional. <br /> <br /> The plot was absolutely ridiculous. I do not think a two-year-old would be convinced of the ridiculous idiocy the filmmakers tried to make into a story. On the positive side, some of the horribly inhuman plot twists provide a lot of humor. For example: "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has hidden a huge rocket in her backyard!" It's getting worse (and even funnier), but I'm protecting you. <br /> <br /> Acting is generally laughable. Most of the children's roles are kind of cute, but not very believable. On the other hand, Annie is pretty awful. The adults do not take their roles seriously at all, but that's largely a good thing. If they had tried to be credible, the movie would have been even worse. Which is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Once you've overcome the general crappiness of the movie, there are indeed some outstanding moments in which it's almost unheard of. The scene in which the son of Lady Hogbottom ran away with the maid is surprisingly funny, although it is a nuisance to be caught by the police. The Butler character is indeed very inferior, but a sunbeam that almost, but never completely penetrates through the darkness. <br /> <br /> When I look at this movie, I actually had physical pain. Nevertheless, there were some redeeming parts that made it almost observable without causing internal bleeding. Judging by the good spots alone, the film would be about a five; Unfortunately, the rest of the movie hardly deserves a 1. So I give it a third. <br /> <br /> That's pretty generous, I would say.
