Do not pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! The majority of people who leave positive comments on this film must receive royalties. This is a terrible movie in every way. Imagine, high school kids without money and humor would make a slasher / comedy video. They would receive a D for it. College kids would get an F or be asked to leave school. Since this monstrosity was made by "professionals", I believe that there should be prison or at least cinema probation. I like to watch bad movies like "Plan 9 from Outer Space", but this thing does not even fall into this category. The script, the drama, the sound and the direction are so bad that it is practically impossible. If you like watching bad movies that are amusing, stay with Ed Wood, Blaxploitation or the horror movies of the 70s. After you have looked at this, you feel that you have wasted an hour and a half of your life.
