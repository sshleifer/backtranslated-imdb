If you liked the first two films, I'm sorry that you will not like this movie. This is the real garbage and unnecessarily straight to the video, probably from the television. The still idiotic but nice scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and he has his own company, Szalinski Inc. his brother. Then he also shrinks his wife and sister-in-law. Now the adults have to find a way to get the children of the house to make them bigger. Quite a repeat of the other two with just one or two new things, such as a toy car rollercoaster, swimming in the bathroom, etc. Pretty poor!
