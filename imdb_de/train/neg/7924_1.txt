Ted V. Mikels' film Corpse Grinders 2 is a painful movie for 103 minutes. The plot is pretty much a mixture of nonsensical business relationships between people who grind dead bodies into cat food, while cat aliens lose a war with dog aliens and are looking for some of that cat food. I watched this movie, looking for some kind of distraction, anything to calm me down, that I was doing something different than losing my mind from the inside out. <br /> <br /> Several scenes run way too long as characters take forever easy things to do. I've heard that Mr. Mikel does not use jumps too often because he fears he's confusing his audience. I am not sure if this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid". As I might try, I could not care to interest the characters in the unnecessarily large cast, with the possible exception of the old men who are the janitors of the factory. The majority of the cast consists of a group of talented amateurs who do not even bother to learn the lyrics to "Amazing Grace" before they have to sing it in front of the camera. Maybe it is also because of the poor sound quality, because I have heard only about 80% of the dialogues when playing the DVD. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie ever made. I've listened to the excerpts from the commentary, and Mr. Mikels is a surprisingly sweet old man. What the hell did he do to make that kind of garbage? I'd like to hear the explanations from the old men who had to lie on a metal conveyor belt without a shirt to be ground up. Movies that I have hated for a long time suddenly appear much better. I long for the intermittent music of Excalibur and the steady illumination of Dawn of the Dead. I have to do something, anything. Do not see this movie
