If you want to laugh like crazy, hire Cage. Cage is about two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are best friends. If Billy is shot in Vietnam, he can not defend himself, so Scott takes him. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott love to "wrestle," and Scott tells Billy that among other things, he's still "sore from yesterday." Wonderful phrases like "Shut the sh! T up" and "Ping" Pang Pong, get lost, make you laugh for hours. The Indian guys who are supposed to play Mexican gang members are also top notch. As they say, it is now "party time. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba." I could go on forever, but just watch this movie and laugh with the dollar. It was so funny that I bought the DVD for $ 5.99
