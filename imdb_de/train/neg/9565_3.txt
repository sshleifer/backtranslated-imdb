I can not say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen since there were one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent movie I've ever seen , Not even a plotter presented itself without my guessing more than ten minutes in advance. There was no subtlety for anything the movie did, no intelligence visible behind the scenes. Every spoken or typed line was so blatantly obvious that it was impossible to "get in" the movie. Much more often than I thought I enjoyed the movie.
