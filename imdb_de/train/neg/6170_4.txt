This movie starts very slowly, but when the action finally starts, it has to follow a bit. I could not understand why some events took place, and many events took place before they were explained, which somehow made them confusing. The only thing that really exists is the huge amount of blood / blood it has, although the special effects are mostly missing. Blood looks like red Kool help. Skin tears as if someone steps on a pile of sticks. Again, the story has a kind of amateur feeling, as if the author did not take long to perfect it. I think it could be a much better movie if the effects were better and more time was spent on the script. I honestly wish I had not seen it, not because of the wound, but because I feel like I wasted 90 minutes of my life. If you like extremely bloody movies, this is for you, if not, stay away.
