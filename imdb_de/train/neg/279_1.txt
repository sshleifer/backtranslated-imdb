Wow, here it is finally; the action "movie" without action. In a low-budget environment (do not miss the hilarious flying saucers that fly past a few times) of a future Seattle, we find a hard-headed head trying to avenge her childhood. <br /> <br /> There is nothing remotely original or interesting in terms of the plot and the performance of the actor is only stomping through the attempts to steal from other films, mainly "matrix", with stupidity, without having the money to do it right. Yes, we see some walking on walls and slow-motion shoot-outs (about 45 seconds), but these scenes are as cool as the stupid hardbody attempts to make jokes about male incompetence now and then We also get a bunch of leads that lead us absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought through by the previously invisible actors during the shoot of the scenes. <br /> <br /> is as bad as it gets. In fact, it does not deserve to be taken seriously, but maybe I can not hire some of you and save your money.
