Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips from "Dead and Breakfast") returns to the house she grew up in and has recently inherited from her deceased sister, without her grandmother (Fay Dunaway) still living in this house , something white. Jennifer decides to sell it because she desperately needs the money to grief Granny. It also begins to have annoying recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven. There really was not anyone to identify with in this movie. Jennifer looked cold, distant, unsentimental and narcissistic, while her grandmother looked scornful, sad, and narcissistic. The movie is good and well done, but without someone to empathize with, it was hard for me to worry about what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My grade: C-
