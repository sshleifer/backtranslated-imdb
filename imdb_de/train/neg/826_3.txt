I love these actors, but they were wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what they would think if they agreed with this crap. Debra Winger just called her im; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were cartoons. Some people thought it was deep. If you liked Breaking the Waves, you probably will like it too. I hated both. 3.10
