The film got off to a good start with an interesting and strong Shannon Lee and in the first half introduces two very sympathetic minor characters. But later, something happens, and suddenly, Shannon transforms into this evil second-hand girl, and the film loses itself in its own context. The second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clich√©s, bad drama, a terrible conspiracy and even worse stunt coordination. Not to mention the terrible actors they chose for the chechen mafia gang. <br /> <br /> "Game of Death 2" was bad and made clowns, but his daughter makes it worse than when it's double playing Bruce Lee. I firmly believe she can do a lot better than that, and I hope that next time she will participate in better production. <br /> <br /> If you're a hardcore hardcore action fan and you're not interested in quality, keep watching this movie I was personally looking forward to it, but was terribly disappointed.
