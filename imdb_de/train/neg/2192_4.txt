Another film based on the mundane, worn-out clich√© of the crazy, mad scientist. The film is about a surgeon whose life's goal is to bring the dead back to life. I know, I know ... you have never heard that! Of course, while all these movies are running, the experiment is very, very wrong and creates a maniacal, bloodthirsty creature. For this promising setup, you would think that it would be at least a little bit exciting. Not correct. As in many films of this era, the idea is good, but the execution and the script are mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I've ever seen (no, abominator: the Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but none of the gems either.
