drss1942 really took the words out of my mouth. I loved Segal's early films and feel like the only one who is still faithful to him. I've just watched this movie (ok, I slept 90%, so I did not see the end). When I woke up and saw that I was on the DVD menu, I was grateful that I had not submitted to a movie and did not dare to figure out what had happened in the end. The voice of Segal and others had something strange. Somehow I remembered the original from Mad Max, where the voice was dubbed, but in the same language (Australian is English, right?). If I had 10 thumbs, they would all immediately point out this Segal injustice.
