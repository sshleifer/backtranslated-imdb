Anyone who has seen "Shine," Scott Hick's film about the heartbreaking but ultimately joyful life of pianist David Helfgotts; I am sure that 'The SOLOIST' is very bad by comparison. It's as slow as a lullaby (I took five breaks to answer e-mails just to wake up). The depiction of the homeless area far above the heights and extremely self-indulgent, I am so much afraid of the terrible beach-fighting scene in Joe Wrights, another disaster of attonment. .J Fox Performance was an extremely bad example of acting and lacked credibility over offset. Although he is struggling with a poorly performing movie, he still manages to charm it, 9Is it me or will he become George Clooney in more ways than one?). However, comparing the two known "STAR" factors is unnecessary, as the light that shines brightest in the drama must be that of "shines" Geoeffry Rush, whose brilliant performance in my sky definitely seems much brighter. With 'Attonment' and 'The Soloist' the written word wins far more prizes for the empathy of the subject. Read the book and the articles or wait until the DVD is soon in the bargain basement.
