A charming boy and his mother move to a city in the middle of nowhere, cats and death follow them. That sums it up. <br /> <br /> I admit that I'm a bit crazy with cats after the movie. But despite all the seriousness, despite the many things that are wrong with this movie, and in my opinion there is plenty of it to go around, it's a very enjoyable viewing experience overall. The characters are more like cartoons here, just with their instincts they can rely on. Fear, greed, pride or anger seem to motivate these people. It can indeed be argued that this apparent failure actually serves the narrative of history. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King script (not that I have anything against Mr. King) are well supported by interesting FX work, make-up, and quite fitting music. The absolute gem of this film is undoubtedly Alice Krige, who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother. King manages to have a simple story of outsiders or people who are slightly different (OK - a lot in this case) trying to fit it into a campy and turn it over the top little horror gemstone found in the Collection of every horror fan must be located.
