foywonders test this cheap STV hits the nail exactly on the head. Make sure you read it. If not, a group of scientists goes into the deep forests of the Pacific Northwest to fumble with a pile of bones in an animal cemetery. The Big Foot family does not like this and continues to decouple the team bit by bit, mostly off screen. Big Foot himself has a pronounced monkey-like face, but is altogether less scary than Harry by HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. In most films, the generic wood-based actors pretend to be scientists who trample and yakking in the forest. This is a no-budget movie in which very little happens, at least on the screen. We can see the sexiest women take a shower while one of their male companions watches, but nothing comes of that.
