... and I never thought that a movie deserved a 1! But this is really the worst movie I have ever seen. My wife picked it up because of the cast but the plot right since the DVD box seemed pretty predictable. It is not a mystery nor a youthful movie. It does not involve sensuality if the title could suggest to one of them from afar. This is just a total no. Do not waste your time or money unless you want to watch a bunch of young people in a gothic environment where a murderer is following them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth seeing. Max Makowski does the worst of Nick Steel.
