"Back of Beyond" takes place at a dive center / petrol station in the middle of the Australian desert, led by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy man who suddenly finds himself in trouble when some visitors arrive unexpectedly. We get what initially seems confusing, like a flashback in which he and his sister (although their relationship to each other is better understood later in the movie) race through the desert on their motorcycles. After that he appears in the presence of the newcomers as a terribly calm and sometimes capricious character. <br /> <br /> We know one thing is for sure, and that's McGregor's mental sense, his vision of danger and his danger. This is his clairvoyance, which is only marginally relevant to the story. The majority of these involve three diamond thieves who break the car and trust Tom to help them out of the lane without getting in the way. Of course, Tom falls in love with one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly all three suspicious allies meet. But not in a way that really leads to much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie seems to be building something important all the time, but it really does not. Even the end, which is like a banal campfire story (and one that really reveals many narrative errors), is almost as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It may be worth a try if you do not notice the awfully slow pace, but at least are in the mood for something that is slightly different than usual.
