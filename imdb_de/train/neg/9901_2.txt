This should have been a star, but there were so many clich√©s, predictable twists that were seen before the Slasher parallels, that I actually gave it an extra star because it made me laugh ... though it never did Im intentions of the directors Im sure. <br /> <br /> I do not often write commentaries on films, they either have to be sensational or, in this case, really bad. <br /> <br /> To be honest, once I saw Jeff Fahey in it, I knew it would be bad because he has a unique nose to pick the worst movies. <br /> <br /> Somehow the farce made me see everything through, possibly for the weird voice of MR T (do not forward Mr. T, but you know what I mean, if you go to the trouble, If you look at it, make sure you do not pay for it. That might have worked if they had actually put the intended comedy into it, but I'm sure you'll find that strange laugh here and there on the farce of the whole thing.
