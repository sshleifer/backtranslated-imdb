This 'movie' must be the biggest pile of steaming C I've ever seen. What can I say more than bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. There is NOTHING to save this "movie," and I pray that they NEVER talk about making a sequel. When you think about it, you should know that two garbage people are being forced to save the earth. Films like "Men in Black" have been torn to pieces and put back together to make this "comedy," but they have failed completely. Please avoid this movie (save yourself).
