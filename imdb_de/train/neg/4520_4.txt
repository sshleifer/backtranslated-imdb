Irwin Allen was great. All of his TV shows had a great pilot or episode. The rest was basically a rip off of his other shows. Some episodes of the Swiss family Robinson were rip off of his older television programs. An episode of the Swiss family is identical to an episode of Land Of The Giants when a member of the group needs an appendectomy. The show was expensive and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost contact with television programs after the 1960s. Acting is strong with Martin Milner. Child stars have started this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. A ray of hope is when Irwin Allen contains his catastrophic scenes such as a typhoon and a volcanic eruption that calls him "Master of Disaster."
