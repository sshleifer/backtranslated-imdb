My friends and I hired this for "Bad Movie Night" with great hopes, but The Brain was a bit of a disappointment. The brain itself looks great, but it usually only sits on its small platform. Who would have thought that it would be cool that the brain can only chew three people in just 94 minutes? This movie has a number of things to start with, including a lead by Estevez-Knockoff, who plays a rebellious genius (we're told that his enormous intellect is seduced into his elaborate pranks and school fountains, which include krazy glue on a chair ). It also has some great lines, a weirdly unconventional and out-of-breath henchman who just barely manages to be everywhere and, yes, some chicks get naked. However, the director urgently needs training in the art of pacing. In the last half, things keep on dragging, with at least 3 or 4 boring chase scenes making up the middle third of the plot. The scenes in the PRI complex are especially bad. At least 15 minutes of this film people walk up and down the same stairwell. I could have fixed the script on this thing in half an hour - more cheese, more blood, more nudity, more brain action. If you make a bad horror movie, at least give me something enjoyable while my superego is shutting down. Maybe the director really tried to get the audience into his movie. At the end of this Crapfest I felt like one of the zombified citizens.
