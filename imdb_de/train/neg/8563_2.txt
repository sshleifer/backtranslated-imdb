It's like the title of this thread. The only impression I got from this movie is that Marlee Matlin's character was always angry, so cynical and so miserable. The first date of her character with William Hurt, where they danced, was stupid. All in all, I tried to finish the movie four times, and of all four times I fell asleep. I would continue to watch this movie with a purpose ... to overcome my problem with insomnia, because all I have to do is fall asleep. Sweet Dreams.
