For those who decide whether to watch this movie or not, and read these comments on insight, I offer these four words first: Do not waste your time! "Chungking Express" has been modestly filmed, quickly beaten up, and seems to have been designed by someone who queued to a Hong Kong Burger King. I can not remember ever seeing a movie with a selection of such one-dimensional characters trying to work through a script of this profane script! It is an absurd effort with a philosophically ridiculous dialogue (a man wanders into his flooded flat and offers the amazing revelation that "tears can be dried with a handkerchief, but water takes time to mop up"). The same figure can also be seen in a deep, meaningful relationship with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty linen, and so on. The shaky, wandering hand-camera work was another annoying feature that I could do without. And if that's not enough to puke you into your popcorn, we'll hear the old ode "California Dreaming" from the '60s, which is repeatedly hailed by the moms and dads during a particularly long sequence over the soundtrack Quentin Tarantino was in favor responsible for bringing this loser through his company Rolling Thunder Productions to America, although for all my life I can not figure out why a man with his talent would bother. He was known for "I'm so happy to love a movie so much." However, many of us hope that he will focus on making his audience happy with more interesting discoveries in the future.
