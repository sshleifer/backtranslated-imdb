This animated Inspector Gadget movie is pretty lame. The story is very weak and there is little action. Most characters have little or nothing to do. The film is entertaining at best, but does not go where and where is pointless, but only just to see and is far from the caliber of the cartoon TV show from the 80s. It's not a movie that endures repeated looks, at least in my eyes. It's only about 74 minutes long, including credits, I guess that's a good thing. Unlike in the TV series, it's not worth rooting the characters here. In the show, you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day, but who really cares? Anyway, that's just my opinion. For me Inspector The last case of Gadget is a disappointing 3/10
