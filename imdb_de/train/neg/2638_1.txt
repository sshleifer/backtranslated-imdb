It's Good It's Bad And then it's The Sentinel, a political "thriller" that is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The act of a mole in the Secret Service is good, but a movie with so much potential has never been slaughtered so much. Directed by Clark Johnson with ham, every actor in this film seems to work on autopilots. Even the great Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can honestly say that I have NEVER seen another movie in my life with so many blatant storylines. The phrase is predictable from the start, and the characters in the character are so ridiculous that they made the audience laugh. Avoid this at all costs. This is a catastrophe of a movie without redeeming value.
