The characters are clich√©d and predictable, all of them either pure white or totally evil. Acting is too stilted to be bad in an amusing, exaggerated way. It's doubly disappointing to be a fan of Bette Davis because her character is not a typical Bette-Davis type. She can only frown thoughtfully. <br /> <br /> On the whole, neither my wife nor I found the movie interesting, moving or even enjoyable.
