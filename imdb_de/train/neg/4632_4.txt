Maria Bello does not seem to care what people think about her choices in film roles. Again, she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie in which she can play. Maybe she needs those movies to remove the sugar coated (also called "Hollywood") movies she's doing here and then (Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3) /> <br /> While I think that's it failing to achieve what she intended (I will not spoil it), Maria Bello is as great as she is in her other independent / minor films she plays. It's her performance that enhances the movie. This, combined with the strange theme, has almost done the trick for me. But in the end (and even if I try to overlook some mistakes like bad tempo and dramaturgy), the movie is still too long
