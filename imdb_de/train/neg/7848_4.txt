This movie was just stupid. I do not think it was scary. I was hoping to be shocked and scared, but mostly laughed that some of the scenes were just fake and the blood scenes were thrown together. They were ridiculously gay and looked that way because the acting was just awful. I think they could get good actors, and most of the characters I hated because they were so stupid and lame, even though they were in the military watching movies for free and seeing a lot of people go out because it was so dumb, somehow happy that I did not have to pay for it. DUMB ASS MOVIE does not see it ... but that's my opinion
