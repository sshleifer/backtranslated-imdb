If you're looking for a movie that portrays the pointless and boring existence of a bourgeois life that's in a web of non-communication and false ideals, then this is the movie for you. If you are also involved in the film and want to keep your interest, then you should probably look elsewhere. There are many films that do this much better. For example, try some of Bergman's darker films. The filmmaker, in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class, was to subject the viewer to a painful, boring and empty incident after another, until the movie finally finds its tortuous and pathetic ending. If you appreciate your time, there are far better ways to spend two hours, such as cleaning your house.
