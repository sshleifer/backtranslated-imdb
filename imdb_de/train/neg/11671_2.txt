I have to say - it's a stinker! (I rated it 2) <br /> <br /> Just look at it if you have insomnia. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of scenery that it chews and pounding, but not much else happens this movie. There is no tension, no deep, shocking secrets, no real threat to the well-being of the heroine. A few disagreements, a slight raising of voices - that's it. The secrets are nothing that could happen to anyone - the last "secret" revealed in the film is completely predictable by this point. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves as she is called to a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), an artist who is commissioned to make a series of murals in a huge ballroom in a huge Mansion of a very wealthy, elderly widowed woman and a growing mother-daughter relationship to paint older woman longing for her. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the older woman's daughter, Cassandra, is dead. You can put together the rest of the pieces pretty well. <br /> <br /> Even the scene with the mysterious man who threatens our heroine does not go so far that you really fear for her safety, maybe for a second or two. Why he is still hanging years after Cassandra's death is a good question. <br /> <br /> It also begs the question that there is only one servant in this huge mansion, a loyal butler who seems to be busy - cooking, cleaning, serving food, answering the door, etc. Anything but seemingly closing the door - this would be the only explanation for how one of the characters goes into a room where Faith is. <br /> <br There's nothing that will make you grab the armrests of your chair and lean forward on the edge of the seat because there's no "mounting" tension in this movie - just mild, pathetic revelations that are thrown out from time to time. <br /> <br />
