Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and $ 2 for letting in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before my death, it will be the greatest regret in my life. Anyone who has thought or financed this film deserves a kick in the legs, because that's where they thought when they made this movie. It's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic and presumptuous jerk who tries to act as poetry. He accompanies his amorous friend on a journey to the coast. Where they meet girls and stuff. Only the fat gets no girl. Skin flicks do not annoy me, I think they are at face value. But this movie is more than just a strip of skin. It's about the fat guy who is looking for love in a girl but then meets another bikini-silicone girl enjoying his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball, who gets money for his family and impresses the ladies, only he has his wife anyway. The dialogue is terrible even for a C-movie. It supports a plethora of black clich√©s, no character development, it's a glorified porn movie that does not contain porn. Never watch this movie.
