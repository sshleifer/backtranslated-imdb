I found the documentary Fast, Cheap and Out of Control for a pretty interesting documentary. The documentary included four "mini" documentaries about four interesting men. Each of these men was extremely involved in his job and showed sheer love and pleasure in his job. The sad part, I must say, must be the subjects in which these people worked / studied. They were interesting for about five minutes, then they became boring and too long-lived. <br /> <br /> The video was shot in a very creative way. I really enjoyed the movie with one dubbing over another. It played out brilliantly and coincided well with the music.
