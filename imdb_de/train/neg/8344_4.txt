After reading all the rave reviews about this movie and a few that are so-so. Finally, I decided to contribute my cents. I agree with most on the point that it would have been a disaster if Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry had not been. Filmed in Mariette OH. Just north of Dogpatch, where all the real talent fled south of I-77 77 years ago, at least as far as a gasoline tank would allow. I got a giggle of reviewers who subtly said they were doing a little better than most, claiming they were following the conspiracy without any hint of confusion. This little story from the Brothers Crook is like an old record with a jump in it. As an American, I understand the difficulties faced by Indian filmmakers. A trip to Romania would have definitely wiped out the budget. Let's be honest, the whole movie was a loop of Claire at the gas station, Claire on the roadside, Claire under the stands, Claire in the house, Claire in the cornfield, Claire in the school. Claire here and Claire there. It would have been almost monotonous and would not have been the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to make a living, but do not write a two-page script and turn it into an hour, twenty times. Before you write another script about dreaming ghosts, look at one or two episodes of Ghost Whisperer or something and get some background knowledge. All the performers except those mentioned above and a few others were busy with their first and last film. There is also an appearance by co-director Jeff, as he is in all his films. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, how? The film had to do mainly with the fact that the cameraman seemed to Lauren Lewis' Derri√®re fixed. Well, with all the sarcasm I've been satisfied with now, I still recommend the movie for the horror buff just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career (hopefully) and that Chris Ferry establishes himself as a vicious spectator Has.
