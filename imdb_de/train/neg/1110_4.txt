An hour, eight minutes, and twelve seconds after that streak, and I decided it was pretty lame. This was shortly after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) fell from a tree on his horse to rejoin the good group. I was quite stunned by the whole Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 gimmick, which was translated into nothing. Obviously, the name Coppola in the credits can not contribute to success, even if more than one is listed. <br /> <br /> If you make it to the end of the movie, you'll probably face the same questions as me. What exactly was the catch with the gloves? What's wrong with the rodeo scenario? Who should represent the stranger? Why did you make this movie? <br /> <br /> I could probably continue, but my energy is exhausted. You see, there is already a western called "The Gunfighter" from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character. If you look at it, you will feel as good as you look at it when you feel bad. I can recommend that.
