This 2003 produced for the TV movie was of course shown on a women's channel. Why do I try as a man to see that at all? I do not know, but I should have my head examined. And the director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed if he does the men wrong. He takes away all the power and conviction that a man could have when several boring women have him with him. The biggest hurdle is Joyce Hyser as a wife. I could not wait for him to drop her. Her revenge was stupid and stupid and confusing throughout the movie. The other Femme Fatale was Nichole Hiltz, about the coldest person you would ever meet. Her eyes gave no guarantee to our leading man to pass over these monkeys, and her acting was so obvious that only a fool could miss her. Definitely a loser. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slow, as the bitch seduced her own husband. Once again he played as a loser of David DeLuise. Anthony Denison is the boss who has little to do but our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or should I say sacrifice, was not so good. At first I thought he was just a bad actor, but later I believed it. He never started the role and kept repeating himself. Although as a man I got angry when the two women got away with it. Men, beware of this channel that oppresses men, and women themselves get away with murder. LMN is the channel. Beware. Note: Having accidentally seen this a second time, I am convinced of my first thoughts. Especially with the author / director Simon Gornick. I still believe that he has dishonored the male species and should whip on horseback. The only salvation in this film is Tembi Locke, who has no chance to show her talents through the terrible spectacle of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise in her vicinity. Plus the stupid act that only makes it worse. Down with Gornick's movie and his empty stars. Please, LMN, do not show that anymore.
