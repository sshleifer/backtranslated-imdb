Nell Shipman tried a plot to achieve a pursuit finale in 'Back to God's Country' last year, and she failed miserably. This time she feels better, although it seems pointless. "Something New" has little action outside of the persecution. There's a brief premise that gets the hero (co-author and Shipman's friend) to rescue the girl (played by Shipman), then it's nothing more than an exciting, implausible hunt from there. Of course it runs like a one-hour ad for a Maxwell sedan, but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous. It does not seem that she has much of the rescue films of D.W. Griffith or his parodies of Mack Sennett and other comedians she imitates. <br /> <br /> An interesting point is that Shipman writes himself and writes in the film, as the author of the story of the film, which acts as a protagonist writer (again Shipman), although she does not do much clever or humorous although she tries. Still others had taught the author's wit in the subtitles, such as Anita Loos with "Wild and Woolly" or Frances Marion with "A Girl's Folly" (both 1917). At least Shipman gives the impression that she does not take herself or the movie seriously - and neither do I. 'Something New' is attacked despite his claim.
