I was in second grade 12 years ago. I clearly remember that. We learned something about space. All the little kids want to go into space, right? Well, after seeing that, I was so scared to death that I was "accidentally" thrown into space by a psychotic robot. I had no idea that this was a movie. I thought it was a news broadcast or something. I think it was my own version of when people got freaked out of the radio show 'War of the Worlds'. I recently watched this movie again, and it became clear to me that my favorite actor Joaquin Phoenix (then known as Leaf Phoenix) was there. I can tell you, I laughed at the dramatic parts and even more about acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, she's moving in slow motion. Did you ever notice that? I do not think you talk so slowly in space or think so slowly. <br /> <br /> The best thing is when Andy gets knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank and begins to float backwards when closing the security doors. Little Max tries to pull her in. Suddenly we get a big close-up of Max's face while he (in slow motion) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?" I had no Idea.
