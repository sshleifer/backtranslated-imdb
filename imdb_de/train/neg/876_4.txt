Until the last 20 minutes, I thought this might be the worst movie by Jackie Chan (except for his pre-1978 work that I'm not familiar with). The final battle sequence changed everything: It's long, good and intense - indeed one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to get there, you have to sit down through a lot of "comedy" that could amuse five-year-old kids (oh, look, someone threw the guy's face to a tomato) and endless "football" scenes. Not to mention the dubbing (including the line "How can I turn it off? It's not knocking" - pay attention to what it refers to). "Dragon Lord" is worth renting for the last fight alone, but the rest of the movie is only for Jackie collectors and even for those who have already seen at least 15 of his other films. (**)
