That's the best way to describe this movie. He turns to a newlywed couple who moves into a house where her husband's first wife is, who died under mysterious circumstances. That sounds good and good, but what happens is an hour of pure boredom. In fact, one of the fun things about this movie is that at the beginning of the movie, there is a warning that promises a free coffin to anyone dying of terror. Well, trust me, no one has ever resorted to this offer, unless someone is afraid of plastic skulls, peacocks, crazy gardeners and doors being struck. And the music is the worst, it's a constant tuba music that sounds like it's being played by a sixth student. And you will find out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to ask yourself what people thought in this movie. Someone dies while running and hitting the head, and the police are never called to investigate. Yes, in the end this is a slow pace (which is really bad, considering that the movie lasts just over an hour), boring little story that the average person can easily understand. Apparently, none of the characters in this movie was the average person.
