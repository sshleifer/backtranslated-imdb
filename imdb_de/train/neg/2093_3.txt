If you like a syfi soap opera, this show is for you, and when it comes to it, it does not work for me, and after watching 3 episodes, I just can not see it anymore. It's boring and slow, and for a show that's based on the timeline more than 100,000 years ago, if you base it on Earth's timeline for Battlestar Galactica, they seem the same stuff as the 100,000-year-old Chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the 100,000-year-old popular brand LCD TVs. This also applies to the rest of the sets in the show. It's just too much of today's material that you can not miss. I think they could have done a better job to get around these problems. Yes, Battlestar Galactica had some of the same problems, but not nearly so bad. As good as the rest of the show, it's not nearly as good as BSG and it's a bad sequel.
