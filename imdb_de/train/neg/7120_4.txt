I saw this movie for the first time on MST3K. And although I laughed backwards at the jokes, I do not particularly think that this movie was so bad. Sure, it was a bit hard to understand that the budget is pretty obvious. But it had a very Hitchcock-like storyline and I can honestly say that I was really entertained when I saw the non-MST3K version. This movie is screaming for a Hollywood remake.
