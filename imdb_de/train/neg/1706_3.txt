Wow, that was a very bad movie ... As read in other comments, this movie has no storyline, no character development, maybe they had a kind of script, but it's difficult to say because of the actual final result. <br /> <The editing of this film was really nonexistent, it jumps from scene to scene with no connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening. All in all, it's just a low budget zombie strip that was not thought out at all, bad acting, bad dialogue, everything is bad. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the bloody factor, I think this must be the place where they spent the money they were trying to justify to justify this. <br /> <br /> Unless you (like me) are keen on finding and observing all the zombie shots you can find, do not look at them. Period.
