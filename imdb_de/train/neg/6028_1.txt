I'm a Christian ... and I think this movie is awful. <br /> <br /> Nobody but Hardcore, Bible Belt Christians will like this movie. The message is just too good in your face. If you want to touch a wider audience, you have to be much more subtle. They can not have the Father wielding the Bible and carrying it around in EVERY scene. RIDICULOUS! <br /> <br /> Bad direction. The discovery of missing persons should have been frightening, but it was ridiculous. You leave your clothes on the floor? It reminded me of old Ed Wood films: "Oh my God, people are missing!" This scene on the plane is just stupid. Think about it: If you found your loved one's clothes next to you, you would not just scream "oh my god." They have disappeared! You are missing! and start crying and screaming. They would be the first to refuse ... they just would not jump to that conclusion. Take a look at Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite shot is the dog sitting outside on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him. I fell off the couch, I laughed so much. <br /> <br /> The music was so bad and so distracting. It was as if the composer were making his own films in his own world. "here's my chance to make a thriller", "here's my chance to do some action!" Stop telling me how to feel James CoVell! A good score supports what's happening on the screen ... This movie needed more UNDER score, but instead it was just as much on your face as the message. <br /> <br /> This was Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was the worst: "They do not understand, people are missing!". Brad Johnson was ridiculous. The two outstanding performances came from the anti-Christian and the older man (sorry, I can not remember their names) Producers, filmmakers and actors are just fooling themselves ... saying "We're going to reach a wide audience" and "Brad Johnson is unbelievable "and" that's like a Hollywood movie ". I came to the conclusion that they just do not know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> I recommend the effort. Making the message accessible to a wide audience is a fantastic idea. Film is the best medium to achieve this. Watch movies like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNS, CONTACT, PASSION of Christ, even O'BROTHER, WHERE ART YOU? The bottom line is that the film had to be made by people who have talent and vision. Unfortunately it was not like that.
