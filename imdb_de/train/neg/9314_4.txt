Well, all in all, this movie was pretty worthless and it's basically a horror movie that was more of a comedy after all. I rented this movie last night when I and my friends went to blockbusters to find a scary movie. That was definitely not what we were looking for, but it pleased us with humor. The actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's funny. And especially this Tracy girl, when she is in the boarded room and tells the clown to leave. They show almost no emotion and it is so obvious that they are acting. And even if the clown looks through this black box paper thing and grabs Mark, he does not even look like he's scared, even though the clown grabbed him and started attacking him. And seriously, would you just be JOGGING if you are being followed? I would sprint for my life! (Even though someone could probably overtake this clown because he's about 300 pounds.) Not to mention that the effects are not as great as when the clown chops off Susan's head in the forest, and then whenever he bangs her head in the forest Brett throws rooms with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise throws her head back. As in the commentary of the predecessor, the beginning makes absolutely no sense and I do not even see why it was even included in the movie. So, was this movie made in 2003? The music sounds like it was made in the 80s, and the camera (?) Does not look really professional. Half the time it seems like the camera could not even stay stable when it's accepted. Overall, I have to say that I liked the movie. However, I would not recommend it if you're trying to find something that scares you, but if you're looking for something that you can make fun of or make fun of, I'd definitely recommend it.
