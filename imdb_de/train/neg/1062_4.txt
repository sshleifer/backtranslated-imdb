Ouch! This was a bit painful to complain about. It has a cute and amusing premise, but everything comes to hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville showed surprisingly good performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly played it far beyond. I know the parts were written that way, and it's hard to blame the actors when the script and the director make them perform such a hit. If you're going to have outrageous characters, that's fine, but you have to have good material for it to work. Do not run away here and scream out of this movie, if at all possible.
