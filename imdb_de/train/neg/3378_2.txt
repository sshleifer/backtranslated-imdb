When this movie was released, I had seen Chorus Line four times on stage and eagerly awaited the long awaited production of a film of the story. My wife and I stood hours before the box office opening on the day the movie was released. It was not only a disappointment, it was a kick in the stomach. <br /> <br /> At first, the story was moved "outside", so to speak, by shooting scenes that did not fall within the boundaries of the theater. These limitations are a big part of the meaning and influence of the story. <br /> <br /> Second & Third together (assign own order): One of the original songs with a very dynamic dance number has been removed. a song that was NOT in the stage production was added. Say what ?? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason why I gave this film 2 stars is my admiration for the talent and the hard work of the interpreters. I've seen Chorus Line on stage six times now, and I would not mind seeing it six more times before I die. It's superbly written, with wonderful music and heartbreaking real stories. If you want to see a musical that includes a great audition, I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of an A Chorus line, you will see it on stage.
