The rich fat Joan Winfield (a terribly miscastic Bette Davis) is betrothed to be married to the stupid selfish Allen Brice (Jack Carson, who looks lost). Her father (Eugene Palette) is determined to end the marriage and she is abducted by Steve Collins (James Cagney, Seriously). They dump land in the desert and hate each other, but (sigh) begin to fall in love. <br /> <br /> This seems to be a high rating from reviewers just because Cagney and Davis are there. They were both brilliant actors, but they were known for their dramas and not comedy. This movie shows why! The script is just awful - there is no real laugh in the whole movie. The racing joke is that Cagney and Davis first rumble in a cactus (this is done three times!). Only their considerable talents save them from complete humiliation. It looks like both are doing their best with the lousy material. Cagney tries his best with his lines and Davis squeals every line with full force, but it does not work. Carson has this "what the hell" look on the face throughout the movie (probably because his characters' emotions change in seconds). Only Palette, with its unmistakable voice and exaggerated readings, makes you smile. All in all, however, this was boring and laughless - a real task to prevail. This brings two stars just for the acting of Cagney and Davis and some nice movies, but really - it's not worth watching. Cagney and Davis hated this movie in later years and you can see why.
