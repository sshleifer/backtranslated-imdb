Here are some of the biggest problems of this movie: 1) Clichés abound. Seriously, terrible "twists" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narrative jumps around in time, which would be fine if you do it well, but not. <br /> <br /> 3) Lame characters that does not develop so much that it either stays absolutely static or drastically changes for no good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Great: HORRIBLE ACTING. Exaggerated by almost every person. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the best points of the movie: 1) The main role looks damn good. <br /> <br /> As I see it, there are only two types of people who would be interested in this movie: a) People who can sit 90 minutes of tricks just because the main role is attractive. <br /> <br /> b) People who often think to themselves, "I like Hollywood dirt with clichés and overacting, but if I could only see it in Korean ..." There is a lot of good Korean cinema, So why waste your time on trash?
