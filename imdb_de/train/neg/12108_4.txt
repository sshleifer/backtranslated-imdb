All I had to do was write this one liner, but it really is. I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I have seen in recent years. I commend everyone involved in most aspects except the most important of the script. It's a weak story about a little criminal. No fine spectacle or black and white film styling can compensate for a complete lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he will do another movie about the General. My advice is, do not waste time.
