All right, a horror movie about a nice suburban family that deals with the death of their parents and about the "thing" in the basement that they are feeding the people who are getting them off the street. Of course there is more to it than that, but to say more would say. <br /> <br /> It just did not come together for me as it tries to have it in two ways, both as a family drama and as a horrible movie. The film is eager to cut across the two genres, but seems to stumble more than it shocks what it never is. It does not help that the final revelation is less of a fear than an "Oh," as on "Oh, that's it?". If I had not seen so many horror movies lately, maybe that would have been better, or it just seemed like I did not compare it to that much. <br /> <br /> I would insist on taking one
