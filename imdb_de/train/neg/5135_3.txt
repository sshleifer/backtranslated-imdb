I think scarecrows are scary, so it's a shame that the movie does not make any more of it. <br /> <br /> A bunch of robbers turn an emergency parachute out of a plane into a huge field with scarecrows. One of them disappears with the prey and the rest chases him down while he is hit by unexplained evil scarecrows. The acting is hammy and the scarecrows are inconspicuous (if they move). On the positive side, the director makes the static scarecrows a bit exciting. It is, as Alfred Hitchcock says, "A bomb under a table is starting, and that's a surprise, we know the bomb is under the table, but not when it's going to leave, and that's exciting."
