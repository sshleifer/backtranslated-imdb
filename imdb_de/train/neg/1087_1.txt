This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. For good actors, the film does not live up to expectations. The most dramatic thing about this film is the music, which pretty well summarizes the movie: Compensating a bad and confusing story by well-known actors, loud and dramatic music. That does not change the fact that this is a very boring movie. Has earned a score of 1.
