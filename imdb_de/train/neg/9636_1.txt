This prodigious waste of production money is a cinematic proof that the rich and famous can be as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From a (stupid) play by Tennessee Williams, directed (with a dead hand) by Joseph Losey and Taylor, Burton and Noel Coward, this project, filmed in a spectacular villa on a cliff island in the Mediterranean, is a safe fire It was won at the handover to Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and boring that it almost contradicts the belief. Visually, the film is spectacular, but that is the power of nature that allows the frame and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. The shrill antics of a screaming Taylor, Burton's half-asleep wanderings, the crazy dialogue, Noel Coward laughing at himself, the ridiculous story and action tools, and the absurd costumes irritate the viewer. BOOM is a shame, a waste of money and talent, and a clear proof that famous people can be idiots, just like the rest of the planet. Not even funny. Just terrible and crazy trash.
