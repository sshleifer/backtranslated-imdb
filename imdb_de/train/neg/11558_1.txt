An extraordinarily terrible story that I can hardly put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims finally appeared alive and healthy and then massacred again. There is a possibility that I missed some crucial elements of the story as I was in a slight coma during the time this baby was there. The box in which the film appears shows scenes that are never in the movie. I was lured by the gross images of bondage torture and the promises of a 'euro garb, sexy horror strip'. I have a feeling that this was the budget version and about a quarter of the film was omitted. The good stuff is more than likely. I got the PG-13 add-on, which made about as much sense as the end of the new movie "Planet of the Apes". Look at this with a friend and a bottle of hard stuff. You will need it.
