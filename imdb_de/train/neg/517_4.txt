"The Return of Chandu" is remarkable, if you can say that for Bela Lugosi as a hero and not as a villain. Why he ever gets the girl. <br /> <br /> The story as such implies that the Black Magic cult of Ubasti tries to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (the delicious Maria Alba) and to use her as a victim to revive her old guide, who happens to like Nadji looks. As Chandu, who has magical powers, Lugosi tries to cross the villains. Director Ray Taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive footage. Fans of King Kong (1933) will see in several scenes the huge doors that kept Kong in check. The spectacle is terrible for the most part. The actor who plays the High Priest (I think Lucien Prival), for example, uses this actor-inspired pronunciation, which was so common in early conversations. The less said about the others, the better. <br /> <br /> It's a mystery why Lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career because he was still a bankable star at Universal at the time. Maybe it was because he played the hero in this case and got the girl who knows. As his career turned downwards in the late '30s, this type of fare became the rule for Lugosi and not the exception. <br /> <br />
