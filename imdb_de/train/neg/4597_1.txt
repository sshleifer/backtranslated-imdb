After surviving this inaccurate movie, I'll admit that it's a more modern narrative than in previous versions. However, it is so inaccurate and so politically correct that it drove me crazy after viewing it. Davy Crockett was badly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would probably have been better staffed when Sam Houston had given the love of both men to rhetoric. I think the selfish Dennis Quaid (a true Texan) would have been a perfect crockett and definitely fed into his starving sense of self-reverence. As a Texan and a true believer in the Texas mindset, I believe that Davy Crockett was the epitome of the Texan, even if he was not born here. Our unofficial motto is, "It's not boastful if it's a fact," was made for Crockett. And this last scene in Alamo, where Crockett is the last survivor, must be the biggest insult to Davy Crockett ever made. Claiming that this giant of a man and experienced fighter would be convicted alive is ridiculous. Three different eyewitnesses report that he was killed in the midst of one or more dead Mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand-fighting. Finally, this lame ending of the film, which allegedly depicts the Battle of San Jacinto as a joint battle of 600 Texans against 700 Mexican soldiers, when in fact there were closer to 1,500 well-trained Mexican regulars. Every Texas student who watches in his first history lesson in Texas knows that the battle surprised the Mexican army during the siesta, and the Mexican army was so confused that they could not form lines and flee as they were not trained, hand to fight in frontier style against the front.
