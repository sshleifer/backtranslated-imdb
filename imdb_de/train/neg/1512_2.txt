A heavy attempt at "Seven", complete with second-class actors, terrible camera work, half-finished story and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda. Yes, they are "sex offenders", they live next door and you are really raped. <br /> <br /> No surprises from the Vice Terminatrix woman, she acts as always - as convincing as a piece of wood. Richard Gere continues to slide down - and is about as deep as the late Steven Seagal. The crazy-eyed singer is best when she's dead in bed; and even the wolf was below average (though she was the best actress in the movie) - maybe they fed her before the shots or something.

If "sex offenders" are not particularly interested - and statistics say that lack of exercise and poor nutrition cause more pain, suffering and death - there is little reason to see or be afraid. <Br /> <br /> There are some body parts fetishes and some snuff, but the Gore is less than mediocre and fails both as an artistic device (because it's pointless) and as a gore because it's not bloody enough. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this.
