Some idiot who had read or seen angels coming to earth decided to ignore what he had heard about the fact that the offspring of humans and angels were bigger than normal humans. To reinvent them as mythical giants who were 40 feet tall is absolutely ridiculous. In parts of the world, there were some historical references to living space and furniture that were much larger than normal people would need. These were supposedly built on a scale suitable for a 10- to 14-foot tall person and somewhat supportive of the Bible's "David and Goliath" story. There is no historical reference to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of ​​a 40 foot creature. If I had rated this movie on my own scale, that would have been a negative value ...
