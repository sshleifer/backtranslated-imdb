Inside Man, a yawning, snail-like disappointment, tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) being investigated for his possible involvement in missing money. If a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a thought leader (Clive Owen) and his team, is the detective charged to force the thief to his job? His only attempt to prove that he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with her own secrets and intentions, sent to retrieve an item from the banker's safe deposit box held in the bank, and you have the threefold dilemma. Unfortunately, everything is set up in the film, and in the end pays nothing. Denzel Washington is the least interested in an ineffective and uncomfortably egocentric performance. The only salvation for the film is its competent co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the movie itself. In fact, Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and high-profile performance he plays as a reckless, malevolent villain against guys. Clive Owen has little to do except breed and pose, but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role. It is strange that so much talent is wasted on this film with little influence or interest. One has to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking when he made this film. However, the most intriguing aspect of Inside Man is how much unjustified praise it has received. For a movie that seemed to have all the prerequisites for a pre-summer blockbuster, this film is terribly flat.
