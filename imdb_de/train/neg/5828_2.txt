I can not agree with another reviewer who mentioned Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be absolutely boring and "content wise" uninspired. He can make eye candy (and I like sweets), but his presumption and fundamental artistic emptiness diminish all pleasure. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid that many people do not distinguish between similar (but really superficial) works by Jodorowsky or even more linear filmmakers like Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love Odyssey in 2001 and have never been bored by the final scenes ...) This type of art, as made by M. Barney, creates confusion and avoids the spectators who would otherwise appreciate experimental cinema. Typical empty postmodern "conceptual" art. And check his interviews. I just do not buy it, sorry. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I was never bored watching Alejandro Jodorowsky's films while Drawing Restraint 9 was a deep disappointment. Especially because it offered the opportunity to be something, to tell something in a non-linear, unorthodox way (like the beginning and the great choreographed dance and the preparations for the ship's departure.) Ships "meet" on the sea .. Ideas Dung as a valuable object (if it was feces) These "pearl diver" ... Everything could construct a great surreal movie with some content.But he didn't.And these horrible, overbearing scenes of the dressing and the false tea ceremony .. How vain and fake and philosophically presumptuous, but empty can it be? <br /> <br /> I have some great scenic scenes, but the whole movie became so boring and overbearing and completely empty and fake that he physically made me ill. <br /> <br /> And it does not have a good tempo, I like slow movies, but that was just boring in some scenes - because it was presumptuous and fake - so I just had to witness the scenes for a long time artistic vanity ... <br /> <br /> This type of film brings only the art and the spirits around t in my view. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
