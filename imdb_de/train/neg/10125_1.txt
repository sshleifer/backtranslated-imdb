... that would be what you got. <br /> <br /> Words alone can not describe how bad this is. If you have trouble sleeping, get in here and I guarantee you will be out in fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Robert Lowery was a pretty good actor in the 1940s, but he calls him here. In an interview, Johnny "Duncan" Robin said that he and Batman had to run out of the car to the house in a scene and that Lowery was doubled out of reach of the camera because his belt was too tight! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy - in fact, he's more like a man in his thirties waiting for Lowery to leave so he can wear the big cape. <br /> <br /> Driving a Batmobile Looks like it was played by Honest Al's used-car lot at a lower price - the Dynamic Duo is not very keen to hide the fact that it's the car of Bruce Wayne is that they drive - in fact it is noticed by several characters everywhere the series. <br /> <br /> The acting is wooden - the sets are cheap - the dialogue is horrible and if there was any script they followed, I'm sure it's in the direction of "Batman" Something here, 'cause it definitely looks like they're getting on the way. <br /> <br /> Batman's utility belt is made of thin fabric with no obvious pockets to hold his gadgets - in a scene when Batman needs a full sized blowtorch that the producers simply stick one in as the scene starts - never to be seen again - his habit is so bad that he can not even see and his ears look more like flopsy -Mopsie, as the unfortunate Easter Bunny, as if they are doing something beating. <br /> <br /> In a scene (I do not fool myself), Batman uses radioactive money that will go up in flames in a second, when it is exposed to the air to indulge in some hoods It is radioactive for him to track it - the reason why it is so flammable is not explained. Well, unfortunately, the thugs open the package in a cardboard box - we know it's a cardboard box because Batman sneaks in and squeezes those boxes that weigh about six ounces on the hoods to turn them off - and soon it burns whole place on the floor. Thanks Batman! <br /> <br /> In another scene, after the Batmobile has been disabled, Batman puts down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and picks up his car - letting the man take care of himself and telling him not to worry Because if Batman smashes the car, the police will surely buy another one for him! Yes, you guessed it, the car said within seconds of a cliff. Not that it matters to the motorist, who probably died in an accident trying to find his way back to Gotham City. <br /> <br /> There is a tired subplot with Lois Lane clone Vicki Vale, who is convinced that Bruce Wayne Batman is - you must have seen the Batmobile parked in front of Bruce's house - or maybe she saw Batman and Robin in the densely populated suburban area walk along the walk. <br /> <br /> Everything about this series is bad - and all but the youngest in the audience want to throw toast on the screen. If you are looking for bad cinema, you could not achieve a better brand. For entertainment, try Burton Batman's films, the television series Adam West Batman TV or the earlier series Lewis Wilson Batman.
