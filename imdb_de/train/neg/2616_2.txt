Remember the name Kevin Lime - and please, never leave him directly again. Timing, Tempo, Schnitt: everything is hopelessly wrong. <br /> <br /> Three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, go out of the <br /> set) can not save anything from this movie amateurs like Alice <br /> <br /> Evans and the kind of production standards you would expect from teen-produced children's shows on British television. <br /> <br /> Greatest secret: the music. A result that is so incapable, inappropriate, and poorly tuned to the tone of the film that you're seriously wondering if it's a case of sabotage. Add an acoustics that seems to be unconstructed from a single microphone, and a director who only occasionally remembers to add auditory actions in off-screen mode, and we <br /> <br /> have what it takes to be supreme Ratio of money from <br /> <br /> recent years.
