I only watched DVD 1. The actual program may have about 10 minutes of good information. Otherwise, they are religious people. It's as if director Brian Flemming has recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and feels that he can easily beat up his opponent with these tools. It never comes back to the topic. <br /> <br /> Religious people tend to be skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive education. Arguments of such victims are irrational and therefore not convincing. Anti-religious people want more data. We do not have to say that religious people are crazy, just like American Jews, that Christmas music gets annoying until the middle of December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, the superintendent of Fleming The Christian school of childhood confronts the director more on his motives. That seems to be the most honest part of the movie, and it was too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming was a little more self-confident, he might have a good story about his own past and present) relationship with Christianity and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth. <br /> <br /> And maybe he could provide his material "Christ has never walked the earth" to a more serious documentarian. I'm not studying the writings of Saul / Paul to find out how airtight this is, but a quick search of Wikipedia suggests that most of these arguments are discredited. <br /> <br /> The bonus interviews are pretty good that they do not support Fleming's thesis much. Sam Harris is a good spokesman for the anti-religious POV, and he does not respond to the other, non-Christian religions. There are also some good (and easy Google) interviews on Salon.com, Amazon.com, and Samharris.org.
