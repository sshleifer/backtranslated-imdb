1. the good news. The 3-D is spectacularly well done, and the Gotcha gimmicks do not work. The film is based on the true story of the height of human history and even shows one of the actual participants in this story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now the meat of the matter: It's about FLYING for krissakes! Flying with big, googy human eyes, true, but still flying. Remember when watching the "Underworld" movies with Rats Vs. Compared cockroaches? This was not meant to be praise, and I never thought anyone would take it literally. This one has even less empathy. Baby maggots? Pooh. In one of these strange contexts of Hollywood groups, this Flik was apparently at the same time with "space chimps" on the drawing boards, also about living things in space. <br /> <br /> Go rent "Apollo 13" and watch a movie with 9 reviews about the REAL Space Program (RIP).
