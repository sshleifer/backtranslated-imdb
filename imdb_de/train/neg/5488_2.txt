Why on earth is Colin Firth in this pointless movie? Was he really that short on money? <br /> <br /> The film is not clear what it is, sadness? Exotic places? Ghosts ?, a vehicle for Mr. Darcy? It's a messy, muddy mess. <br /> <br /> It seems to be a kind of idea that Italy has to be good in itself and that Italian has something to offer as a language - but in the end the girls just want to go back to Yankland. <br /> <br /> There are pointless episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy streets - but what it's about or why someone should take care of it is not clear. <br /> There was also a woman in the movie , It was not clear what work was here, but she seemed to be there just to make vague, inappropriate and maudlin comments on the girl. Was it about pedophilia? <br /> <br /> A pretty terrible mess, all in all. I gave him 2 instead of 1 because he does not have the charm of a very horrible movie.
