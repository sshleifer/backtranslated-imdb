In the end, I watched The Tenants with my close friends, who hired the movie on the cover solely for the look of Snoop Dogg (a passionate fetish). Understandably, I did not expect much. I thought the film included the typical range of Snoop Dogg behaviors and images that are common in Clich√© rap videos. However, my generalization was wrong for the most part. Unfortunately, the film has not improved. <br /> <br /> Most would call the movie a dark serious drama, while I would describe it as a dark, seriously boring drama strip. The film tells the story of two fighting writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) trying to create their own masterpieces. Their contrasting life forms an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the movie like a wild rollercoaster ride, which accounts for most of Snoop's character. It reminds of someone with a serious case of a split personality disorder. And though the movie is a drama, the acting of Snoop and Company, which has a morbid and serious tone, is more strangely hampered than anything because it has a lot of dialogue and much more dialogue afterwards. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are mostly blocked with more dialogue. The end suddenly surprised me. It was a bit twisted, a bit unexpected and a perfect way to end a movie that had to end. Looking at the credits, I could not help but imagine the director thinking, "Oh God, how the hell do I end this Snoozer?" By the way, the director has carefully crafted hints and subtleties that culminate - and all are on a busy street full of dwarfs wearing nothing more than black sweaters, more visible than Waldo.
