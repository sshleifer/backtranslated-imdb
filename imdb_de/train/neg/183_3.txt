This is a western action. James Steart leads an All Star Cast in the picturesque Northwest, which is filmed in magnificent splendor. The scenery and the costumes are great. There are action and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who eludes a crooked government in Old Nothwest. <br /> <br /> The main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood has always turned into a hero. Even as this movie was filmed, the cynic was the stereotyped hero, and the one portrayed by Stewart really has few salvation graces. He is nice to his two partners, and that gives him an extra dimension of credibility and sympathy. <br /> <br /> However, he is so pigish of all the others that it's hard to really take care of him or take care of him. He's very similar to the one-dimensional western spaghetti characters (cut not so bad) , <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the secondary characters are quite enjoyable. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others make this worth seeing.
