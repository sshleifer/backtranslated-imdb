I've seen a lot of horror films in my time, all absurdly bad, but no one reaches the depths, into which this garbage crashes. This movie made me angrier and angrier as I looked at him as I tried to wrap my head exactly what this movie is about. Well, once I've seen it, I understand - somehow - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too confusing to have fun watching. Yes, there are the usual scenes of innocent violence, one-liners showing the overwhelming insight of their characters ("The highway is mine ... me!") And enough nudity to distract us sufficiently from the "plot", but still You will leave this film alone and exploited like a puppy that is no longer wanted and is lying in a box on the roadside.
