The time I spent with this movie was a waste of time. I do not like science fiction. I do not reject a genre per se, as good work can be done in any genre. This movie is not good work though. I can not fault the visuals (unless foreign makeups are involved), and the special effects are impressive. The story was not bad for a trekkish comic. But the fx visuals were obviously the place where the interest / attention / money of all manufacturers lay. The direction alternated between sluggish and confusing (one was not at all sure who did what and what with whom and to whom at a crucial time). The "acting" was mostly very bad. There was no basis for most of the line reading except for an indication of "It was so on the page and the director told me I should be crazy / sad / scared / whatever." Okay, so it was a pilot of the SF series. Since when is this an excuse for correctable sloppiness in areas where a dramatic medium is essential: Am I surprised that the pilot has sold the series, or is the money also in the hands of technicians?
