Trust me, this is a disappointing movie you want to avoid, and this comes from a huge Denzel Washington fan. The frustrating part is that it's 1/3 of a great movie. The first part of this film does an extraordinary job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he was paid to protect. The trailers to this film all mention that she is kidnapped. So I do not say anything when I say that the film gets into an almost incomparable confusion after their kidnapping. Whatever the director was trying to achieve, he just managed to literally make the audience sick. Fast, hectic and choppy cuts follow for the next half hour, while Creasy tracks down the culprits. These cuts are so unnatural and disgusting that they just get you out of the story. I am sure the director felt that this disquieting way of presenting the story meant a change in Creasy's character and that another film was to follow. Well, he was right. The following movie was complete and unsatisfactory. The result is a depressing ending that ruins even the first forty minutes of the movie.
