What a garbage was this movie. The premise was fine, but even with some crappy effects that mixed a giant with normal-sized people (even the effects in Hercules were better), I knew that would be bad. But the really horrible part of the movie is the dialogues. It is completely incoherent, stupid and stupid. I felt it was written by a 9th grader in creative class and got a D-. I want to torture Casper van Diem and the other actors for the movie. <br /> <br /> I had a lot of cheesy and bad movies (I love the tremors), but that ... I do not recommend it at all. It's stupid and the totally amazingly bad dialogues make you flinch.
