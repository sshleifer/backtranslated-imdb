Just when I thought I would finish a whole year without evaluating a single movie with "bombs", a friend brought this notorious fucking dog to my house last night. I was afraid I knew the worst, because I knew his reputation, and it was as horrible as I expected. This is a Mexican chaos that was dubbed in English and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has terrible sets and effects and shows a rather frightening Santa Claus who does not operate on the North Pole, but of a cloud in space, and who has no small elves to help him make his toys, but all different groups of children from virtually everyone There is land. The opening sequence, in which St. Nick laughs heartily as he watches monitors show how all these kids work hard while singing terrible Christmas carols in different languages, seems to go on forever and without history. Obviously, THIS Santa Claus does not pay attention to the child labor laws! <br /> <br /> Finally, we get some evil and shabby, red-tailed devil's apprentice, who himself travels from hell to earth just to make little children naughty Turn the Christmas round into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it will frighten little kids and turn off Santa Claus and the holidays forever. Oddly enough, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas movie, which makes it somehow more sinister in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on here. This easily makes my personal list of the "worst movie I've ever seen", but I'm sure that's nothing unique.
