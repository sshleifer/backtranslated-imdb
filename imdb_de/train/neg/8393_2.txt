John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domergue, who saw as players all the better days in better films, met to make this horror movie class G about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion. In the last two decades of his career he had followed the theory That it would be better to keep going, no matter what you did, and getting those paychecks The man did not discriminate in any way in which he performed. <br /> <br /> He plays the caretaker of an old gothic mansion, which director John Ireland has rented for his latest low-slash movie. It even has a graveyard, but with a missing resident. Faith Domergue is Ireland's alternative star, and Carole Wells is the young inventor. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes, most of the cast is dead, not dead yet. The script is so incoherent, I'm still trying to figure it out. I will not waste any gray matter anymore.
