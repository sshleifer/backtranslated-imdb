I am very open to foreign films and I like to think that I understand what they are trying to achieve, although some things get lost in the translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this movie was boring. I've often thought about how interesting it would be to make a film that shows only a typical day or period that really did not make sense. Now that I've seen such a movie, I'm not going to think that way anymore. There are sounds about society, racism and a craving ... but South Park has it. And when I see South Park, it actually moves me to feel an emotion. The feeling that came closest to me in this movie was the yawn I experienced after the first five minutes. I rate the typical movie with seven or more because I love every movie the most. I gave this movie one.
