"Meatball Machine" is one of the most complex, ridiculous, horrible and exaggerated sci-fi horror movies I've ever encountered. It's about the good versus the evil and a story of the coming of age, with the goal of talking in a bloody, gloomy and humorous context. For that reason, the violence is not particularly cruel and does not make you shaky, but the unfounded bloodshed and nakedness run free. The performances of Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst I have ever seen. If that was not enough, it was also directed by an unknown director named Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie has it all, it's bad to the bone! A must for every b-movie freak !!! ... simple: a delightful and rare gem.
