I'm really surprised at how many good reviews this anti-Christian pseudo-documentation has received. Well, I respect the opinion and belief of the guy. I myself do not believe in the learned Christian doctrine in this state. However, anti-Christian propaganda is a slightly different topic. <br /> <br /> This movie has valid points, but they are very few and presented in a very biased context. I do not recommend it to see. I think everyone should see it and decide for themselves whether they believe it or not. And that's actually more of an opportunity than the director gives to the Christian teachings. Instead of asking questions, it looks like a personal vendetta in the Christian school that influenced his childhood. It also misrepresents most Christians, either as incredibly naive or as fundamentalists, no moderation in between. The director uses film scenes from Passion of Christ without permission and puts on an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. I actually found the headmaster the most down to earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified. I also strongly doubt that all Christian believers who were interviewed were subsequently consulted or even given the purpose of the pre-interview investigation. Here are some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity. But the way all this thinking is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional, and terribly biased.
