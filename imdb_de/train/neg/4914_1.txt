I love a good sappy love story (and I'm a guy), but when I rented "Love Story," I prayed that the end would be as quick and painless as possible, and just the opposite for Ali McGraw's character. <br /> <Ali McGraw, when Jenny alienated herself in the first 15 minutes and irritated me. When we learn that she's been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I can not help wondering if her death would be such a terrible loss to poor Oliver, or if anyone watching this movie is interested in it , If she did not die, her scratching personality would probably have pushed Oliver over the edge and eventually landed her in a divorce court. <br /> <br /> People love this movie, but it's one of the worst of the 70's.
