How can you do anything wrong with a movie called "Gayniggers from Outer Space"? Just make some superior stereotypes for the characters, use the Village People as the main soundtrack supplier, and make tons of gay gags. Plot is unimportant. Too bad, this movie contains nothing of it and every joke misses the spot. The characters all look the same, apart from the German Gaynigger, one or two jokes work, the rest fails. <br /> <br /> The title made me laugh and I was ready to laugh more about the movie. My expectation was apparently too high.
