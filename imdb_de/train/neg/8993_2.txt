In the 70s, when I first saw this, I was in high school. It was cool. Now, as an adult, I look back and say to myself ... yes, right. What was so funny? It has moments, but there are only a few. It's so old that the jokes do not stand up anymore. Show this to a younger crowd and they will be completely lost. If you like this kind of humor, you might want to stay with Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon. Tunnel Vision and Groove Tube are too outdated for today's viewing.
