One of the worst movies ever. Not funny, bad cinematography on TV, bad acting. Sad to see that so many famous old actors could hardly walk, let alone act. The leading female Nancy Young can not act. Terrible direction. Below average with bad TV movies. Occasionally weak jokes fall flat. Even the basic requirement of the film makes no sense. Somehow they are supposed to prevent a wedding from taking place, but there is no logic behind their actions. At the slow pace, my wife stopped looking, but I suffered. The old men should behave as if they were young and horny, but it looks rather pathetic than funny. How did you even get the money for it?
