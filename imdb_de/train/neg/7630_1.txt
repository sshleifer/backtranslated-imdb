A boring movie about a boring city in the 50s. How can anyone think that this is a classic? The producer almost ended his career by pushing his girlfriend Cybil Shepard into several films far beyond her acting ability. I think this movie gives an insight into how bad the future films of Peter Bogdonovitch would become. Cybil Shepard's career jumped after several films produced by Peter Bogdonovich. It was not until "Moonlighting" that her career returned. I thought the acting was a bad rendition of the "graduate". I noticed that this movie was not shown in the US. The only place I saw was late at night in Europe.
