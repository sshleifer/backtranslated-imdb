The only good thing about this film is the beautiful landscape. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have withdrawn from the pulpit when his son Paul departed from the teachings he had proclaimed. How many times can his boys in vain accept the name of the Lord in this film, which comes from a Presbyterian background? It does not fit. I wish Paul had swept down the river at the very beginning without a boat to spare us the stupid, grinning, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). So Norm becomes a teacher and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler who wants to save the norm, but not something like that. It is very uninteresting. We see that Paul's prejudiced whites are contested for his Native American. That was the only part that was interested and might have become a real "wild western". All we can see is a sleepy town where the sons of the two ministers have nothing to do but 1. Norm chases after a lame girlfriend and takes care of her family, and 2. Paul makes stupid stories in the newsagent and scratches himself Head of swigs and many flies tie. I'd rather watch a show about fishing this movie - which will never be.
