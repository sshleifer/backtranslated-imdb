"Algie the miner" is a bad and uncomplicated mute comedy. The timing of the slapstick has ended completely. This is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they should be funny or not. The actual quality of the film is irrelevant. This is a compulsory consideration for those interested in film, especially because it is one of the earliest examples of gay cinema. The main character of Algie is a female type who behaves like the stereotypical "pansy" common in many early films. The film has the homophobic attitude of the time. "Algie the miner" is pretty awful, but fascinating from a historical perspective. (3/10)
