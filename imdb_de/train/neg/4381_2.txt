In short, this is one of the five worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not that they did not try. There was some decent writing with some structural elements, a good cast, a good acting. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some of the elements may have been a bad structure and no content story, too much of a leadership (who is probably much) better if you are aloof), some bad direction and editing. After about an hour I had enough, ripped my hair off after about an hour and a half, and was very upset about the hour and fifty minutes it was running. There was also some insincerity that I went with someone who used to be a heroin addict. He was excited that it enchanted something that had no good. This was underpinned by the pretty 17-year-old girl in love with the 30-year-old junkie. <br /> <br /> And the hectic nature of the guide was a turn-off enough. There were clunky plot points that were an attempt at structure, but the end result was listless and endless (with odd timelines). The characters were colorful but never ending, which made me feel bad for the quality actors you just have not seen enough. <br /> <br /> Skip it. I assumed that this was a first director in love with his own shit, but he did that before. I'm confused how these and many other really bad ideas find someone who actually gives them money.
