A little boy sees his mother killed and his father hanging himself. Twenty years later, he brings together a group of friends to exorcise himself so that he does not look like his father. All bearing marks are available: the nice couple; the "funny" guy; the robust (but delicate) hood; the smart girl (she wears glasses - that's how we know it); the nerd and two blondes without personality. It is a stupid wooden statue that brings to life (not ask) and kills people. I knew I was in trouble when we jumped in after a great opening scene 20 years later - ALL the bad horror movies do! Palmer - why Betsy?) And the murders are stupid and / or unimaginative. My favorite scene is when two people allegedly have sex and the statue hits the guy off the bed to show that he is fully dressed! A really bad, stupid incoherent horror movie. Avoid at all costs.
