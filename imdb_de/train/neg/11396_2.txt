The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a film that does not go directly into the Playboy channel. "The Hazing" borrows heavily from everything that came from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead before, but still manages to get along with enough humor to see it ... and hardly. The characters are made of cardboard, the dialogue is made of wood, the story is as thin as paper and the actors could not figure out a grocery bag. Put it all together and you have a pulpy mulch ball for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. To watch this movie is very similar. Chew for 90 minutes and you have a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.
