The 1960s were a time of change and departure for most people. Social upheavals and riots were the order of the day as people talked about their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity and drug use were among the daily tissues and daily news. This film has attempted to summarize these historical aspects in an entertaining film, and has been largely successful. Two families are persecuted in this film: one white and one black. In the first half of the film, history tracks every family on an equal footing in social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is almost devoted to the white family. Although there are more characters in this family, and the storylines are intermingled, but the racial aspects of this century are not equally considered material is mixed with colored and black and white original material to give the film a documentary feel. The film is a fiction, but excerpts from well-known historical figures are used to set the timetable. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, but the situations were predictable and the plot was one-sided.
