In 1454, in France, the magician Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) was beheaded and his lover Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) tortured to death, charged with witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, they curse the next generations of their executioners. Nowadays (in the 70s), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) go to a séance session with their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) the calling spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to drive to Villas de Sade, a rural Hugo estate in the countryside, to find a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the Fiend possesses them, bringing Mabille back to life and executing the locals in bloody sacrifices. After her father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers hiding the amulet of Thor's Hammer in a well; Together with Maurice they try to defeat the demonic Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. Last weekend I bought a box of horror genre with five DVDs by Paul Naschy for US $ 9.98; Although I had no references, I decided to take the chance. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a Trash B (or C) movie, which immediately reminded me of Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is revealed through terrific script, directing, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and edition, and with many naked women. The result is just funny and I can guarantee that Ed Woods style is back. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
