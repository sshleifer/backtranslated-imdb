Why, oh why can not anyone make a decent story out of a legendary movie? This is the second version of "Beowulf" that I have been disappointed with for a year. But I have to say, the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel" with Gerald Butler) was far superior to that. This one was just a bit disappointing. This is a mess !!! <br /> <br /> What annoyed me most? Was it the useless plot elements that they added for no particular reason (human sacrifice - meaningless love interests?), Or the bad CGI or the inconsistency of the characters, or the uninspired acting? Even worse was the way the beautiful Marina Sirtis looked so terrible !!! And do not let us even talk about this ridiculous crossbow? <br /> <br /> And why did they keep reminding us that Beowulf had the strength of thirty men, yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the movie. He was thrown around by the two monsters he had fought to rely on his buddies to save his bacon. Even when he struck the arrogant prince, he did not knock him out. He was too dependent on weapons. Beo-Wimp is more like that. This was certainly not the mighty Beowulf of the epic! <br /> <br /> I would like to end this with a positive result, but I can not really think of something. I can only say that if you have ever read "Beowulf" you will be infinitely disappointed with this gruff, inaccurate apology for customization!
