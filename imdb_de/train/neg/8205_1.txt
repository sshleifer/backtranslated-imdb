Very bad drama and a very flat story. Not Even a Decent B-Movie <br /> <br /> Events that were shocking as if people boarded an alien ship were boring and very lame. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst sci-fi I have ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch them because I like the genre, but it was so bad. <br /> <br /> Now there are really very few good movies to ALIEN, I think, because most of them have a low budget <br /> <br /> I give 3/10
