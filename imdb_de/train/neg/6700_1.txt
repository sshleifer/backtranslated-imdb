Is there a movement that is more intolerant and valuable than the environmental movement? For a young socialist kid who joins the circus, he must be as intimidating as getting into a real circus. Although these people usually outsource their minds to these important topics in Hollywood, Hollywood's teachings often seem fragmented and confusing. Fortunately, Ed is here to teach neo-hippies the art of environmental awareness. <br /> <br /> Here you learn the art of waving your finger against anyone without losing your trademark. They learn to shake off logic and science with strong arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that you are not interested in by calling it the gateway to the planetary Armageddon. <br /> <br /> In addition to lying straight, you also learn how to refuse accusations that distract you, no matter how much you are a hypocrite. You will be able to consume as much energy as Al Gore while people treat you as Amish. <br /> <br /> In the second season it was even more useful as we could visit other Hollywood gods, be holy your name, and check - ie judge - their lifestyle. NOTE: This is the only time a Envirofascist can judge another, as it allows victims to buy all sorts of expensive and trendy eco-toys so that they can put their finger on the faces of other people swinging <br /> What did Ed have in store for us in the third season? Maybe he teaches us how to judge when sleeping!
