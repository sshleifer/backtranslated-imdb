A worn-out conspiracy of a man taking the rap for a woman in a murder case, and the equally worn-out conspiracy of an outsider inside who is eventually shut out. In this case, one would think the movie would transcend its hackneyed provenance. Scene after scene, however, drones without change in intensity, without character arcs and inexplicable behavior. <br /> <br /> The topic of homosexuality was completely unnecessary - or completely unexplored. It just seemed to be included to tickle the audience. When will Hollywood learn that gay characters do not automatically make a more convincing picture? <br /> <br /> An unfortunate horrible movie. When will Lauren Bacall choose a good one? I expected better from her and Kristin Scott Thomas. This is definitely a miss.
