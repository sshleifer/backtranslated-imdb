After reading the reviews, it became obvious that everyone understood this work intellectually. How boring. Oh, how about the good old days and there was nothing like it. Of all the comments, no one expressed any support for this or any other work. <br /> <br /> I grew up shortly after the end of the Steam Age, and this cinematic jewel with Dan'l Boone graced the Samin√©es on Saturday afternoon. This was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with gaping, yapping, farting, giggling, snot monsters like myself or myself. At that time it was a cinema filler. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that any criticism contains anything about the plot. The only problem was that it was more of a template. Here goes. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) gathers friends and defeats the evil people. Hooray! <br /> <br /> Each of us children figured out this conspiracy before we shut down our quarters to look at it. That was about the storyline of every Scott, John Wayne and Roy Rogers movie ever made. If you take the time to review every single movie, do not ask for surprises. <br /> <br /> You have to remember the context of time. There was no or little TV. Nothing for children. There was school. It was the outdoors. There were toy guns. No cyber time. And the steam age had just collapsed. But movies like these made for entertainment and filled the imagination of young scavenger hunters. Even the girls got it. <br /> <br /> This movie was the entertainment. And it's just as pointless as anything that's produced today. It originally had a purpose to be propaganda. But fast became children's films. <br /> <br /> Our fathers had experienced the right thing. And it would not be until Sam Peckinpah a decade later that finally showered the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and abundant quantities. Someone died slowly, with great pain and pitiful, just before his direction. Until Peckinpah, war and shootings were a bloodless affair. Thanks Sam. <br /> <br /> To see a movie, he had little or no blood, the adults did not mind. They would not have tolerated it, I think. No courage spraying the shattering plant life. So this movie had all the honor and nothing of the flower. Gung Ho was then suitable for children. <br /> <br /> You will see that I gave this rating a four. Why should I do that? Well. It's a terrible movie. No matter how I love it. I love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood. But qualitatively, a movie is not so good. Basically, Gung Ho has become a romantic novel for children. <br /> <br /> Should people see it. Of course. I'm not saying stay away. Realistic, however. The plot is simple. The characters flat? They are shoals. You can love a bad movie.
