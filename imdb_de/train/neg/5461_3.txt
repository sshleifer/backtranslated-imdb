As with all cult TV shows, there is a group of people who love The Twilight Zone so much that they classify virtually every episode as the greatest shows of all time. While some of them are indeed wonderful classics, the truth is for every big episode, there were several that were mediocre and at least one stank. Like die-hard trekkies, these zone lovers insist they are all made of gold. In fact, it was me that initially made me repeat some episodes of a few cult series, rather than the films I normally watch. Very bad, it's bad for any reasonable standard. A widow observes a long procession of Civil War soldiers passing by her house. In the end, there is a very unexpected turn, and there is not much excitement or tension here.
