Overall, this movie is awful and should never have been done. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no connection to the audience and the characters. For example, if attacked, you want to say, "Oh my god, no!" Feel, but you do not. In this case, you do not care, because no link was created to know the character. In the trailer, it looked like the movie was great, but there is no reason, really. It might have been a mystery, but there is none. "Everything she has is a toolbox." It was said on the back of the DVD that you might think the movie was carefully planned and sent, but it's not the end, it was just awful, very straightforward and pointless. The action is either average or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion, it was a waste of an hour of my life. Also the "special effects" and sets were average, nothing special. There is not much blood or bloody violence, not much blood is shown. This movie was advertised to make it sound pretty amazing, but really, it's not even worth a search. I do not recommend it to anyone unless he is satisfied with some fighting and a boring story.
