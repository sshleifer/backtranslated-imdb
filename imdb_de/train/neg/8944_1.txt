I saw this movie last year in the media class and I have to say that I really hated it. I was in the 10th year (and at the age of 15), that may have something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the revolution, I think it's a terrible book, and I've hated it, and I think George Orwell is one of the most disturbed people in the world ever live on this planet. I'm sorry for those who loved his work, but unfortunately not. The themes in the film were well-presented, but the way the entire movie was set and the events that took place did not meet my standards. This is only my opinion and I am sure that many other people enjoyed this movie very much.
