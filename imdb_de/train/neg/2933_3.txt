If you've read the book - do not put your hopes up if you did not - read it and never watch the movie. It's strange to find out that Toby Young actually did a lot of writing the script (as he asserts himself in the book's aftermath). Because the film is very different from the book. <br /> <br /> What the film seems to aim for - a more thought-provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with simple, witty sarcasm and makes it so easy that everyone would do it - it does it Perfection. The movie is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for sitcoms and has lost any meaningful news it could have had. <br /> <br /> You're better off not seeing her.
