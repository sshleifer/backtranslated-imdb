If you've ever seen this movie, you know it! If you do not want to and do not want to watch a classic BAD movie, it's a good idea to watch this movie because it's rated the worst. If you are really bored, then rent it. If you want to know what it's like, here is a small summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a huge cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people. Adam does not like the way a passenger gets all babes, and he tries to play the role with the witty jokes. BUT WAIT! It only gets worse! You have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it really is.
