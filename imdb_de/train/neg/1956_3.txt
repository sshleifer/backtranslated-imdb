This movie has a redemption feature. At one point, after a character is attacked by an ax-wielding fairy, his brother asks him, "Why is your cock over there, Chuck?" After I had to endure almost an hour of bad movie, my alcohol almost came from my nose. <br/> <br /> Some of the plays are not that bad, but the kids all stink and PJ Soles should be ashamed of themselves for this movie. The story is weak and nobody does what you think (or what common sense dictates). There should of course be many story points that do not match. In one scene, for example, the ghosts of young children have a hard time concentrating to move a physical object so they can prove it exists. A difficult feat, as they obviously can not interact with physical matter. Minutes later, they pick up all the branches from the ground and beat the tooth fairy with them. Apparently they can sometimes move matter and sometimes not. Go to the picture. <br /> <br /> Much blood and courage, but ... some nice breasts. But that does not make up for the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie about the Tooth Fairy, you can rent Darkness Falls. I think it's great, although many other critics do not share my opinion. At least there is a mood.
