I saw Cabin By the Lake in the US this afternoon. Considering that this movie was made for television, it was interesting enough to see the sequel. Well, I stand in for the charisma tonight and was extremely disappointed. I knew that I would not like the movie, but I did not expect to be amazed by the use of DV (Digital Video). The film would have been bearable, if these juxtaposed digital recordings would not come from nothing. I expected the plot to be linked to those shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING POSSIBLE A SPOILER !!!!) The open end in Cabin on the Lake was acceptable, but the open end of the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee that Return of Return can be seen in the lodge at the lake, when the film was shown against nothing, but at infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.
