You can not imagine me looking forward to the king of the ants. As a massive Gordon fan I waited with angry anticipation for the European premiere. Especially because I loved Dagon - Gordon's last success - so much. The king of the ants had premiered here in my country, and Gordon himself had come to introduce it. Unfortunately, I could not congratulate him. The king of the ants is still uninspired and mediocre film. In fact, the quality level never exceeded the usual TV thriller standards. The action sketch is terribly routine and with the exception of some bad scenes, the typical Gordon touch is never recognized. The already weak script has more holes than a Swiss cheese bowl! It is a young would-be rogue who has committed a murder. So he does that. And of course they do not pay him. And of course he falls in love with the victim's wife. Mention her, and they're the only ones who remind you that you're still watching a movie by Stuart Gordon. The acting performances are below average with McCenna as a heroic lowlife, George `Norm Peterson 'Wendt as a chubby bastard and Kari Wuhrer as a kind hearted bombshell. Extremely illogical things happen all the time and the stupidity of the story becomes irritating very quickly, while the makeup effects do not even satisfy amateur horror fans. I read a few more comments on King of the Ants, claiming it's Gordon's best because it's finally a thought-provoking and mature movie. Well, if that is so much. Well, I think every good director will eventually have the power and inspiration. Too bad it overcame Stuart Gordon.
