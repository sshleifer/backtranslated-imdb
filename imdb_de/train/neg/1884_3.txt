Fragmentary film about a few people in Austria during a heatwave. This kind of movie has been done more often and above all better. The stories have nothing to do with each other, except for the pathetic finale: "Humans are cruel." Ugly flesh, unpleasant people, and a movie that's run way too long without really saying anything ... Ultra-realistic? Hardly ... boring? Indeed. Not even the beautiful Franzisca Weiss can save this! 3.10
