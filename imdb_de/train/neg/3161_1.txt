Much of "Over Her Dead Body" is so painless that I wiggled out of embarrassment for the actors in my seat. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proves that she can not wear a movie in this horrible romantic comedy, and besides that she does not even have a comedy timing. It is annoying and annoying, like a ghost returning to earth to prevent a clipped clairvoyant from engaging her widower. The fianc√© is played by Paul Rudd without comforting or charm, while the clairvoyant is played by Lake Bell, who brings to the movie any anemic energy he has. Bell was most sorry for me because she seems to have weird skills and worked overtime to get the material working. Unfortunately, she faces the insurmountable task of producing any film in which Jason Biggs is bearable, and like the rest of the cast, like Leo DiCaprio, she is swept along at the end of "Titanic." <br /> <br /> "Over Her Dead Body" really impressed me because of his laziness and lack of effort. I started to think about all the interesting projects that can not be financed because huge amounts of money are put into this stupid crap. Seriously, does Hollywood think that movies like these are good enough? How stupid do you really think the audience is in the cinema? <br /> <br /> Note: F
