I just watched this movie last night and as someone who initially had very low expectations he was still disappointed. The most blatant flaw in this vile movie is that the main point (the guy awake during the surgery) had NOTHING to do with the result. It would still have been finished in the same way. What was the point of it? Who knows. This surgeon also had four complaints against him, and he did not believe that people would ask questions if a patient died at his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely talentless and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was ridiculous from start to finish. I'm pretty sure if you could cut someone through the chest with a scalpel, you'd be in more pain.
