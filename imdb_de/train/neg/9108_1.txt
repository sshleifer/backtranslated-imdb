This so-called prequel is just a badly made remake for a better version of Dangerous Liasons. The illustrations are the same as in most scripts. I loved the book that came out of it, and I loved the first movie, but I will not even go into the third movie. The pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal, and ... I just can not stress how bad the movie was. If you do not want to take my word for it, just look at it and you'll see what I mean. If you've read a review that says, "If you like the first one, you'll love the second." The only reason is that it is the same movie! Although the plot is not even that good. They recorded so many lines from the first movie. It's hard to say which movie you're watching right now.
