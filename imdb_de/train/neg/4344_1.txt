If you hit yourself on the head with a shovel, write the script with your feet, and you may be approaching the intelligence level of this movie. There is nothing in this film that has not been done a thousand times in other gangster films and made much better. Those who think that "Scarface" was a kind of hero for whom you saw or saw "Goodfellas," "Menace II Society" or "Dead Presidents," and thought MMM "This is life for me!" will like this movie. I thought I would give the film a chance because the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after seeing that Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs were involved. Anyone over the age of 4 sees the original with Pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.
