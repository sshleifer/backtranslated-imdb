At the time, I remembered seeing stupid Nintendo Power comics that had the same artwork as this show ... and then came the news that this show was coming to a TV near me! I was not shrewd, but curious ... I was curious how bad this show would be. My friends all said that this show had no real meaning and was too stupid for people like me (I'm actually gay), so I decided to see the show with low expectations. <br /> <br /> WHAT A DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First, I hate the new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and I hate how many fans drool over Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how she made Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his name was) a good guy who owned a restaurant. Bad move, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing more than a loser of King Dedede (who is really fun on this show), and I hate the face of this one company that provides Dedede with those terrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> I started hating Kirby even more, as it was obvious that Nintendo only wanted to give Kirby some popularity. Kirby will never beat Mario in the fight for coolness, and Kirby will always be just a tiny, creamy gush. NUF SAID !!!
