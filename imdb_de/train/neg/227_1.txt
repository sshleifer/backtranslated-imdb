Was that a comedy or a serious drama? This film begins with a carefree banter between three women. Fine. There is a conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are a few antics between them. Fine. However, as the plot gets fatter and eventually turns black, I began to wonder if I had misinterpreted the first part of the film. It continues in that direction for a while, until it finally tries to return to the original carefree banter. But now it is too late. It's hard to understand why these women are still talking to each other and the finale is unconvincing. Really a lesson (for British filmmakers) how not to make films. Hard to see how the producers ever convinced themselves that this movie would work. And the box office turned out to be a real flop because I had never heard of this movie until the weekend (four years after its release).
