Slaughter High is the story of the revenge of a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinematic history. Unfortunately, after the promising opening, the strip went straight to hell. A very boring and superfluous mess with mediocre strikes and a last half hour that sucked on a whole new level. The guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the release of the strip. If you want to borrow the strip, stop it after the prank and remember to choose life.
