This bomb is just one "explosion" after another, without humor and only in absurd situations. Really, pyrotechnics to the utmost. Reality is not one of her strengths. I gave a 1 out of 10 points. I would have zeroed it, but this option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But sometimes we all need money. And I was still shying about Mars on this Tim Burton farce. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that this was a turkey. But if that was a turkey, then this movie is not even a gizzard. I wish I could say, "Give me my money back." You can bet I could do it if I could. But that's the problem with premium services, the subscription variety.
