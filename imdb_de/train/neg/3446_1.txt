This film on paper looked like it might be good after seeing that this movie was totally awful !! The plot has no meaning, and I think I've counted the best part of the 5000 cut scenes that make the movie more boring and ridiculous. I saw how this late night was black and no sounds, just to complement the SCARINESS, but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music. This movie summarizes what's wrong with this type of movie. To be honest, do not say more, but look at your own risk. This movie is just garbage, ENJOY !!
