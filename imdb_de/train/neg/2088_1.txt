What a terrible show. Science fiction fans seem to see everything regardless of the quality. It shocks me that something out of the ordinary like Firefly goes on for a season, while garbage like the Battlestar Galactica remake triggers a spin-off. This secession is pathetic in every way. Acting is youthful and uninspired. The characters are cardboard stereotypes of everything that has ever been in a bad sci-fi series. The story is bad. The dialogue is worse than a soap opera. The direction is bad and the sets are awful. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and effort. This is a spin-off that should never have been done.
