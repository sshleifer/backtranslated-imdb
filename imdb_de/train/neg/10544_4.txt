When the childhood memory tells you, this was a scary movie; it's touch and go if you should visit it again. Anyway, I remembered a scary scene featuring a homeless man and a cool villain of Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is not a very good movie, unfortunately. It's full of those cop cliches and a very bad script with holes a truck could drive through (along with countless practical "twists" that make the story work). Lou Diamond Phillips is the over-confident cop who sends serial killer Kober into the gas room to find out he was himself a Minion of Satan and now has the power of resurrection, along with the ability to possess any weak mindshe comes across Mixture of a very poorly realized psychic who helps with the case. Ahhh, that's garbage. But as such pleasing, especially if you have good memories of it. It scared me as a kid and this scene with the homeless guy is still pretty good. As for any kind of logic here; Forget it, almost every scenario is thrown in for a good reason and ends up being a mixture of a Steven Segal action movie and a '70s movie with demons. And who would have thought it would be a good idea to lead Lou Diamond Phillips here? Needless to say that he does not convince at all, but he tries his best and I have never had a problem with the man who seems to have so many reviewers here. With respect to Tracy Griffith as a prophet, the less the better. But Kober is pretty good as a murderer; I always liked this actor. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" could be exactly what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and "brain shutting down" is required. Beer will most likely enhance the viewing experience, and I will definitely have a lot of it when I shoot this movie next time. All in all; not a good streak, but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as children. "See you soon, buddy boy"!
