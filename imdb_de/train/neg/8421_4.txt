Funny that I feel compelled to review this movie, but here I am. <br /> <br /> I'm checking it because I recently had the resuscitation of R.C. could experience. Sheriff's play "Journey's End" on stage in New York, at the Belasco Theater, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others and a masterful director David Grindley. I left the band's theater shattered. I'm not exaggerating, I was dumbfounded. After nearly two and a half hours of a replica and very claustrophobic representation of the soldier's life in the trenches of the Somme (I speculate) during the First World War, which was brought to life alive by all those involved, I came with the theater from the theater shakes. <br /> <br /> Mind you, I'm not easily shocked or too sensitive. I myself am a stage actor and director, so I know that the buttons are pressed to produce certain effects, both emotionally and psychologically. But what I had just witnessed came to life so much that I had shivers leaving the spine. <br /> <br /> None of these emotions came to life, while "Aces High," the film based on this game and even adapted for the screen, was screened in collaboration with RC Sheriff himself just before he died , <br /> <br /> Screen customization takes place in the sky over France. So the claustrophobic atmosphere is gone at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The only pluses of the movie are the aerial combat scenes, which are outdated in their special effects compared to today's standards, but still very valid are the flying tactics that were applied to the screen. <br /> <br /> Granted, there were a few screenshots of "All Quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque, held in trenches rather than in the sky. But that was the "German" vision of things, if you want to be picky about such things. <br /> <br /> "Journey's End" is just the other side of the coin and would have made it a great movie if they'd left it alone and stayed intact. <br /> <br /> The transfer to DVD is poor, although in widescreen and adjusted for 16: 9 screens quality is the quality of the film itself is cinema. Not more, not less. It has several shortcomings, such. For example, minor scratches and dots, though the copy is clean for the rest. <br /> <br /> If you want to have another WWI movie in your collection, especially for those who love and want to see aerial battles between vintage cars, then this is a picture for you. However, I would rather suggest "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, although this too is a film full of inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you, who loves good acting and drama, I would go out of this. Buy the game. Watch the game if you have the chance to get a decent revival in your area, but stay away from this possible adjustment. <br /> <br /> It's an anti-war movie that is granted, but the weakest I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors like Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud is just a bluff as they are seen to be very weak and very weak. Short cameo roles throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> McDowell, the very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, all perform very poorly, not because of their lack of skills, but rather because of the lack of true and solid direction. <br /> <br /> There are too many gaps, and as I said, it draws to a dubious end. Ambiguous because none of the men we are familiar with and sympathize with live in the original play. They are all killed in a deadly and futile mission. In the movie, they all die, except for Malcolm McDowell, who manages to stay alive for another day. He is the wing commander of the unfortunate group, only to receive three more pilots who die and die for another lost cause. The end of the game leaves a naked stage in total darkness. You only hear the cannon noise, the machine guns rattle and grenades hit the whole theater. Then suddenly total peace and quiet. The curtain opens. Lighting. And here they are all. Strung, straight and rigid. Obedient bodies ... <br /> <br /> Far more interesting and far more shocking than the final "Aces High", which is also pulled from the hair. <br /> <br /> It's up to you to judge that. <br /> <br /> If I had the money and the contacts, I would take the piece and develop it as it was intended. Add an action scene here and there in the field, just to imagine the "outside" horror and slaughter in the "vast fields of France" around the involved men, but then focus strictly on what's happening these tiny ones "Cabin" on the edge of reason and the world ... <br /> <br /> Do you want such a movie? <br /> <br /> Then ask for it. <br /> <br /> That's not it
