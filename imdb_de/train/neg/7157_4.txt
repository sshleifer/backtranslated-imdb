1. watched 26.5.2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Comic story about a druid witch trying to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. At least I think that was the relationship. A kind of eerie quality is not held in this film other than Stephen King's The Shining. The difference is that Nicholson's performance had campiness that does not happen in this movie at all. This is taken very seriously until the end, when some lame singles and attempts to lighten the mood do not work at all. The performances are not the problem here, but the story is. Everything does not seem to come together very smoothly, and the viewer has a lot of information and no real understanding of what happened in the movie. There is a very small throwing performance of Christopher Walken as Uncle's granddaughter, which of course gives him a top bill for selling the movie. Do not buy into this gimmick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
