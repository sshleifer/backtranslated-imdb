This movie is awful. In the end, you will find that your life has been stolen for several hours that you can not get back. The "twist" end is very thoughtful. The character development that leads to this end does not coincide with their final actions at the conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation - with the premise that the Rob Lowe character will die on Christmas Eve - is explained in literally ninety seconds to "No, we just betrayed you". Then the Rob Lowe character is not even upset! "I'll forgive you, if you can forgive me," he is as angry as he gets. If someone needed weeks to convince me that I was about to die and then said, "No, I'm sorry, I was just fooling you," I would raise a grave hell. I do not feel bad about giving away the spoiler because maybe I could save some of you from watching. Please save and do NOT watch this movie.
