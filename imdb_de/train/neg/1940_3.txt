The writing of the journalists and the required, zealous, reckless press spokesman and the sobbing grandmother were committed with fists and clich√©s. <br /> <br /> I can not blame the actors Say that! "<br /> <br /> This episode had a press perspective and a police perspective, while the police perspective was standard, the press outlook and characterization was exaggerated and exaggerated in insulting places. <br /> <br I notice that this is an HBO If so, then the stereotypes of sledgehammers can be explained in this light. <br /> <br /> I was in complete panic during the press conference scene, lacking credibility and not ringing remotely. After 40 minutes in the first episode, I'm still waiting for the suspense. <br /> <br /> Skip Five Daysthis. The 2008/9 production with these characters is far better and more exciting, even if the crime is over the top History had unforgiveable moments that can only be described as amazingly incredible. For a press secretary who launches a press conference without attending investigators, press questions to answer. <br /> <br /> So unbelievable that it feels like an amateur lesson. <br /> <br /> I started looking for journalists called "Scoop" and for Perry White to perform. <br /> <br /> I saw the 2009 Hunter "five days ago" when he came to Australia, unaware that it was a prequel, and looked forward to Bonneville and McTeer going around again. <br /> <br /> Head shaking terribly.
