I give this movie a 1 because the IMDb rating system does not contain negative numbers. This movie was awful. It was played very badly, the story was written poorly, the action was incredible. I doubt that the Salvation Army could fight as badly as the troops in this film. I will not write plot spoilers because the movie is simply not good enough for plot spoilers. Writing comments in the plot would be pointless. If I compared this movie, I would have to compare it to Reign of Fire. Although I did not like Reign of Fire, this movie was at least better than this one. <br /> <br /> Some of the people in the theater who were left before the movie was half finished. The only reason I did not do that was because I just did not think about it. I hoped for a CGI party and fought masterfully, but that's not what happened. The martial arts lasted every 30 seconds and that was very disappointing of an exercise routine during the flashback scene. The CGI was not well done either. A scene comes to mind. During one of the earlier tank battles the troops shoot up ... nothing. Someone forgot to call the animation guys in this movie, so the street was totally vicious. I also think that the voice of the bad man was synchronized by the voice of Imotep from the Mummy movies. Had the same shrill echo happened. (Somebody owed some royalties here?) Since I mentioned the fight scene, I say yes, that could be considered as spoiler, but only for the purists, I think, do not buy the DVD when it comes out. You were warned.
