I thought it was at least aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, overbearing and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are a few decent songs, but in the end there is a song that only comes from "Yaowwww!" while someone happens to knock on a wooden object. Other than that, there are some pretty songs, but it's not worth the while to see the movie over. Go to itunes (they have the album), preview and select the good ones. <br /> <br /> Half of the movie is a guy who cooks tea. Well, that's a slight exaggeration. But you will see what I mean when you see it. Apart from that: DO NOT SEE IT!
