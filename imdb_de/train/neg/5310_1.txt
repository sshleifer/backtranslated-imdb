I do not know what this other review has been talking about. This is definitely not a Bimbo movie. I do not think there was a decent-looking girl. No, it's just a cheesy, poorly made Ed Wood-style sci-fi hit. And it is bad. I can not tell you how bad it is. I saw it on the cable late in the evening and I was shocked. The fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to all of us. The actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke and the tempo is incredibly slow. For me the music comes first. A monkey could write a better topic with a toy xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on the cable, pay attention. You'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be.
