Imagine transforming the American national anthem into a cartoon. Add a few cute animals, some awful puns and a pair of roller skates, and you'd almost see an exact copy of this movie. I remember seeing that when I was younger; I rented my mom's video about five times. The story itself is not so bad, it's just that any Marxist who is watching would certainly have something to complain about. <br /> <br /> If you do not like America, you will not like this movie.
