There are a few nice shots in this film, it captures some landscapes with such a beautiful light, in fact, cinematography is probably the best asset. <br /> <br /> But it's basically more of a TV-themed movie, and although there are many twists and turns in the plot, which makes the viewing pretty interesting, there are no subtitles and important developments in the plot unveiled in Spanish, so that non-Spanish speaking people get a little lost. <br /> <I had it as a Christmas present as it's a family trait to work through the films of an actor we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was just awesome in "A Time To Kill" and "The Newton Boys" Me said I wanted to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> Although the DVD box says it's a Matthew Mconaughey movie, it's used as a marketing ploy. He has a few lines and can be seen on the screen At the end of the film, he is not exactly minutes long, he is basically an extra and he does not light the screen exactly while he is running, so the hard fans are worthwhile from this point of view the ally does not. <br /> <br /> The movie star Patrick McGaw is great and very eye-friendly, and his character is just so nice and gracious and caring, a true saint of a guy he would have written well in a ROM. <br /> <br /> So for real mcconaughey acting brilliance from those I've seen, I'd recommend "A Time to kill", "The Newton Boys" "Frailty", "How to Make a Guy in 10 Days loses "," Edtv "and" Amistad "and also avoid" Larger Than Life "and" Angels in the Outfield ", unless you feel like a children's movie kids nearby, as neither of them indicates his talent, But entertaining films for children are, again, MM is really nothing more than a supporting artist with only a few or a few lines. <br /> <br /> Like Scorpion Springit's not a bad movie, but it's not a screen robbery either.
