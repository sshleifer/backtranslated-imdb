Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to ridiculing a lot of rabbis who invent distorted machines to circumvent the Sabbath rules, he does not really attack Judaism and seems angry when a rabbi actually challenges the existence of the state of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to his logical conclusion, he would realize that the founding of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so-called "sacred books" of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete and total lack of objectivity or focus in creating this film. <br /> <br /> I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even so intelligent. Anyone can go to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their faith, but what do you have in return for them? Nowhere does he tell them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes him the "rational" person in the room? In a way, it reflects how he really does not feel and looks just as stupid as these people. <br /> <br /> If you have a good movie / documentary about the real evils of religion and how can religion actually be detrimental to human civilization? See Richard Dawkins' Root of All Evil? on. It is a brilliantly researched documentary that clearly outlines what he wants to achieve and how. Bill Maher's Religulous is not funny, it does not raise interesting questions and it does not give insight into such a controversial topic. It seems to be the shouting of an old man dissatisfied with his Catholic education. I'm almost sorry for him.
