It was all that was not it: it had pace, pop and actors who were not afraid to chew the scenery. It also had a decent script. This had scratched my head. If Farrah does not really care about a career, why does she have a manager (and why is he wasting his time)? If Kate and Barney are "artists," why sign up for the Mother of All Jiggle shows (like the movie "Brady Bunch," in which Robert Reed wants to do Shakespeare just to find himself on BB)? They were not industrial names, but they did not really starve. And while they got the story right (the poster was released before Farrah got the show), Silverman rejects the pitches for "Funniest Home Videos" and "American Idol" and Spelling promises that his girl Tori will one day appear to be a show Creating for her will not happen. <br /> <br /> What bothered me was how Spelling's role is distorted. He was shown as a showrunner and creator when he was not one. And how he "comes up" with the "idea" for CA is ridiculous! <br /> <br /> How did Spelling and Goldberg enforce Farrah's verbal contract when the others were signed? And why did not Farrah or Bernstein say she was leaving, not because she had discovered her Inner Diva, but because majors wanted her? When trying to create conflict and tensions by posing Farrah as a "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), it fails because the groundwork has never been done - here's the picture of the "Three's Company".
