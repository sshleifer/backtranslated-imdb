This film was o.k. but it could have been much better. There are some scary moments, but there are not enough of them to watch this movie again and again. There are some scenes that will make you move fast and miss nothing. The biggest mistake is that it is so predictable. That's why I rated it so low. It can be seen, but do not expect anything great.
