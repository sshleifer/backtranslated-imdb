I've awarded these two stars for the incredible DV sharpness that gives their character's cold and dark sterility. That was generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This movie fails on all accounts. I can not recommend that because it is neither poetic nor dull. Neither dramatic nor exciting. Neither controversial nor ordinary. It's just a pathetic junk that no horror or exploit fan can recommend in good faith. , .Please just stay away from this horrible product. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
