When talking about great director / actor combinations, the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson are usually not mentioned. Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two ranges from really good action entertainment to mediocre. Unfortunately, Kinjite: Forbidden topics in the latter. <br /> <br /> This is sad because Kinjite could have been much better. But for my life I do not understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese woman, a guy who is used to getting cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage is used up. That might have been good for another movie, but it had no purpose. <br /> <br /> An uncomplicated police drama with Charles Bronson as a deputy cop who has seen a bit too much in his work and a strong prejudice against Orientals. This part could have explained a bit too. But he'll have to overcome it if he and the patient partner Perry Lopez want to find a captured Japanese schoolgirl. Bronson's time in the vice squad has told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A stylish, murderous pimp, played by Jaime Fernandez, is the guy, and he and Bronson have a story. In the best scene of the film, Bronson had him eat an expensive Rolex watch and set his car on fire. At some point, Fernandez discovers Bronson and Lopez in a deli for the whole night. He sprays his Rolex snack with an Uzi killing everyone except Bronson and Lopez. I really think this little incident after Fernandez would have had more than a few LAPD deputy police officers. But that's another terrible big hole in the storyline. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, in the end, Fernandez has a very rough justice. I wish the whole movie would have been better. This was the last film by the Bronson Thompson team and most recently the director of J. Lee Thompson. He should have gone out with something better.
