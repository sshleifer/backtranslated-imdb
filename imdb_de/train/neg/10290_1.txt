I bought Bloodsuckers on Ebay some time ago. I looked at parts and it was just too stupid to check again. The excessive amount of watery "blood" at the beginning is simply outdated - not to mention the "whips" - wind noise. My friends and I made a super-low-budget movie, and the effects still surpassed this crap festival. <br /> <br /> There are far too many to count in terms of the number of mistakes in this film. I knew one of the actors - Believe it or not, he was my THEATER teacher. HA! <br /> <br /> Final Conclusion: Do not mess with this "horror" sting. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (out of a possible 73)
