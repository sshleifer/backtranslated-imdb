I've given these 3 stars out of 10 possible stars - because the stories are open and unexplained, and because of the nauseating scenes in which someone eats extremely disgusting, and scenes of a rotting corpse. <br /> <br /> None of the above things had to be shown in such a graphic way. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie as it is relates to three loosely connected stories, none of which satisfactorily concludes. The Bounty Hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is the character that connects all three vignettes together. First, we Dylan McDermott, who looks damned good looking as a wanted criminal escapes to Mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter as he rides through a frontier town and discovers a sad saloon girl by Helen Hunt. Then we have one of the Hemingway girls, not sure who plays a western woman on the lonely border, who goes to a neighbor, an attractive redhead, whom we soon know she was traveling too long in the wastelands. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, with the final scene of the film being completely rational.
