The plot of this movie was not just about the ease with which the two psychos could hijack a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat, but it was a terrible rip-off of 'Misery'. The main reason why I rated this movie so low, however, was that it absolutely disgusted me. <br /> <br /> I'm not someone who is slightly shocked by what the filmmakers point out, and has always had a penchant for horror flicks, but this movie ran too far out of sheer force and torture, just to score for the To get shock factor. I think most people, if they only look at the first ten minutes of Hide Seek ', is looking for the remote.
