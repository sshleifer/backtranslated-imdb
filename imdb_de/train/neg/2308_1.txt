OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg stood next to Danny Glover, parodying the famous farmer and his wife. Then put this baby in the DVD player and all hope is lost in less than five minutes. Supposedly a comedy. And I have to admit that I laughed about ten minutes before the end. This movie has the following elements: A battered and maltreated neighbor next door, a boring process, racism, talk of lynching and death and arson. Hilarious, right? No, please, if you never listen to someone else's reviews, please do so here. You can not even force yourself to look at this crap. CRAP! I said it, CRAP! Anyone who carries names there should in fact complain.
