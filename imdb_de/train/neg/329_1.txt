First, I bought it in the video library. Second, I saw it. Third, it was boring. Fourth, it was not funny. Fifth, most of the antics were lame. And last but not least: It is not only a bad movie, but also a total fiasco. <br /> <br /> I am a big Adam Sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten movie. I'm sorry because it was his first movie. Even if you're a big Adam Sandler fan, you should not watch this movie. Instead, just take the video, board a yacht, and throw it overboard.
