Deceptive Advertising ... I've seen a commercial for Carlito's Way: Rise to Power, which states "From Scarface Producer and Carlitos Way" for Scarface. Not taking away from Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion, he should have had a little more class. I think I can speak for the masses when I say ... We hate being lied openly. As for the movie, it was bad at best. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Although Luis Guzman should be ashamed of working on this film. Overall, this film has not done a good job and filled in the gaps for Carlito's Way. It's obvious that this project was an attempt to make a fast movie instead of making a good movie.
