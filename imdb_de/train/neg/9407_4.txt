"Houseboat Horror" is often regarded as the worst Australian movie ever made and described as a typical Slasher movie. He was awarded the "See the Film That Can not Get an Academy Award" graduation death by Burned Maniac as they try to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback. Bad act and written Slasher stripes with tensionless and annoying characters. The throats are cut off and a woman is killed with a horseshoe. If you like cheesy Slasher movies, you can try it, but you have been warned. At least it's better than the Swedish "The Bleeder" .4 out of 10.
