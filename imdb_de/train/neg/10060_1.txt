The author goes on a "journey of discovery" of his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the (completely and rightly forgotten) movie "Bright Leaf" is about one of his ancestors. It's not like that, and he does not discover anything of a mild interest in this absolutely stupid and selfish, glorified home movie, which is suitable for showing at the (drama) drunken family reunion, but certainly not for commercial or not commercial publications. A good reminder why most independent films are not recorded by big studios - because they are boring and irrelevant and are of no interest to anyone but the director and his immediate circle. Avoid at all costs!
