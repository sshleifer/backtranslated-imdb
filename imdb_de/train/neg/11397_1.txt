That was really terrible! It had a terrible plot, was poorly played, and was like an amateur remake of the evil dead, but not nearly as good. <br /> <br /> It took all my tenacity to get through it, it's a good job I did not have to go to the bathroom, otherwise I doubt I would come back! This makes Hammer House of Horror like a Hollywood epic on a big screen. <br /> <br /> The only value of this film was the endless supply of beautiful women. No worse among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to browse the beer with your friends after a night, then this is the thing for you ... otherwise avoid it like the plague!
