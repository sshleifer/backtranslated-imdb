As a single woman over 40, I found this movie, for single women over 40, extremely insulting and humiliating, not to mention any other woman of any age. It was a sad, pitiful attempt by a man to write and conduct a "chick movie" and he failed miserably. Andy McDowell is not a big actress at first, but given the nonexistent "conspiracy" (I hate even calling her a conspiracy), she had no chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy for the characters and no attempt to make the film realistic or credible in any way. And then there is the compulsory male fantasy of an attractive, straight woman who suddenly decides to try lesbianism - PLEASE. <br /> <br /> Not only, I wish I could get my money back for the DVD, I too I want the 112 minutes of my life back. What a rip off.
