"Show me your boobies!" is not funny and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons, if you know where I come from. I do not want my 6 and 7 year old daughters to think or hear this way. I find it sad that Nick hypeed that crap so much and then we get it, stupid little kids who behave like stupid adults. I know it's supposed to be humorous, but remember, we have cute little innocent girls in K and 1st grade who can not wait to see this. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw it. My daughters will not see it. I'd like to block Nick, but I do not have the heart at this point, but if Nick keeps putting that kind of crap out, I have to do that.
