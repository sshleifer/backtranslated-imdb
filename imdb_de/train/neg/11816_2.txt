It is unlikely that you will lose yourself in frozen space for 15 years. Falling into a star ... unlikely. By the day it falls into the supernova and explodes ... ridiculous. To be rescued by a ship ... priceless. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Zaphod Beeblebrox's Heart of Gold to the rescue. It is also not parent of the year. After sentencing her daughter to two years of solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship, the mother encourages her to get drunk and leave alone with the strange man they have taken. This is a sign that they can fight in the hand, which is the bulk of the action of the film. One of the highlights of the fight, for example, is the psycho speaking face-to-face with a woman as he blindly points the weapon at the other person about fifteen centimeters away, who meddles in the firing line. At the end, the three-headed family leaves Metropolis big ship, with which she wanted to watch the supernova, until the last moment, because it is too slow to escape the blast, instead to use the psycho's battleship, which they have refueled within a minute with 1600 pounds of propellant gas from one 0.7-kiloton missile. You have to love these tough science fiction stats! <br /> <br /> As long as Hollywood treats writing as irrelevant bells and whistles, they will continue to make films that do not run in the sci-fi channel at 3 o'clock in the morning.
