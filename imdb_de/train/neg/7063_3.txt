The guy did a lot of drafting for a bunch of movies, and one day he said; I should pick a cheap scenario, try to put as many titles in the can as possible (because I'm a title designer after all) and try to convince people that this is actually a movie. One of the worst I've ever seen is for sure. If you feel the need to see beautiful titles, you should not waste a few posters. <br /> <br /> It's kind of ironic. Do not you think, have you seen the poster? The only part of his project where SHOULD had the title work had almost none!
