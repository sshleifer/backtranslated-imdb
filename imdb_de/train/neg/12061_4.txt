Charles Bronson plays as Lt Crowe a policeman who declares war on a dwarf named Duke (Juan Fernandez). He abducts the daughter of a Japanese businessman who is the man who sexually molested Crowe's daughter (Amy Hathaway). While Kinjite is not for everyone, it's a bit of a disturbing storyline, but it's well done and indeed entertaining.
