Robert Forster, usually a very strong character actor, got lost at sea. He was a New York family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a house invasion. Creepy theme exploited for cheap fate in the "Death Wish" era. It's not difficult to make fun of these dingy procedures: the dialogue is full of roarers, the crime statistics are irretrievably obsolete and the minor characters are ridiculously over-written (especially a vile judge who allows an accused murderer to go straight out of the house go to the courtroom). The production of low rents is contemptible in its self-righteousness, especially since the violence in our cities has only increased. * from ****
