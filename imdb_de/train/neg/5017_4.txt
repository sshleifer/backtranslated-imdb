I just finished this movie ... saw it in the video rack and as a Nick Steel fan I just had to hire it. To be honest, it probably should have stayed on the shelf. The concept was interesting and there were some pretty clever twists, but somehow I appreciated almost everyone before they came. And in the end, in my opinion, the movie went a little too far ... If you have to look at it at a glance, you'll see what I mean! <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Nick Stahl's acting was great (especially considering what he had to work with). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but he always plays the same kind of character ... too much Paul Finch from "American Pie" gets by for my taste. <br /> <br /> And finally the worst part of this movie It has to be January Jones' emotionless performance ... I think in Hollywood really only a pretty face counts.
