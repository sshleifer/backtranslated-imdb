As a poker lover, I was looking forward to seeing this movie, especially since Scotty Nyugen was in it. <br /> <br /> Basically, Scotty Nyugen's short spots in this movie have all that to offer. </ The characters are unlikely and annoying, the soundtrack is awful and the plot, well, there's no DVD box after twenty minutes, I was so bored. Actually, it's just a shame that Nyugen was in this movie, otherwise I would not have bought $ 16 on Ebay. <br /> <br /> Take it from me - AVOID 7 7 2 Offsuit !!! Dire :(
