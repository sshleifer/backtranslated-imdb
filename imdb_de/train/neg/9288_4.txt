Half Past Dead with Steven Seagal in the lead role was a big B hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel, an action movie that loses nothing but does not have the ability to win. It's less entertaining than the first: in every way. But it is worth a look. If you like action movies or just want to see something during a popcorn session; If you would like to see former WWE stars on screen or even see sequels, even if they are direct or not. Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below average, he did not do a job. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did the job, but nothing amazing, anything but okay. <br /> <br /> Technical details, well, a Sony production can not be great. The cinematography was a disaster, but the direction was acceptable overall. Whatever, just look at it if you want. If you take care, you lose nothing. But if you do not ... well, you will not lose either.
