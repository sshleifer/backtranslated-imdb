How is it possible that a movie can be made so bad? Bad Action Bad script. Just an embarrassment around. This is just a bad clich√© after another. <br /> <br /> This movie actually has some big stars. Unfortunately they are singers and not actors. <br /> <br /> This film has hardly earned any money for good reason. The charm of black cowboy movies just does not exist. It's a shame they did not have a good story to tell. <br /> <br /> There are some big stars in this movie.
