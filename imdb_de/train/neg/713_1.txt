First of all, let me say that I felt so much about this movie that I specifically signed up to IMDb to review it. And my review? This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The summary of the film sounded interesting - Nazis, occultism, time travel, etc., but the film did not bring all of these together. Remember the episode of South Park, where manatees were written with "idea balls"? Did these manatees also write unholy? It's as if the author wanted to include all these different ideas, but had no idea how to connect them all together, and to make things even less meaningful, a Donnie Darko esquire time-travel theme became the Added end that disrupted the chronology. <br /> <br /> I realized early on that this was a bad movie. Special effects were too low for something better than directly on DVD. The acting was not great, but in fairness I have seen worse. I'll praise the Nazi images, they were scary, but the evil Nazi butcher was just a comedian. <br /> <br /> I have no vendetta against this movie or anything, but to be honest, I'm not even into the horror genre. However, this movie can not be called a thriller or a drama. If this story was well told, it would have been a good movie. But it was overdone. Waaaaay overhyped.
