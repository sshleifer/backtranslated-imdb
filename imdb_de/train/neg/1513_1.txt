The Flock is not really a movie. It's a wannabe movie with would-be actors. Apart from Richard Gere, he did not perform well, but if only one of the performers really cares about his character and the rest of the cast is just acting, the result is as pathetic as this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you are acting. What the hell did Claire Dains do here ?! She is the least suitable actress for this character. In 99.9% of the movie she looked extremely out of place, not everything !! The only thing she did was ask silly questions like "Do you really think so?", And made stupid faces. Her acting has embarrassed me, and I've always liked her ... She's the romantic type of film, I do not know who she chose among all the actresses ... seeing LOL and Avril Lavigne ?! That really made me laugh. Anyway ... If you want to feel like you're throwing up, this movie will do the job for you !!! I wish I could vote -5.
