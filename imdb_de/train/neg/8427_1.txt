Let me first say how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man, seemingly unable to fulfill his dreams due to his presumptuous, manipulative father, it was incredibly carefree and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is undoubtedly one of the biggest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my 10 out of 10 points without reservation. <br /> <br /> But this movie spin-off is a true tragedy in the truest sense of the word. Hardly any part of the TV show is successfully transferred to the film. This movie has a very bleak, depressing tone that has almost moved me to tears on several occasions. Seeing Harold get beaten up in a pub (and not in a weird way) is not my idea of ​​comedy, but definitely a reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The film was painfully not very funny except for the scene in which Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbor. This film has always taken the trouble to watch the TV series. In the television series, Harold always went for respectable girls, not strippers. <br /> <br /> Albert's reactions to the remarks that Harold's girlfriends made against him were absolutely priceless in the TV series. In the film, Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity presents itself. <br /> <br /> Most movie spin-offs on British sitcoms are pretty boring, with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES movies (seen in some countries) respect was actually better than the TV series itself !). STEPTOE AND SON, however, must be at the bottom of the pile, even under GEORGE AND MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice - skip this and revisit the second spin-off of STEPTOE AND SON instead. It has a much brighter tone, the TV series is more faithful and actually very funny.
