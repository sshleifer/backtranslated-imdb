Since I hate reading long essays, hoping to find a point and being disappointed, I'll tell everyone first that this movie was awful. Alright, terrible. And not surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought I could agree with him because he gave the film the rank he deserved, but he was sadly reprimanded for reading what he said. I am very ashamed to have the same page as someone commenting that the movie "definitely does not have good-looking women". Let me be the first to say, "Wow, this was definitely a serious thorough review, and my mind can barely understand the philosophical reflections on this film." Seriously, a lack of "good-looking women" should not be considered essential for a movie. If you're desperately looking for "good-looking women," you should really see other types of films that are not necessarily in the sci-fi category.
