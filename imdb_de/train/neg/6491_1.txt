This movie was a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with a group of movie lovers who have a different taste in movies, but always have a keen eye for a "genius" (as one of my commentators on this site had the favor, to mark this steaming pile?); None of them found a single quality of salvation. We finished the movie with a rousing chorus refrain that I do not want to reprint here. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the positive reviews here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins himself. After all, as one of the reviewers will tell you, did he finance the film himself? because no one else in Hollywood or anywhere in the world would risk a single penny or good name in connection with this movie. Do not let the half-known actors who appear in the film lure you into their catches? As Christian Slater admits in the peculiarities of the "Making of", he signed the film without reading the script or knowing any details (a folly that I'm sure I will not repeat). <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the luckless One who stumbles into this swamp of indulgence written, directed, produced and financed by a man too famous to admit Not everything he creates is a masterpiece (and if you do not believe me, please google "Anthony" Hopkins "AND Art).
