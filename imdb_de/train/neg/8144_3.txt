I just saw that at the 2006 International Film Festival in Vancouver. The summary in the festival guide sounded pretty good, so we decided to find this out here. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Apart from being badly written, it was boring. I will not take anything from the actors because they can not do much with this bad script. <br /> <br /> The first bite was a clich√© without irony, exaggeratedly serious, without being funny. The movie would have been better if Hunt Hoe had gone through a terrible horror sensation. Instead, he took himself too seriously and this led to a boring movie. I can not recommend this movie. It felt too long and, all in all, just weak.
