When I watched a movie screening at the Philly Film Fest last year, I was upset, and when I saw that it was running on cable tonight, I could immediately have it remindered. Was it worth the wait? Well, let's go back a bit, since I do not have to give you the plot yet. Sean Crawley is a young man who does not know how he lives. Enter Duke (George Wendt), who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night, Ray totally begs Sean to stop the guy who accompanied Sean. And from there it goes on. Which leads me back to the question asked. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the setup was pretty good and George Wendt stole the movie for me. He just took the ball and ran with it. But it's not nearly as violent as I thought, and at some point during the filming run, the ball is not just dropped but also fumbled in the other direction. I know exactly where this point happened, but I can not say it without spoiling the movie. But it is needless to say that it happened. The end does not save the movie either. Poor Stuart Gordon can not be anything like Re-Animator or Castle Freak. <br /> <br /> My rating: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Kari Wuhrer shows her Ta-Tas in a fantasy and then in the next Ta-Tas and it pans down and ... OH MY GOD MY EYES MY EYES !!!!!
