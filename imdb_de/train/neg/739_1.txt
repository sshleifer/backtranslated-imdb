Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, begin with the wrong foot in the first step, assuming that Wells gothic horror wrote and that all his lines should be taken seriously. That's just not true. Wells was a great legacy of the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that the British could prepare the Victorian complacency unprepared for the new technology - both good and evil. <br /> <br /> Two Terrible consequences follow - the protagonist is portrayed as a shaky screamer (I was reminded of Fay Wray in the original King Kong) rather than a man who strives to live up to the ironies of an incredible catastrophe ; and the dialogue stinks of "Victorianisms," which seriously meant that Welles clearly wanted to be put in the cheek. <br /> <br /> All this looks suspiciously like Ed Wood, who wastes a huge budget on CGI effects By the way, the 1940s Warner Bros. cartoon factory could have done a better job. (Gilt of splattered blood looked like red balloons, I expected them to fly off at any minute.) Think of The Yellow Submarine as the old EC comics. Worse is the theme loss that robs the movie for some reason to exist. Although the makers of this film trace the story back to their Victorian era, they miss the eerie way in which Wells's story predicted many of the horrors of the First World War - a fact not unnoticed by Wells himself, the post-war war revised topic in The form of things to come. <br /> <br /> Without any topic here, we have a lot of people running around in cartoon balloons and not trying for a high school production from a drunken student of Macbeth. <br /> <br /> Really, that's the worst, most pointless piece I've ever had since a friend made me see the Eastern European cartoon "Fantastic Planet" thirty years ago. This movie was so presumably boring, my friend and I and two complete strangers gave it up halfway to the mockery and sat near the screen playing cards, using the movie as light to see the cards - their only utility so far every one of us could notice. <br /> <br /> But I already have electric lighting in my apartment, so I did not need this wells set for anything. <br /> <br /> Do not avoid this movie - steal any copy you can (do not pay a dime) and burn each one of them. God in His wisdom created us only for this purpose.
