What a mess. I saw this with a friend a while back and we both see ourselves open to the many wonders of the cinema, but surely that's not one of them. <br /> <br /> Although it could very well be ideas / concepts and there are certainly some good services (under the circumstances), everything is buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony draws from the same gene pool as Natural Born Killers, U Turn, and similar films as far as the cut is concerned, or he may have been looking for inspiration in Nixon. Say what you want from David Lynch, but at least he usually has a method for insanity. <br /> <br /> His quote that he made the movie a joke says it all. It's worth neither money nor bandwidth or time.
