Mulva is being turned into a suger com by Teen Ape. When she awakens, she is considerably hotter (the roles Debbie Rochon plays in this sequel) and wants revenge on those who did her wrong. As the subtitle and boxing implies, this is indeed a lift off the "kill bill" films, but since this is a film by Chris Seaver, this is a wildly incompetent satire (and I use that last term extremely relaxed) I would love to say that's better than the first movie, but to be honest, I was so incredibly drunk when I saw the previous movie that I can not even hope the two at this time to compare. But I must have enjoyed it since I bought the sequel (see if I'm drunk because I do not have a better word, complete and totally shitty movies). There are a few loud moments (very few), but I remember Bonejack is funnier. At least a little more than an hour, it is quickly overly much for what it is worth. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Audio commentary by director Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon and the Lbp Gang; Second comment from Seaver; 31 minutes Making of featurette; Lloyd Kaufman's 6-minute tribute on low-budget images; Fake 2 minutes syrup commercial; Stills gallery; Promo trailer; and followers for: Mulva, Egg Salad, Fiilthy McNasty 1, 2 & 3, The Feral Man, The Bonesetter, Midnight Skater, Demon Summer & Splatter Rampage Wrestling
