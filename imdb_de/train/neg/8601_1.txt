Ok, where do we start with this little gem? Mutant snails start to conquer a small town in New England (?). Only one man can stop her ... and this man ... is Mike Brady! If that's not ridiculous enough, stay tuned. <br /> <br /> The snail's footage is known as stock footage. No matter who the snails are attacking or where they are, the same shot of snails poking everywhere is shown. Remember that this unique recording makes up at least half of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting in the movie was downcast, pulled, stolen the wallet, beaten your girlfriend, killed your dog, BAD. I'm sure there is something worse, but it will be hard to find. The only gem was ... you guessed it ... MIKE BRADY! He must have attended a few night classes at the YMCA because he was the best in the group. <br /> <br /> How horror? This movie is not to be taken seriously. There is no horror! They are snails to cry aloud. With one or two salt shakers the whole ascending action could have been avoided. Watch this movie in an MST3K environment only, otherwise I can see significant damage to the brain.
