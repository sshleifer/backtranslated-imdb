This "movie" is such a bad job! Nothing seems to be trying and being realistic. Plot is weak, acting - miserable, actors are astonished as in a first annual production and are very anxious to act without chance from the beginning. What a flop! What a waste of time, money and effort for everyone involved including the audience. Like every thriller, there are murders, dead bodies and blood. Imagine someone who committed a murder with a knife five minutes ago and came out of the house quietly and smiling, not to mention the pipe, as if a virtual agent were cutting his throat. This murder was also to be carried out by a tiny fragile woman on a strong man, and she cut his throat !!! Did she politely ask him to bend for her? There is much more stupidity of this kind than the public leaves and wonders if this should be a joke that turned out to be bad. Continuity is another big problem, for example: The eagerly hungry groom is lying in bed, waiting for his virgin bride to come out of the bathroom and falling asleep after a long time (!?!). The next scene begins with the young couple entering the reception area and asking for hints on scenery points! NO WORD ABOUT LAST NIGHT ??? So much of a waste of time even writing about this low-low supposed "movie".
