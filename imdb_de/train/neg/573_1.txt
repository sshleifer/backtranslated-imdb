The last critic was very generous. I am calm as the first movie, but can not say that I like this movie very much. The beginning is tolerable, but it's going downhill pretty fast. I just do not see Jon Bon Jovi as a "bad vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. Many scenes just do not make sense. I mean, any normal human being would suspect something is going on when suddenly a strange woman appears seducing you, let alone an experienced hunter. Why is Una able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing was said in this movie, you would not mind if it was entertaining, but that was too much to ask. This is one of the worst vampire movies I have ever seen.
