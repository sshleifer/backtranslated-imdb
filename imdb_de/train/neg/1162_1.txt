I saw this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. To this day (sorry Jack Nicholson) it's still the most boring movie I've ever seen. It just went on and on with no apparent point and then - it just ended. The lights came on and I watched everyone looking around in confusion. Did the projectionist miss a role? I've never had the urge to find out. All I remember is that the movie was a drama about annoying college basketball players and their coach. The most enjoyable part of the film was watching the totally mystified audience after the words. Fortunately, this was only an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
