"Scary Movie 2" is a disappointment to the Scary Movie franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good, but this movie was kinda boring and not very funny. Luckily, they picked up their act after the movie and shot two more great scary movies. <br /> <br /> This film is about a group of teenagers being tricked by their professor to go to a haunted house for one night. Things go awry and then they realize that they have to flee. <br /> <br /> This movie is not terrible, but it could have improved a lot. It's a bit of fun and if you enjoyed the other films in the series Scary Movie, then look at that - but I do not think you'll almost like it that much.
