Anyone who says it's better than hostel talks about crap, I think I'm not a fan of Hostel, but that's just ridiculous. This is just another shot on a camcorder, straight to DVD, with little wasted time, I can not believe how many of these movies are there and I'm not decent yet. In the '80s, video nasties, gore and horror films were shot on budget, with a great story and a lot of new ideas and, above all, the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now they just seem like trying to get the people who are into blockbuster to rent a copy until people stop doing it, then these movies will probably continue to appear. This movie has so few ideas that it's amazing how it was ever done, acting is terrible too, the location is totally unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying that it announces the faith. This waste of time has absolutely nothing to offer, unless you are looking for a list of the worst films of all time. My best / worst part of the movie is when a female character points a gun at someone and threatens to shoot at her if she does not retreat. You can see that she does not even cover the trigger with her finger, which only holds the finger grip. An absolute joke.
