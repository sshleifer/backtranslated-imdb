Okay, let me mark a new word here: Polyphobia: the fear of polyamorous relationships. This is another film from a long series of films that start to thrill the audience over a threesome, just to make a penny and sermonize on what is so necessary and the only moral thing, a monogamic solution to find. Only one in a thousand people understand the joy of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Mark my words: In a few decades, polyphobia will be just as much a faux pas as homophobia, but guess who was too close to realize it? Right the first time: the producers of this film. And so many like it. Why even a ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned movie like this? She is proud to be open to gays and completely overlooks the fact that we live in a time when monogamy is transformed into sequential monogamy, which in turn transforms into swinging and polyamory. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing, ordinary chick movie. (But damn it, I have to say, Heather Graham is the cutest creature.) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
