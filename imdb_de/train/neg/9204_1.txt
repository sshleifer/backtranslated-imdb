I've seen this movie many times (and recently I've read the book the movie is based on) and every time I see it I just want to beat all four. The fact that they do not suggest the fact that Tom Hanks character outside of his game session in his D & D (oops M & M) :) -Persona ("Oh, he acts only in character." That and the fact that after three months of therapy, we destroy everything and feed his delusions! This kind of people give RPGs a bad name. <br /> <br /> Also, the stupid 'Love Ballad' and the music of 'Cat on a Piano' and 'Stop us if we get too annoying' is almost enough to edge your teeth!
