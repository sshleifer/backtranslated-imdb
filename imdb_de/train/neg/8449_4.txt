What an absurd story, murder extortion, child abuse allegations, gays and the catholic church. Why is it that most UK-based TV dramas, sitcoms, etc. have to include the compulsory gay, which is now becoming very tiring. Everyone accepts that there are gays in society, only there are other minority groups, but we do not want it to ram our throats in every single show (I pass this on). Apart from the above, the drama went from an interesting little story to a pantomime, the priest was a pedophile and gay people are everywhere, oh yes, to be all alone, one of the gay couples was black. I'm amazed at c ecclestone when I thought about it when he read the script.
