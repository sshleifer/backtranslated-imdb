The moment the striker started, I knew we were having trouble! The premise is ridiculous at best. The story was even worse if that was possible. <br /> <br /> The acting was stiff and the actors gave a feeling of inexperience. They expect more from people like Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines were delivered as if by a robot. I'm sorry, I like Reid, but she was VERY incredible as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff chose a lousy film to stage their comebacks. <br /> <br /> The continuity was off throughout the movie. The creatures were not bad, but they were not good either. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I want to return the ninety minutes of my life. You can keep the money, but give me time! What a waste.
