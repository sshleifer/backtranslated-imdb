The version of this movie I saw was called "Horror Rises from the Tomb". The horror in question here is a wicked medieval magician played by Spanish horror legend Paul Naschy, who looks like he's playing Abanazer in a panto in the church hall. He rises from his grave as a stupid descendant (I think he is a descendant, as played by Naschy) returns to his ancestral home and the magician's head and body, those of the witch-hunters who executed him united, united in a village Try to stop him, um, rise from the grave. <br /> <br /> When the head and body are together again, hell breaks loose and many people die. Like all good magicians, Abanazer has a lovely assistant here. This piece is played by another Spanish horror, the beautiful Helga Line. Like virtually every other woman in the film series, she regularly gets her gear. There's a lot of nudity in this movie, and not just a woman - we can even see Nasha's limp body, which is not a pretty sight, I can tell you. Most of the sex-angle of the movie is ridiculously free. There is a particularly funny scene in which Naschy and Line discuss their evil plans and then suddenly decide to understand them both with the young young blonde who possessed them. <br /> <br /> It is also pretty bloody in some places - especially a Herschell Gordon Lewis moment when Line puts his hands in a man's chest to remove his heart. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie are the pretty effective zombies that come towards the end. However, they are quickly startled by a fire and do not come back. Which is a shame. However, the scene where the zombies rise is the film's most ridiculous moment. It all happens in the distance, and we have no idea what happens until we see some of the distant figures that are evolving. There are some garbage scenes like this, mainly thanks to the bad editing. When a worker falls under the hypnotic spell of Nashy's head, there is a large close-up of his face that seems to exist forever and serves no purpose. <br /> <br /> Not a great horror movie, but entertaining enough. Of course, the version I saw was a dubbed American version that was probably cut to pieces. As far as I know, the Spanish original version could be a masterpiece ...
