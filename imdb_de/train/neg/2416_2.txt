2 stars, and I am generous. (smaller spoilers) Look, this is a low-budget zombie movie in Gangland Oakland. As the plot looks like, a scientist wants to revive his dead brother after being killed in a pass. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie: which zombies?! All "zombies" growl (which does not just sound weird) and trickle red blood out of their mouth! No scary eyes, no rotting flesh, just a few people growling pathetic and running around like idiots. <br /> <br /> The cover is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the entire movie, so it's not as if the whole "hood" is plagued by zombies or something else, there are only a few, and it's contained in no time at all is so bad it's weird is. Nobody can do anything in this movie (except maybe one of the gang members) and it really seems like a few friends are meeting, deciding to occupy their family and make a movie one weekend. <br />> Conclusion: Since when do doctors wear tracksuits? Please skip this!
