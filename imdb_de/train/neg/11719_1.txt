In the words of Charles Dance in this movie: "Bollocks!" No conspiracy, no character development and absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Filled with things that do not happen in the real world (since when are British police inspectors armed with pistols in shoulder holsters?). Full of mistakes (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of boring and artificial dialogue. And the direction / editing is terrible - shaky handheld camera shots that add nothing to the movie except for an indefinite feeling of seasickness; confusing jumps; No structure. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes's character is totally disagreeable - why should we care what happens to him? Direct to the video? Straight to the garbage bin!
