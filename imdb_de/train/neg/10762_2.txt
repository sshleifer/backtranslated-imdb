This was an impulse that I received from the local video store. Do not make the same mistake as me. This movie is boring, unconvincing and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is especially poorly written and delivered. At each scene they shared, I flinched. Dennis Hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disconnected self; his role was obviously not boring for him. And although the film supposedly plays in Puerto Rico, it feels more like a Hollywood lot. All the main characters are Caucasian, and some speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Odd. If you see them on the shelf of your local video store, go ahead anyway.
