I did not know that this movie existed until I saw Blade: Trinity. I played around on the Trinity board when I heard some users mention how the Wes Craven series is way better than Blade's 'crap', so I quickly researched: I got the results on IMDb & RottenTomatoes for Dracula : Ascension checks, and at some point during the search, I found out that this is a continuation of Dracula 2000 for this film, which is a big contradiction to the results I've seen. <br /> <br /> Let us make a short personal summary here. I remember seeing Dracula in 2000, and I remember I did not like it at all, and then saw the reviews of Dracula: Ascension lowered my expectations even more, but then again, I'm the guy who made the movie necessarily have to watch for yourself (any movie), so I can form my own opinion. <br /> <br /> A few things I noticed when I started watching this movie was that the budget was low. That's why I go to ignore many v / fx and just to believe that it's compensated by Story & Drama, I was also impressed with some of the castings in this film (Jason London, Roy Schieder and Jason Scott Lee). > Oh my god? This movie was cheesy! But cheesy can be entertaining at least, I found it rather ridiculous ridiculous, the bad audio synchronization from the re-recording of the dialogue in a few scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this film. Sure, they all knew about vampires and some basic things, Luke even had a book about it, but did it prevent them from being intentionally "infected"? No, that's the worst thing, as slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check the sound she hears with just a towel. <br /> <br /> I also must have blinked at some point because I'm not sure how "Dracula" got clothes on his body, mostly because he's big and angry and I think if I was in that situation I would not be the one to dress him. <br /> <br /> So the movie ends like any middle film in a trilogy? it's not like that, instead it's a "cliff hangar" where I can now wait for the third installment "Legacy". Oh, the entertainment value of Cheesy movies.
