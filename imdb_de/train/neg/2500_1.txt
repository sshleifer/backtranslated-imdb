Van Dien has to shy away from embarrassment at the memory of this ridiculously bad film, as every single one of us must. To be honest, I'm pretty embarrassed to admit that I've seen it from start to finish. The production values ​​are somewhere between the original series "Crossroads" and "Prisoner Cell Block H". Most five-year-olds would be able to find a more realistic dialogue and plausible conspiracy. If you can imagine the most dramatic porno movie you've ever seen - one where the action is filled up with an endless "story" to explain how a pouting old peroxide blonde cauldron has come to spit - from a couple of guys with Mustaches Roasted - You have an idea of ​​the standard of acting in "Maiden Voyage". Worse, you can not even fast forward to the sex scenes as there are none. A terribly horrible movie.
