Yes, even as a fan of shows like survivors and apprentices, this show is pretty bad. The first few shows did not bother me, but then I realized how miserable everyone was to even attend the show. The antics of Alex and Aaron giving men a bad name when they cheated on or made their choice on the first occasion was really not a good look for the show. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can have Trista. She had the most annoying voice I've ever heard on TV, and she was definitely not the smartest woman (very media-intensive, but I doubt there's much more there). <br /> <br /> I have not! I have really seen every show, except for the occasional repetition in the daytime TV. I think the purpose of reality TV is to treat it as "entertaining garbage". Think of it as something you can laugh about, and you do not have to think about it too much (I do not look at CSI like a TV-tired and stereotyped reality, but you have to think too much when looking anyway). <Br /> <br /> A few thoughts on the reasons for the show. For the very first time, the woman said everything to her "wife like Amy (who had a lot of lessons) - commented that she had tried every scene from the bar and club scene to meet a guy, and it did not happen to her." Hey Amy, how about a club, a hobby, a charity work, a job where you meet more people, all I know is that it's not the ideal place to meet a future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many of the other girls seemed obsessed with the idea of ​​meeting "the perfect man." Note on ladies: It does not exist, but there are many great people who could become great husbands, some of them for you You may not earn six numbers a year or are a JFK junior look, but they are still great guys The superficiality of the woman on this show is unbelievable I'm still a young man and I believed thatThe woman gradually grew out of her superficiality as she grew older and more realistic about her future partner. This show proves the opposite. Overall, this show does a lot to endorse many clichés about how women see men in society. It's really a terrible show and I think all these kinds of shows just should not be done anymore. Country Mile's best dating shows are Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel because they are fun. Nothing is more busy between the "couples" than a simple night. The bachelor unfortunately takes too seriously.
