There was a ghost played by Shaq. His name was Kazaam, and he was crazy. His rhymes were hackneyed, these lines were bad. This movie is a shit, Prolly did not make $ 20, he lives in a boombox, no lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp ... In a stupid movie with terrible special effects. Oh, and it's confusing as hell. I will not even continue. Let's just say it belongs in the category "it's so bad, it's funny". Take a look at your buddies and laugh well. But do not expect anything spectacular.
