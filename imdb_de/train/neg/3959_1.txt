This is NOT one of those movies, it's one of the biggest pieces of tripe I've ever photographed. The camera work tries to be conspicuous, but it's just crap, the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries, but without the sex. The only reason I bought this was because I wanted to try DVD. This was the cheapest one I could find. Possibly the worst purchase of my life and could have dissuaded you from DVD forever. The soundtrack is really kitschy and most of the movie is The endless reruns of the clips from the first two films make up why someone wants to make such a horrible movie as I can not. If you had really tried to make an original movie, I would be nicer in this review. Not only do you have the rights to reproduce and then re-work things from the first two, and repeat in this movie with about 1/3 original material, which about the standards of film students. DO NOT buy this movie. The only entertainment that this DVD can offer is when you plug it into the microwave and watch the flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTER incredible GARBAGE! 0/10, if only the electoral system would allow that.
