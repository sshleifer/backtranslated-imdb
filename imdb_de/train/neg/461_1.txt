Warning: Avoid this terrible Super Duper movie ... If you've seen it, you'll be SOOOOOOOOO disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are now granny's age. SO HARD trying to be young innocent and sexy, just not working at ALL. Pam and Denise behave so horribly in this movie. <br /> <br /> Plus The script is absolutely cruel, I can not believe anyone can come up with such crappy ideas. With the development of the film industry film lovers are not as easy to satisfy as in the last century. I'll bet the moviegoers from the last century will hate it, too. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I think seeing "White Chicks" from 2004, it's so much better that this ... will not make a mistake at the time I thought this was the worst movie I've ever seen.
