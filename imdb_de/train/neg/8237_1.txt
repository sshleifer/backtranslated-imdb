How was this movie ever distributed in the name of all that is holy? It looks as if it was shot on someone's cell phone and brings the screaming girl sacrifice scenario to completely new depths. They literally scream the entire 90 minutes of the movie. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no tension, no characters and not much acting. Just scream and scream more. <br /> <br /> I quit after fifteen minutes and quickly burned myself to see if anything happened. It does not - except, of course, to scream. Strangely enough, the fast-forward process raises another problem - there is no camera work to talk about. Each shot looks like every other shot - medium distance, an angle, boring, dull. DULL. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad that it's good. It's just bad.
