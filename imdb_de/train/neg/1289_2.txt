This was a new all-time low in the West. The writing is painful, the characters are impossible to emphasize and either disgusting or bland, the violence is appalling and technically not very convincing. And Tobey Maguire shows us the downside of his talent, walking his role sleepwalking with his expressionless eyes and his scratchy voice, which only gives mannerism here. "Ride With the Devil" is one of my five worst movie experiences, which never exceeds a western negative.
