Rating: 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> As this mini-series drew near and we've been aware for the last six months that the Sci-Fi Channel continued to use their shows with BG ads, I confess the ego felt a growing discomfort as I learned more. <br /> <br /> As with any work of film art that has grown to a certain test of time, different people go to see different things. When people think of Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some, it is the chrome warriors with the oscillating red light in their sights. For others, it's the penchant for special effects that were pretty evolutionary in their time. Many forget the state of special effects in the late 70s, especially on television. For some, the memories are resolved around the story arc. Others still remember relationships, as relationships themselves have helped to master the challenges they faced. Honestly, I come from the latter group. At the heart of Battlestar Galactica were the people who contracted to save themselves from a wicked empire. Yes, bad. The Cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of humanity, but they did. While basing stars whirled around, men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources, and somehow managed to survive until the next show. They did not survive because they had better technology or more firepower. They survived because they cared and trusted each other to get to the next show. <br /> <br /> The show had its shortcomings and was sometimes juicy, but they were people who might be interested in you. <Br /> <br /> The authors of this current version never seemed to understand that. In a way, he took the most insignificant part of the original show, the character's name, and a plot approach, and designed what they called nothing less than a reinvention of science fiction on television. Since this was their goal, they can be judged by how well they did it: failure. It was anything but a reinvention. In fact, it has long been one of the most derivative sci-fi ventures in many ways. It borrows a lot from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5 and even Battlefield Earth. I find that regrettable. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore has been contributing to popular science fiction for more than a decade, and has contributed to some of the most popular science-fiction television films one could hope for. One of the difficulties he apparently had was that there could be no conflict in the Enterprise D & E bridge crew. This was the inviolable rule of Roddenberry's ST: TNG. Like many who have lived by these rules and who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under this authority, Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the recognized science fiction Master has learned: Gene Roddenberry. Instead of writing the best possible story, he has created a dysfunctional cast here, as I've ever intended to create as many castaways as he could. Apart from the fact that they were not functional, some of them were not the least credible. Anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone who unintentionally attacked a superior officer would not only get "hacked" for a few days, he could have been executed and would never come out the next day. It would not have happened, point, especially in wartime. <br /> <br /> The thing I remembered most about Ron Moore's earlier work was that it was the death of Captain James Kirk. He killed Captain Kirk, and unfortunately he killed Battlestar Galactica.
