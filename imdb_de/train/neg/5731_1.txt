I watched the unrated version of this movie and realized after about 30 minutes that I never got my time back. I persisted until the end, hoping that the dialogue would improve, the martial arts would someday be realistic, the special effects would actually look special. I was so wrong. I love horror, I'm a total hound. I'm counting some of the splatter flicks of the eighties to the greats of the movie world. However, this was not done in the eighties. If this film had been released in the early eighties, one could refuse the fax the bad appearance. It was not that it did not have that defense. The dialogue is terrible, with so many bad lines that I flinch at writing instead of torturing myself. I do not like a hostel, I never thought, I was overrated, overrated and I did not feel anything for the protagonists, but next to this garbage it shines as a beacon. The back of the cover for Live Feed promised a twist that you would never see. I'm still waiting for the promised turn.
