I've been waiting for DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON for a long time, and after seeing it, I was really disappointed. It was not the Baroque movie that I expected. The trailer (which I saw on a Something Weird DVD) is much better than the whole movie, which is remarkably forgotten. There are almost no eye-catching scenes and the look and feel is interesting, but there are also other Baroque films, by Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are boring and there is almost nothing dramatic, though we see rape, crucifixion, madness and so on. <br /> <br /> The main problem with DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was that it was a conversation - more than anything else. It was almost like seeing a book. I just wanted the movie to have moments of silence or mood or something, instead we see / hear the main cast members chatting endlessly about boring stuff. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity.
