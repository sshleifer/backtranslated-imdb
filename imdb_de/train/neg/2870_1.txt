Oh dear God! Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not look this movie! It's 82 minutes of my life, I'll never come back. Sure, I could have stopped halfway. But I thought it could get better. Not everyone who has really enjoyed this movie is a seriously ill and twisted person. No wonder we Australians / New Zealanders have a bad name when it comes to making films. Everything about this movie is terrible, from acting to editing. I do not usually write reviews here, but in this case I make an exception. I only wish someone had warned me before I set this disaster
