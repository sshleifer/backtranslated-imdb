This movie has let me go. The title was perhaps the best idea I've heard. I thought it was an independent film about a zombie outbreak and their ambition to take over the US and a group of single survivors, band together and kill the zombies. ABSOLUTELY WRONG! It's about a psycho-policeman with a weakness for killing his female arrests, what he expects when a pack of zombie-women gets up from their graves to get their revenge. As you can see, it's not about the nation or a district. Where to start with the rigor of this cinematic disaster that has caused our nation. <br /> <br /> First of all, the zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and pale face. What are zombies, but thoughtless, controversial intelligent, cannibalistic killing machines that feed on their most primitive basic needs? These zombie women run like streetwalkers and runway models, they talk as if they're in a bad movie noir movie, and they do not behave like real zombies. Sure, the food and killing is there, but where is the thoughtlessness and the terrible distortion? Although it's a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire in the zombie genre, it makes fun of this genre and asks, "Why can not zombies be beautiful fuzzy killers?" I would say that this movie is considered a really bad indie movie produced and produced by Garage Junkies. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who loves zombie genres too much, it's an insult and scary, is not it?
