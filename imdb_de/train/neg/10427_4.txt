Well, they say, nymphomania will not leave you satisfied. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) is a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly has sexual relationships with men. She's still exploring and trying to find "more data" so she can see what she wants from life and men, though at her age she looks like she should have a pretty good idea now. (However, I can not agree that Young says she's too old for the role, and if she is, we should all age so well.) The movie left me mostly cold, though by no means the worst of it Art will you ever see. And unlike the recent Eyes Wide Shut, at least something is happening here.
