Plot is not worth discussing, though it does point to corruption, murder, power, and other Thriller-related issues. Characters are sometimes interesting. Not realistic, but still interesting. <br /> <br /> Development is slow as the tea ceremony. Visuals not stunning, but good enough to relieve the eyes. Good movie to watch after dinner before bed - nothing too shocking, nothing overly irritating. Movie sitcom style. <br /> <br /> I liked Woody - excellent performance. Had to fight against the lack of conspiracy and did the job pretty well. The rest is bearable, but very predictable. The whole thing is well visible and better than most TV programs.
