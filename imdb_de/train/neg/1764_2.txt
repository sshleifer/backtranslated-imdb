Although in many ways I agree with the comments of the other reviewers. I think that the plot and the idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem with this movie is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure I've never seen a less talented "actor". I can not imagine how that person has ever been in a movie or on television. In my opinion, she would be better than Wal-Mart. If you want to see a person with this low talent grade be involved in the payroll of roles, the question arises ... "Who knows them?" I would really like to see this movie redone with some talent. I can not blame the writer for not having the time to watch the movie.
