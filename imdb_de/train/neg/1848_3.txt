There are bad movies, then there are the movies that are so bad that they almost become art. This is one of those movies. My partner and I are still pretty shocked, you know, staring into space and drooling! It can be said that the people involved (I hope they changed their name to protect themselves) had a great time and definitely were not shy. I give this one three out of ten just because of the unsatisfied dirt and REALLY bad gore effect. I laughed a lot during most of the movie, so you could say it showed me a good time. Beware of the viewer, the above words in no way suggest that this is a good movie because it is not. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to miss a movie with such a great title.
