It is interesting first. A naive park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a pretty, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane), who is known only for a short time. They seem to be happy, then they disappear without warning. He searches for her and stumbles after a few dead ends about her abused childhood and slippery past, which may involve criminal activity. And apparently, the filmmakers did not know what to do with the story. The beginning is not as exciting as it sounds, but it is at least observable. Then it stops being interesting or even meaningful. And the ending is so lame, so boring and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence that you think the scriptwriters did not know what to do with it, and it's boring to try. What a sad waste of a good idea!
