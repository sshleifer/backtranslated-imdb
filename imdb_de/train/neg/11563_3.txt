This Italian semi-horror movie starts off very much like a softcore porno movie and becomes a puzzle that has a few too many loose ends to be good, and the fact that it's pretty boring makes this movie for my liking pretty inappropriate. The only thing worth seeing is the many breasts that are spread throughout the movie. The story tells the story of a man who lures girls into his castle at the beginning of the movie, where he puts them in his dungeon, goes insane and apparently kills them. They show the nakedness, but they never really show the murders at this point in the movie. Then the guy at a party finds a nice red head and goes around with her and marries her. He has something for redheads, you see, because his beloved former wife Evelyn was also one, she also died in circumstances that did not have to be the auditor's audience. After many talkative scenes, murders with snakes, foxes and the like begin. At this point it is easy enough to find out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is, then you have a nonsensical ending where everything does not end so well. This movie just did not work for me, I had too many questions and the last third of the movie just did not have the breasts of the first two thirds of the movie. Explaining Evelyn's death would have helped the film as if Evelyn had finally come to an end. Granted, the title is not completely misleading as it somehow left the grave, just not under its own power. The Gore is for the most part very light, as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene with a lot of blood at the end. I just thought that this movie was a bit boring.
