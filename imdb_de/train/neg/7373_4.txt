I do not know what the rest of you are watching for Steven Seagal movies, but I look at them because, stupid as they are, they are at least always good for a laugh. Why would you rate this film 1 in 10 on the basis of dubbing, if that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie a cult favorite you can laugh about the stupidity of? <br /> <br /> Attack Force is by no means a great movie, but I thought it was just as valuable for a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of its other films. In fact, I did not think it was one of his worst ways. It usually had a reasonably consistent line of action and was generally exciting in most cases. The end was really shit, but that too had some funny elements. In the end, the story did not do what it had promised, but I actually thought that acting, characterizing (if I may use such a big word), and the rest of the production values ​​could do just what a real Steven Seagal fan would expect would. Most of all, Seagal was the rocky-faced man and non-nonsense man we expect, and the rest of the cast pretty well supported him, never staging him. This, folks, does a Steven Seagal movie. Deal with it. Or even better: laugh about it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
