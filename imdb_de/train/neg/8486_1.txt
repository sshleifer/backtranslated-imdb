I can not believe that anyone thought there was anything original or interesting about this film. Like the next one, I'm a fan of science fiction and can even enjoy old films with ridiculous assumptions as long as they are written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my glowing review of Altered States [1980].) A monkey could have better explained why I should take the basic idea of ​​this movie seriously for a second. The problem is not that the producers have a low budget - they do not care. <br /> <br /> Well, the worthless magazines whose glowing reviews appear on the box publicly humiliate: <br /> <br /> Chicago Tribune <br /> <br /> San Francisco Chronicle <br / > <br /> San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (Actually, I like to read the latter two.) Her movie Checking the credibility has prevailed. But I know, if I ever make a movie with a handheld camera, a cheesy plot, and stupid effects, I'll show it to these journalists and remind them what they said about Conceiving Ada.)
