The good earth follows the life of a slave and a poor farmer in China. The film is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great, but I hated that they had decided to cast Anglos in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is ridiculous like the father of the farmer. He has a strong American accent, like most of the leading actors, that I could not stand listening to him. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Hollywood could not get past its racist beliefs to make Asians work in the lead roles. Taking Angus and making them look like Chinese is akin to Anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play African American.
