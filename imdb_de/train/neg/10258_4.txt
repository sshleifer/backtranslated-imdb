The earth will certainly not be thanks to Father Pergado and a lot of nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since said that he would have been involved with his producers, who told him that a lot of great actors were involved) is Father Pergado and can do his usual, heavy and frightening routine. The cast is not that bad, though most have since retired from acting. The movie has terrible sound effects (which come mainly from pressing keys on an old computer) and sometimes ridiculously thoughtful - for example, a scene of the sky for hours that feels like hours. Nevertheless, in a world that is doomed to failure, the story is quite funny and the production is appropriate. Interestingly, one scene shows Albert Band and Mrs. Jackie; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and the Assistant to the Charles Band, Bennah Burton. Despite his sluggish nature, I really wanted to see how it all worked, so I really liked it.
