The film seems incoherent and badly written overall. The script continues as if ten different people had written it and none of them had communicated with each other. Apparently they wanted to take a page from a Miracle in 34th Street (the original movie), but that's so bad that the movie falls apart. This film is only for very young people, and even YOU will see the fact that the person who wrote the script knows little or nothing about baseball. Such as: <br /> <br /> ?? If the angels are in the last place, the owner does not seem to care that his manager is getting him into a fight with his bowler. On the moon? or that he STUNCHED the team's play-by-play announcer on live TV. However, if the team is just a game of winning the division, it's out of shape because of a story (coming from a 6-year-old) that the manager gets help from a kid who claims to see real angels. What sounds worse? A violent, uncontrolled manager whose team has lost 15 in a row? Or a winning coach on the fringes of the playoffs, who looks a bit eccentric and helps foster children? The owner's reaction does not make sense. And he has moved to change his mind about Maggie and her speech from Clich√© Country during a press conference. <br /> <br /> ?? The Angels are scheduled to play in the final weekend series against the White Sox for the division, but at the end of the game is repeatedly claimed that the Angels had won the pennant. "Not the regular seasonal division title. <br /> <br /> Whitt Bass, the Goofball pitcher is the starting pitcher and wins the game that loses the Angels losing a series? Then the starting pitcher ? DAY. <br /> <br /> Mel Clark (Tony Danza) is said to have thrown 156 notes in the ninth inning in a low-score ball game.Typically, the number of tables in low-score games is much lower than this usually about 80-90 pitches. <br /> <br /> "AL," says the angel in the end, "championships must be won alone," although he and his angels have manipulated and repaired games throughout the second half of the season. <br /> <br /> I could go on as there are MANY other examples where the story is poorly written. <br /> <br /> For younger children (under 10 years) this movie can be entertaining pity? right, that could have been a classic and it's an unforgettable mess that will forever be washed out as UHF / cable on Saturday morning.
