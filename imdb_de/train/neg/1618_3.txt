I saw this movie with the most positive expectations. I had seen Jacquet's previous movie (March of the Penguins) and had heard a very positive review of it on the radio. However, I was very disappointed. Above all, this movie is terribly boring. Literally NOTHING happens. I tried to describe the content of a movie to a friend, and we both laughed in the end, because I could just stammer things like "it's dark, and the girl goes into a cave, and other times the fox has babies and so on. After about half an hour, I sighed, yawned, rolled my eyes, scolded the reviewer on the radio station, and hoped that it would soon be over. But the movie went on and on. When it finally came to an end, I had sunk so deep into my chair that I had to look a bit like Stephen Hawking. The most annoying parts of the film are (a) the girl, who is obviously there to give children an identity. She wears the same clothes (one year) throughout the movie and shows exactly two facial expressions: joy and seriousness. She is cute, no question. But a film about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without its all too human presence. I kept hoping that she could be eaten by a bear, drowned in the river, or something like that terrible. (b) The commentary of the adult voice of the girl who only tells us negligible, obvious, boring, superfluous things. (c) The music that lacks desperation. When the girl happily jumps around, the music jumps around too. If the fox is threatened by an eagle, the music also becomes threatening. It reminded me of the early days of filmmaking and was just too predictable to enjoy. Granted, many of the kids who watched the movie with me obviously liked it, at least they were somehow involved. Therefore, my warning only applies to adults: if you are over ten years old, avoid this movie. In most other places you can sleep better (and cheaper).
