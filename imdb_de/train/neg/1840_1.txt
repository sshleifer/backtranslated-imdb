This must be the most brutal "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken as a crazy homeless man can not make me laugh? Something has to go wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I have ever felt like. I used free passports and still felt like I wanted my money back. I can say with all my heart that the only movie I've ever seen was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The. JUST. worse. Movie. I laughed a lot at the carousel scene, and that's it. If you invest 2 hours in something charged as a comedy, you should make more than laugh, right? I do not know, I think the filmmakers thought "Flan" was a weird word or something. And the other joke is really a dead horse - literally.
