Since I and my other half are big fans of trash horror, we could not resist getting a movie that contained both sizes that excited us! For a movie from 2004 with a rip-off cover by Freddy Vs Jason, this is a shame! The worst movie I have ever seen, but worth a look if you can prevail! <br /> <br /> The drama is terrible, the effects ... well, I could do it better with my camcorder It's so bad that they just took the trouble to make up the faces of the zombies and neck, Hands out etc. No story, weird flashbacks that make no sense and a horrible script! <br /> <br /> "From a vampire" You broke my cigar "was the answer of the man who looked like Uncle Jessie of Dukes, crossed with Santa Claus!
