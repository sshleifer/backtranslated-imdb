*** THAT INCLUDES MANY MANY SPOILERS, NOT THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL IS PATENTALLY SUITED *** <br /> <br /> Oh my God, where do I start? Well, here - this is the first time I came home from a movie and said, "I have to go to IMDb and write a review of this NOW. It's my civic duty." So bad is this strip. <br /> <br /> * start with the digression * But let me just mention one thing before I start. I'm not a Harvard art major film Noir-Weenie (in fact, I went to college at the other end of Mass. Ave in Cambridge, the place where the smart people with no rich fathers and trust funds go, that's me directly into the nerd-who-ob-obsessive-comic-book-movies-census-group, and yet I hated this movie ...). My viewing habit is the high-profile cinema that includes The Die Hards, Bond Flicks, Clerks, and The Grail. I wish the Titanic had never dropped, not so much because of the lost lives, but we would not have been exposed to that crap of a movie. And the only and only reason why I look at a French French art film is when Emmanuelle Beart is a young and often unclothed woman. I have given Maximum Overdrive here on IMDb one of its precious 10s, for heaven's sake. So I'm as flat as they come, so I do not criticize this movie because I'm looking for a certain standard of cinematic quality - because Elektra stinks like a three-week-old dead goat. * End of the excursion * <br /> <br /> OK, there is so much bad here that I have to try to categorize it. Here it goes: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the compelling reasons why a man wants to see this streak is to see a lot of hot JGar (I have no idea why my wife wanted it). I think between this and "Finding Nemo" the latter was the sexier movie. Do you know the red outfit she advertised in every crazy ad you see? You see them TWICE - once at the beginning, once at the end. Crap. Besides, she basically looks like Morrissey would look if he were a woman - lots of pouty lips and black clothes. Which brings me to the incredible expression that JGar shows in her acting - from "pouting" to "pouting and crying". Oh my god, you would think she was forced to go out with Ben Affleck or something terrible. Um, wait ... <br /> <br /> THE BAT GUYS / GAL: They have about the same range of expression and acting skills you would expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit. At least in addition to the performance of JGar it is not particularly noticeable. One man has the job of standing there and being huge, another is to stand there and have things coming out of him, and the woman's job is to stand there and breathe and / or close the people kiss. They manage to accomplish these incredible achievements. The main villain has the most difficult role of all - he must appear a) angry and b) Asian in the same way. He does that well. I think there was a fifth villain, but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out of self-defense. <br /> <br /> PLOT TWISTS! This movie has as many surprises as a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Put it this way-my wife, who has only been in the US for half a year and speaks very little English-whispered this to me when the girl first appeared in JG's block, and I swear to God that I am Not invented: "She goes home to kill girls, and father too." And this is before the father has appeared on the screen. Well, my wife is not stupid, but she's not being promoted by Mensa for her presents, and she has no contact with Daredevil or the comic book genre. And she found that out in, 00015 seconds without bumping and without prior information. So obvious is this movie. <br /> <br /> Rarely before the first time stupidity! OK, so there is this big guy in the movie. He can fire a firearm and brush off the shot like a lint, and he can take a nasty Electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal (or melt - or something - more defenses, thank God). But JG jumps on his head and he explodes? An Achilles Noggin? OK! That's the insane stupidity of this movie. <br /> <br /> Ack. I start to feel a cerebral hemorrhage, so I have to stop. But you were warned. If you have to intentionally cut your own hoops to prevent yourself from seeing this movie, do it. And if Armageddon is coming, please let it appear on DVD> before <this one.
