Seriously, I've read some of the reviews for this movie and have to ask if you've seen the same movie. <br /> <br /> Yeah, I give the set-directors a lot of credit for making it 1930's vintage Los Angeles, but so what? <br /> <br /> None of the characters is sympathetic, the story seems aimless, Karen Black is just not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just icky. (And his character "Homer Simpson" makes me want the animated version. D'oh!) Then you had the creepy kid actor, the scary kid Billy Barty, etc. This is one of those movies that movie fans love and the rest of us look and go "What the hell!"
