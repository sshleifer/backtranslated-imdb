What happened to our dear Ramu? Is this the same man who made Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I refuse to believe. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he clearly jumped off the high cliff he ascended, giving industry some of the greatest works of all time. This movie is supposed to fall like a brick. I did not want to leave the theater, but I had to sit down because I could not park my car from the parking lot before others left. Otherwise, nothing would have made me sit outside the interval. <br /> <br /> This film is in no way close to Sholay. It does not even come close to being within a mile. I think Ramu certainly loves The Godfather more than Sholay, as Sarkar was a classic work. I read Ramu's interview a few days ago, in which the interviewer said that Ramu does not sleep more than 4 hours a day, even in one go. I totally agree with that now, since his lack of sleep probably called for the movie. <br /> <br /> There is no performance in performance. Amitabh Bachchan does not even look scary. He looked more frightening in the few posters and wallpapers I saw before. Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she did not have many dialogues (in fact, no, if I remember correctly). She opened her mouth in this movie and found a place in the story. The new man who plays Jai's role seems to have that brazen look, but did not make it at all. I can not go on ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too big for me to do it now. <br /> <br /> I've promised myself throughout the movie that I'll see the original Sholay again, just to see it's still there. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Terrible movie. The media and critics will cook Ramus goose. And to remind all readers, I'm one of the biggest Ramu fans, and I can not spare him for this act.
