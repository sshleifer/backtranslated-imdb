Rounding out the schedule is "Our Gang" (1929-30), in which "A Tough Winter" contains two storylines. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, who are home alone on a winter's day, decide to make some toffee. Little Wheezer passes Mary Ann the instructions from a radio cooking show. The problem: Wheezer passes on information from various shows and Mary Ann puts soap in the mix! Fun moments pop up when the rest of the gang shows up to pull the taffy - and end up being found throughout the house. <br /> <br /> The second plot is about Stepin Fetchit, a gang's neighbor / artisan, and his interactions with the gang. <br /> <br /> "A Tough Winter" has never been shown on TV to my knowledge, although it is available as a home video. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization, which shows a devious, sly and slowly moving character. "Our Gang" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a "talented comic" and used this "Our Gang" entry as a pilot for a fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day. Understandably, the characterization of Fetchit today is offensive to many people, which explains why the film was postponed. <br /> <br /> Although there are some fun moments with both Fetchit and Toffee, "A Tough Winter" is a sucker's snaking effort. If there was a positive effect from this film, the Hal Roach Studios became confident and experienced in conversation. The sound in the movie is good and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film has partially paved the way for the outstanding "Our Gang" films of the years 1930-31. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points.
