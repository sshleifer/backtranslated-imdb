This is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last one. This time, the parody is mostly from "The Ring", "Signs" and "8 Mile" for a strange reason. In my opinion, this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny. I laughed maybe three times and that's not enough for a comedy. I really enjoyed the first two, but this one was just stupid. If your jokes are corpses that are beaten up and people keep throwing things at each other, then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if your smart guy stays home enough and saves your money and stops making these kinds of movies, they're getting worse and worse.
