A shame that even a talented director, Desplechin, could not make a decent performance out of a poorly talented actress Phoenix, Esther Kahn lacks the substance to convey a very precise and clear plot. In an attempt to fill the concentric circle of an actor's plight, the performance and presentation is too unconventional and poorly executed to draw sympathy from the viewer. In too long a running time, the redundancy of Esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective, reducing the plot to a weak frame of catastrophic representation. The content is incoherent and unfounded, as Phoenix tries to carry out Desplechin's instruction, just as Esther supposedly tries to do the same. We have never had a convincing victory over Esther's pain, we never have a victory for Phoenix talent.
