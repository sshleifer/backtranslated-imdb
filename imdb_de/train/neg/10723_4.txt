The soul of an old mummy is passed on to one of his followers so that he can punish anyone involved in the desecration of his tomb. Soul transference lets the young man age at a tremendous rate until he himself resembles a mummy. One by one the blood is drained by those involved in the excavation. To be as short as possible, the pharaoh's curse is a rather lackluster affair. While the film presents some good, original ideas (bloodsucking mummies, soul transmissions, interesting make-up effects, tearing the scene, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, direction and tempo are the definition of idiots. To make things even worse, the first 15 of the relatively short 66-minute runtime of the film are just upholstery. Usually I go for these slow mummy movies, but Pharaoh's Curse even tests my patients. The cast helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodann is the only bright spot - Wish that the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character), the cast is just as boring as the script. After all, I do not know whose idea it was to put the mummified-looking servant in a seemingly sleeping pajama, but it's a ridiculous, ridiculous look for a creature that should scare the public. <br /> <br Despite my mostly negative comments on the pharaoh's curse, I'll rate him as 4/10. Certainly not a good rating, but generous given the problems I have with the film.
