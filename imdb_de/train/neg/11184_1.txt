This is a really horrible movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just writing this so some people are going to look at it somewhere. If I've stopped a person from wasting some of their precious life watching this movie, I'm going to die happily. <br /> <br /> Extremely boring, although I, with Al Pacino in the lead role, I could at any rate believe that at any point in time something interesting would happen. Then the credits spun, and I realized that I had been completely cheated to see this incredible fool. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie has achieved such a high score as on the IMDb (over 5 stars when I last saw the voting). Do you choose people ironically? <br /> <br /> Please, please, please, please, do not watch this movie!
