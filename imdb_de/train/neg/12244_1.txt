This movie is awful. The CGI is the very cheap, gray spot CGI. The crocodile looks like a big gray spot. The worst thing is that no effort is made to make it run or look alive. Mostly this is a photo-shipped CGI inserted into scenes, and you almost expect to see the hand moving the CGI spot across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen, and I've seen many of the very bad sci-fi channel movies. <br /> <br /> Apart from the terrible lack of special effects, the cast is composed of typical low-cost actors who are likely to work as waiters / waitresses with local guests while they wait for their big breaks. The most ridiculous scene in this movie may be when one of the bad guys tries to sexually assault Kate, and the giant crocodile jumps straight out of the water to the second floor of Villains headquarters and out the balcony, pulling the bad guy off Kate and instead rushing right through the building (and crushing Kate), the croc just flies backwards into the water at the same angle. No laws of physics can apply to this movie or special effects. At least there is honor among crocodiles.
