Oh my gosh ... I thought CBS primetime TV shows were the worst things Gerald McRaney appeared in. Four people experiment with a crazy mind control <br /> <br /> computer. That's it, do not lend it. <br /> <br /> I have seen it under one of its many titles - "Gray Matter", and it may be one of the worst films of recent memory. The other <br /> <br /> reviews are right, it's awful. Never before have so many well-established <br /> <br /> recordings been seen on screen, NEVER. The cast is awful, the direction <br /> <br /> is awful and the script is awful. I can not stress how horrible that is. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as if you were a smallpox. <br /> <br /> This is rated (PG) for physical violence, some gun violence, mild gore, some profanity, and some adult situations
