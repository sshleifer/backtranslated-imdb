Visually, this film is stunning. It has some gorgeous black comic moments. But on the whole the plot is very clich√©, as is the apparent message. If you are a fan of excessive violence in mainstream movies like Hostel or Saw, you will love it. If you are looking for something high, then drive away. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival 06, and I only chose it because I was looking for something disturbing. After all, it is not disturbing. Only grind and unpleasant to sit through. If you really want to be challenged, you will see something like The Lost. If you want to get stressed out or tell your friends about a really broken movie, then this is the place for you.
