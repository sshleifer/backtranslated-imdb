Oh man. If you want to give your internal Crow T. Robot a real workout, this is the movie you can put in the old VCR. The potential for dividing lines in this film is simply unlimited. <br /> <br /> (Minor spoilers are coming up, Hey, do you really care if a movie of this quality is "spoiled"?) Traci is a girl with a problem. Psychology has developed a name for when a child has a sexual infatuation with the opposite sex. But this girl seems to have one for same sex, and I do not think there is a term for it. Maybe it's because her mother Dana is played by Rosanna Arquette, whose sweet overbite, neo-flower child sexuality, and voluptuous character tempts me to forgive her a lot of bad movies or disagreeable characters. Not only is Dana unaware of her daughter's behavior here; She seems to be fighting for the gold medal in the Olympic Indulgent Mother competition. <br /> <br /> It's possible that Dana will miss Tracis murderous series because the truth is told, Traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster. The only reason is that the screenplay dictates that it can do any kind of body count. <br /> <br /> A particularly funny comment in this film is the character of Carmen, a Mexican maid described by Dana as long as she is like a family, though she dresses the way the director would say : "I just fell from the tomato cart of Guadalajara." Carmen is so wise on Tracis plan, she could also have a sign saying "Hey, I'm the next victim!" Carry. Sure, Traci confronts Carmen as Carmen returns from the show and brings her together with one of those slightly angled wheel wrenches that automakers put a joke on their spare parts. I suspect, rather than in real life, that these things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for a tire change. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, Arquette wears a faint dress to a vineyard under a cloudy sky and talks to the owner. Cut in another flimsy dress under a sunny sky and talk to the owner's brother. Then she cuts the first dress, in the first place under a cloudy sky - but it will be later. You get the picture. We talk really bad about the direction. <br /> <br /> As for the skin, you can not expect much, although Traci has some nice bikinis. <br /> <br /> For those looking for garbage, 8. For everyone else 1/2.
