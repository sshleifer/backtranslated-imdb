The director clearly said that the idea and the plot of this film are completely original. However, as far as those who read the slam-dunk comic, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes ... <br /> Another clue is Jay Chow himself. Know Do not mess with Kung Fu. It does not impress anyone when he tries to act as he can. Many people today can see the differences. Luckily, the movie does not include much of KunG Fu fighting and much of it is enchanted by stunners and visual effects ... <br /> <br /> I think Jay's actors are still a pain, especially if almost everyone else so much better in the movie. The only reason I think that Jay is the main actor is simply his popularity. Despite all efforts, I would like to prevent anyone from viewing this movie, so this "original" movie gets what it should not have turned into one of China's best budget films for this year.
