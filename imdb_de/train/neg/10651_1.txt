Want to learn the secret of creating a Slasher movie set in a fitness center? Simply fill the movie with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and let them bump and drag them to the floor like in a gentleman's club. That's what the creators of this terrible Slasher movie did, and this little gimmick kept me watching to the bitter end. This is the worst Slasher movie I have ever seen, but every time I was ready to change channel, they would add another scene with the training girls and I would stay. As a Slasher movie, Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of. As a showcase for beautiful girls who train, it is a success. To avoid a strong recommendation, unless you like the idea that half the movie is a big T & A show.
