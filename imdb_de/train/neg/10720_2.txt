I saw this movie last weekend and is stupid and pointless. An ancient curse makes a man in his pajamas a mummy? The victims are scared and can not avoid an old man. They let their torches fall and tremble instead of trying to ward it off or burn it. Quentin aka Mr Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster aka, Miss Canfield, of Beaver Fame. Wow, love plot. The rest of the cast simply follows in the graves, waiting for screams to respond and come to their aid. The Egyptian girl does not look bad, but it does not give much to the movie. Where is the mummy? Really just a curse unleashed. Universal Mummy movies are not in the least a torch. Watch this movie if you want to sleep because you are being dosed.
