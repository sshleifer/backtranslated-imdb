The message of this film is "Personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is said to be the "ugly duckling," but the funny thing is she's not ugly at all (in fact, she's much more attractive than her friend Uma Thurman, who looks like a model). > Well, would this movie work if the "Ugly Duckling" were really unattractive? When will Hollywood stop this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is ridiculous despite the message it wants to convey. <br /> <br />
