The movie earns 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl (I'm sorry, I'm biased, I think the pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies) and 0.5 for the fact that it's shorter than Azumi 1. I have Azumi 1 and 2 seats seen in 1. I was amazed myself when I was able to prevail. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the pluses of the movie. The girl. Ueto Aya is cute. That's all to save the whole movie. The fact is, if the main character was male, I'm sure most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all. <br /> <br /> Now we can talk about the minuses. First, it is really uncomfortable, with many and many repeated scenes. Scenes of Nachi and Azumi keep coming back. It seems more like a dramaturgy. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks and also this movie. Second, the film is too unrealistic in a historical context. I have nothing against unrealistic films. But this movie is a bad way to show creativity by throwing ninjas like bears and cobwebs and so on. It reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. To illustrate "I do not know" what effect it has, the director films people who die with blood spraying (literally) around ... people who do not know their heads were cut off ... etc .. etc ... etc ... Too many of them spoil the show. It seems like the anime influence in this movie is strong. The show is greatly affected. Third, Azumi should not be an assassin. She seems more like a one man army, only she is a woman. I do not think you see murderers storm into army camps. The only time I felt she had behaved like a "murderer" was when she killed Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. After all, the plot was thin in both films. It is a linear representation without any development and surprises.
