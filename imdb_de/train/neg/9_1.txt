This is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. It tears apart almost all types of thriller and manages to make all of them a mess. <br /> <br /> There is not a single good line or a good character in the whole mess. If there was a conspiracy, it was an afterthought, and as far as acting is concerned, there is nothing good to say, so I will not say anything. I honestly can not understand how this kind of nonsense is produced and actually published. Did anyone ever think, "Oh my god, that's a shit," and call it a day. Such a crap that people download illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different movie, at least if you have downloaded it, you have wasted neither time nor money. Do not waste time, it's painful.
