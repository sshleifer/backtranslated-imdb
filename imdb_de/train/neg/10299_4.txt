I must admit that I took the trouble to think that something had to happen apart from the corpse in the first scenes ... and its disposal over him. I was wrong. It was a movie screening of Betty Hits The Beach, which was encased by Mordant Morven for the first part. I really do not care what young Scottish girls do today, who your screw is and what drugs they use. Visually, the walk through the Cabo de Gata in Andalusia was pleasant and certainly the highlight for me. Nadir was the shop for her dead friend. When the movie was over, I had two thoughts ... 1. That's all there is to it? 2. Now I see why her friend killed herself. Rename it. "Bare Bitch Boredom or what I did on my trip to Spain." I'm such a jerk that I can handle these things.
