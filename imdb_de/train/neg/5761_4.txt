Hollywood does it again. Lots of money, no creativity. I'm sure the authors had something other than oxygen when they wrote this. Based on the previews, I thought this would be a funny movie. But if you are not familiar with the latest stupid pop culture, you will miss the most stupid humor in this movie. Why are you wasting your time? You can sit on a log without doing anything and have more fun than this movie offers. <br /> <br />
