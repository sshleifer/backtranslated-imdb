In order to improve the drama of this sudden birth, she is located in a special department for "difficult cases". The main story is that of Loretta Young; She is on leave from a long prison for murder. Will the doctors save their baby at the cost of their lives, or mind their husband's request for the opposite? Melodrama and feeling are dominant, and they are not the honest variety, to say the least. For example, just to keep things moving, this hospital has a psycho-station next to the maternity ward and lets a woman run around with a hysterical pregnancy to steal babies. <br /> <br /> There's just enough laugh and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a Warners movie, mainly by Glenda Farrell, who drinks gin out of her hot water bottle while waiting to have twins and finds her sorrow they now have a law against the sale. An example of her answer: "Be careful." Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon, of course, is wonderfully authoritarian as an overseer, but do not expect her to have a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the movie is that the sight of a baby makes everyone brew. Despite the obvious limitations, this movie should have been better than it is.
