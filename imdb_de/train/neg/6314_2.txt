I love Seth Green. His appearances on THAT 70s' show are always worth watching, but last night I felt that the show had to be reworked. Four young men inherit an apartment in New York City for which most of us would die. The grandmother must have been an heiress who had this room at all. I felt that the need for realism should have come out. Anyway, the conspiracy about four best friends who got this apartment was unbelievable. I would have been thrilled if they had to be confiscated from one of their parents, which would have contributed to the humor and malfunction of the show. There did not seem to be much humor in it. I only watch it because it falls on a winning Thursday night before My Name Earl. I think they should go back, scrapping this series and starting over. We need more family series. How about Seth and his friends moving in with their crazy parents in the suburbs after a fire burns down? You could let Dabney Coleman play father and Christine Estabrook, mother and dysfunctional siblings. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is endless and the network is bursting.
