Thoughtless, ignorant, ill-considered, career killer (where is the talented Angela Jones now?), Profoundly indecent garbage. No wonder Reb Braddock has not directed anything since then - anyone who has the opportunity to make his first film on his own terms, based on his own script, with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself, and creates something like THIS, anyone who feels that this is a story worth telling the world, and does not deserve a second break. Under the circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they are told, and they do it well. It's just that they should not have done it. <br /> <br /> 0 of 4.
