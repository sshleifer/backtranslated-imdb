This was a rip-off of the same garbage we had seen half an hour before to see Bob Saget's host. Dave Coulier just thought it was funny, and it was pretty much the same show as America's Funniest Home Videos, except for a host who had a combined IQ of three. Tawny Kitaen really needed the money, and Coulier had to go to the bin for his jokes. It was torture enough to see him imitating Popeye and other tense comic launches on Full House. This guy, who has played all practical jokes about everyone, deserves to be at the end of an A-class. Coulier had to have money to please Alannis Morisette while they were together.
