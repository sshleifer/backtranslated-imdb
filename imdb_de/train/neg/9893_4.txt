I just hope no classicist / historian has seen "Cleopatra" or, if they did, make it laugh. The film is terribly inaccurate, even more ridiculous than "Gladiator" (at least a well-written script whose historical errors are articulate and well-suited to the story). Octavius, Caesar's heir, is in the Senate before the assassination of Caesar: at the ripe age of 19! <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the acting is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than a trace of James Bond in him when he says, "Caesar, Julius Caesar." Billy Zane is a ridiculously dense Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela strives to be the seductive pharaoh (who did not look good at all in real life), but seems unbelievable. <br /> <br /> This is a warning to all historians - this movie does not match life!
