More people are probably afraid of the dentist than little monsters or scary-looking puppets. That makes it a perfect theme for a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years, but when he gets caught by his wife cheating on him with the poolguy, he snaps and brings his anger and frustration into his job. Well, give a crazy dentist a drill and a mouth, and you can probably guess what's going to happen next ... Especially the end is a big disappointment. Last note: In this case, look for Mark Ruffalo (you can count on me, eternal sunshine ...). <br /> <br /> 5/10.
