I once promised never to get out of a movie (a personal policy that made me suffer from a variety of filth such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost made it. Dog days was a really terrible experience. Anyone watching this movie will think that the Austrians are a pathetic, pathetic bunch of retards. It shows a world in which love and humanity do not exist, a world in which people humble themselves for one reason only - to distract themselves from their miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-style with non-professional actors (most of which come from the imagination of Austrian shock-caricaturist Deix), director Seidl wants to directly believe that this is real in the suburbs of Austria (in Europe? West?). The viewer is confronted with depictions of gender orgies, violence against women and the disabled, insanity and humiliation. However, this is not a social criticism. This is a pure shock without aesthetic value. Instead, you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If someone needs a movie like this to see that things are wrong in our society, that person has to go through life with eyes closed. This is pseudo-social criticism with a sledgehammer. And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people - that's not why I hate it. But it shows average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And that's why this movie is really despicable.
