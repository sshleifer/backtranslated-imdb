This movie was incredibly bad. I saw it at the San Francisco Film Festival 2004. Before it started, the owner of the theater got up and told us that half of the audience had left the theater the night before, which happened to be his "world premiere". I do not think anyone in the theater understood how bad the movie would be at this point. We all understood until the end. <br /> <br /> It's not a documentary, though it was sold as a kind. Dark Angel was a bad biography and a false homage to Bettie Paige, in which half the movie is really just remakes of old Bettie Paige movies. The movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of these 90 minutes is below average. A scene would start to go, then someone said "wow you're so good, Bettie, why do not we make another movie?" It was followed by a 5-minute remake of Bettie Paige that was almost as ridiculous (and even boring as the normal part of the movie). At the end of the movie, people laughed every time another remake of Bettie Paige appeared. it was so ridiculous. I heard a lot of laughter in this theater, but people did not laugh with the filmmaker, they laughed at the film and its poor content and structure. This was easy to see because the parts that would have laughed the most were the ones that should be serious or enlightening. <br /> <br /> I know that movies are expensive. I have seen a lot of cheaply produced independent films, but somehow they differ from anything I have ever seen in the cinematography and quality of this film. The movie looks like it was made for $ 12. The cuts, the graininess and the lack of a sensual conspiracy made this experience an unforgettable experience. This movie makes "Dude, where is my car?" look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> My friends and I left the theater feeling like we had just paid $ 8 to be tortured. The only redeeming part of the experience was that we had to laugh at the fact that somebody had actually made this movie and that it was good. Apparently, last night, the night of the "world premiere" that the director / producer / producer had been in the audience, witnessed how people laughed and left his film. Bettie Paige's films were destroyed. You should also destroy this movie.
