Note: I could not force myself to write a constructive review of Prom Night. That simply does not work. Instead, I went through what I thought while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Things I thought about when I saw Prom Night: <br /> <br /> -I am so tired of those dreams, where these elaborate deaths will only take place when the main character wakes up, before she bites her. When I say "work out causes of death", I mean, of course, that the throat stings in the throat area or in the stomach. Was not the whole thing "it's just a dream" ruined by Dallas? Speaking of that, I wonder if a pair stabbed in the stomach, will lead to death immediately. <br /> <br /> - The movie is only ten minutes away and I can already count the horror clich√©s on two hands. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - After meeting the friend of the protagonist, I am sure that he will die. Does anyone want to place bets? <br /> <br /> - The killer in this movie is a teacher obsessed by the main character Donna. (By the way, does anyone believe that "Donna" is a horrible name for a main character in a horror movie?) He spends three years in a high-security prison before he breaks out and finds Donna celebrating her high school prom. Although there is no taste for the taste, I seriously wonder who would take all the time to look for someone as boring as Donna. <br /> <br /> -High schools allow promenades to take place in hotels and not keep track of students. Apparently, students can buy a hotel room and get on and off as they wish. I suppose if this point of action were not there, the movie would be 90 minutes long, when people get bored out of their minds and bite into the dust at every walkway when they go to the bathroom. I think the compromise for her excitement is my boredom with everything. I've already played "Count the pieces of chewed chewing gum under the seat" and "guess how much money I have in my wallet" and I'm only in the 20-minute mark. How else will I talk? <br /> <br /> -Note to myself: Do not forget to make milk and bread on the way home. <br /> <br /> - Beautiful Writer: You needed enough false anxiety to get through this movie and any other horror remake this year. <br /> <br /> - The 1980s version of this movie was not that good, but compared to this remake it was like Citizen Kane or at least The Godfather. It had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of their many horror movies after Halloween and it ended up with a little twist. I miss Jamie Lee. I wish she would do more. <br /> <br /> Appearance at the prom, there is not much dance. Instead, the girls argue with their friends about where they want to go to college. I hear all these colleges being educated by name, and I wonder who needs to question these girls at the entrance exam to get in. <br /> <br /> - The killer has to carry a bag of really effective cleansers and wipe his mess between the scenes. That's the only logical explanation why he can stab someone on the carpet or in the bathroom. When someone goes to the hotel room, there is no sign of a fight. (On another side note: This is a very lazy killer, Michael Myers was on the hunt for his victims, I'm just saying it) <br /> <br /> -It's official: the entire audience in the theater is on the killer rooted. What triggered it? Was it always when Donna returned to her hotel room while sirens went off and ordered everyone to leave the building? Was it her constant dreams, and how much she insisted on playing her footsteps after she had gone through something dramatic? Or was not it the convincing performance of Brittany Snow? I have to say it was all up. <br /> <br /> -Okay, who had "he dies in the third act"? You win the pot. <br /> <br /> - Finally the movie is over. My friend turns to me and says, "Donna was not too smart." That's the understatement of the week. A bit of a tornado is a small gust of wind, or a week's blackout is a slight drawback. <br /> <br /> -I can not wait to find Rotten Tomatoes and see if anyone has given a positive feedback. <br /> <br /> -I can not recommend that. I can not recommend that. This horror movie is as lazy as any other, and the only way to enjoy its cheese-smelling schedule is when you are under the influence of at least ten beers. And for theatergoers, unfortunately, no alcohol is served. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out of ****
