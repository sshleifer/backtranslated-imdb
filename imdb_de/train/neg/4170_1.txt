That is simply unsurpassable. If there's a story somewhere, she's so deeply buried under the awful characters and shattering camerawork that she's imperceptible. There's a group of vampire hunters doing their thing, and the vampires who kill them have little aliens in them. They stick their heads out and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine a blood-and-blooded alien sock puppet screaming in horror as a cowboy guy zaps her with a cattle bull, then you get this. These people are loud, abominable, violent and just extremely annoying. Then there are some anti-human people standing around in their CGI spacecraft so incredibly pompous that it's impossible to endure. These people make Hillary Clinton look like a right-wing extremist. They are friends with a few vampires or something ... who cares. <br /> <br /> Then there is the camera. Do you remember how everyone hated the thousand cuts per minute of the last rollball remake? The people who made this movie love the stuff. There's enough for three really shitty Nu-Metal videos on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing smells. By comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
