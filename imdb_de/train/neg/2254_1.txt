OK, folks, to be honest ... that must be one of the worst movies about show biz ever made, but I laughed myself silly (which was probably the reason why I enjoyed it). Basically, it's all about sex, sex and achieving your own 15 minutes of fame. Did I mention that sex was a major issue in this movie? If you value bizzzzare characters and light entertainment, watch this movie if you have the chance (and have nothing better to do). <br /> <br /> *** Attention spoiler !!! *** The funniest thing in the movie was the guy who asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) On the show and flash his wallet with his sweetheart Pictures A Triple A for Bad Taste and Fun!
