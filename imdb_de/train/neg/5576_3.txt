If you talk about Japanese cinema today, most people do not talk about Rashomon or the Seven Ronins or Ran. For the masses, Japanese cinema means all those monsters we love to destroy these Japanese cities again and again, often in battles with each other. The first and greatest of them is Godzilla, who has come back a dozen times or more, confronting three-headed Hydra in some movies like a space-ghost, Ghidrah. The special effects got a little better. But the charm of these old films was also that the paper mache city sets were destroyed. They looked so fake, maybe three steps over Ed Wood. Some visitors from the future have traveled to Japan to urge that Godzilla be destroyed from its first discovery. In fact, he was discovered in the Second World War as a surviving dinosaur, when he protected the Japanese crew on a Pacific island from these American troops. But later, with Bikini's nuclear tests, Godzilla, the friendly dinosaur, just like Barney, the vicious machine we've met in the cinema, has been ruined by Japan so it will not become the economic colossus that existed in 1991 the movie came out. I do not want to say more, but we all know that Japan is doing relatively well. <br /> <br /> Like all other Japanese monster movies, just sit back and enjoy the chaos.
