I'm giving four out of ten stars, dots or marks or something. <br /> <br /> There were two really funny scenes in this movie. All scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) moved pleasantly. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual way of dealing with stereotypes, frantic speed and a stupid soundtrack. and "soundtrack" is generous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two really funny scenes were Amy P. She's just totally funny in an animal way. It is a mix of the Monkeys Sketch they make on SNL and Lucille Ball. I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) just agreed that they did it for the money, because if, then then we had the Sarah Palin parodies born, then we can say yes, it did worth bringing the black man back to the servants who are really there to help you be more human <br /> Blah. 4 out of 10, as I said, is generous. <br /> <br /> But not more girls, OK? Oh, I almost forgot. The mother of "Two and a Half Men" is in this movie, and she has undergone some sort of plastic surgery so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30-year-old, so I try in every scene she chooses to rearrange her face or put it in my head or simply answer the question, "No. Wait, wait, did she have a plastic surgery?" Because as a viewer, you really do not want her to undergo a plastic surgery.
