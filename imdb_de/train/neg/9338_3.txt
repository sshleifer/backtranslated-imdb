Pam Grier plays the lead role as Coffy. She is a nurse looking for revenge because of the drug dealers who have inspired her sister by the evil heroine. As with any Blaxploitation movie of the 70s, you can expect the racist villains to only get their desserts. <br /> <br /> There were dozens of these films shot in the 70's and they were really humiliating for both the black and white audiences. This is mainly due to the violent racial hostility in these films and the degrading, stereotypical characters. Especially the female characters. <br /> <br /> Other common threads between Coffy and other films of this kind are brutal violence, corrupt police, car chases, generous amount of nudity, and sexually explicit beautiful women. Not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug dealers, pimps, gangsters, and other criminal scum. Pam Grier, the undisputed queen of 70-year-old blaxploitation heroines. She was great, both stubborn and absolutely stunning. As in her other films, Pam outshines the other characters in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on screen that these types of films can not be surpassed without them as the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, you better watch her other films like Foxy Brown or maybe Friday Foster. These movies have much less emptiness than Coffy. Pam's character in Coffy degrades too much to get the bad guys. Pam's characters in her other Blaxploitation films do not stoop to take revenge, as Coffy did. <br /> <br /> I would say, just watch Coffy if you can not see any of Pam Grier's other films. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress makes viewing of Coffy bearable.
