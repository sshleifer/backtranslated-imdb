Of all the movies I've seen, this, The Rage, has to be one of the worst. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialogue made me scream in pain. "How can someone come up with such a shit?" Gary Busey is known for his "B" movies, but this is a sure "W" movie. (W = waste). <br /> <br /> Take for example: About two dozen FBI and local law enforcement officers surround a trailer house with a jeep. Inside the jeep is MA and is "confused" why all the cops are about to. Within seconds, a massive gun battle ensues and MA is killed instantly. Policemen pounce on the jeep while Gary and her companions carry them along. The cops fall like dominoes, and the jeep with Gary moves around in a circle and is not hit by a bullet. MA is killed and Gary does not seem to have noticed - the guy is tough. Truly a miracle, since the six hundred with 300 bullets there has been such a miracle.
