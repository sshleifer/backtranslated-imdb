Do not listen to the misleading title "werewolf woman". Europeans are known to value sex and nudity in their horror films, but this one is just too much. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have a dark sex scene behind it, in which the title character goes crazy and brutally kills her partner. The first few times are fun, but a hundred minutes of it quickly become very monotonous. She is not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can not even decide on its tone. The first ten minutes (a flashback) were legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I would have a trash classic after that), a rather poor character study of the woman who is repeatedly maltreated and tortured into a revenge thriller. In the end, the director insists that this is based on a true story. Fine. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some entertaining aspects of production. The title Werewolf Woman is an eye-catcher and there are some nice gore effects and nude scenes. These, however, quickly become drab. The dubbed dialogue is quite funny in a camp-like manner, especially the most buzzing doctor in the world (he drinks at work). Unfortunately, the movie quickly gets pretty irritating. There is no actual action or anything else. It's a shame because when I read a description, I thought the film had real potential. "Werewolf Woman" is way too long, slow moving and a bit too pointless, even for the standards of the exploitation genre. (4/10)
