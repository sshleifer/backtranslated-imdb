That was really the worst movie I have ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely terrible throughout the movie, the hair is so bad! They talk like monotone voices and there is no chemistry. The cover of the DVD is not nearly as far as the movie actually is. Really boring. I had to go through a few things because watching was so painful. I really want to know how anyone on earth could think that this is good? hhaha, they literally talk like "talk" and say "yeah" and there is no passion. I could not say that they were in love. I'm sorry, but this was the saddest apology for a movie I've ever seen.
