After 30 seconds, I felt like this was going to be a bad movie, but I did not know how bad it was. Then the actor playing the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth, and my friend and I decide that in order to survive this movie, we must turn down the volume, put together our own dialogues, and double the speed on the DVD. That did not help. About halfway we turned it off. I have seen some very bad movies, both with and without the assistance of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are only a few films that I doubt even the bots can save. Most of the film that bothered me the most was that people hypnotized believing that zombies had rotten green skin. I think they were all hypnotized into death and then hypnotized into rotting themselves. Stick to the real B-movie cult classics like "Plan Nine From Outer Space."
