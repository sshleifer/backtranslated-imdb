Normally I would not write a comment online, but this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Not only is it filmed like a series of soaps ("The young and the restless" is actually filmed by professionals in comparison), it also has terrible cuts. It has no action. It is full of useless garbage. <br /> <br /> Here is an example: A man wants to kill the main character because he was fired because of him. So (after a lot of crap) here they are: The guy puts a knife to his neck and says something like "You're dead now". Then the main character says, "If you kill me, you're dead. I told the police that you're threatening me." So the (killer) guy is like (just about to cry): "Oh no ... the cops are following me !? !! Oh ... my god." <br/> just an example. I really can not believe that this movie actually exists. So: IF you want to see the worst movie ever ... continue, I recommend it :)
