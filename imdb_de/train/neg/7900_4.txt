The title creatures devastate a peaceful little desert town. That's basically the whole storyline for this movie, and while the scenes dedicated to the munchies themselves are fun (in a modest way), the rest is just filler and poor filler. From the "hero" who is a painful Woody Allen wannabe, to the ultra-urban city policeman, it's hard to pick the most irritating character in the movie. There were times when almost everyone was on the screen together and I thought, "Okay, at least the girlfriend is cute, but why do we have to put up with the other fools?" The film also includes pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair) that were probably dated as early as the early '90s. (* 1/2)
