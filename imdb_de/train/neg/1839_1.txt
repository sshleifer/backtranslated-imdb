I could not wait to put this movie in my DVD player when I rented it. After I started it, I could not wait to get it out of my DVD player. Actually, I saw the whole movie. My wife and I have always waited and waited for something funny to happen, but nothing funny happens. The box read how it would be really funny. The premise of the movie sounds good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How could this movie be missing? Well .... it is missing! This is the most unruly "comedy" I've ever seen. Nobody I talked to thought it was even funny. It's just a really weak movie. Trust me. Avoid it ... AVOID IT !!
