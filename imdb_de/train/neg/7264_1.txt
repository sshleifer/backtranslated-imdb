Just another movie in which male nudity is taken advantage of from the beginning. horrible drama and love scenes are the most un-sexy I've ever seen (and I'm not concerned that I associate the idea of ​​two young men who love each other because I'm gay). <br /> <br /> As in Mil nubes de paz, director Julian Hernandez shot an incredibly challenging film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes, but makes a 2-hour movie with it ... And this time There is not even the topic of racism and commodification in the Mexican gay community that you could talk about! God, gracious, have mercy on us!
