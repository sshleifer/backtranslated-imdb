Admitting to fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty hard admission for a heterosexual. But what can I tell you? Maybe the famous extra is something everyone talks about and turns a star into a star. It crosses this barrier. It draws you into unknown sensual and emotional areas. Brando had it in Pik, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper and of course James Dean and more recently Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt has redefined the concept from a single source. He's the only reason to go out, get in the car, find a parking space, buy a ticket, buy popcorn and go to a theater to see "Troy". If you do not, go ahead anyway, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.
