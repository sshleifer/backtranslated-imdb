Tenants Two writers strive to complete their books in an almost empty dwelling. They help each other first and then slowly the tension builds up between them. <br /> <br /> This is based on a Bernard Malamud novel, and unfortunately everyone speaks as if he were in this novel. The dialogue is very little natural, it is purple and full of nuances of meaning. It's as if an English major at the university wrote the script with a head full of claims. It's awful and I was immediately immune to everything the movie had to say, which is a pity as the movie is populated from top to bottom with great performances. Snoop Dog Down is a good form, but unfortunately none of them can overcome the falseness of the words and the premise. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this movie. Although it is not really bad, it is very preaching and pretentious, so you really want to go. I lost less than a third of the interest and had to fight through to the end. If you are interested, I would try the cable, but I would not spend good money on it.
