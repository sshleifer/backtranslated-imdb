This film was awarded in 1990 with the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film. Over the last few weeks, I've seen dozens of nominees and winners from the past 30 years. I really think that this movie might be the worst of all - and it was not just a candidate, but a nominee won !! I assume 1989 was a terrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> The film features a group of characters that look a bit like a super-tight Uncle Festers. There seem to be simple articulated figures moving with stop-motion animation. All are identical - with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that everyone has a different number on their backs. They all stand on a large platform that hangs in space as if by magic. Everyone has a pole and there is also a box on the platform. The platform starts to tilt slightly and in response the men move to balance the platform. This goes on for the longest and on and on and on and on. The only relief from this boredom is when one of them tends to be uncomfortable toward the end, but it's not enough to enjoy watching it in the least. Apart from passable stop-motion animations, these shorts are nothing interesting for me ... NOTHING. By the way, the big short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why was not among the nominees. It was a great short and far better than any of the nominees this year or the year before. Maybe Pixar's success has led to a downfall in the past few years, but KNICK KNACK is so smart and so funny it almost seems criminal to have ignored it. Could not Pixar have entered it? This seems unlikely.
