Well, I'm not a movie critic, but I really hated the "9/11". This movie was generally bad. With the exception of Alejandro González Iñárritu's segment, which presented the theme most effectively and directly, the short films were at best boring and, in the worst case, offensive. The worst thing in my eyes was Youssef Chahine's demanding segment in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers with American soldiers, even to the point where the suicide bombers fight for a bigger cause. The segment was completely inappropriate and, given Chahine's apparent lack of decency, was a waste of my time and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a film with their views on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice it was tasteless.
