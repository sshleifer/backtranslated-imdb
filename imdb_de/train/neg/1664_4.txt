This movie is entertaining enough, thanks to a great performance by Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsey Haun is adorable. The reason why the movie is so predictable is that we've seen it all before. I have not read the book A Mother's Gift yet, but I hope for Britney and Lynne Spears, it's a different story than this movie. If you do not think that a movie with a music video should end as an original idea, the entire movie reminds of the plagiarized word.
