I can not believe how uneducated this movie is. It's like watching the police academy, just with people who have no idea what they're talking about, and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot to be a buddy. I can understand the suspension of unbelief, but that's just stupidity. Not only is there no conspiracy to this movie. It's like watching someone pretend to be a doctor and whirling non-medical words as if he was the head of the staff at a major medical facility. In addition, people wear clothes that are inappropriate for a space program. I feel like I'm watching a "b" movie of the Valley Girls in space.
