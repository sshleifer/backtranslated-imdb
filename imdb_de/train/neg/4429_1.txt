What a stupid threesome. <br /> <br /> I will not even waste time evaluating one of the points of this show. It is not worth the time. The only comment I'll make is - why get such a DUMB, an inarticulate fool, to be the star?!? <br /> <br /> There are not many grim testimonials to the worsening mental state of the networks than the fact that FOX has stated that it will NOT bring back John Doe (a decent series), but WILL will be mindless death like Joe Millionaire for another round of killing the brain cells of the American public. <br /> <br /> FOX has lost it, IMHO.
