This movie was not nearly as much a chore as I expected. There's a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic UFO conspiracy paranoia feast. Most of the plays are mediocre but quite typical of the stuff of the 70s filled with pregnant pauses. A photographer and a model are witnesses of strange processes in the forest and will soon fall prey to the same incidents. Flying saucers are being discovered, more people are disappearing - but are they the aliens or the secret allies of our own government? Soon, a reporter and a "UFOlogist" (apparently modeled on the character of the author-director) are drawn into this enigmatic fiasco and become the target of the secret agents, who are as threatening as they are unlikely and funny. Then the fun really starts. <br /> <br /> The movie predictably makes as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be praised for taking it so seriously. The camera work is fine for a low-budget movie, the tempo is pretty good, the script is stupid and absurd, and there are continuity issues to look out for. What are the few seconds of brilliance that I mentioned? Honestly, I can not tell you much without writing a spoiler. Suffice to say that the end of the movie is worth at least a fast-forward if you can not take the middle.
