Sure, if you ask a mother who is the most beautiful baby in the world, she would tell you that her son is the greatest kid in the world. She is right, at least in her own world. <br /> <br /> The producers of the movie were Biggie's mother and his good friend Puffy. Well, do I have to say more? I will divide it for those who do not want to do a simple deduction. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fake. You can just put together a couple of Biggie's MTV videos and call it a movie. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggie's mother. The real one in life looks like a dog. <br /> <br /> I'm just wondering why he called Biggie small. Big body Small cock? Big mouth small tone? Big fat little eyes? Disclaimer: I am a person of color. So keep your racist remark to yourself.
