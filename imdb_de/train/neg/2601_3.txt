I have just seen the movie for the first time. I wanted to see it because I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early films. <br /> <br /> The film is about a girl (played by the young and beautiful Drew Barrymore) who moves from NYC to LA to overcome his recent loss. Shortly after she fell in love with a man who falls in love with her, it is obvious that she has an evil twin brother who followed them. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty poor and lousy. Both the dialogues and the acting make the movie not really worth seeing. In summary, it's just for the fans of Drew Barrymore.
