This is absolutely the stupidest movie I have ever seen. What a waste of a great cast. This is James Cromwell as the envoy of the ignorant. I could go on and on, but obviously I would spend more time on this review than anyone who has ever worked in the script. The only thing that's going on in this movie is that we're against it and how you can enjoy profane slapstick beyond any reasonable human tolerance. This is one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen - and I love James Garner.
