This film offers nothing new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross-cultural love story that was carried by politics in the mid-20th century / before World War II in India, where the British and their modern way are evil and the primitive ones but honest and true Indian good. Certainly, such stereotypical depictions of the British are now quite pass√©. Apart from the drama that drives the second part of the film, the narrative is predictable, acting is pedestrian and two-dimensional, and the direction is obvious and uninspired. <br /> <br /> The story really needed to be refined and would certainly have benefited from another half-hour of screen time to give the characters and narration more depth and give the viewer something to feel in < br /> <br /> All in all rather uninspired. Oh, and Linus Roache just can not make a tragedy - getting in the eye with emotional pain just does not work for me!
