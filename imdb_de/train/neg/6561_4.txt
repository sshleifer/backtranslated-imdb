The opening sequence will show the arrival of the Legion on November 13, 1918 in Paris. The troops are stacking the train. They wear the uniform in which the French army, including the Legion, went to war in 1914. This is a sure sign that the war movie you are about to see will be a turkey. (The French army realized in 1915 that the war in red trousers and dark blue coats did not work: French metropolitans were deployed in "horizontal blue" and colonial troops in khaki.) Claude Van-Damme's remake has at least made the uniforms more or less right. Really a pity if directors make such mistakes, if they then try to put things in order.
