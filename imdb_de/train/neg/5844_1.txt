This movie is easily one of the worst I've ever seen. And I do not mean that well. We wanted to see a crappy horror / thriller, so we chose the one that seemed the worst in the store. For once the movie was everything we expected. And more! (Or should I say less?) <br /> <br /> The actors look like they read their lines of posters behind the camera. The so-called special effects are created by placing red clear plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are looking through the eyes of the killer rats. And the script? Do not even let me start the script ... And when you thought it could not get any worse, it turns out that the first part of the movie was Oscar material compared to the end. <br /> <br /> Take it from me, this movie is weird if you like crappy horror movies, but if you want a good movie, keep watching. That's not for you.
