The movie is bad. Nothing special - just a "children's film" without serious cause. However, there is one reason you should be aware of: the animal talk. Some of them are so funny what they say, you just can not stop laughing. So, if you want to hear a dog say "I'm Keyser Soze" in a dog fight, or another animal says, "You walk like a dead cat?" Because there is no other good movie to watch. Vote: 4 out of 10
