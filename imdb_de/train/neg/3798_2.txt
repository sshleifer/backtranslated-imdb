And that's the only reason why I own this DVD. Now I have not seen the first Nemesis movie, but I looked at the information and I say here: What? Why? Because in the first movie Alex was male. But then it was the first one in the future again, so maybe this Alex is brand new and the scientist just happened to make Alex female. Who knows, at least it was not addressed in the film in any way. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot: Alex, then a baby (or whatever you want, as it was, is in the future) escapes with her mother on a special time ship and ends up in the 80s Years in Africa. There Mommy is killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in an African tribe. Then the tribe is slaughtered by a cyborg from the future and Alex runs and hides and finally kills the cyborg. So there sounds familiar, right? Terminator is not the only movie that gets torn up here, Predator gets its fair share, and I think the first fly movie, Vincent Price, will be a particular nomination for creating a solid foundation for building your cyborg. <br /> <br /> Let's see, what else? Okay, the movie was a normal budget budget, but had bad special effects for a movie from the mid-90s. It would still have been okay for an 80s strip. The biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer is hardly interested. Nemesis 2 is not the shabbiest piece of cinema I was allowed to enjoy (?), But it's damn close. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about acting, because be honest: Did anyone expect Oscar-worthy performances here? Well ... At least I found Sue Price hot in this Amazonian warrior-type. <br /> <br /> A "real" movie rating: 2/10 There are not many professionals on the quality. And despite the fundamental plot, the film itself makes little sense. <br /> <br /> A Campfilm Rating: 4/10 I occasionally have to laugh because the movie is so bad that it's little merit in it
