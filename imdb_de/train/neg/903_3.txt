"Stella Dallas" dating back to 1937 with Barbara Stanwyck has not aged very well - as anyone thought, a half-updated version of the story would work now is a real mystery. Maybe they thought the cheeky, cheeky Bette Midler might make a difference, but that shrill script defeats them. Do something about a bartender who has an illegitimate baby, and years later, when she gives the young girl to the child's rich dad so she can embark on a better life, and not the shabby, old-fashioned attractions and feel can escape. Midler works best with a movie director who can control their excesses, but that does not happen here. Stephen Collins is as rigid as the man who changes her life, but Trini Alvarado is well staffed as Midler's daughter. This was once referred to as the "image of a woman", a swallow that is not passed because it remains faithful to the origins of the 1930s. * 1/2 of ****
