I went to "Evening" because of the cast. That's why I was in "Norman's Room" - the movie that featured Diane Keaton, Leonardo De Caprio and Meryl Streep - and enjoyed every minute of it. The same goes for "The Notebook", even if it was delicious. My feeling was that anything that features performances by Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would be at least as good. Instead, I sometimes found that even the best actors can not overcome banal, simple, and even offensive material. <br /> <br /> Now I had no problem with the structure of the film. I actually enjoy movies that move back and forth over time to tell a story ... as long as one era illuminates the other and describes the vice-verse. But while Vanessa's character lay on her deathbed, remembering an event in the past that she considered "a mistake," it was sometimes fascinating. However, the part that actually shows what that "past mistake" was can not clear it up. In fact, it makes it pointless in the dumbest "girl meets boy, girl gets boy, girl loses boy" fashion, and in the most incredible, stereotypical, wrong way possible. <br /> <br /> And of being a spoiler here, keep in mind that you should keep reading. <br /> <br /> First of all, Claire Danes was brutally wrong. Not only does she not resemble Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman, she does not have the edge in acting. Do not get me wrong, it can be good in the right role - just not in this one. And Patrick Wilson was a failure, though he has the acting skills that almost make it. He would have been better suited for the role Hugh Dancy played - the rich confused WASP - and not the goal of sexual attraction for all. he's a bit too WASP-y for that. Hugh Dancy? A hint - "I'm agony, drunk and wait until you find out why." And the "why" (I'm a closet in a sexually oppressed world, so I have to drink too much and fool myself before anyone I know) was so offensive to me and the way he died (As you knew he would do it because that's the only thing that can happen to a fag in the fifties.) So ridiculous, wrong and mistreated, I almost threw my candy on the screen. <br /> <br /> modern part between Toni Collette and her sister, her fear of engagement, her jealousy of her sister's "perfect life". "Her sister wonders if she's made the right decisions, her pregnancy and her too perfect friend (who might have been more interesting) and meaningful if played by Patrick Wilson, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach could face his dreamy eyes Having been an interesting Harris - anyway, all of this was passed in the '70s and' 80s, and in much greater depth, do we REALLY have to present it again and everything as if it were fresh and meaningful? <br /> <br /> And um To top it off, Meryl Streep does not appear until the last ten minutes of the movie, all in old-fashioned make-up that hides many of her facial expressions, she's still good, but only because she's Meryl, and Meryl can find a way even the dumbest dialogues under the heaviest make-up. <br /> <br /> So basically, this movie has every cliche in the "really meaningful message" Movie book, and it adds a few who really had no business, trotted out again. For two hours and with "Lifetime Movie of the Week" music guaranteed to be immortal to you, this is a complete failure in both the "sensible" and "filmmaking" areas. I give "3" only for Meryl and Vanessa. <br /> <br /> If you only need two more movies from your films, please put aside my comments on "Evening" and have the time of your life. However, if you want to have a truly meaningful experience with great actors and filmmakers who know how to handle a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings, then hire "Norman's Room" and find it Out, what a really great show is.
