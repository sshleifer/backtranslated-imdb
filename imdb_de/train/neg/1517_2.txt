In the title, I write that the story is ridiculous. In the following I will explain in detail, why this film ruined in my opinion this film. <br /> <br /> Gere and Danes do their job, and while it's not their best job, that's fine. The rest of the cast, however, is doing a very poor job. However, this is not just the fault of the actors. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones who have characters that even have the least room in the movie to really lend depth. All other characters either have too little room in the movie to create depth, or the character is such a cliche that it does not matter how much the actors try. <br /> <br /> The director has a bit complex, but just looking in the direction, I think he does a good job. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is the kind of script that is bad in two ways. Above all, it's a bad script. The characters are flat (except for Gere and Danes), the villains are clich√©s and the characters' actions are absolutely incredible. In addition, the authors must have an agenda in which they want to bring back our views and ethics by a hundred years. It's a kind of movie that says some criminals are still criminals, regardless of whether they paid the price society gave them. It is also a kind of film that, if only between the lines, states that any form of sexual deviation should be punished without trial, judge or jury. According to the film, anything that is not sex in the missionary position of a married couple is a sexual deviation. <br /> <br /> So, if you go to film school and need an example of a bad script, or if you write scripts yourself and want an ego boost. See it For everyone else, I recommend another movie.
