Just a stupid old movie. First, Stanwyck's son gets his foot in a really stupid way and then her husband gets caught in another really stupid way. To save him, Stanwyck has again bad luck and meets a kidnapped convict. She has a chance to kill him, but fails very stupidly. In the end, her husband is saved, and Stanwyck tells us by tale what the stupid message of the film is. Everything is good as ends up stupid. <br /> <br /> I never found out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in Hollywood's glamorous Golden Age. this nose is so beautiful? So photogenic? The movie is mercifully short and runs a little over an hour. It's as if the director sensed he was crap, so he thought it best to keep the crap short.
