No mention of Ann Rivers Siddons adapting the material for "The House Next Door" from her 70s eponymous novel or someone else did. This lifelong film was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. After reading the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film was shown on a cable version of a film that was clearly made for television. You know when the critical moments precede the commercials, which of course you can not find in this version we looked at. <br /> <br /> The star of the film is Lara Flynn Boyle, who has a new look that puts this viewer in the limelight. A curve because of the cosmetic transformation that this actress has gone through. From the new eyebrows to other parts of the body, Mrs. Boyle can hardly be recognized as Col Kennedy, the figure in the center of the mystery. This was not one of the better moments of the actress in front of the camera. That goes for the rest of the mostly Canadian actors who deserve better. <br /> <br /> The film feels like a mixture of "Desperate Houswives" with "The Stepford Wives" and other, more well-known traits, combined with a mild dose of horror. The best thing about the movie was the house, which serves as a backdrop.
