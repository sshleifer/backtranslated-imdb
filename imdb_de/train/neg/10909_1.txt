This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice and the action is shit! There may be a funny joke, it's stupid and it's boring. Throughout the short film, I fell asleep and wondered when it would end. <br /> <br /> No one acts humanely and everyone looks stupid and ridiculous. Rob Schneider, who behaves like an animal, is nothing that I would pay for. It looked weird, but the bottom line: WHAT NOT WASTE, YOU ARE PRECIAL TIME AT ANY SUCH AND STUPID FILM. I was wondering when it would end, even if it's short movie. At first we thought it would get better; but it gets worse. Stupid to the end. I went out of the theater and I would forever remember this movie as extremely bad. <br /> <br /> The author and co-producer of this movie is a Simpsons TV writer, but this is nothing like The Simpsons (this movie is shit !!!)
