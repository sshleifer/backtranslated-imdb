When I saw a small scene of it for the first time in some announcements, I thought the show would be entertaining. The little robot guy looks kind of cute. The animation style seems somehow familiar to some classic shows. Before the show aired, I examined it with some sources. There I was slightly upset. The three children (Tommy, Gus, and Lola) are appropriately pronounced, but Robotboy is an exception. It would have been much nicer if portrayed by a young lad. A good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "Whatever Happened To Robot Jones?" The show is really not bad. But the way in which Robotboy is portrayed inappropriately is my only criticism. Therefore, I do not look much.
