I was a fan of Without A Trace from the first episode. I really can not express my disappointment in the last week. This is a REAL problem that has dealt with too many African American families and with which they continue to work. The lack of media coverage in the first 48 hours was documented by a recent study. Law enforcement, including local, state, and federal agencies, is also complicit. What was the purpose of promoting this topic and then ending it? Apparently, television can handle almost any topic except RACE. That is shameful. Get it together or do not explore it next time.
