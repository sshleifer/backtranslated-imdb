This is at the top of my top list of the worst movies I've ever seen on Starz on Demand. They seem to pick up any direct DVD crap festival they can find and make it here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Apparently, anyone with a digital camera and a low budget can produce a horror movie and put it on TV. To be honest, it looked awful right from the start when I saw the trailer - but I gave it a real chance. <br /> <br /> I always try to get interested in low budget movies. Some of the best movies I've ever seen were films that worked on their low budget, or in other cases, only a low budget was needed to be great. <br /> <br /> This is not one of these films. <Br /> <br /> You know the story by now, I'm sure you'll read that. Either you heard about Starz on Demand or for whatever reason you landed on this page out of boredom. It's about a pitiful and vile girl we meet every 3 minutes in an incredibly bad "Heavy Metal" music video. Who put it together must have thought that it looked really interesting, but it really does not. Anyhow, she kills herself. Then she owns someone. Then the killing begins. It's really memorable and as average and boring as possible. When the first shot is fired in her apartment, it sounds quite serious after a popcorn bang. Was that the best sound effect they could develop? I could find a better sound effect that can be used for free (without copyright) on the internet ... right. Now. <br /> <br /> Do not let the other reviews say this is a 10-star movie that fools you. You're obviously either distributor of the movie or maybe even the director trying to convince you that it's worth buying.
