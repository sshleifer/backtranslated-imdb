The announcement of this poor apology for an amateur class at Sundance is a great example of what's going on in most indie filmmakers these days. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is the art of film art. Just taking a 16mm camera and pointing at someone who has a line does not make a real movie. <br /> <br /> I think we're lucky that the director did not record someone's camcorder ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, indie movies are real people. There is nothing real in this film. None of the characters acts like a human from afar. <br /> <br /> What makes her appear as a being are the fantasies of a writer trying to impress his friends by showing them how "cool and nervous" he is. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but that's not good writing or good governance. <br /> <br /> What's left is the shell of a bad movie that somehow found its way to Sundance. Hard to believe that this was one of the best films submitted ... <br /> <br /> In any case, I lost what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand.
