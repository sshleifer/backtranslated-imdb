This version of "Moby Dick" offends the audience by claiming that it is based on Melville's novel, which even goes so far as to expose the wrong phrase from the first chapter instead of the famous "Call me Ishmael". Apart from the cruel acting, even by John Barrymore, this may be the best example of how far Hollywood (especially early Hollywood) would revise and change a famous novel just to increase its box office chances. The beautiful, poetic Language of the novel was absolutely eradicated, and Ahab was changed from a dazzling, blasphemous, obsessed madman to a dashing, misunderstood hero who only wants to kill Moby Dick after seeing his woodland hero Bein. Add to that the evil standard brother who wants the fiance for himself and has another end!
