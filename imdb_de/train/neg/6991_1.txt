Do not bother. I thought I would see a movie with great superspense and action. <br /> <br /> But it will be boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start. In the middle of the movie you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed. Towards the end it gets better, but not really great. I think the director just took this movie too seriously. In such a movie, even if you are not interested in the plot, you want at least a nice action. I fell asleep in the middle of the main part. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> derboiler.
