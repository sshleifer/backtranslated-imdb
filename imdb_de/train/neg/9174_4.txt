I usually like zombie movies, but this was just bad. <br /> <br /> The good parts: girls swim topless with thongs, Sonya Salomaa topless and Ona Grauer's breasts wiggling in a tight top while running. <br /> <br /> The bad part: too many video cuts, too much matrix slow motion (it pulls the action), not enough blood and courage, bad drama and no story. The only other person in the theater was smart and stayed right upstairs without a floating scene. A waste of $ 6 and time altogether. I give a 2 out of 10 points.
