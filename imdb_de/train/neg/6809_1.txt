A stinko from a movie showing an act of the trader and, albeit friendly, less than the Oscar caliber. But the worst mistake for me was the total misrepresentation of a jet plane and especially a 747. Some of the biggest mistakes: <br /> <br /> 1. No flight engineer (or even a flight engineer station) 2. Wrong identification of F-16 interceptors as F-15 (no match) 3. Loading the passengers in a "tail luggage room", which is allegedly accessible from the cabin - even if There was such a compartment, where so much weight was so far back that the Plane could become immobile. 4. Hollow point bullets that "will not damage the plane". 5. The entire landing process was so bad that I wanted to puke SR-71 (from all aircraft) with a pressure seal flap 7. Opening a cabin door to the outside - in the wind - in flight !! <br /> <br /> Ah crazy, it was just a really lousy movie the list of the last 10 of the year.
