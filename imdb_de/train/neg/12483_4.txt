This movie is similar to Conan, the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape, and murder. Somewhere under this debauchery there is an action, but the filmmakers do not do well to show it, which is a pity, because it could be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - who unfortunately does not stand out in any other way. The fight scenes are not too bad either - I love how Deathstalker lets his sword "drink" the blood of his victims - and there's plenty of nudity and sex to lessen the general level of machismo. <br /> <br /> Not all that good - but not that bad either ...
