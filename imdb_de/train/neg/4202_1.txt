... am I missing something here? "unexpected action developments"? "Conspiracy of action with subversive joy"? are these onlookers the same Arquette vehicle I've just submitted to (in a (obviously) obvious bout of sadomasochism right now) ... I just joined this site to make sure no one else rents that stinker. ..this film was embarrassing for everyone ... Quick question: Did Sir Stevie read the script before he gave Kate C. the thumbs up? If so, it must be the same Spielberg who lit "Howard the Duck" green ... do not give me that, "it was a hit" crap - I appreciate Mssr. Reddin is not pleased ... the DVD cover promised "surprising corners" and a "twisted story ..." story !! Story ?? It's crap that old Bobby McKee and his wandering gang sound like structuralists like geniuses ... Sundance? Berlin? Toronto ?? I have a home video of my cat that's more interesting than Arquette's negative-sized portrayal of fearful loss ... and Deux ex machina for Mr. Stanley T. Speak. Thank God, just lately he thought to call Dave for the police! and thanks, Shiva, that the cops just got the real killer ... what !!! Until the end of the credits, I still waited for it to be a kind of fight against Arquette and his "hidden millions" ... No, Mrs. Spielberg, you are not getting away unscathed: what the hell was this kitchen scene with the "athlete's foot in my crotch "Gag ??? are you feeling worse or "only cause"? I do not know ... hey movie lover: why not make it a blockbuster night and rent it together with "Jersey Girl" and "White Chicks" and then commit sepukka (or is it Seppuka) ... and take E Dunsky with you ....
