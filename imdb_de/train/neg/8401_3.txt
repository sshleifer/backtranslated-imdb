Having just seen it on TMC, it's new to me. It's obvious that the Stooges are stars, but they do not really lead the show. First, they are divided into two groups - Moe, as "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a pair of vagrants. So there is not much complete teamwork. The love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting; the two ladies are the only ones with acting skills. There is another group of musical stooges who are not funny, unless you consider their attempts to be funny sad. The music is boring, they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses, the dorky western clothes are stupid, and there is a lot of movie without a rascal in front of the camera. By the way, this is obvious after Curley's first strike and his reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears early in a non-cocking role. I loved everything these guys ever did, including all non-Curley stuff, but this little dog is pretty lousy.
