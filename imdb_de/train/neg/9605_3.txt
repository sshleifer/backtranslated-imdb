This 70's Italian movie is NOT even in the class with Dog Soldiers, The Howling, or even that dreadful American werewolf in Paris, BUT ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about the lead actress, a stunning blonde who runs amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphics, total nudity ... it's obvious that she's a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is a hoot, the SFX are childish and acting (mostly) stinks. The only redeeming value of this film is the nudity and sex scenes (and there are a lot of them). Tame to HBO standards, but still fun to see if you get along without a date on Saturday night. OK ... HERE IS THE SPOILER ... There is NO werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine's ancestor (??)).
