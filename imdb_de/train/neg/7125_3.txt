VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be a big disappointment! And although Sam Peckinpah collaborated with Robert Towne on the script, he still appears as a sheet-metal movie, dry-headed by the undefined Buzz Kulik. First, Yul Brynner, the top bill for Pancho Villa, is wrong. He is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His one-touch performance is lacking, and Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought the role. Brynner looks just like a Russian aristocrat who disguised himself like a Mexican bandit in the midst of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one. Also the second billed Robert Mitchum is totally wasted in the picture! His role as a biplane aviator, throwing bombs he made himself in the cause of the revolution, is a poorly written meager role that a little star could have played. Mitch has no decent line throughout the movie and thinks of his other Mexican revolutionary image as the far superior "Bandido" (1956), in which apparently nobody has any interest in releasing on DVD. In addition to any style, "Villa Rides" suffers without the presence of a female star! There is the starlet Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl, who looks forward to Mitchum, but her casting is only superficial. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters might have added a few much needed scores to the swaying plot. <br /> <br /> There are a few good action scenes in the movie, but some good action scenes. No filming and the not-so-perfect Panavision image quality plus the over-repeated Maurice Jarre tune does not help. <br /> <br /> Paramount has no extras - not even a trailer! Yes, a disappointing movie and DVD presentation that could and should be much better.
