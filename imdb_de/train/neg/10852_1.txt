This movie is a very funny movie. The violence is bad, the acting is ... well, Dani, stay tuned or scream or whatever the hell you do. The random chicks, who wear very little, only serve to catch sexually frustrated Goth boys. I personally think that this movie is really shitty. The story and the characters COULD be very good if the director, actors, and other little nibby things were better. But the movie is just bad. The only reason people like this bitch is that it has Danni in it. This movie is possibly the worst B-rate movie ever. And believe me, that's hard to achieve, especially if you're competing with Def by Temptation and over crappy excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a CoF fan and I just see it as another garbage movie ... A really bad movie. If Dani did that as a comedy, it's fine. Very well done. In addition, I appreciate it low, because it is shitty. Take a look at it when you're in a happy, happy, joyful, joyful mode so you can laugh about everything or if you have many different types of drugs.
