I wonder how much this film actually has to do with the 1984 movie "Bachelor Party" with Tom Hanks. Is this movie even an official sequel? This movie is missing in every department and obviously it's better not to look at it. For a comedy, this movie is just not good or funny enough. It relies mainly on the character's stereotypical assessments, but instead, the movie does contain some good, original and funny moments. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is also very little history and the movie as chest sides. They just wait for it to finally start. There is a main line somewhere, but this is so horribly unoriginal and so poorly executed in the movie that it feels like it's something that does not exist. I guess there is even a message and a moral story somewhere, but this is so terribly unoriginal and bad in the movie that it just does not work out Many sex jokes and nudity, just without the main characters of the teen, making the story all the more makes you sadder and tasteless. The movie makes some really wrong jokes that are out of place for any kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I've ever looked at this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
