I rented this movie for a few laughs. I had never seen the SNL sketch before, but hits like Tommy Boy and Waynes World could not be that bad, right? The answer: it was. This movie was hardly a way to relax after a hard day's work. I was always waiting for an action and a funny part, but there was none. The highlight was Tiffany Amber Thieson, and that's it.
