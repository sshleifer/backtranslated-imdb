First of all, I should say that I have read the manga, and so my argument is based on the differences. <br /> <br /> This anime disappointed me a lot because it eliminated the comedy and high-quality action of Manga and OVA. What remained was only a shell of what it could have been. Many of the characters lacked the depth seen in the manga. Alucard is not the sympathetic character who secretly desires death. Walter's story lacks treason. And the Nazi villains who want to devour the world in the war are completely absent. Instead, the anime provides the Gary Stu rogue Incognito, who is defeated against all seemingly unfavorable opponents. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is not that the anime deviates from the manga, but that it does so bad work.
