I rented it by mistake. After a cursory examination of the box, I thought this was a time travel / science fiction story. Instead, it's a "Christian" story, and I suppose that's a typical example. If you sold the message, you probably overlook the awkwardness of the plot / drama / etc. But I found it quite painful. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the rewriting of the story in this story bothers me. It paints the 1890s as a sort of paradise for family values ​​and morals (a character is appalled that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), But overlooks very unappetizing sides of this "highly moral" society (rigid race, sexuality and sexuality social discrimination for example, was widespread). And at one point, the hero at a clothing store owner complains about things that do not sound much different than the complaints of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported recently in a WSJ). <br /> <br /> I think it's the kind of stuff you'll like when you like these kinds of things, and it's certainly wholesome ...
