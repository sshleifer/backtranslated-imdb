This was a curious kind of film about a New York life about a main character (the name played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he is a Ricky Nelson musician, only he has no talent. <br /> <br /> It's kind of fun to see a profane, tough New York City woman enter and take over the picture with a terrible accent. That ruined the movie for me. It must have been Catherine Keener, who normally plays hard and garbagey women. <br /> <br /> The haircut on Pitt - an exaggerated pompadour - was fun. I can imagine Johnny Depp playing that role better. One last note: It's strange to hear a movie that was produced in 1992 (with the exception of Woody Allen) with mono sound only.
