This movie has its share of negative comments and I have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made. Most of the films based on King's works are pretty bad, but this one goes beyond evil into the realm of the terrible. There is no scary moment, unless you consider stupidity frightening. It is typical of King Garbage - myths that have turned around made no sense whatsoever, mixed with obvious and so-called "scares" that are about as shocking as PeeWees Playhouse (which is at least entertaining). It's full of ridiculous moments, not the least of which is Alice Krige's character. When she rages and begins to rant like the villain in an old Batman television series, it's so absurd that she gets sick. All the people who attended (including John Landis) are fortunate that they still have a career. But the most absurd are the cat costumes that end up looking like cheap rubber outfits bought at K-Mart. The best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats that actually outsmart the people in the movie.
