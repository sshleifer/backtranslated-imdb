How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her ... Too bad that she is completely out of character. I did not read the book by Jane Austen, but I can not believe it's so superficial and the characters are not much more than cartoons. It probably was not that easy to reduce the 600 pages of the book in two hours, but I expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and teacups. I sighed with relief every time I saw an actor who did not pass the sign of overreaction (a couple of times).
