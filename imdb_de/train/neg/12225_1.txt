My personal idea of ​​hell is to be locked in a room without my being able to close my eyes or block my ears and play this movie on all available surfaces in this room for eternity. The whole idea that Streisand is playing a boy / man is just starting to scrape out how ridiculous that premise is. The most important thing about any movie is the concept of "willing suspension of unbelief." , , That's not possible in this movie.
