This movie could have been much better if a script was rewritten. Not that I would expect much plausibility in films, but you would think that even the homeless and city-dwelling Jack Mason would question the question of why a group of seasoned hunters would hired him as a hunting guide. And when he reaches the hunting ground, the poor Ice-T plays his part, as if he were actually leading these men through forests he has never seen before. <br /> <br /> And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns in Seattle? <br /> <br /> I assume this movie is based on Richard Connell's short story "The Most Dangerous Game". A few years ago, I showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story. I reworked the movie and cut out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity. It took 43 minutes.
