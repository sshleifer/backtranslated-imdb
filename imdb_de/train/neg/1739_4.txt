As I watched this woman in Ermine, I wondered what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to introduce Marlene Dietrich. Someone at 20th Century Fox may have decided that one sex symbol is as good as the other. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better. <br /> <br /> Betty plays a nineteenth-century Italian countess, infiltrated by a troupe of Hungarian hussars led by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Is led. Her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the US Palace Hall and the rest of her reputed pedigree look no different in Doug now, and another 300 years ago she dealt with when armies failed. Besides, the current Betty was just married to Cesar Romero, and the invasion came at a very bad time before things were done. That gives everyone a bad attitude, I guarantee that. <br /> <br /> Fresh and healthy, all American Betty is NOT the actress who seems seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich might have done that, but with Betty she's flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can look at. Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin have written the score for this film, and This Is The Moment received an Oscar nomination for Best Song. The only chance of Lady In Ermine for the Oscar glory fell on Buttons And Bows. Ernest Lubitsch died halfway through the movie and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine. I can not believe that Lubitsch Grable had the leadership here in mind. You will not, either, if you see this lady in Ermine.
