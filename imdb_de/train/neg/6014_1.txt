Left Behind is an incredible waste of more than $ 17 million. Acting is weak and boring, the story even weaker. The public is asked to believe the completely implausible and often ridiculous act and to give nothing when it comes to good faith. The film is not only poorly played and scanned, it is also lacking in all technical areas of filmmaking. The production design does not contribute to the credibility of the action. The effects are completely unoriginal and shallow. The lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably bad; compared to movies with a tenth of the budget. None of this, however, will be significant in that millions of families will undoubtedly accept the film for its health and religious leanings. and who can blame them. However, it is regrettable that they will be forced to accept filmmakers in the third price range.
