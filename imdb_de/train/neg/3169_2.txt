This movie is one of the worst of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the spectacle is terrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has talent, and the only one who does not bother. I've never seen Desparte Housewives, so I do not know how Eva Longoria is in this series, but she was terrible in this movie. It's as if she knows nothing about acting. Her character only laments throughout the movie, and she can not afford to be an idiot and still be entertaining. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows little emotion, and it looks like you're looking at the cue cards as she reads them. It goes from A to B with little surprise. So much more could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should revolve more around her and the things she does as a ghost. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: It's not worth looking at.
