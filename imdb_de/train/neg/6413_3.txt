My friends and I went into this movie, not knowing what to expect but hoping for the best. When we came out, we were just a little more informed about what the movie's plot actually was. While not the worst movie I've ever seen, I definitely do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters. Maybe a friend will rent it for you (it's not even worth the rental cost) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> If a movie is so complicated that you have no idea what's going on in the past five minutes there really is not much in its defense. The acting was decent, more than you would expect from this film, and some shots were good, but everything was jammed by a lame plot and a bad script. <br /> <br /> This movie was actually so bad that I bought a ticket as soon as it came out to see a good movie just to clear my mind. I recommend that you all skip the first step and watch a good movie instead.
