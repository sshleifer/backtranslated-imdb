Maybe I'm not up to date anymore or just do not know what Electra looks like in current publications ... But the Electra I read was much more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. She usually used others to do her dirty work, and most of the time a kind of double-cross was involved. Just when you think you have found out everything, she pulls the wool over your eyes and makes her way. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty weak in the dialogue, the acting was not very convincing and the action was spotty. I was really looking for something more in Frank Miller's book "Electra Assassin". Which is much darker than anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effect where cool action was sometimes interesting, but mostly story and storyline were slow or illogical. Tha hand was not threatening enough, and Electra was not .... bitchy enough. She's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story, it just did not interest me.
