I doubt Jigsaw was even hip at the time. The entire theme of the LSD was associated with a murder mystery, an obvious obvious attempt to reach a young audience of the era without having the slightest understanding of the counterculture of the 1960s. Apart from the outdated aspect, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including excessive action, stupid and darn dialogue and LSD flashbacks, which last endlessly long even after hammering in the first 60 seconds, but which does not generate any actual tension Paper a great way to do that, and an end that is so banal and predictable (not to mention a lot of bad TV shows) that the climax is actually an anti-climax. If it were a better movie, we might be able to expose unbelief to a few things that would make it enjoyable, but the weaknesses are so blatant that they only serve to highlight the improbabilities the viewer might otherwise miss. I've seen jigsaw on TV, and it's definitely a late-night TV show that's supposed to fill the airspace and pass the time to kill someone else's insomnia than anything anyone should actively seek. At best, three out of ten.
