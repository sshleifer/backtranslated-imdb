How can you collect this respectable cast of young British actors and come up with a bunch of film fertilizer? Terrible screenplay, annoyingly hectic camera, terribly edited, horribly badly traded. Only Rhys Ifans tries to fill his role with life. Another painful proof that "different" is sometimes "filth". Why do not the money people read the scripts before? Do yourself a favor: spice yourself up and do something else - hit a thug on your knees. It's less painful and more fun than this movie!
