John Leguizemo, a wonderful comic actor, is a New York Latino who can infiltrate a variety of male and female characters to showcase the bizarre weaknesses of an ethnic group trying to cope with an alien culture. He is not Italian, however. He does not look, think or act Italian ... especially Sicilians or Calabrese, immigrant groups living in Bensonhurst or Bayridge Brooklyn. Each scene in which he interacts with his gumbas seems wrong, as if he had wandered through a West Side Story college production, while the other boys were paying "Mean Streets" with low pensions. That's just a problem with this ill-conceived, crazy movie. Spike has blown up this one big time. By the way, CBGBOMFUG means "country, bluegrass, blues and other music for uplifting gourmets [or possibly gourmets]. Ask Hilly Crystal, who founded the club. <br /> <br />
