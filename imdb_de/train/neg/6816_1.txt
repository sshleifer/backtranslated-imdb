I have to say that nothing is wrong with low budget movies, so that was not my problem. My problem with that is that I had the feeling to see the home movie of my neighbor. IMO everything about it just seemed like a guy would make a short story, grab a camera and start firing. I understand how hard this has to be in order to work effectively, but when lending for a movie, I feel like watching a professional movie. <br /> <br /> John Schneider has a huge resume. is a great actor and was fine in this movie. The other people were not there. I understand how it has to be fun, and it's cheaper to use friends and relatives as performers, but it's not a convincing show. It seemed like he was shooting, he tried to make many scenes more interesting, but once writing, acting, and acting are around, that kind of style is not necessary, and it's not a distraction. <br /> <br /> Also on a technical level there were digital artifacts everywhere. In the first scene of all these beautiful cars, as they made a slow scan of them, they seemed to jump a little back and forth. The problem is not in my display (Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonal), but somewhere in the production, I've never seen such an artifact in a professionally made movie, then there was the sound, it sounded like you did not have a voice -Over made what might be okay, unless it sounds like the track in this movie, it sounded like the built-in microphone in the camera.
