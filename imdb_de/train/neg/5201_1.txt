The story has been seen before, but it does not matter if you can figure out if you're creating a real storyboard. It's clear that the director did not spend his work on the storyboard. In addition, the cameraman spent far too much time leaning against angles that did not match the film's message. However, the funniest thing is, if you look at the film's website, you can read that the director made the film with bad camera settings. Because it reminds us of the hunt. But I have never heard of hunting with bad camera angles ;-) It will have 1 star, because the story is fine. It is a pity that Ti West did not spend more time reviewing his story. It's like the movie is more important than the planning. Because you have a camera, that does not mean you should make a movie right away ... come on. Anyone can make a movie, but not all will be just as good. So a tip for Ti West is: Stop and label what you want. Use your time to plan and not film until everything has landed on a storyboard. You certainly have the ability and the desire - do not abuse your talent.
