The premise attracted me, but it was clear that this was about 30 seconds, either David Lynch or something serious. Interesting to look at, just to go through the fundamentalist laundry list. I can be a jerk for a rousing spiritual piece (Romero comes to my mind), but there was nothing spiritual about this piece. The message seems to be that we all have to act as if we had an Iq of 80 (or just a lobotomy - Jennifer, what happened to you?) And blindly follow the Bible without self-examination, or we'll get the second coming out. It's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings (I'm working around the corner from the site of the former WTC). I like to think that God is a little bigger than that.
