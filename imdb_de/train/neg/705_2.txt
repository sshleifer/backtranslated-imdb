There is so little of the fantastic Anne Rice book that what is here makes no sense. Some of the characters - intense and surprising characters - do not show up at all, and those who do so are so watered down that there is no reason for their existence. <br /> <br /> the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the sequel between Marcel and Julia? Why does Dolly Rose ever appear, as her story has never been explained? Where is the rape and salvation of Marie, whose greatest characteristic (and the biggest downfall) is that she knows how to act white - and her marriage to Richard? Why does the movie end with Marcel being beaten by his father? We learn nothing from Aglae except that she is a slut who hates her husband; Why is there no backstory that explains this hatred? <br /> <br /> There are none that are better than mediocre in the performances, though this is probably due to the lousy script. The best thing is the actor who plays Richard - but Richard is not enough on screen to save the movie. The worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, although the actress has nothing to do with the little she has worked with. I thought it was impossible for a movie shot in Anne Rice to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FAST OF ALL SAINTS makes this mess seem like a critical hit. How come that Rice is such a bitch that allows her best works to be so much garbage on the screen?
