The plot was boring, the girls were sick and the alleged Italian men's leadership had obviously never heard an Italian accent. Someone said the boys were cute in this movie, but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people. There were literally no redemptive features to this film. <br /> <br /> I think this is an actor's cemetery that will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins, who seem to fascinate people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business. You have no room in it.
