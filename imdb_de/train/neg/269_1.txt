After seeing the first ten episodes, I have to say that this show is shit. <br /> <br /> What bothers me the most is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should have shot it in California so we could have scenes in the desert. That would have been more appropriate for the film. The first scene in which they are outside in another world is in the mountains with lots of pine trees, where it looks cold. That does not feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in ancient Egypt. Here it feels like they are fighting aliens in a Canadian forest. And it's so lame that on other planets, apparently, the case is coming. In the woods you can see leaves on the ground that all look like forests outside of Vancouver. It just makes the show incredible and stupid. <br /> <br /> And then there's Richard Dean Anderson. He is not Kurt Russel. Sure, he's doing a decent job and trying to copy Russel's performance a bit, but he's just not as cool as Russell. And not nearly as good a actor as Russell. And Russell's way of playing O Neill, well, he was much more cynical. Anderson's O Neil is way too soft. I liked the fact that Russels version was just not fun and had no trouble to detonate the bomb until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a really good job on Jackson, even though he takes on James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa. No Jaffa. Only Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! A former bodyguard of a wretched Ra character, previously seen only in the pilot and in another episode. Teal'c talks and behaves like a robot. I have seen a better acting by Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> And the fact that Teal'c and the Ra character and the people who rescued her in the movie can suddenly speak English is also incredibly stupid. What made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an old language and were real monsters. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects, they are really good in the pilot. But the very rare effects in the show are done poorly and look cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It's so obvious that they walk around in the background on a stage with a badly painted painting. It is an insult to us viewers to make it look so cheap. Especially if they could do it on a blue screen with CGI backgrounds. <br /> <br /> The X files had a better effect when they broadcast their first episodes in 1993. That was 4 years before the start of SG-1. And they did not have the apparent budget of $ 2 million per episode that SG-1 allegedly had. You must have spent all the money for the catering. Because I do not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring and pointless show. That could have been great if they had shot the show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.
