A call was missed, another Asian horror based on the phone. I recently rented a Korean horror movie based on a mobile phone called Pon. A missed call was just as boring as this one. Maybe phones just are not scary or anything, but that step was boring and drab. No suspense or thrill for me, and the last monster was disappointingly cheesy and careless. The film was pretty much pulled apart and felt too long. I did not keep my attention. It seems that phones are hard to scare, it's like trying to scare a slot machine. And it's ridiculous to compare it to "The Ring", it seems like every Asian horror movie is compared to it and so far I have not seen such a scale. For horror directors: Take the phone off the hook as a horror device.
