The crater lake of a meteorite strike (hence our title) awakens a plesiosaur that focuses on the hickige population (in California, the capital of the world). <br /> <br /> There are bad movies and then there is "The Crater Lake Monster", from which MST3K somehow escaped. This is a terrible piece of the low budget exploitation / monster movie of the 70s. <br /> <br /> Although the film is to blame for many crimes, this is the biggest Arnie and Mitch, two hideous rednecks that serve as comic relief. They stroll around, fighting for "banjo music", hitting women and acting like pitiful apologies to humanity. The characters are so bad that they should be considered crimes against humanity.
