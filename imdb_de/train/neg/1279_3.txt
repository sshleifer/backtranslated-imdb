In this film, three stories are told, which were apparently filmed without knowledge of a combined vignette film. The makers report the three vignettes, all of which tend to downsize Martin Kove, though you never see any of the clues with Kove Sun (she makes Adrian Monk look brave), she has a paranoia night home alone. You're literally yelling at Vivian for doing some ridiculous things. She spends most of her time in a nighty, which shows her amazing qualities. But her movie is the worst, if not the most biting. <br /> <br /> The second vignette belongs to Bill Paxton as he represents the roommate from hell. His geeky roommate allows him to take full advantage of him, and Bill does so whenever he can. The last vignette was funny because a man feared death would take him any moment, much like his buddy who smothered on an olive. <br /> <br /> Not very interesting as the movie as a whole seems to be hacked with very little thought. A must for Bill Paxton fans.
