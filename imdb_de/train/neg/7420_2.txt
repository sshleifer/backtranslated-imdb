A romance without feeling, a drama without themes (or drama) ... This movie is supposed to be all that and fails on every account as if it's not trying. Or as if the team of director / publisher / screenwriter is not really trying. The actors are capable - they need better support. <br /> <br /> An element that does not fail is the score by George Delarue. Nice and moving. What a pity it depends on this movie. In a good movie, the words and movements of the actors and the music are synchronized. This editor plastered music without regard to dialogue and movement. The love scene is particularly appealing in this respect: an insult to the talents of the leading actors. <br /> <br /> There's another element in the movie that works: the location photography. A moment in Grand Central Station. I had guessed in advance what would happen; But it was breathtaking how it was filmed in this scenery. Some commentators in this forum have pointed out that the US assimilation of Nazi criminals has actually taken place in these years of MacCarthy anxiety. The moment the film seems to be seriously looking at American society, it switches to conventional romance. Before human emotions can move us, it's a (predictable) "thriller" withdrawal. <br /> <br /> Just as the film offends the talents of the actors, it offends the topics for which it claims (and fails). <br /> <br /> You will be warned.
