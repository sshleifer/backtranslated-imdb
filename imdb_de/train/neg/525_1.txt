I looked through the other comments and was amused that clearly only the people who actually worked on the film made comments. I mean, I hate saying bad things about an amateur production, but if you're making a bad movie and want to comment on it, divert it a bit. "Groundbreaking" is a little over the top. This is a Boston-based college production that does not even reach the level of most amateur college films. It's what you would expect from a bunch of kids. A stupid action movie without much creativity. It's pretty funny when you're ready to make fun of it. Not something you'll ever see unless you study at Emerson College.
