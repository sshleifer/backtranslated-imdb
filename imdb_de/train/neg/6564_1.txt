This is one of the worst movies I have seen so far. The best part was Christian J. Meoli "Leonard", who tried to jump up and down in front of the counter, somehow like I wanted to do it on the DVD to save the movie The rest of humanity is agony, this crappy movie to watch. It has a great cast, so you always wait for it to be okay. I mean with Sean Astin "Andrew" (played his role perfectly, did a great job, too bad it was in this movie), Kyra Sedgwick "Bevan", Ron Livingston "Chad", Ren√©e Zellweger "Poet" (she put her name on the cover, she has a total of 1 line and less than 4 seconds in the entire movie ... <br /> <br /> If the cast had this, she would buy all the copies of this movie together with her burn the director George Hickenlooper and the writer John Enbom
