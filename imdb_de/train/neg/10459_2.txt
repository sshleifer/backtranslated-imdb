Disjointed, unclear, bad script, bad photography and direction ... all in all, obviously a failed first attempt at commercial filmmaking by the good people of TBN. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures has been a great success in the past by helping bring "China Cry", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But "The Omega Code" is an unfortunate mistake. As a Christian who has supported TBN and many programming languages ​​and loved "China Cry," I still find it impossible to recommend this movie to anyone. They are very good with their ministry, but this is not an example. Do not waste your money ... rent "China Cry" instead.
