- The movie starts with a meteor falling into a lake. Unknown to the locals is also a dinosaur egg at the bottom of the lake. The meteor heats the lake and turns it into a huge incubator. You guessed it, the egg hatches and releases a dinosaur that terrorizes the community. <br /> <br /> - What a garbage. It's not like I like the stop-motion sound dinosaur, it's all the other thing about the movie that bothers me. The spectacle is cruel. The dialogue is absolutely ridiculous. The comic relief is anything but funny. Logic does not exist. Any resemblance between the "scientists" in this film and an actual scientist is purely coincidental. I could talk for an eternity about the bad aspects of this movie, but you have the idea. I think it's pretty safe to call this disaster "MST3K Worthy".
