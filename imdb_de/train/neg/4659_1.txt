This movie is a waste of footage. Do you think that the map of a military mission plan would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight if someone has binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens? It happened in this movie. Do you think that a DEAF person was actually drafted into the active army of Europe during the Second World War to serve in a "Negro" unit ... in cooking, in the care services, in the funeral details, etc.? It happened in this movie. Believe that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer shares the same DEAF K.P. Being part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from the destruction of the Germans before the arrival of the Allies? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier did not know that a German aircraft was approaching from behind and would overthrow and kill him? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers standing in a barn in a barn of a farmhouse where the Germans have come to rest in a barn, their emotions when they see the German soldiers who are only 50 'away? They made it in this film and left any access to the barn, which could examine the Germans completely unprotected. Would you believe that the captain mentioned the rank of general, if not his name, as the person with whom he spoke about the airwaves and in plain English, and that the general in plain English said about the airwaves that the dam had to do this? be protected the next day? Perhaps they should have just sent an emissary to say from which direction the American attack would come, just to give the Germans a little more relief. This so-called movie should be on a list of the 50 worst films. If so, I'm sure it would work out well. Take a look at your own risk.
