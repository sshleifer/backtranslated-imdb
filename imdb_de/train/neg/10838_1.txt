The minute you give an 'art film', 1/10, you have people barking for your ignorant, half-hearted, artistically retarded blood. I will not try to justify that I'm not an aesthetically challenged retardist by listing all the 'art house cinema' I like, or mentioning how I gave an unknown 'cult classic' 10/10. All I ask is that someone tells me the meaning, purpose and message of this movie. <br /> <br /> So I would sum up the movie: opening montage of three unrelated urban legends that are almost absurd levels of living together. Incident. It followed (in short, to spare you 3 hours of pain) the following: A children's show that dies of lung cancer tries to complete things with his addictive daughter, whom he may have raped if she has a child and will courted by a jarring police officer with relationship issues, while the star contestant of the game show decides that he does not want to be a failed prodigy, a fate that has struck another one of the game show participants from the '60s we see is now an unemployed homosexual who is in love with a bartender who has braces and needs money for "corrective oral surgery" while the producer of the game show who himself dies of lung cancer asks his male nurse for help he has with the son he had given up years ago patched up and become a womanizing self-help guru, even though Mr. Produce's second wife He suffers from guilt because he cheated on a dying man; and oh, sometime it's raining frogs (you read that right). And I'm going to spare you the incredibly long and pointless, literally wandering monologues that every character seems to give rise to without any rhyme or reason except to make sure that the movie crosses for 3 hours and is classified as a "modern epic". <br /> <br /> You probably think I could have summarized the movie better (and you can not confuse it) if I'd written the damn thing a little more coherently, maybe in a few sentences instead of just one ... Well Now you know how I feel.
