Sometimes it is not always an advantage to make something strange and contemporary. Although I must admit that the stage design and the concept of the film were quite interesting, the implementation of these ideas in a congruent story simply did not work. This movie was so awfully slow and meaningless that even Robin Williams could not save that garbage. It's obvious that Barry Levinson's dream has remained on his face, but he should have warned the rest of the world of this impasse.
