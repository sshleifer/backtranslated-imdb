The comment from "eliz7212-1" hits the proverbial "nail on the head" for this turkey of a program. But it's a shout to see William Shatner "frolicking" and "dancing" (yes, "" the markings on the word "dance" are necessary for what Bill does). This show would be a great sketch on SNL or MAD TV - and there are a few stars for a spectator or so to see Shatner taking "camp" to new heights - whether in a role or as himself. But the guy is funny. <br /> <br /> The girls who are browsing through the gambling cabin areas are quite unhappy if this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the turkey's whiskey-a-go-go genre , with a reaffirmed demand for shapely young women, to dance again in raised cages. post "" By sheer luck, it went on with a quarter of a mil or so. The second candidate, who is a bit smarter, but happy, $ 1,000 at Jeopardy! To win was zoned by the card, which requires answering a special question - which he did not know, and therefore stayed with Zilch. <br /> This abundance of game shows that are usually dangling individuals and sometimes giving away huge sums of money admittedly a cheap attempt to try to attract viewers as a whole. Even if the moderator is well compensated and he is giving six-digit numbers in an average episode, I can assume that the revenue can be cheap compared to the cost - since there is no sitcom cast in which multiple stars receive six- or seven-digit numbers , per episode, with some big leftovers. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that even the better ones will soon lose weight. This point has already quite reached this point. I think his offers, especially with James Spader, and the others on "Boston Legal" should give us a satisfying amount of Bill Shatner's offerings. <br /> <br /> Again, the above rating is simply appropriate to see Bill may dance once; that should be enough.
