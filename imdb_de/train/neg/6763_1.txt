God, what a terrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment a bit or something (see the terrible use of music and pictures here), but why? The whole thing behind "Natural born killers" seems to be a "smart" look at how media can become complete garbage, but unfortunately the movie itself becomes garbage. Please, Mr. Stone, next time you want to criticize the fascism of television programs that use force to get high rates, avoid the same with your movie! Michael Haneke said very cleverly about this film that he denounced the media fascism with fascist cinematographic methods. How true ... Only he forgot to tell us about the tremendous headache you get after getting craped by this extra load!
