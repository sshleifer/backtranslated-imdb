This movie is a huge, steaming pile. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why anyone felt that the Garland / Mason version had to be renewed, and why Striesand would have been the first choice for a star. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why our people (Gay Americans) consider Striesand a kind of treasure. In my opinion, she had with Funny Girl and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent the Judy classic or even the original (a good movie for yourself), but please, skip this stinkpot!
