The Ascension is actually a step up in terms of the original movie in history and in the special effects. Jason Scott Lee Good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself (if you remember him, he was from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason London is funny as Luke, the boy who helps the woman he loves Dracula's body was far away from the plate. Diane Neal is as good as the woman who steals Dracula's body to find a cure for her dying friend. And Stephen Billington is great as Dracula herself. To perform better than Gerard Butler in the original film. Roy Scheider completes the remainder of the cast in this film, and does a decent job mentoring Jason Scott Lee's character. This is the second installment of the trilogy and they have a good start. It's in the air if the last movie will finish the series well.
