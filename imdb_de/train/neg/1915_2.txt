It's a pretty good cast, but the movie does not have the grace of the original Italian comedy Big Deal on Madonna Street. If you are looking for a fun caper movie, you should visit the original. William Macy may be one of our biggest living actors, but he did not do much here. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I'm sorry he tried to fill those shoes. Could just as well try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro. The art direction is rich and structured, but does not bring anything into the story, the extra parts they add to the story seem completely unnecessary and the things they take away are overlooked. Even if you start out the way you do, it seems oddly unfounded and takes away the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has its strange and ingenious charm and Luis Guzman has this weird charisma, but the love story part of the movie just looks clunky and flat. It's too bad that no one figured out how to make this movie as good as it was originally done, but on the other hand, it's too bad we live in a culture where we feel like we're doing amazing things rather than just learning to enjoy the originals.
