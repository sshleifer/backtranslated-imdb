I actually paid to see this movie in the theater. <br /> <br /> It would get a rating of 1, but the battle scenes between the robots are fine and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I notice that some films have a bigger budget than others. I have no problem with that. Unfortunately, for obvious reasons, science fiction films are likely to suffer the most from a small budget. But one way in which this film fails is that almost every piece of every set looked cheesy and cheap. I mean, could not they even make it look good? <br /> <br /> The other major reason why this movie is horrible is acting it for the cheese factor, but at the time I was expecting a good movie and had no idea how horrible it would be. Thankfully, the experience was over in just 85 years of protocol.
