I can now clearly see why Robin Hood flopped fast. The first episode is probably the worst thing the BBC has ever aired. The opening scenes were about as intense, meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting, Robin Hood had no character and swordplay was just ridiculous. The worst part of the episode was that Robin Hood snuffed some makeup-dressed cow at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eyeliners in the 12th century? Nobody. The series may have improved dramatically since then, but this first episode quickly raised people's hopes and is essentially a bunch of Cr * p. A great hero of England was disgraced. <br /> <br /> "Will you tolerate that?" I'm not sure unless the BBC starts to understand what a sensible investment is. 3.10
