My goodness, as a gay man living in NYC, I can gratefully say that I've never seen the underworld of gay culture portrayed in this movie - and I'm glad of it !!! If this movie was broadcast on television in the United States, there would be a great backlash against homosexuals, and I can not say that I would blame them. The people in this movie do not represent the average gay American or even the average Trandgender American. What they represent is a simple nightmare. The inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments (anti-white) are blatant and disturbing. Society can not be held responsible for people who have opted for drugs, unemployment, and the rejection of education through the cast of the film. The actions of these people are not desperate acts, but rather the rejection of something that resembles personal ambition and the willingness to make something of oneself.
