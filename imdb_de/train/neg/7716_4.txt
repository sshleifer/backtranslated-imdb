I only had the luxury of seeing this movie once, when I was still quite young. The film is so blurry that he tries to remember him. However, I can say that it was not as funny as a movie called Killer Tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene in which the older couple talks about poor Timmy. Apart from that, the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people who are scared and exaggerating, the way people should do it in a movie of this kind. But only a very stupid premise and a catchy title song are not a good comedy. Granted, this movie is supposed to be a B-movie, nothing to be taken seriously, but you should still make funny jokes and not try to integrate a mildly amusing premise into a full-fledged movie. Maybe a short would have been good, since the trailer that showed the above-mentioned older couple and a man desperately trying to turn down a bigger tomato was really good. The trailer itself looked like an apparent trailer, but no, they actually made a whole movie, and a pretty weak one.
