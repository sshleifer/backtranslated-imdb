My God. This movie was awful. I can not complain too much. I have looked at it, just to be maxed out. It was enough. It's weird that the most disgusting part of the film was at the beginning when the woman was extremely viciously forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby. <br /> <br /> I think it's the most funny as well Notable actor in the film was the Hispanic soldier who acted as supporting actor next Friday. Everyone in the movie has done a terrible acting job. It was one of the worst shows I ever paid. <br /> <br /> I also expected that it would be much crueler than the first one. It was not I had expected it to be more cruel because it's a sequel and horror movie episodes are usually less successful than their predecessors. I expected it to be more cruel, as Gore and Violence usually sell a horror movie these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but it was not nearly as cruel as the first one that was still a disappointment. <br /> <br /> The mutants in the first one were pretty disturbing, but the filmmakers tried so hard to make them so weird that they were really funny. <br /> <br /> I also hated the overall concept of displaying the clip of the son of the female soldier on her camera mobile with the inscription "I love you, Mum" FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to even show it because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than for the rest of the soldiers, and it was even stupid to try again and again to make ourselves feel HEAVIER, by showing it three more times without reason. This movie was a joke.
