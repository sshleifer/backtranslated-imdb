If you are addressing a very simple, regressive, selfish, anti-establishment and anti-civilization Juvenilia, then this is the ideal movie. This film is written very poorly, with often inaudible dialogues and annoyingly fatiguing handheld cameras. He presents the world in appealingly simple Manichaean words: All adults (especially teachers, parents, priests, and physicians) are insensitive at best and come across predatory monsters at worst. The only escape from the horrors of civilization as a whole is a lot of primal yawning and infantile regression (literally) in a primitive, cave-like space in the forest, with utopia in the form of a rave party - again in wood (of course). ). Shows all the weaknesses of a first movie and much more.
