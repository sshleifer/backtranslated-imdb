Maybe you should not compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street has many of the original artists of early hip-hop, but it has obviously been made clear that this could be their big turn, of course for some, and that's nice. But if you think of it as an original hip-hop culture, you're wrong. It's overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Look for the first two movies I've mentioned. They convey the grudges associated with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this film is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even enthusiastic. This is probably because history, acting, dialogue and direction are all terrible, but music and dance are what people love about it. I love dancing, but at the time I thought Electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was so happy when around '86 a new generation of now classic hip-hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers , Bizmarkie (just to name a few), and I still do not like most of the beats in this movie, so it does not work for me, I mean, Wild Style does not have a lot of history, but the music there is great and authentic the taste is different and that's fine but in my opinion this movie is trash except the breakdance and some music, so I can not rate it higher than one in four ten.
