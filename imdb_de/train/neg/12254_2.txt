Some may be joking, but it's really an art to make particularly bad movies. This is missing on all fronts. <br /> <br /> A bunch of young people - of course women with swaying breasts and wet t-shirts - will of course go to the movie "Blood Surfing" and land on a 31-foot crocodile. <br /> <br /> Not only the crocodile was obviously wrong, but some props (note that the boat hits the reef) look like they came from Thunderbirds! /> Not good, from start to finish. Do not see it
