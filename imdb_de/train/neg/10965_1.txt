I'm watching this movie as I write this. , , If the following comments "prove my lack of development as a true artistic filmmaker", then it is. , <br /> <br /> But. , , I thought (still thinking how I am watching) about this movie. , , To say the least, is very, very overrated. Very very. <br /> <br /> It looks like a really, really bad student movie made by someone who has extremely limited resources. , , and who did not pay much attention to the detail. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go any further as far as the various options I lack in this film, but. , , Well . , , I just do not get it (remember, I totally admit that maybe it's ME, the idiot is here - not the filmmaker - because I did not get that "imaginative genius"). , , I rented it on a whim because the reviews were very, very outstanding. , , <br /> <br /> Gosh. , ,
