I remember when this was in the cinemas the reviews said it was awful. Well, I did not think it was that bad. It was amusing and had a lot of humorous humor about families during the holiday season. Ben Affleck is a rich guy who has to find a family at Christmas to please his girlfriend. He visits the house where he grew up and makes a deal to rent the family there for Christmas. I liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract. That was funny. <br /> <br /> So he makes stupid requests to the family and even writes scripts that they can read. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for the love interest. And he learns that the holidays are not so bad after all. <br /> <br /> The whole Doo-Dah act was funny too, especially if the first was replaced by a black man and the girlfriends' parents did not say that. And the parts where Doo-Dah meets his "supposed daughter". FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was worth checking to see if it caught on the cable.
