The Brothers Quay are directors who should judge by conventional thinking and should shoot short films. I myself really enjoyed her first feature film, Institute Benjamenta, but after her second year effort, the Earthquake Piano Tuner, I'm willing to agree that she does not come close to her genius in terms of length. Piano Tuner is without a doubt a great movie to watch and listen to. Unfortunately, it is painful to get through the intricate stories and glacial tempo. Reading the storyline sounds like a pretty good story. But the brothers do not manage to bring it to life. One thing they should definitely avoid in the future: the dialogue. My God, it is terrible here. A huge bust.
