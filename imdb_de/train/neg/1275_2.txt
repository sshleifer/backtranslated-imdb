This is a terrible movie. All three stories are bracketed with a hypnotist line for psychiatrists, which is unnecessary, and all stories are bad. The first is about wild wolves and a woman. There are some things that do not make sense, but the hypnotism thing makes up for it. The second, with bad Bill Paxton as a crazy roommate, should not be seen by anyone. The last, unfortunately the best, is almost incomprehensible, which in my opinion is better than the other garbage.
