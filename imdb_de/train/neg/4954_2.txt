I saw the original Batman Animated Series and I am an avid collector of Batman comics. With a comic hero like Batman, there are certain qualities that can not be changed. Creative liberties are all good and good, but when the character completely changes, it's too far. I bought one of the seasons of "The Batman," hoping that an extra bonus feature might shed some light on the creator's reasons for making this show such an atrocity. In an interview about the making of "The Batman," one of the artists or writers (I'm not sure which one) said, "We felt we should not play around with Batman, but we could deal with the bad guys." So they went on to make the Joker an immature little kid begging for attention, an anime knockoff to the penguin, a super-jewelry thief to Mr. Freeze, poison ivy to a youthful hippie, and countless other nefarious acts. Bob Kane turns in the grave around. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I wish I had more hands to give this show FOUR THUMBS. It squeezes my rating with 2 out of 10 just because it uses the name Batman. Warner Bros ... think again! You're welcome!
