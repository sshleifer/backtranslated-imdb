That was a really bad movie. Michael Moriarty's character "Cole" was the biggest reason this flop flopped. The actor felt that summoning an incredibly awkward southern flair would make this character more evil. After about 20 minutes, I wanted a speech therapist to perform, which would have added some sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) bad traded - 2) unsympathetic characters - 3) ultra-thin plot line <br /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
