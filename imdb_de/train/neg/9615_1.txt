From this adaptation, it seems obvious that he did not. He not only left the action behind, he also did his own! The things he had chosen were so ridiculously incredible that I was glad he had skipped some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was blurry, fickle and choppy, to say the least. I do not want to say anything mean about the actors, but they can not act! Of course, Dickens is difficult, but that is pathetic! Micawber was nothing more than a mid-nineteenth-century Kramer, and the less he said about Betsy Trotwood, the better! If you want to see the real Copperfield, check out the wonderful 1999 BBC adaptation. As for the scriptwriter, I think he read the Cliff's Notes!
