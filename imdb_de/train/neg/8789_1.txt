I watched it on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this horrible movie unfolds. every time you think it can not get any worse, it inevitably does. The spectacle is absolutely terrible. The action makes no sense at all. The title "Cold Revenge" in the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so obviously included in the first shot. There are many mistakes in the dialogues that say there is simply no intention to make another attempt to at least try to make this movie bearable. I can not remember seeing a worse movie, and occasionally I get bad - except for Wesley Snipes. No. Who I'm joking is a bad joke. Unstoppable earns Best Picture Awards at the Oscars when compared to this bitch.
