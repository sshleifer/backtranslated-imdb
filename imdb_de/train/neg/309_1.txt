Hello. I'm Paul Raddick, aka Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. I'll tell you something about this terrible movie, which is based on Adam Sandler's film career, but digitized after a short time. Going Overboard is about a rising comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails ... I thought. Sandler meets babes who like the history of the world, part 1 and rebound. The babes should be betrothed, but in fact they are executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler fared badly in Going Overboard, but it was better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison and Jen Leone's Favorites, 50 First Dates. The man, Drew Barrymore, was a hot girl. Spanglish is glowing, going overboard is not a Dooley squat! End of the file.
