This unpleasant movie has little to recommend. Dolph Lundgren gives a performance that is better than this script or his other action films allow. There are occasional dialogue clippings that suggest that the film may provide insight into a bizarre subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. Motivations are either murky or trite. The majority of acting is below average. The script creates unnecessary confusion. And the director's unnecessary fascination with focusing on Gore distracts. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this movie.
