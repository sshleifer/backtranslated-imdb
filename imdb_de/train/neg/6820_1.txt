This stupid, implausible story is only fulfilled by the opening scene in which a hardened policeman delivers some almost audible lines that confirm our biggest fears: he's dead. Maybe the film would have been saved if the director drew on the dazzling star power of A. Martinez would have waived in favor of this sad anonymous actor who had filled the screen for a brief moment. No less likely that an unnamed hacker would save such a rinse water film as a villain committing murder by dropping rocks into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver. His moment is short; his promise is immense. Perhaps this obscure thespian will give us more screen time if there is a continuation of this poorly-fledged movie.
