I comment on this miniseries from the perspective of a person who first read the novel. And from that perspective, I can honestly say I'm having fun, but I can see why it has not been sent back lately. Specifically, this mini has some serious issues, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It's a terrible failure. The actors of the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (then 45) played Natalie Jastrow, who was about 26 years old. Jan-Michael Vincent (then 39) played Byron Henry, who was about 22 years old. The other Henry children and Pamela Tudsbury were also played by actors far too old for characters to be in their 20s. <br /> <br /> 2) Part of the acting was absolutely terrible. Ali McGraw sometimes made this Mini almost unsurpassable. I have seen more convincing performances in high schools. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction was bad. To be fair to Ali McGraw, the bad drama and character development was probably the director. Hitler's account was far too exaggerated. His character looked and acted more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic, sometimes charming, but always devilish genius that Herman Wouk painted him as in the novel. Some of the other characters are so stereotyped (Berel Jastrow) that they do not get the depth of character that Wouk created for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very outdated. The hokey music, the presumptuous narration (it sounded like a narrative for history films in junior high school), and the entire primetime soap opera made the Mini almost weird at times. All too often, Byron and Natalie will disguise and look as if they were 1979, not 1939. <br /> <br /> Those who watch this without having to read the novel first will probably not get through it all because it's rather than late The 70s / early 80s will appear as "too serious" Primatzeit soap drama, and not as a TV version of a certainly modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Remakes of older films and the like are sometimes poorly done, but in this case, a creative and inspired director could make a very impressive, memorable and critically acclaimed production. I never see this happen because a remake needs to be as long (15 hours) or longer to get it right, and given the short attention span of most American viewers, it could not fly.
