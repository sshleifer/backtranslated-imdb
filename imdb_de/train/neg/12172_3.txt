After the debacle of the first Sleepaway Camp, who thought a franchise could be born. SC II is superior in aspect. More inspired murders and just a lot more fun. While this does not have much to say (compared to the first movie), Sleepaway Camp II is worth the rent. Not so good: crappy act and mullets abound. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: 5/10 <br /> <br />
