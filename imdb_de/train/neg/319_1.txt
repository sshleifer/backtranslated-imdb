A friend of mine bought this movie for Â£ 1, and even then he was totally overpriced. Despite big names like Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this movie was about as funny as picking a chisel and banging right through the ear hole. It uses tired, weird drum techniques - the fourth wall breaks constantly as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of "hot girls". Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it a successful comedian to become successful with women. When the on-ship comedian - shamelessly called "the opposite sex" for his unfathomable success "Dickie" - is considered lost at sea, Sandler's character Shecker gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he is rather locked up in the bathroom, probably seasick. <br /> <br /> Maybe he puked out of his mouth the worst movie of all time.
