I shook my head because I had seen this movie for the first time at the age of 13 months. I remember that it was incredibly bloody and made me angry. I saw it on TV a few years ago. Big mistake - the acting is made of wood, the plot does not exist and the film has no value, unless the 23-year-old T & A gets you going
