I am usually disappointed with network movies. Even Flix, who attracts big actors, is usually ruined by the TV people. However, this is the worst of the worst. The script is weak and the drama, especially that of Tracey Pollan, is disgusting. I stepped away to watch my children's high school games and treated myself to better acting. Pollan pretends to read the script while she speaks. When she tries to express fear, anger or grief, it is extremely hollow. Due to the overall quality of production, I found it difficult to take them seriously. If you decide to defy it, you are preparing for a big disappointment. Creepy things will not scare you, sad things will not make you sad, romance will not make you warm and blurry, and you'll probably be as worried as I am to see the end. "First to die" says a lot about this movie.
