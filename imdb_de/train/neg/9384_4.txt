Mae Clarke will always be remembered as the girl in whose face James Cagney showed a grapefruit in the same year THE PUBLIC ENEMY. She will not remember this weird little story about a hoodie girl who realizes that her past will always be with her. <br /> <br /> In a way, this looks a bit antiquated for 1931, almost as if you were looking at the famously inactive lights of New York from 1928. But do not be fooled. Although Ted Tetzlaff's photography is still in the big scenes, there is a lot of movement, which is a distraction for the moviegoers in the setups. But competing against the fast-paced things everyone at Warner does seem to be, this attempt to bring the woman's point of view as a tearjerker into the genre does not work, and Mae Clarke is not the actress who bothers.
