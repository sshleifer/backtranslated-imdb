I used to think that for films, actions or other means are needed to be interested in the story or anything that is going on. This movie has shown me that you do not need it at all. <br /> <br /> I could just put it that way. But IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was somehow pretty. not in the least convincing. The way the characters talk in the movie suggests that they should have taken place over a few days, but there is no time, and I'm pretty sure everything will happen in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk, buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before you vomit. It would use your time much better. Time you will never get back. Jurassic Park 3 was pulled off better than this movie.
