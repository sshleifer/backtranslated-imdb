Anyone who has seen the original must destroy this terrible remake. Alex Baldwin, who tries to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen with a word for word remake, just does not work. While Baldwin has done some great work, this is a flop from start to finish. McQueen had charisma and never tried to compete with a star. As far as Kim in the role of Ali McGraw is concerned, enough is said. McQueen looked dangerous, threatening and believable, as Doc, the film had excitement and tension, and Baldwin and his company turned it into a comedy. I laughed the only time I saw this miserable movie. And this terrible hairstyle for Michael Madsen, who is one of the most exciting and credible actors today! Did the make-up people have it for Michael, what did they think of? If you want to watch the film as it was under Sam Peckinpah's direction, get the original!
