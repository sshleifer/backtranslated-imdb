There are many obvious exaggerations associated with this movie. Let's face it: the main reasons why someone would watch are for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying that they are not good actors, I say they stank in this movie. The special effects were decent (and I'll say the filmmakers did the ship very well, the eye is appealing), but the IT even has some major flaws. For example, just before the ship goes down, you can see an unfinished bluescreen image behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the story of the REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to this story. Editing was cruel - there is no reason a movie lasts more than two and a half hours (with the exception of MAYBE, a biographical film), and the writing and script were terribly punctured that maybe the music was better than I predicted could (and not just the song "My Heart Will Go On"). There's a scene I notice when the ship goes down and bass music sounds. That could be the highlight of the movie. The mood was consistently boring. I was relieved rather than sad when Jack died, and I know that it can not be what the director was up to. Chopped chick strips.
