This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was expecting a bad movie, but I was surprised if I believe it or not. The plot is the tradition, all clich√©s are included. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is written so poorly that you actually laugh when the otherwise half-run-down actors try to make them sound. The photo is not so good, the music is so crazy that it really made me angry, the actors do not even try it, although the script makes it almost impossible that you can expect more from people who have been acting for 30 years Actually, the action scenes actually manage to miss the action itself. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why these bad movies keep coming, who is funding this shit? Where is the screening? And why on earth do actors take up this impossible scenario? <br /> <br /> There are a million Hollywood movies in this genre without any claim to reach the theaters, but even the straight to video stuff actually makes it professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything positive, except the title that explains everything. I feel robbed by 2 hours of my life.
