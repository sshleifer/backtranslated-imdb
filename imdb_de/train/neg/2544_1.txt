Gung Ho was a good idea, but it's too much to ask American viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition. In this movie, the main character Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and persuades a Japanese car company to come to America and help his dying Pennsylvania city. Two things come to you. Why should a Japanese company come to America to build cars, and that good? Second, can anyone understand that American companies of all kinds are going to Third World countries to have their products manufactured for American labor costs? The film assumes that the world's leading manufacturer of cars would go to one of its best competitors (except in Germany), there to classify a work as unrealistic. Keaton was still in his comedy mode at the time. But he does give a credible performance, though he could prove he could go from comedy to drama in a few seconds without embarrassing himself, but director Ron Howard can not stop it from becoming a television movie that ultimately Anyway, it's going to turn into a movie because when the politics and problems of Japan-America relations go bad, they'll have to put an end to the unlikely story. Gung Ho has Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel as the producers of the two TV series made the film and then the TV version of the film, giving the film a light feel. The Japanese manager loves his American workers and says that he and other Japanese can learn from Americans. His number 2 man Saito, who supposedly dislikes Americans, does not think so much. I would have preferred it if all the Japanese characters were like Saito than the soft Goofball characters they made the Japanese of. That would have made the movie more interesting.
