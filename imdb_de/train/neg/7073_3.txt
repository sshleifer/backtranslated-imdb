We have an average family. Daddy is a famous rapper, we have the "rebellious teenage daughter", the adopted white kid and the cute little kid. And we have careless housemaids, which show had such a maid? Do we have a kinky Brady Bunch? Yay! When it first came out, I found it really cool, mainly because I was young. The music was bad. The raps were so bad and they were rated too poor. All his raps were about his family and friends and about problems. The father was, so to speak, the type "Danny from Full House". Always gave the advice. But he was not a pure freak. They had a janitor for that. Notice? The acts were essentially Lil 'Romeo was in some sort of trouble, or ... that was not it. Oh, and maybe a Preteen drama. Yes, the stuff is good. Not really. But it's still a good show for kids. But Nikelodean could do better.
