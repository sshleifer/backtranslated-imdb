The main reasons for "Red Eye" are Rachel McAdams, who delivers an outstanding performance, and Jayma Mays, who works wonderfully as Assistant Hotel Manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy looks so much that he becomes caricature. The rest of the film is interspersed with holes in the holes, which I will discuss in more detail. Please do not read further if you do not want to know what happens! <br /> <br /> Here is a summary of the plot. Rachel McAdams' character (Lisa) manages a hotel where the new, hardened Homeland Security Director wants to stay that night. Rachel returns from a funeral to Miami, but calls up from her assistant until the plane takes off. In the meantime, someone is stationed in front of their father's house Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him when Cillian calls Murphy (Jackson). All Lisa has to do is call the hotel and move the director's suite to a suite where Jackson's cohorts plan to fire a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the storylines or absurd coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to make the call and in the middle the phones on the plane lose their connection. Lisa tries to fake that she makes the call, but by chance, a guy from Jackson also makes his way across the hall and knocks on his phone to indicate that it's dead. Jackson reaches for Lisa and grabs the phone. <br /> <br /> 2. At some point Jackson gets knocked off her head and of course Lisa is knocked out ... but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson gets Lisa writing a message on the mirror in the (extremely large) toilet and he bangs her around a bit. Miraculously, the only one who hears anything is an 11-year-old girl whose word, of course, is discounted. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa pinches Jackson's neck with a pen as the plane lands, steals his cell phone, and makes a mad rush at the exit, which inserts the passageway between the seats and 18 rows of stagnant passengers. Although it is known that a passenger is in the neck with a pen, the flight attendants force Lisa by opening the door to the jet-way. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, everyone is reasonable (though not very unlikely). But here it is really stupid. Lisa gets into the terminal at Miami Airport and there is no mobile signal (every major airport in America has an excellent cell phone reception). <br /> <br /> 6. She runs Jackson through the airport, and no security forces delay her. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa in the airport while pulling the train from the gates to the terminal, has lost some of his voice from the pen in his throat, but he still can be reasonably understood , He does not call his husband outside of Joe's house. (PS: There is no train at Miami Airport, but the train shown looked very similar to Orlando Airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and drives away. Of course, when making a phone call, this phone says "low battery" and shuts off soon (when will they stop using this sinister plotter?). <br /> <br /> 9. While the phone was still saying "low battery", Lisa had reached her assistant just in time to send the director and his family to the window of the room on the 40th floor in front of the gun fired by the fishing boat the director's rescue. Of course, they expect us not to notice that the hotel is surrounded on three sides by the sea. The rocket could probably have been fired in the first suite, eliminating the entire Lisa Jackson plot. What is the story here? Was the original director's room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a bad view? Nevertheless, everyone gets out just before the rocket. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa goes to Joe to rescue her father just to see the killer out there. Although she rolls over him (while shooting at her) by throwing her Jeep into the house, nobody in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop by. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrives at Joe and knocks him down (we do not see how ... maybe a head butt). Then he explains to Lisa that he has not killed his father because he wanted Lisa to die first. (Give me a break, what's that? Saturday morning cartoons?). <br /> <br /> 12. For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson chases Lisa around the house, and she defends herself with respect. Of course, a real killer (ie one who may have been played by Jason Statham) would have abolished Lisa (or anyone who is not a trained killer) in the first 30 seconds. In the course of this persecution, Jackson steps over Joe at least once without caring to kill him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson prevails, and he is about to kill Lisa when he is shot (as you suspect) by Joe. <br /> <br /> Well, here is my suggestion. Or maybe he should meet with Michael Bay (who ran the equally stupid "The Island") and make "Red Island".
