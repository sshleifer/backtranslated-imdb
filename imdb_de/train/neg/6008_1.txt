If you have made the mistake of watching the movie before reading the book, please do not give up the series. I bought my first copy of one of the books in May of this year, and I'm almost finished with Book 10. While "Left Behind: The Movie" vaguely follows the story of "Left Behind" (the book), the characters are not nearly accurate. <br /> <br /> Here are some examples: Rayford never acts for Hattie (he is close to being informed of the zeal); Buck Williams is a blond hair-writer, not a television reporter. Chloe is in Stanford and many of the details of the book Rayford wonder if she has "survived"; Buck and Chloe meet much later at a Hattie-initiated meeting in New York; Irene and Raymie are never "in the book," but only in Rayford's retrospective thoughts; The streets are so packed with wrecks after the Rapture that Rayford and Hattie need to fly back to the suburbs ... etc etc etc etc ... and that's just from the first movie; they are about to release the third. Please, even if you did not like the movies, give the book series a chance.
