I had never heard of this before it appeared on cable TV. It's very typical of the science fiction of the late '50s: sober, depressing and not a bit paranoid! Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is more likely to be presented in a documentary style - which is an inexpensive way to leave much of the narrative portrayal and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as humanly possible What is unmistakably an extremely cheap company! Although not uninteresting in itself (the Apocalypse-via-Renegade rocket angle later used with much greater confidence for DR. STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and mercifully short, the film's focused approach is His theme leads to much unintentional laughter - especially in those scenes where there is an imminent birth and a band of unsuspecting juvenile delinquents!
