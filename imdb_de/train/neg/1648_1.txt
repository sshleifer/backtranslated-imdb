Personally, I appreciate really good movies, but I also have the strange ability to enjoy even the worst crap. You know, those times when you just want to sit there and watch a horrible action movie to kill time. This is the only movie I can remember when he turned off in the middle, and I have absolutely no intention of ending it. The plot was so thoughtful and predictable that I called what the next scene would be easy (and I'm usually not very good at it). The actors were terrible, I saw better acting in middle school. Even the scene cuts were bad, the river was wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a parody that has forgotten the funny.
