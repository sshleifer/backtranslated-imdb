C'mon guys, some of the previous reviewers have almost written a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old TV show from the 60s! This episode of Star Trek is noteworthy because the most serious baby (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. In contrast to the TNG and Voyager series, which were completely limited to sound stages. <br /> <br /> This use of an outside position (and a baby) gives a fairly ordinary episode of this now-outdated episode the right depth and a nearly movie-like quality and very familiar show. <br /> <br /> Except for a few notable exceptions, eg. "The City on the Edge of Eternity", "Earth Assignment" and "Tomorrow is Yesterday" The old Star Trek series must be seriously mothballed and out of boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes of 79 are a pretty bad average. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the boring stuff that Gene Roddenberry actually produced back then, contrary to the popular belief that some people worshiped the ground he walked on. he actually did a lot of trash! He does not deserve to be spoken in the same breath as Irwin Allen. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the Enterprise Bridge from a modern perspective. They used shaky plywood for the floor, a cafeteria chair with plastic back and cheap cardboard over the instrument panels. You can see the wrinkles in the paper clearly! Any cost savings or what!
