For the great thinkers among us, "The Intruder" is an irresistibly incoherent film from France, which gives the so-called "art films" a bad reputation. The story is about a bitter old cam sauce, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who is looking for a heart transplant in Tahiti. Apart from that, I have no idea who the people in the movie were or why they did what you did. Without losing a coherent plot, the film loses us early, though I'm quite ready to admit that there may be someone who actually gets a deep message from this movie. <br /> <br /> This confused snail's pace lasts a full two hours and five minutes - though I seriously doubt anyone with any life will still hang on the credits.
