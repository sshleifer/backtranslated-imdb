[*** POSSIBLE SPOILER ***] The reputation of this movie has preceded him. Therefore, I sat down expectantly to see him in the mailbox on the TCM. What a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb and the production values ​​are first rate, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin and the whole thing is too long. For a film about alcoholism, family differences, infidelity, gambling, and sexual oppression, the film is strangely flat, prosaic, lifeless, and clichéd. An example is the depiction of Frank Hirsch's infidelity. His rather heartfelt plea to his wife to "go upstairs and relax", followed by her foreseeable headache, leads - even more predictably - to his evening connection with his secretary ("hey Nancy, I have the blues tonight make us a ride "), all after a well-worn formula. We do not believe that these are real people, but cardboard slices that act in a puppet play. The cause of the apparent friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained. Dave's infatuation with the on-again-again-out-again-Gwen scene is inexplicable given her fat inability to get stool or leave the pot. His later despair with the Shirley Maclaine / Ginny character is obviously doomed to failure from the moment he is presented to the viewer, and it was clear - through the conventions of this kind of soap opera - that this was only possible from to be solved to someone who is killed. The moment the jealous lover ran around with his gun, I started betting who-Dave or Ginny-would get killed. The whole thing was wrong with a 'P'. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, Maclaines achievement and Dean Martin's are the outstanding achievements. By and large, however, I find the film's interest in a pure piece of Hollywood history.
