The Wicker Man has done the impossible! It replaced Cat Woman as the worst new movie in my Steel Trap Cinema mind. YES, it's really that bad. So bad that when I sat down to read this review, I thought, "If I had the choice of either watching this movie again or letting red hot needles slide in my eyes," I could choose the red hot needles. <Br /> <br /> Neil LaBute has created a rare film in which Joel Schumacher could sit back and say, "Yeah, that's a bad direction". <br /> <br /> I think the first hint I should have been the tagline: "Some sacrifices need to be made". Surely it sounds like a naughty, ominous line that intrigues you, but the victim will be all on the viewer side of the screen. Trust me that those responsible for this film should be charged with hate crimes. Or at least fraud, because he tried to spend it as something entertaining. Serious! The film is about an island where males are only for breeding and I would still prefer to settle on Gilligan's Island, with only pictures of Condoleezza Rice, and then I'm stranded there. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who tore the loudest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater. This is not a joke and not fictional. I've never been to a "thriller" and have heard so much laughter throughout the movie. I can not tell you with certainty if the laugh was intended to lessen the tension in the movies, or if they really thought that guy was really going to fly. I honestly opted for a power outage or a fight for a movie breakout. Anything to make it more interesting, which is pretty sad, since Deez, Powder, and I drank only two beers before the movie (an act soon before any Nic Cage movies, write to your congressman today, do not delay) , At some point, I thought, maybe this movie is really a parody and Anna Ferris will turn up. Oh, as I wish. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage is throwing out as much ham per frame that I'm thinking of doing a cholesterol test today. To think that I ever thought Sean Penn was a bastard for Nicing's acting, oh he's still a bastard, but less than one. Yes, Sean Penn's fate was diminished by this movie. Do us all a favor, Nic play your strengths and remain a pathetic loser and drunk. You can not play Superman, you do not get strong hunky roles, go straight to jail, do not go, do not go, do not collect $ 200. His best moments in this movie are when he finally gets out of balance and actually beats a burly woman to steal her bear suit (like the fart, no joke or a functional moment during that review) and then like Aman like Conan O'Connor. Brian's running bear masturbates, but with half the hilarity of a bear whirling his trash. Fortunately, it comes to an end when it turns out that he will be a victim to the crowd on the new Burning Man and Lilith Fair tour hybrid show. Yes!!!! I just spoiled the end for you? And if you knew better, you would build statues of mine in worship and sing songs of my legend. I sat through this crap so you do not have to. <br /> <br /> About half of this little misfortune I thought Jack Bauer had completed this case in 20 minutes in real time. .OK 35 minutes when Kim is first attacked by a mountain lion. Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau could have found out in less than an hour, and you're not an Inspector Clouseau. <br /> <br /> If you are captured for any reason and have the choice to watch this movie or take a ball, take the ball. <br /> <br /> Somewhere Uwe Boll laughs at us all.
