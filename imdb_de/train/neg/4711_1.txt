I really hate this show! I had seen an episode and knew that this show is really terrible. The storylines are poorly written and executed, and the jokes are really bad. I mean, it's just a rip-off from Dexter's Laboratory and Johnny Quest, a vicious boy with flamed blond hair and his twin ingenious sisters and talking dog; a dying father and a smart, super busy mother ... oh-my-flippin'-god! Her father is a crazy mother's handyman, not so gay! If my father is home-made, I would personally die! A pity, that's ... I would really. <br /> <br /> I have nothing else to this ... this travesty, but only 3 words; Count them 3 words to describe them: <br /> <br /> · Lame, · Stupid and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I could say, guys, it's definitely my list of EV-ER's worst animated series! If I had one, that's it.
