This movie really drove me crazy because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent. I lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people here do not have a southern accent. This movie is about a man doing meth, and I do not know what this movie is about. It has a pretty graphic drug use and it's really offensive so you see how these people use meth like sugar. I lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick because he enchanted the drug. The movie makes it cool to use the drug, but in the end I was happy when the guy almost made it across the state border. I also know that most women who suffer a traumatic rape do not want to love the next day with their boyfriend or husband. The movie is wrong in all directions. I would suggest "The Basketball Diaries" if I suggested a movie about drugs.
