"Ask the Dust" looked amazing on the trailer and we especially like all the actors. Unfortunately, the movie was not compelling enough to be considered a drama, and it was not funny enough to be a comedy. It seemed to mock and had no entertaining effect. After waiting for seventy minutes for this thing to get better, my wife and I left the house. It just was not interesting, moving, funny or artistic. It seems like it was written, produced and directed by a high school student; Worse, it was such a shameful waste of exceptionally talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
