I just want to say that this production is very one-sided and breaks the impartiality, if you want to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> There are no credits from the people who interviewed you, so you have no idea if they are worthy to be heard. <br /> <br /> Tell the story from a single perspective. It is very dangerous to do so because the next generation will learn the bad idea and wars will continue to come. I know that this is not the only reason for wars, but it does not help either. <br /> <br /> You can watch this documentary, but read a lot beforehand on the internet. Balcans are as complex as human history.
