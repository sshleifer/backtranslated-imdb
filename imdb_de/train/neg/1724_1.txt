... and it is this movie. I can imagine that if there really is a negative afterlife, damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie in endless loop for all eternity. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe it's not so bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen alongside "Manos, The Hands of Destiny" ... and I've seen a lot of bad movies. do you trust me. <br /> <br /> This is just a shitty B-movie, bad filmmaking at its best (or is it worst?) What I really disliked about this movie is the moronic duo they threw for the comedy Relief. Well, a bit of comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the film focuses on the adventures of these two idiots and not on the "heroes" of this movie, who actually have less time than they have! <br /> <br /> To be honest, Crown International has really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and making bad edits. But honestly this was probably a bad movie, so Crown really could not have done much about it. <br /> <br /> This really has to be in the bottom 100 list. I would not wish for my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's my kind of Campy B movie. It was bad, but I liked it anyway, despite my 1 star rating.
