Merry madcaps in London is holding a treasure hunt. A young woman unintentionally repairs her married father-in-law with a strong, independent women's aviator who was never in love. A fascinating, early vehicle for Katharine Hepburn, who plays an Amelia Earhart-style Aviatrix who was too self dependent to surrender to any man. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the scriptwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted the book by Gilbert Frankau) were obviously assigned to this project to preserve the female point of view. Why, however, are all old clich√©s preserved like frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays the kind of simpering, whiny woman who goes to bed when things go wrong, and Hepburn's latest scene is another shit. A curious artifact, but not a classic for Kate watchers. ** from ****
