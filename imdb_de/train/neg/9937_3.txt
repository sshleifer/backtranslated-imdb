First, this is a very dated film that is not focused in its portrayal of the leftist political revolution. If someone says that the only way to truly be revolutionary is to be no longer intellectual (which in itself is quite nonsensical, since the answer has just come from the intellectual), that leaves me desperate. as if we all should become monkeys in the name of equality - that's just ridiculous. Our intellectuality is just one of many human qualities, but that does not mean that we should not educate ourselves as much as possible. But this non-educational message undoubtedly ties in with Godard's use of rock music. hence The Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song "Sympathy for the Devil", the genesis of which we are experiencing and from which the film has its name, is in fact nothing special. The chord sequence, which is not particularly original, was much better used in Led Zeppelin's "Thankyou" (Led Zeppelin II). Aside from the fact that 'Sir' Mick Jagger declares in his usually nebulous manner (more like Bob Dylan) - note that the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively repeated to form the verse. The Black Panthers depicted in this film do not seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that actually undermines the sexual "liberation" of the 1960s and today (in fact a message that believed the behavior of the Rolling Stones at the time the film was being filmed). <br /> <br /> No wonder, the DVD was delivered for free with The Sunday Times! For a truly profound historical account of left sympathy, listen to the masterpiece "Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore" by Luigi Nono.
