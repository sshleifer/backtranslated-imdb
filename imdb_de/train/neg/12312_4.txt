After the Second World War, for 50 years the United States was in a state where important sectors of the economy were dominated by military interests. At the same time everyone in society had served because of the war and the wars, or was associated with someone who had done this. This enabled a minigenere, based on the notion of American wisdom in the middle of the US, to have an inflexible military machine. Sometimes this machine was not an American military, for example in prisoners of war. Once removed are stories in other machines: science fiction and corporate, but they always relate to this military genre, and in fact, the testosterone recordings even refer to their comical siblings. <br /> <br /> You can track it, I think. perhaps starting with the comic, which means Amrican, sections of "The Great Escape," which promptly spawned TeeVee descendants in "Gomer Pyle" and "Hogan's Heros." Then a second wave, triggered by "Catch 22" and "MASH". Both had been real life, then books, then films, and in the MASH case, TeeVee. <br /> <br /> But most of all there was the "Phil Silvers Show" about a sergeant Bilko and this followed from "Mister Roberts". A lucky scammer who only committed harmless crimes, and then only in response to an overly crude system that tried to limit his life. This was the day TeeVee shows were important. You've absorbed them instead of just wearing them to work and chat. It was in no wise particularly smart, except to find that rift between what we wanted in control and freedom. <br /> <br /> It is one big zone in which the Americans have worked out how they think about forgivable or even lovable, lies in a military context, a zone adopted by one of our political parties here. <br /> <br /> Because it's big, it's sometimes worth laughing. "Stripes" was damn funny, I thought. It had the turn of the outsiders who defeated serious enemies, so to speak a few "Dirty Dozen". And sexual adventure. <br /> <br /> Well, long before the civil war escalated. It's trying to touch that sweet spot like other remakes that have abused Steve Martin. It's so insatiable that you actually use the army as a stronger player. Another way to keep track of how societies develop the grip of military power. <br /> <br /> Teds rating - 1 of 3: You can find something better with this part of your life.
