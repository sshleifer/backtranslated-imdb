Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this movie. He is barely there. Most of the time the screen is dominated by listless jokes. A running gag is that a character's name is Jerk Off. There are also many erection jokes in which the headline is someone who has an erection. This movie is as funny as Kirstie Ally's British accent. <br /> <br /> This movie started like a weak action movie: five minutes back story and then bam! Funny jokes Apart from the horrible writing, the film is also badly directed and the acting is terrible. Also, this movie makes the old bad comedy cliche that he has many well-known B-movie actors. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid, and Phil La Mar. These are just a few of the people who spend more time on screen than Rodney, though he is charged as the lead character. Do not be surprised to find this movie in a pharmacy that sells for five dollars. That's too much too.
