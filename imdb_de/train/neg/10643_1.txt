Usually I'm a little fan of the poor 80's and early 90's where the movie is now shown. But this movie is so unbelievably horrible that it was a real test of endurance to endure. Guys who disguise themselves as girls were put to death - but never so pathetic. The performance of Corey Haim was downright miserable, Nicole Eggert was not much better. This does not have any redeeming qualities, even if you're a # 1 fan / actress fan in this garbage - stay away!
