Dire Just terrible The script is sophisticated, the drama painful and the story just drags on. It's undoubtedly a celebration of Sally Potter and something else. That would not be so bad, but she's the director, writer, and star of the movie, and so it's just self-aggrandizement. I did not care about the developing romance between the two main characters, and the end did not come too soon. It has two redeeming features. First, many shots, especially in Paris, are very pretty and look pretty good in black and white. Second, whether you are a tango fan or not, the music is generally excellent (except where Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own risk or if you need an unintentional laugh. I am sure that it appeals to someone. Statistically it has to be.
