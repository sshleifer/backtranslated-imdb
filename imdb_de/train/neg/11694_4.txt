So 'Thinner' ... Yep ... This yarn by Steven Bachman (read Steven King) about a man who gets his just desserts from a Gypsy elder he's just killed I do not know why I'm not anymore enjoyed when I could have done. I think what really distracted me was the actors. I mean, who is the main character? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And if you scream out loud, can you please stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for any Italian mafioso role that ever exists? And while we're at it, does any mafioso have to have a pasta that cooks Italian mothers? The only good acting work done here is under 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine as Gypsy Elder. He's pretty good. But the rest, I make you all "better actors ..."
