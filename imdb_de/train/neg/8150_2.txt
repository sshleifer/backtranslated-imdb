If you want an unpretentious and reasonably funny hour or so, it's fine to see it. It really is not that bad. Yes, there is more logic than I would like to describe here and could tax the patience of people - like me, I have to admit - occasionally throw things in front of the TV, but that's at least funny. Just because it's not always INTENTIONALLY FUN, you do not have to abandon yourself. <br /> <br /> However, if you've read the book - or one of Brookmyre's other books - you'd probably do it. It's best to avoid it. I read them all and when I saw this movie for the first time, I despised it. I have given it on another page in detail and in detail in the trash. The TV storyline has virtually no relevance to the book and served only to outrage and annoy many loyal (and admittedly daring) Brookmyre fans. Look at this, then read the book and THEN make your comparisons and give your verdict.
