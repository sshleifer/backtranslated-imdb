After watching about half of this movie, I noticed something special ... I kept changing channels on the TV to see what else was going on - not a good movie feature in a number of genres, and me have to say that it has misunderstood with each of them. I switched 80% through the movie to see an old replay instead. Conclusion: The whole movie felt like the creators did not know exactly what to do and ended up in a mix with no apparent taste.
