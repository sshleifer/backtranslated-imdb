This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This makes the Mill TV movie run look like Reservoir Dogs. Based on a book by the only Britney Spears and her mother, this is garbage, nothing is a decent performance by Virginia Madsen (I hope you were well paid) to save it. The story of a Red Neckland gill who wins a scholarship at a prestigious music school is little, but a means to peddle Ms. Spears, to give the music to the consumer, and to generally agree that low brow must be the way. Here's nothing good with all the beats as predictable as the night after. Never again.
