I own this movie. I have no choice. Recently I was really bored and the box fascinated me. So I put it in the old VCR and shouted for the next hour and a half of my life, "Why God why?". The story was not so bad as a player I could appreciate something of it. I think if you are interested in extremely geeky-romantic scenes, you will enjoy this movie. "I've always thought of myself as a Vulcan you know like Dr.Spock ... you can not love." There are few good things to say about this film. But when it comes to really bad movie, this is the one for you !!! The real story, however, is much more interesting;) <br /> <br /> If I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
