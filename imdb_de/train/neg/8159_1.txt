This only applies to the first movie by name. The plot has nothing to do with the first one and the whole movie stinks !!! I have no idea what they thought, but this movie is so bad. Avoid this at all costs, the first movie in the series is acceptable as a Slasher movie and the fourth, but this and the third are nonsense !!
