This really does not do the blues justice. It starts badly with pictures of the Voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone blind), who seemingly is telling from outer space (?) And telling us the life stories of various Blues musicians. Corny, as it is, could be the most visually interesting part of this documentary. After that, the only thing that can be seen is actors who make the classic melodies incompetent, filmed in a fake black-and-white cut of the 20s, in which Beck and Shemekia Copeland rape the same songs afterwards. This is a good tool to show us why the old blues greats were really great, but it's not compulsory for viewing. There is hardly anything that could justify making it a movie, not a radio drama. Nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments. That's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for the Blues. Avoid at all costs.
