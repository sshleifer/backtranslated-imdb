This movie was extremely boring. It should take at least 15 minutes. The images of the child and the animal that were killed were a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> I usually do not write any comments, but it was so bad that it had so many good and excellent comments. I think, in this case, we have come one step closer to the honest assessment of this title. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? I fall asleep 3 times during this movie. It was about 4 hours after I woke up from 8 hours of sleep. I think it's the point itself. <br /> <br /> There's no dialogue between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the very end. <br /> <br /> If you fall asleep once, you will not see it rewinding and catching up because you will fall asleep again.
