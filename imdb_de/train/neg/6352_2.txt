I have always been a big fan of Woody Allen and will always be most of what he has done in the past, but only a blind lover could ignore how boring, meaningless, overbearing and, above all, horrible this movie is. An empty mental masturbation based on fickle reasons. And what a disastrous idea of ​​artificially restoring a putative "actor Allen clone" that means putting Will Farrell in the mouth and showing what Allen would have done to Farrell if he had been 30 years younger. The result was obviously ridiculous. And not to mention the dialogues ... what was meant to be a philosophical reflection became an involuntary mockery of intellectual thought unaware of its comical effect. How sad...
