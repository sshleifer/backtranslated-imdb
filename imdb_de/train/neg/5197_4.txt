Weaker entry into the Bulldog Drummond series with John Howard in the role. Usual funny banter and antics, but not much conspiracy. As an inspector, Barrymore has something to do and disguise disguises to follow Drummond, Algy, and Tenny on a wild chase (mostly in circles, maybe the budget was tight) to rescue the poor Phyllis, who wants to be held captive by Drummond to lure to his fate. For those who hold points, Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry him, and Algy worries about missing the baby's baptism. It's fun to see Algy and Tenny disguised as anglers to mingle in the Angler's Rest, but little of it gets stupid.
