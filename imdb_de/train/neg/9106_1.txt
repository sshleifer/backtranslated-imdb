Already in the opening scene you will see how much they have tried to imitate the very intelligent and powerful "Cruel Intentions" and how flat they ended up. You'll also notice what terrible decision they made when they cast Robin Dunne as Valmont. Then in the second scene, you'll meet the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother. That is, if you can overcome the fact that Kathryn was not blonde in the first movie ... Then the movie goes on, you see the cheap, romantic story of miles, and you notice that Sebastian has already met Anette in the movies has past, here called Danielle, and Cecile, here called Cherie ... How original is that for a prequel. Then it becomes an inexpensive "Wild Things" movie with many, many painstaking "twists". As I said, Robin Dunne was a very bad choice. Not that he's a bad actor, he's good. He just does not have the charisma that Ryan did. Amy Adams, who in my opinion is one of the most talented young actresses of our time, delivers once more. But with all the talent of the world you can not save this garbage. Overall, this "movie" feels like a series of "Beverly Hills, 90210". The score was stolen by 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker' ... Yes, they used the JAWBREAKER score ... Could they at least not leave them alone ?! You want to pass this on. If you want more cruelty, look at the dangerous connections of Stephen Frears.
