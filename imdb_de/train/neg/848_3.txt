OK, if you're looking for another Bastketball diary, this is completely the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> I have two brothers. Max, the younger, has a strong cocaine addiction. Adam, the oldest, is a doctor. This film is intended to show the leap from reality to the extreme depths that allow drugs. It does not do it. It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation. The main focus of the film is on Max and his farewell paths. After all, Adam can not take the stress out of his job and starts using it (perscription drugs). <br /> <br /> This movie has almost no climax. Do not get into what cocaine really does to you, have boring and inexpensive scenes, and the acting of the oldest brother Adam is terrible. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how this film has managed to survive and receive bonuses, it is not a heartbreaker. If you want a clear and true story film about the extreme world of drug users, buy 'The Basketball Diaries'. Notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie, but if you think you will enjoy it. See for yourself ...
