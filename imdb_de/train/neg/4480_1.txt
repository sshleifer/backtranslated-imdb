Let me first say that at first I did not see this movie with high expectations. It was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movies, and "MTV" was stuck on the front page, so I did not expect much. What I expected was a tear joke, overly dramatic, but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, let me begin by never reading the book. I have not seen any other versions of the movie either. <br /> <br /> Acting was my main problem with the movie. By God, it's WONDER. The main girl is pretty mediocre but compared to the rest of the cast she is Maryl Streep. The main hero, Heath, is just terrible. He can sing decent-sounding clich√© songs, but that's about it. His acting broke the "sad" moments by being so bad at points that I just burst into laughter. The girl of Isabel was also rather god-fearing, and the brother was just a flat figure played by an actor who could not express any emotion. And when he tried, it failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor to play Edward, though it was obvious the direction was bad because he did not achieve what I saw. Oh, and Father was not half as bad in my memory, but he was so short on the movie that I can barely remember. <br /> <br /> The story itself was not very good. More separations than you can imagine. Predictable story (To the end, which I barely understood). EXTREMELY one-sided characters with no real depth ... Overall just not interesting or captivating, nothing we've never seen before. MUCH better and nothing that would be worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> The end is supposed to be a tearjerker. It did not do anything like that. The end is not built at all, it almost feels like an afterthought. In fact, I had to ask my friends WHY the end actually happened, and when they told me, I had to face my face with "Wait, when did you say that?" Never a good sign. The editing was probably the worst I've ever seen, even though I understood the fade-ins fade-outs, because this was originally intended for television, but that's really no excuse. <br /> <br /> All in all, film is just garbage. I'm a sensitive guy, I cried during two Simpsons episodes. I never cried, not even near. Really, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see a tearjerker, look elsewhere.
