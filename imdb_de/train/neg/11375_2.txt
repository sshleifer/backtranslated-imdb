Are you talking to me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie with some guys I've never seen before, or since I've been starring as a guy from the neighborhood and trying to be an actor. He has heavy taxis for Taxi Driver as he tries to grow up with this Shtick. When he learns the hard facts of life, he does what everyone else does, changing his image! He goes over to a good guy overnight. His friend can not believe the change (but he scores with Faith Ford and gets a cool, paying gig). Can this young punk keep his street criticism as he grows up? <br /> <br /> This is a real, lame movie that tries too much to integrate too many things at the same time. An interesting idea that breaks down due to bad execution. Who knows, maybe someone will reach for the ball and run because the filmmakers fumbled the ball this time. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. Unless you want to see a hot Faith Ford and a young Bubba from Forest Gump. <br /> <br /> xx
