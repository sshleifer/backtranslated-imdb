"Fungicide" is probably the most incompetent, embarrassing, pathetic "movie" I've ever seen. The acting is criminal, the direction practically nonexistent, and the special effects are probably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenseless laptop computer. <br/> <br /> It's far from me to stifle creativity, but I really think such things should not be done. I'm sure the "movie" makers will say, yes, the "movie" was hampered by a low budget (as in nothing) - but in that case, they really should not have bothered. As it is, they have offered the world something so horrible, so vile, that only fools could have the slightest pleasure from it. <br /> <br /> When starting the "movie" it was not as if I expected it to be "Citizen Kane" or anything. I expected a little horror on a low budget, maybe with a bit of ingenuity, a touch of fun and even some energy. What I got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief. <br /> <br /> The story? Well, our suffering anti-hero scientist working in his parent's basement shakes a few times in a cup. It seems that such high-level science is the result of years of research. His parents then send him to a strange hotel in the countryside to relax. There are some other people who are just too terrible to write about. Anyway, the scientist drops his test tube on some mushrooms - and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people. (Wow, I get suicide by writing the summary of the plot). Our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar (by attaching a "fuse" - really a piece of string). The barrel inexplicably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon and destroys all mushrooms. The end. (Thank God). <br /> <br /> This summary is as good as the "movie" gets (and actually makes it much more interesting than it really is). It should never have gone beyond this stage of development (which I have called an outline scrawled on the back of an envelope with crayons). Someone should really go in and shake somebody strong and say "NO". <br /> <br /> And these "special effects". Well, they are "especially" okay. This has gone crazy CGI. And that of a person of whom I can only assume that the bicycle pump is the pinnacle of modern technology. And if the mushroom monsters are not in the style of a home computer graphics package from 1984, they are portrayed by actors who have slipped in a leaf (I'm not clueless). <br /> <br /> One of the most indefensible things The movie is about laziness. This can be summarized by the scene in which the hero turns his weapons (a la Clint Eastwood) and then fails to get them in the bag. I mean, come on, a few repetitions and he could have done it, but just to leave it as it is - really weak. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that money was spent on this camcorder garbage. The "movie" makers should shame their heads and be no more than fifty yards from any movie equipment. <br /> <br /> I also think that it is wrong for friends and family members to come to IMDb and publish mischievous reviews and make stupid high user ratings that give a totally inaccurate picture of the "movie". "Fungicide" is an absolute travesty of filmmaking. Mr. Wascavage is either very, very stupid or very, very cynical.
