This sword & sorcery story of a horribly brutal and talkative "hero" defeating a wicked king is worthless in almost every detail. The spectacle is terrible from the leads to the supporting roles. The mocking, happy joy with which the director shows the hero bloodied is absolutely disgusting; it is not redeemed by justice for his cause, because he is as bad as the people against whom he fights. Z-movie editing is abundant, including a scene in which a character "dies" at a sword thrust, which was obviously missed entirely by Lana Clarkson, who are usually shown naked in the movie. As a 20-year-old man, I will not pretend that female flesh on the screen does not attract me. But the treatment of their characters is so humiliating and the sex scenes so casual and cheerless that I myself could not enjoy this aspect of the movie. <br /> <br /> Most cheesy films of this era are at least somewhat relaxed with a light-hearted, winking feeling (the sequel is better in this regard), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take himself seriously as a heroic fantasy. Under no circumstance! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 of ****.
