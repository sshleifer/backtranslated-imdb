Given the story of the director of this film, it's hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through. I was at the European premiere yesterday and one of the executive producers was there. He still had to watch the movie and, boy, he had a surprise. I have not read the book to which this book refers, nor do I know if it has been highly rated or appreciated, but I have read "Captain Correlli's Mandolin" and how poorly suited it was for the canvas and how bad this movie was, I can only suppose that something similar happened here. Acting was not bad, though there were a few too many raised eyebrows from Farrell. Honestly, I can not believe how little I cared for any character in this movie. Situations appear on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness. Donald Sutherland's part contains several scenes in which he opens a door, says something and closes it again. I kept looking at my watch if I did not twitch in the dialogue on the screen. I've never been to a movie before, but I was tempted to start in that movie. I gave this movie a score of "2" for reasons that seem terribly shallow to me. However, these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the all too short earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek was naked and looked pretty. I can say little else positive about this movie. Do not ask the dust for something, he can not speak!
