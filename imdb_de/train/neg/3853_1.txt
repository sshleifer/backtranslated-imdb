I think Jason Lee has a lot of potential, but this was the WRONG vehicle to try to break out as a star. The plot is terrible, the comedy is terrible. I laughed twice, I think, to the relief, because in hindsight that was pretty bad jokes. I was worried about the future of Fletch and had to console myself with the fact that the movie was flawed, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend the still photos on this site to find out instead of this movie. Save your time 1 star
