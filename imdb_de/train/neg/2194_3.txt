Ordinary premise. Very unrealistic What I've learned from this movie is that maybe it's not the best idea to drive crazy to get into the weekend cabin. I loved how Bill can roll out of the car easily and without any injuries! Unfortunately, the same can not be said for his girl. Oh, and the police never seemed to find the car or track down the wreck owner. <br /> <br /> Many pulled-out scenes including a simple stripper (still have nightmares about this scene). Poor assistant guy and his stupid, useless hand. I admit, I was curious to see what the mysterious "thing" was behind the door, but when it appeared, I just laughed. HAHAHA !! The girl seemed really sad to be revived. Personally, I would really like to have a new body after such a painful experience!
