badly directed garbage. a mediocre nihilistic sadistic gorefest ... if you're the type of person who likes that ... see a shrink. Even if you are this person, this does not make a good movie, the acting is really bad, the story full of storylines, the director should just give up and find a real job because he has no talent for this film. I can see why people do not like uwe boll ... we've had some of his films lately and that's the best of them, which is really sad! The complete absence of any kind of human seems to suit some people, but here it is simply true. Horror movies can be full of despair, they can be miniature works of art, they can just be viewed well, if not otherwise ... SEED is really very bad.
