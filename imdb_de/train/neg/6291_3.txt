Now I recently had the pleasure of seeing the weird bachelor party, one of my new favorite comedies, that laughed until it hurt the kind of movies. Of course, I wanted to see the sequel, hoping it would have the same laughs, but instead, Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation is being made by the American Pie generation. Yes, the first movie has nudity, but it does not show up in every scene. The plot is exactly the same from the beginning, it's not always a complaint to me, but this could have been a bit more original. The only thing is that I am glad that in this movie no old actors from the original can be seen, because it looked cheesy or really stupid. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are only engaged after 2 months of dating, everyone is against it. Melinda has a rich family, but they are quite happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother Todd is worried that Ron will accept his job. So they're going to Miami for a bachelor party and Todd will see to it that he lures Ron into a photo that makes Melinda change her mind about the marriage. <br /> <br /> Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation laughed a few here and there, but not what the first movie has achieved. These guys, Ron's friends, were more vile than sympathetic, except for Seth he was weird. The only sympathetic characters except Seth are Ron and Melinda, everyone else is more or less annoying. Do you want to watch this movie? Just look at Girls Gone Wild, it's the same, just that it does not look like it's a movie. Stick to the original bachelor party, this is the movie that brings you to tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
