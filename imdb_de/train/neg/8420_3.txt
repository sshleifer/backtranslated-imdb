Despite the outstanding cast, this is an inconspicuous film, especially from the aviation perspective. It may be a bit better than the monstrous "von Richthofen and Brown", but not much. "Blue Max" is still the best of a small market in the last 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is fun if you do not take it seriously. It's interesting to speculate on what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new, high-quality movie from World War I.
