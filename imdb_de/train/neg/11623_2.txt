From what I read about the movie, I was thrilled to support a movie with a Christian theme. Everything about the movie was very unprofessional. Especially the writing! Without good writing, a film has no chance. The author / director said in an interview that he does not want to reveal how the title is related to the story. Believe me, it was not a big surprise. I've always been waiting for the teenager / young adult backgrounds to unfold, but it never did. As someone who divorced, I was very disappointed. This movie would NOT have been my consolation when I first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your Christian life!
