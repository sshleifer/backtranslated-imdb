The zombies' uprising is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's way down the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the trick to make zombies after the First World War, one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions. And at least he succeeds first. A love triangle makes history a bit more complicated. <br /> <br /> This was really a boring movie with terrible actors that made it difficult to tell who was and who was not zombies. The dialogue was a little better and the plot was unbelievable (not the zombie part, but parts referring to the "romance"). And although I'm not a student or an expert in cinematography, the camera work did not seem to help the film much. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen a few films that are worse, this is unlikely to be anyone. It's bad and NOT in such a bad way.
