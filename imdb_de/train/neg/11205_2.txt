Yes, I definitely regretted that I gave up my Saturday night and saw this strange little but very long movie. Apparently, the main character did not do it, stealing two hours of my life. Here is the epitome of the anti-hero in "No Regrets". We have this madness, so confused, so wandering, so selfish, aimless and unlikely that it was extremely difficult to get past the attractiveness of the aspiring son of the highly favored merchant Jaemin, unless it was just the physical attraction. He claims differently that it is love. But after seeing this, it's like loving Charles Manson because you dig your beard. (Okay, it's not that bad, but still no real salable properties.) I could never overcome the cause of Jaemin, the endless blades of Sumin. It was never shown, just said that Jaemin loves Sumin. Maybe it's a culture that flew over my head: crazy / stalking = crazy love in Seoul. It has to be that way, because more than half of the movie is stalking the other, and the last part stalks back and forth to the point where I thought it would turn into a screwball comedy. I waited for a tiger named "Baby" to show up. Okay, Sumin has two jobs during school time, so good that someone is trying to improve himself. After his first taste of the attractiveness of his stalker, he gives up his job for a kind of prostitution ring. What? OK, as I said, the obsession does not stop when the job / career changes. When you throw in a few other very angry characters, you get a jumbled movie in which unimaginable events seem unstructured. Basic movie, not terribly horrible, but with foreign gay movies it's better.
