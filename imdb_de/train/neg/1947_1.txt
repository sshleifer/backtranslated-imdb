I'm 17 years old and still likes most Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the '90s movies, and recently we were offered one of the better DVD Scooby Doo tours of the decade, Scooby Doo and The Goblin King, which I did not expect to be as good as they were. Anyway, come back to get a hint! I watched a few episodes and expected something very good, but I was not impressed by what I saw. At first I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and very Saturday morning checkered standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hated had slightly better animations. Worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked aliens and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne as they added a lot to the old episodes when Scooby Doo was positive. I also hated the character changes because it seemed like puzzles were solved, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superheroes, something they would not have done in the movies or Scooby Doo Where Are You. Show. The subject was not very good either, I can not even remember it, and the jokes were lame and smart. I admit that there is a very talented voice if it had had better material, and they were not told to sound as human as possible from the original voices. In conclusion, I personally thought that it was terrible, and I'm not trying to discredit it, that's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
