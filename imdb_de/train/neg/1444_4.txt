The film is very tedious and unfortunately differs quite a bit from the novel. If you want to watch the movie, do not read the novel first as it will shock you. However, the cinematography was fine and if you're a person who loves adventure genres exploring Africa, then you should try. Performances are sufficient, but many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was in search of his missing brother and not on a lady who was looking for her father. Gagool was torn and killed in the cave, whereas she turned out to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
