In a now deleted post by another IMDb user, it was pointed out that anyone who could see "The Medusa Touch" should be warned of a scene that is eerily reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York. However, I hope everyone who reads this will take this warning into account. Despite an interesting pedigree (Producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye", co-producer Arnon Milchan co-produced the Oscar-nominated "LA Confidential" and screenwriter John Briley won an Oscar for "Gandhi") and an international Cast, I found "The Medusa Touch" a stubborn, unintentional laughter uprising. It was a badly directed, terribly written and restrained mess. It was trying to use the genre of telekinetic thriller of the 70s. The movie fails in many ways. Please note "Carrie" and the underrated "The Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). There were two entertaining and thrilling thrillers dealing with the same topic.
