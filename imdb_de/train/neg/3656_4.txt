I have to admit that since I can remember being a fan of samurai flicks. I watched more randomly, be it "elitist" works like The Seven Samurai or the bloody comic version like Lone Wolf and Cub. I also liked US / Japanese "crossovers" like The Bushido Blade. And of course everything that Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada contains. I've watched virtually every samurai at least twice. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993, I saw Kabuto for the first time on video that even samurai films can be boring. At first, I was looking forward to seeing Mayeda reach Europe and the confrontations that would emerge from it, but when he actually reached Spain, I was not really that interested in the movie anymore. <br /> <br /> It would not do the film justice to call it "bad". Technically, it's a clean start to the genre. But it's never calm enough. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as a director and actor and has only a fraction of the above Japanese actors with charisma. Speaking of Sho Kosugi's son Kane, who appears in almost all Sho Kosugi films as a Shos son, he has inherited little to none of his acting skills. The minus points are the lack of blood and blood, which until then was a trademark of all Samurai films. This was obviously meant for a younger US / European audience. <br /> <br /> Let's just say that it's such a nice movie for an average historical action-adventure fan, but boring for boring fans of samurai cinema. Fans of the "samurai meets ??" - Genres should watch Red Sun (1971) with Charles Bronson as Cowboy, who must team up with Samurai Toshiro Mifume to get a samurai sword from Alan Delon. It's pretty good how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong. <br /> <br /> Although the movie lasts only 100 minutes, it seems to be a much longer movie. <br /> <br /> The reason why I gave this with 4/10 points instead of 3/10 points: For the first time, when I saw this movie, I saw it in the German dubbed version. In this version Kosugi can actually be understood. I have to admit that his Engrish is sometimes funny, but gets boring after about 30 minutes.
