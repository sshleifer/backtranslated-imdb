Alfred Hitchcock has invented every kind of thriller you might think of: he set the standards so high that any director making an exciting movie is fated to be compared to him. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this Bullock vehicle is all The ideas, almost everything, were already contained in Hitchcock's classic "Rope": the two students who committed a gratuitous crime, Niet's philosophy, and the clues that the guys spread, the master was the first one who put them on the screen -minimal movie, which was a technically intriguing tour de force. <br /> <br /> "Murder by numbers" does not take place in a single room, like "the rope", mind you. And what a supreme originality, it turns two policemen against the bad teenagers, and one would not guess, these two policemen are very different: Bullock actually plays the role of a woman who lives like a man, and her partner (Chaplin ) is as shy as an unsuspecting girlie The performances of the two boys are not really gorgeous, not as good as those of Edward Norton in Urangst. <br /> <br /> Well, "Rope" was so good ....
