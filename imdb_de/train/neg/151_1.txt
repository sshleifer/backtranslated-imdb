This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming thing about this movie is that next time I'll be asked what the worst vampire movie I've ever seen. I have a suitable answer. <br /> <br /> I think it's shot at 35mm, so it's like hell. I would not have bothered to comment, but I've noticed that some fanboys (who were probably involved with the film) claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix. Let me expose the myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good in the movie. Everything is sticky. The actress is ugly. The fight choreography is the worst I've ever seen. The fight scenes are incredibly amateurish. Imagine a girl whirling helplessly with her arms, missing faint kicks that would not hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director has just pulled people off the streets to give them roles in the movie. <br /> <br /> I know the director did not have a lot of budget for the movie, but so far, even better movies have been made on a smaller budget. Unforgivable.
