I saw this movie when it was first released. The memory of how bad it was left me almost forty years. I did not want to trust my own views about the movie when I saw it. That's why I looked up a film review published in a big city newspaper the next day. A little research shows that the producer was the star of the man Leslie Caron. The hint of nepotism suggests the beginning of this terrible movie. The list of many capable actors - including Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Graham and James Sikking - suggests the film is promising. The death of this film, however, is due to his terrible script. The "mystery" that is implied is so obscure and so little revealed that the viewer remains confused from scene to scene. The film seems to be torn between detective secret and spy thriller, but never decides for one or the other. The feeling of tension is missing completely. The main characters choose to play dry, emotionless types in a way that does not create any empathy. The cinematography is pedestrian. The result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters, the storyline, and ultimately the movie itself. I am not surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film for sale. I hope that if TCM finds a withdrawal of this movie and feels compelled to air it, it will surely be banished to the 4 o'clock slot.
