Well, that's 90 minutes of my life, I'm not coming back. This movie makes the teen television show "California Dreams" look like "Almost Famous". The spectacle was terrible and the plot unrealistic. Do not even let me start with the actual band at the top of this story, lame songs, watch, etc. They had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country and there is not enough irony in the band world to accept them. The guitarist is considered a heroin user, not that I accuse him. If I had to deal with a lazy band with outdated songs and wooden games, I would inject the horse too. <br /> <br /> Music remotely seriously, avoid it at all costs.
