* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> <br /> With a title like "Bleed" you know that the creative juices did not run high when this puppy was born. The movie is your usual, low-priced Slasher movie. Sure, they try to be creative with the premise of the "Killer Club", but we find out that was just a joke anyway. Okay, for those who really care about these things, the basic conspiracy is that a new girl in the city starts dating with her colleague. He invites her into his circle of friends, and at a party they tell her how a "murder club" exists, and they murder people, blah blah blah. Well, we learn that it was all a joke, but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage. Now the "members" of the Murder Club are killed one after the other. Oh, and the bad guys win and the movie ends with a downer. However, it does not really matter to you at this point. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the first 10 minutes of this movie make no sense. The motivation for the murders at the beginning of the film is never explained. I would say it was a way for the director to fill the movie, but there are scenes on the DVD that have been deleted! I'm not sure why anyone wants to see more than the feature-length version of "Bleed," but apparently the people behind the DVD thought the audience was asking for more. The box says that there are Easter eggs, but why the hell would I waste my time looking for extras in this movie? <br /> <br /> I expected a bad movie and "Bleed" delivered on this front. It was not a funny bad movie. Everyone looks good in the movie and there is a lot of nudity, but the acting is just awful. My least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer ... I think he should be funny and amusing, but he just comes out as a tool. I think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage in a strangely unconvincing death. Heroine pushes the women into the cement bar of the parking garage and the woman looks like she's hardly beating the thing, and she spits out a gulp of blood and "dies." <br /> <br /> For those who think filming is a complicated, creative process done by professionals, read "Bleed". It will change your mind and you will find that every hack can create a movie. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money otherwise.
