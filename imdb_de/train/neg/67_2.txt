The political theme of this film is so obvious and cumbersome right from the start that the result is quite predictable. Any good textbook on writing scripts advises superimposing the characters, integrating drawing sheets, and creating a three-file structure. You will not find anything like this in this movie. The police are the bad guys and are therefore portrayed as flat, incompetent and cowardly. The creators of this film never seem to think that the police could be honorable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the good of society. The viewer gets no opportunity to catch up on his opinion of whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The movie starts with being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no indication of guilt or innocence. We see him go through the door of a prison, but only know that he was inside for three years when we hear that much later in a dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film contains many shots of Ned Camera with a serious expression. I found the movie a real duty to watch. It's the direction for modern films, and this has kept me from looking more.
