When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was broadcast in the United States, I was thrilled. I then had the misfortune to look at the damned thing. I love the books of M. C. Beaton about the wonderful Scottish constable. The characters in the book are entertaining and very well written. The powers responsible for this mishmash have apparently never read one of Beaton's books. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has something to do with the series. In addition to the lack of well-known characters, I find the whole show offensive loud. It seems the actors feel like yelling at each other and shouting at each other. If you love the charming Hamish Macbeth of M.C. Beaton, do not waste your time with this garbage.
