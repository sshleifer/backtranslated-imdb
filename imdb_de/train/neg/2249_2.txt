This is a terrible disaster of a movie. From start to finish it is filled with bad acting and even worse conducting and editing. The only redeeming parts of the film are some of Streisand's numbers, since the Kristofferson parts can neither be viewed nor heard. The main problem with this movie is that we never see Kristofferson's character at its peak or that Streisand's character does not do well. The first should be in the downtrend and the second should go up. The final Streisand number could have been one of the biggest finals in the film, if it was properly directed and edited. The only framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. If the band, the audience and the wide settings of the stage had been shown, this number could have been dynamic and interesting. This film must have been directed and edited by a dropout from NYU Film School. The only worse thing is the wretched screenplay. The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this movie, and even that is completely miscalculated by fake technical decisions.
