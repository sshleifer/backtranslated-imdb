Apart from the great movies of the great James Wong Howe in the fight scenes, this movie is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie I have seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda. The first was Charles Laughton's "Rembrandt". It was so lousy that I turned it off. I'm afraid this is not much better. Flora Robson is as ugly as ever, like Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps her performance as a virgin queen was good for the 1937 standards, but compared to Helen Mirren's, she is not comparable at all. Robson explains her lines in a robust way. Their battle message to the English troops is so mindless. <br /> <br /> Even a dashing Laurence Olivier can not save this total boredom. <br /> <br /> The future wife Vivien Leigh is a minor role here and she does not really teach anything here. To think that Scarlett was 2 years later! <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the story of the Spanish armada in this movie is so boring.
