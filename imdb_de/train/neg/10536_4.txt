William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director / writer recognition for this entertaining, low-budget movie about three boys camping in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet supported by fire and students joke back and forth ... and a dreadful city tramp called Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... by Leatherface Fame) wanders over and exchanges four stories of Gore for food and the warmth of fire. A story is the old retreading of "The Hook", two teens on the trail of a lover who are attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand. In another story, a few tokens must collect weeds. You stumble upon a guy who knows a guy who has great s # @ t. As they smoke a few sacks, they begin to turn gray and green before they inflate and fall off. One of the better stories is about an unfortunate man who returns home for Christmas, who can not wait for his mother to die, and he enjoys telling his nephew and niece, Satan Claus. The Fourth Campfire Fairy tale is about a greedy sailor being washed ashore by an empty treasure chest and being chased away by zombies at sea. <br /> <br /> Without much budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets to the point and could have been a lot worse. A bit cheesy, but funny, except maybe the sailor story. The spectacle is understandably not praiseworthy. Cast members include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H.Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin, and Paul Kaufmann.
