one of the worst movies I have seen so far. Pathetic action scenes and really bad acting do not help either. The only good point are the parts of Gary Busey, but that does not really lift the movie. it lives up to its B-movie ranking and passes the test with flying colors. A waste of my money, although at first I found it entertaining to get annoyed after a few watches. I recommend this movie only if you watch it for free or make a gift. (a gift that you can ask for the receipt and return a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
