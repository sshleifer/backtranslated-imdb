I saw this movie when I was much younger and I thought it was funny. I saw it again last week and you can guess the result. Some funny parts, very few and too long. The beginning is the only thing that's funny, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> If you want a full B-movie, this is a good choice, but do not expect too much of alien dwarf size
