I do not think much about this movie. <br /> <br /> This was a horrible movie ... I can not even tell you why I chose to watch it. It had so few redeeming qualities that I do not even know where to start. <br /> <br /> The plot went from implausible to absolutely absurd. My whole body was tense throughout the movie because I could not wait for the horrible to be over. At the end of the film, I felt incredibly relieved. <br /> <br /> The cut was poor, the acting was below average and the plot was weak. Francoise Robinson was cast as an Indian, although she does not even resemble someone of similar origin. <br /> <br /> If a movie is to be so idiotic, it should be ridiculously stupid - at least. It was not It was just pathetic.
