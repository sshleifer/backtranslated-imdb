I saw a trailer for another video and decided to rent when it came out. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is extremely boring, acting (aside from Christopher Walken) is bad and the characters can not care less, besides wanting to see Nora's husband beaten up. Christopher Walken's role is such a litter, what an eye-catcher!
