This is the worst movie I've ever paid, and with the exception of "They Saved Hitler's Brain" the worst movie I've ever seen. When this movie came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV, so I expected it to be probably the funniest movie that could be produced because it did not have the limitations that the TV improvisation shows had to deal with. <br /> <br /> The authors must have believed that we are going to do something nude, flatulent jokes, cheap sex and hey, we have a risky side that splits ridiculous comedy. The game show skits are nothing more than a cheap, unimaginable start to Let's Make a Deal with stupid rudeness. The sitcom take-off, involving the single girl and boyfriend, was simply poor high school humor. Advertising for the stun guns was the appropriate humor for Seasame Street. The metro sketch by LA was a fat humor with tasteless bloodyness. The French chef went around blindly and said "there is no difference" with a French accent, well, you have my point. <br /> <br /> The only funny sketch that affected Chevy Chase, which lasted a full minute. That means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh yes, I have read the comments on the whole country, which was stoned in the 70s. If you are tall, you will like this movie. Well, most of the land was not stony in the 1970s. If the unwritten writers were stoned, it must have been sleepy sinus medicine. When I saw this movie, there were 4 other people in the theater next to me. Of course it did not come out how bad the movie was.
