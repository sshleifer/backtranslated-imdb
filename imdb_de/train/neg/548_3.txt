I saw the 7.5 IMDb rating in this movie and decided to watch this movie my roommate had rented. She said she had seen it before. "It's funny and sad! I cried when I saw it for the first time," she enthused. Compared to other Bollywood films, this may earn 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other films I have seen in my life, this does not deserve more than a 3. Any movie in which I can constantly guess What will happen next is not good for me. The characters are unbelievable how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are invented. It is dramatically over and the songs are not that great. My biggest problem with Bollywood films is the lack of subtlety. All emotions are too exaggerated and therefore not realistic at all. Any emotion or bond between characters that is least subtle has to be magnified with an unnecessary song. I think I understood that the relationship between the father and the son was more like one between friends than one between parent and child, without the need for a five-minute song. The stupid comic relief with laughter was neither funny nor necessary (Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the shed). When a movie tries to bring tears through the most choppy means, it just does not make sense, just a bit embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br If someone has end-stage lung cancer, their son living with him would know that something was wrong without that you had to tell him something. Too many action holes to count. At first, the movie was amusing and cute in the way Bollywood movies are for people they do not look so eagerly, but it got boring. It takes a lot of skill to create a movie that is amusing and heartbreaking, and the best way to do that is usually not to end up with all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heart-wrenching parts to have. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER OVER ***** Maybe it had a bit more depth than other Bollywood movies I've seen, but not much. I laughed more about the film's stupidity than about the parts that should be funny. I did not shed one single tear or feel it afterwards, but was overwhelmed by a sense of disgust at the attempt of a dramatic ending. I do not recommend this movie if you want to see something good. I recommend it if you want to see a Bollywood movie that is somehow sad.
