This was one of the most boring "horror" movies I've ever seen. A college kid has a nightmare epidemic in Alcatraz, where there are roaming spirits. The film, which seeks to deliver a mix of "Nightmare on Elm Street" and standard vampire fare in the form of a poor 80's music video, is replete with bad drama and an exhaustingly slow story. Although it is such a bad and often ridiculous film (digging the mullets and the dreadful dialogue), it would be a good material to fake a sequel to the Mystery Science Theater 3000's 1987 Silver Scroll Award from the Academy of Sicence Fiction To win fanatics and horror, or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack or that Tony Basil plays a role in the movie. It's a huge disaster, albeit with a small cult sequence (see the other IMDb comments on this movie).
