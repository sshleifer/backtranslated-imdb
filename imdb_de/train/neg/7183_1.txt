This is the worst adaptation of a classic story I've ever seen. They modernize it unnecessarily and some points are actually just sick. <br /> <br /> The songs rarely move in history. They seem to be thrown in by accident. The flying scene with Marley is pointless and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It's not just one of the worst movies I've seen, but it's definitely the worst musical I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's probably only considered a classic because "A Christmas Carol" is a classic story. Just because the original story was a classic does not mean that it's a cheap adaptation.
