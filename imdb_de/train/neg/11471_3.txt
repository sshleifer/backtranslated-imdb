Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws? Orca is not exactly a "Jaws rip-off", but it's obvious he's been trying to capitalize on the success of Jaws. First of all, Orca was a bad movie in my opinion, not terrible, but definitely not good, at best average. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a male killer whale (Orca), having seen his partner and his unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeking revenge. I could not bear to see this movie again. The direction of this film is bad and compared to Jaws, it seems that the director, producers and writers were almost without talent. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, she was very average and believable, but the actual characters are not the least sympathetic. The effects were okay for his time and the killer whale footage looked pretty good. <br /> <br /> The violence is confusing, bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people. The music is exaggerated and very loud, drowns out the sound effects and is sometimes irritating. I hated how they exaggerated the killer whale's intelligence (killer whales do not just match a partner, as shown in Orca). Overall, this movie was in my opinion bad / bad because of the reasons mentioned above. Some people may appreciate this movie more because of the concept of vengeance between animals and humans, so I will not beat this movie and I can understand why some people like it / 10 (but maybe 5/10 for its concept)
