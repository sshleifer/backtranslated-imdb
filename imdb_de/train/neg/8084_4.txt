I picked up this title from a friend who had it in his extensive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so thankfully I did not have to personally pay for it. I had a hunch that this would be a bad movie, but I know what a really bad movie is after playing sizes like Children's not playing dead things and the incredibly strange creatures that have stopped living and mixed Zombies have been and now there's really nothing that baffles me, unless it's amazingly bad. <br /> <br /> Solar crisis is bad, but does not reach the absolute pain in which some films are. Anyway, the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare in the direction of the earth, which will essentially destroy it. To counter this looming threat, humanity has assembled a spaceship and a crew whose mission is to shoot an antimatter bomb (which describes the opening as "the greatest explosive of all time") into the sun, through a twisted sci-fi System causes The logic causes the flare to shoot at a different angle and the earth remains undamaged. <br /> <br /> Never mind that what I've just described sounds like a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with an ensemble ensemble (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis can hardly handle this level of mediocrity, thanks to an action that is easy to start, but which becomes more and more nonsensical over time. <br /> <br The culmination of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villain character (played by Boyle) who insists on sabotaging the mission. With means that are never explained, he sends an evil servant with an embarrassingly bad haircut to exercise a vague electronic mind control over the genetically-engineered space crew scientist played by female boss Annabel Schofield. Why is he sabotaging the mission? For, according to his feeble-minded stance, he believes that the torch will not happen, and if it does not, he'll be fabulously rich for digging his evil claws into the stock market. In fact, you have a villain with the absurdly dumbest motivation you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is astoundingly devoured and develops very slowly, with the passage of time using characters that have only vague or useless short roles in the storyline. I could sit here and explain in detail what exactly happens to demonstrate the scriptwriter 's sheer inability to do an act that actually clicks or attracts your attention, but I sit here writing this review on Microsoft Word, and I know that this is the case would take three pages, and I would only lose your interest. On the other hand, you probably have the same effect when you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> At any rate, the film is miserable with a very poor dialogue. Imagine if everything had happened on Star Trek Enterprise that the characters spat out each other with sci-fi jargon. Yes, I know, they already do, but imagine if this is ALL, do it and use that jargon to create vague and almost nonsensical scenes that do not cause any excitement, excitement, or interest in the Cause viewers. <Br /> <br /> This is best illustrated at the point where a character in a zero-G environment re-bolts a bolt to a metal box before crunching for a few minutes in pain before suddenly exploding. The script previously refers to the character who risks an explosion, but gives no firm answer to why or how this happens and why he can not really escape. Overall, you have a sad cross between the bizarre and the ridiculous. Then we have several scenes in which a dramatic structure leads to nothing. Jack Palance's performance is wasted on a character who only serves to drive (not ask) the boy's heroes across the desert before being shaken and killed by a series of suits. On his deathbed, Palance finally tells his offspring his surname (while wearing a horrible, injured makeup job that seems like someone is putting a balloon under his eyeball) that he had previously kept silent about. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy repeats it calmly after it has expired, giving the viewers the impression that the name is of importance later in the film. Perhaps Charlton Heston's gruesome admiral figure knows him, and the conspiracy will advance if his name is repeated. Something. Everything. <br /> <br /> No. We are sorry. Any hope that you have will be dashed if this moment turns out to be just one of many pathetic, failed attempts to create drama for a character so shallow and freakish that it will always be a stain on Palance's career Just like the rest of the cast is similarly damaged. <br /> <br /> The conclusion of the film is a painfully abrupt end. Schofield steers the bomb into the center of the sun to save her actions while standing under the villain of evil, a climax. This is yet another of the movie's most notable visual effect sequences, which even make for the visibly elaborate care still looking as chinty as it really is. The saddest thing about this film is the obviously large budget, which was tragically wasted behind a stinker of a script and a supporting role behind Boyle, Heston and Palance, who manage to nag the coffin with sheer hyperfunction. </ Br> /> class: D
