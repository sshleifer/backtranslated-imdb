There is only one thing that is essential for a thorough recognition of The Indian Runner. Take off your pants. Peek in. Is there evidence for a Y chromosome? Okay, you do. <br /> <br /> This film has all male requirements: blood, guns, car chases, loving women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, alcohol, violence, pyrotechnics - what have I left out? - Oh, yes, torches. <br /> <br /> As a woman, I sincerely hope that Sean Penn sees this as a kind of "childhood". Since he has both written and directed the matter, he is almost entirely responsible. An unequal cast (as usual, Viggo Mortensen shows how the job is to be done) tries to save Penn. Too late. The lines and actions are there. Even devoted, experienced acting can not change this. <br /> <br /> I found this movie puerile and stupid as well as predictable. The dialogue staggers - Sandy Dennis has my respect for the attempt to breathe life into a maternal maternal monologue without maternal authenticity. Then she dies. After a while, this is also the father of the protagonists, played by Charles Bronson. Her absence is barely noticeable. <br /> <br /> At certain intervals, the pyrotechnics mentioned above, etc. seem to liven things up and scare the public into something substantial. <br /> <br /> If you are male and under 25 you can love this movie. Plan the return at 35. Do you think you will still like it? <br /> <br /> I do not think so.
