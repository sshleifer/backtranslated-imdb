The original "les visiteurs" were original, funny, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 must be a candidate for "the worst first sequel to a really good movie". In LV2 everyone screams again and again, if a gag does not work out first, it is repeated five more times. LV2 is a terrible parody of LV1, except, of course, that a parody should be inventive. If you loved LV1, you just will not see this movie, just watch LV1 again !!
