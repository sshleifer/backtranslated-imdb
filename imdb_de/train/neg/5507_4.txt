This was another big screening appearance for a 1960s US television show. It's amusing enough, but it was very much to be formulated. Intelligent Martian lands on the earth and from his point of view meets the not too bright people. <br /> <br /> The usual craze arises with the human Bridges, who eventually connects with him and helps him to get home. On the way there he also gets the girl Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a nice trip for some nice Hollywood stars that I have not seen for a while. Pleasant enough to pass some free time if you can not see anything better.
