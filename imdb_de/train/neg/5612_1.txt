As a spiritualist and non-christian. I thought I was really sticking to my belief, but what a lot I look. I thought the movie had great arguments, but it only got one-sided views from atheists and Jews. And who are all those street people he interviews and who do not know their arm from their heads. Where are the right theologians and priests and stuff from which he could have arguments? I am not retired and in 1970 I wrote books and finished my studies. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or believe me or not because an anti-Christ told me so. Please remember that he has come to the conclusion that he does not find God because his ego and his demons have defeated him. I'm not going to say that the movie was breathtaking to help atheists read that they feel better. But if you really want to show the world that you are interested in us, poor souls who believe in Jesus, then lure us with your value, not the drumming.
