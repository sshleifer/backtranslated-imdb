The fact that most of the budget was probably on the list of high-performance founders could not have mattered if it had been staged with instinct and imagination and some sympathy for the satirical intent of the original. Instead, we get incredibly bad song and dance sequences with quaint beggars and whores, and the final estrangement is achieved by retreating to show that the action took place on a music hall stage, appropriate for a production that's more like Lionel 'Oliver' Blair as Brecht. The acting talent is shamefully abused: Migenes and Walters are good, but do not have to work hard: Migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the material. Julia looks perfect as a Mack, but struggles with the character, which is covered with a false, fake accent. Harris' Peachum is embarrassed and Polly is cruel. The adaptations of text, script and music are often uncomfortable: it was a bad step to orient the film on Marc Blitzstein's Bowdler-Broadway version, but at least his words were understandable, unlike most interpolated in gestures of fidelity were. And an attempt to overcome the low budget by filming with claustrophobic angles on misty veiled sets lit in garish blue and orange, as if Vittorio Storaro was failing by a bargain basement - the film just looks cheap, subdued and unthinking , shameful
