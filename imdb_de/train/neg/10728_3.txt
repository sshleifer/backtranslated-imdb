The worst movie I have seen in a long time. Interesting first half with engaging, concise dialogue between dubious characters in a late-night bar. The film degenerates into an informal sequence of scenes that aim for a visual shock (read disgust), without redemptive observations or lessons in humanity or anything else that showing and my politeness prevented me from disrespecting him. Still, time is precious (as the director himself noted in his intro) and I am very annoyed with the time I wasted on the film for the second half of this game, especially the female lead role.
