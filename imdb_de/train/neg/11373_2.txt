It is not obvious to look at this film (so I recommend viewers to examine the people who explain their case), but this presentation about the realities of Islam and the promotion of violence and intolerance against all non-Muslims lacks objectivity and completely disregarded in the human condition. It is one thing to document that the Koran says many things about how a devout Muslim is required to interact with non-Muslims, but any realist can realize that not every person who feels that he or she is a follower of Islam, does so You will agree with and adhere to all principles of this belief and system. There is a reason to question a lot about the moderators so that the audience has to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism. Do not swallow everything, hooks, twine and sinker without you having to think about it yourself. <br /> <br /> A certain person, for example, examines the person Walid Shoebat. who claims to be a former Muslim who has committed an act of terrorism in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who do not believe any of these claims. I have never been Muslim. I have never read the Koran. I am not a Christian or a member of any faith. But I am an intelligent and demanding person. While the film is quite disturbing, it shows in a presentation how some Muslims see their commitment to Islam; I remind you that Islam has more than the views of the fundamentalists. Just as fundamentalists and evangelical Christians are, there are differences in the intensity of faith and duty between Jews and Muslims. If you are watching this movie, you must have the salt shaker in front of you. A cereal is not enough, you need more. Please use your own mind and think for yourself, research what is presented and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam fits into it, based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video. Among those who put together this film, there is a common political link that points to a clear bias. Be your own brain.
