This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! There were people leaving the theater, others were falling asleep (ok, it was a late night show) ... This is a no-sense movie. I would really like to watch the making-off of this film because I am deeply interested in what the authors of this garbage put into their heads. Do they laugh when they create all these ridiculous things, or do they really think they are doing something interesting? I wonder ... The soundtrack is awful, except for some instrumental stuff reminiscent of an earlier Bj√∂rk album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay home. It is the best thing to do. The small, tiny pieces of beautiful music are no reason for you to undergo this torture. God!...
