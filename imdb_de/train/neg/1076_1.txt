This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Branaugh seemed to remember the accent so much that he could not keep his lines. The plot was definitely not worthy of John Grisham's name. No wonder it was never published as a book or published in cinemas. I did not even look at it. I decided that I did not care who did it.
