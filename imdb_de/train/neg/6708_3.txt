Turn your back or you will come back in MY FRIENDS! Only a happy ending can make your innocence blossom, which is full of darkness and destruction the moment you see it. It is safe to say that the whole film is falling apart, with a sarcastic approach and a tribute to zombie shows that deny any nonsense. Now and then we get a name like "Johnny", and this "Johnny" can not go anywhere. There is no specific reason why our "dead corpse" crawls out of his grave to survive only to prom, making the movie completely useless. Without a sense of sadness, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he is dead. Johnny takes an arm from Eddie's arm. The viewer is asked a difficult question: Why does the movie have to be this cornball? There is an answer. Any resemblance to any living or dead person is purely coincidental. "Life" is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing to do with the movie. Show it to your girlfriend and she will skip the prom and turn your life into an abandoned ruin. Blah !!!
