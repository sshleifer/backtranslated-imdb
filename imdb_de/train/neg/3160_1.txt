You know you have trouble watching a comedy when the only amusing parts come from the Animal Cast. It is a pity that the parrot, Cat & Dog, was only in support and not the other way round, as the people in it were pretty miserable. <br /> <br /> If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what a name that is), Jason & Lindsay, I would forget that theatrical lark and do something else, as they are all as weird as drying of color and terrible actors. <br /> <br /> The main gag in the movie is one of the characters that scream, I'm not gay, which is funny, as if you were not. You could change your mind if you have to endure the three bossy, fatigue and tiredness I say very simple women lead the film. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen in years and hopefully never see such a bad one again, though I do not expect it.
