I've always liked Spike Lee's movies, but this was a waste of 2 1/2 hours. I had expected more from Son of Sam and got instead a film that had very little to do with the 1977 series murders. The talking dog was ridiculous (you know you're in trouble when all movie guests broke out inappropriate laughter). The whole movie seemed very disconnected and not very interesting. The sex scenes were completely irrelevant to the plot. I'm not against sex in movies, but it should have a point (unless it's a XXX movie). All in all, we were very disappointed with this spike lee insert !!
