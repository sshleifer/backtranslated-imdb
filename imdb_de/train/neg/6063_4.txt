"Masters of Horror" has proven to be a "poor venue" for "Message Episodes", and while Joe Dante's "Screwfly Solution" (one of the series' best episodes, period) can make a definite case, most efforts are for that to do boring and inconspicuous acts (nothing discovers horror more than a soap box). And "pro-life" simply combines reactionary perspectives with ultra-violence. The young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs) running through the forest is nearly hit by two doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who happen to drive to the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's dad, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a rock-cold, right-wing, sacred roller who does everything possible to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. When it comes to nothing else, "Pro-Life" has accumulated some buzz about its controversial topic, but John Carpenter treats this company with amazing indifference - he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself ( admittedly bad); The slow tempo does not build tension and just makes the already slumbering plot crawl. Even if Dwayne and his sons storm the clinic, the guns are blazing, this is an impressive event. Later, when a doctor is tortured with a "male abortion," the scene appears unnecessary and unnecessary - an attempt to sort out the signed film. The poor performances (unfortunately, this is where Perlman gets wasted) become an excrescence of the script, and Carpenter's direction feels exhausted, as if "Pro-Life" is the source of his next warm meal. When a spider creature with a human head and a man wearing a latex monster suit roams the hallways, all you have to do is ask yourself what the brains behind this mess think ...
