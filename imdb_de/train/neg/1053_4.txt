Bizarre picture of the Cinderella story. Terribly bad script, but Kathleen Turner offers a pretty decent evil stepmother performance. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning in some areas, but that's about it. The costumes of the period range from the Elizabethan period to the 1990s. Fast forward until you see something interesting and save the 90 minutes of the drop. <br /> <br /> If you are really in the mood for a Cinderella story, I recommend "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "The Glass Slipper".
