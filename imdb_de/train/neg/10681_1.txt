How unhappy to have so many of my "a" lists, and good "b" list actors agree to make that movie, but they did, and that's what got me looking at him , I had never heard of this movie, but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. right on the DVD cover and James Woods in the background, how bad can it be? In a word, very! This movie starts o.k. has some twists and turns, then just puts an egg. The end was so weak, it was as if the writer was being called, and his 4-year-old son sat down at the typewriter and chopped the end out. How ironic for a movie called "The End Game" to have such a poor movie. These are the types of movies that allow "a" list actors to quickly move to the "b" list. I hope Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods do not make that a habit.
