I have absolutely no knowledge of the author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels. If TOM'S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of her work, I would probably have had little interest in her books as a child. When I was a kid, I was not really into literature, unless there were soldiers fighting high-ranked monsters, middle-class kids, as the story revolved around protagonist Tom Long, who lives in London pulls a house without a garden and suddenly finds a metaphysical house. Having a garden of its own was undoubtedly something working class workers did not have in the fifties. I assume that somewhere there exists a political class text. There is also a romance involving a young girl named Hattie. But again are cynical children amused by love stories? Perhaps the worst criticism is that there is very little excitement or adventure in the story. <br /> <br /> This is a children's movie that seems dated from the source. It's harmless, but I'm surprised by the high rating of IMDB voters. I wonder how many of them would have gotten so many good grades when they were ten and just saw the trilogy LORD OF THE RINGS.
