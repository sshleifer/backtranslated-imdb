Disney? What happened? I really wish the movie was shot in the 60s, like the book. And I could really have spent some cheap special effects to save the budget for a more accurate customization .... I'm glad maybe somebody reading the books might be influenced ... Redheaded man as IT interchangeable? And what's up with the volcanic eruption? Where was THAT in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! Long ago (1978) I heard that there was a European version of this movie. I really wish I could identify it. I can only imagine that it is closer to the real story than this bad adaptation. This movie has to be X.
