I've seen Dolemite and also (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two more outstanding works of the blaxploitation canon from our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this film, The Human Tornado (also known as Dolemite 2), will always occupy a special place in my heart. The Human Tornado can not be topped due to the weird stupidity, the lack of film production skills and the absolute enthusiasm (a little too much, frankly). <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old buddy Dolemite copes with a white woman when some racist policemen raid the house for no good reason and you would not know it! The woman in bed with Ol Dole is none other than the sheriff's wife. Her scream when she sees him: "He forced me!" Dolemite's shout: "& $ * @ $ are you really ???" Subtlety was never his strength. <br /> <br /> Highlights? The cameo of a very young Ernie Hudson (of Ghostbusters fame), the continuity flaws (characters looking in one direction and one in the other direction, Dolemite's suit changes color each time his nightclub acts) and Queen Bee's demonic eyes in her first scene. <br /> <br /> But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore. Did the man really think he looked cool in this movie? I do not know why, but you must admire the pure enthusiasm that he has. Whether it jumps off a cliff completely naked or rhymes orders to its gang (eg: Fast! Into the cave!) I have a plan to have that mother dig $ * @ (% & his own grave) the man is committing he overboard, never again as fast as at any time he does kung fu, the fight is filmed at high speed, but occasionally Rudy slows and clenched his teeth as if they were speeding up the movie as an effect or if they did In fact, "The Matrix" is not Human tornado, like the original Dolemite, is an incompetent movie of enormous proportions, but at least it's fun, and certainly you have to To owe these people the trouble, but not so much. Enjoy my heartfelt recommendations.
