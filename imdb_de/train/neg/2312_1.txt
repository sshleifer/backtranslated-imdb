This is one of those movies in which I wish I had just stayed in the bar. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty boring. What story there is is very weak and you have to guess it. The film spoils itself with sophisticated camera techniques that trigger migraines and make it look like a student film. Did I say that it is already boring? If all the characters had died suddenly at the end of the movie, I would not have cared less about it because I had no emotional attachment to them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but that's about it. For the first time I thought about going out of a movie during a performance, but I firmly believed that it was better had to become. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> With this type of movie, you could threaten naughty children.
