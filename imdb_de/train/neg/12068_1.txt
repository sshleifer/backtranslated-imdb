A family of terrible people has to stay in a house for a week, otherwise they lose their inheritance, which goes to the servants, who only get their inheritance if they agree to keep the house in order. People are dying (and you'll do it if you're trying to get through it) If you ever wanted to see bad actors - many with badly set teeth - or try a bad horror movie, this is your chance. That's just awful. It's so bad that I thought Al Adamson, one of the worst directors of all time, was directing, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I do not want to say anything about it, not because it's not polite, but because I can start, I can not stop. Avoid <br /> <br />
