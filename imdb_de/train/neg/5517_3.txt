I only rate this movie with 3 out of pity because it's worth it. I love to praise a great movie and am not focused on "male" movies. Legal blond was an excellent movie. The Georgia Rule, on the other hand, was a poorly organized, poorly organized, unrealistic example of filmmaking. At the end of the movie I did not care who lied or if something was solved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in a movie is a good STORY. This story is weak and never evolves (just because the topic is deep does not mean that the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is a character who undergoes a significant change of character and is prepared for this change throughout the movie. In the Georgia Rule, the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Second, there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Creating a really good dynamic character is hard work and takes time (you only have a few hours in a movie). This means that too many tried dynamic characters pay too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the badly written story and the trash of weak dynamic characters, I can not say I liked anyone. Every character was a mess. That's fine if you write American Beauty, but not if you're trying a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a terrible mother, her daughter was a terrible mother and a daughter, and Lohan was a terrible excuse for a human being (no, I will not let her down because she was molested, everyone happens to crap and we're all for it responsible for our own actions). The Mormon kid "Dudley Do Right" should have had the guts not to interfere with his religion and his obligations ... and Simon, I'm seriously, which guy occasionally lets a 17-year-old girl who was molested pass by (it unless it is he.) an actor or a politician). This movie is worth it if you want to remember what good filming is NOT!
