This show is awful, the jokes are all terrible and getting worse. I'm one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas, but I liked it at least first, until it broke down in season two. All the jokes had been played through and the characters had nothing planned. At least Corner Gas was good at first. The Little Mosque in the prairie is usually a horrible, boring CBC comedy that had nothing to offer in Episode 1. Or maybe just people who actually live off the prairies? Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? I do not know any person who likes this show and she does not like herself. The jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it will not be long now, because the whole success of this show seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being Muslim, which is different and could have led to a great show.
