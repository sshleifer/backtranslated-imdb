I did not know anything about the movie or that it was based on a bestseller. I've guessed from the opening scenes what this would be about, best guess, a treasure, and a death list. That lasted about 15 minutes when I got the movie sneaky suspicion that the movie was crap. I will not bore you, how bad the plot and acting were, but anyone who gave more than two stars, must work for the filmmakers The hospital. He was wearing a suit, shirt and tie in jeans and a shirt in the hospital. Could not even get the continuity right. I got the Christian theme, hard to miss.
