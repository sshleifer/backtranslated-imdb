Sadly, Marry Harron decided to make a fictional account of Bettie Page to accompany her own problems with men. As is typical in all their works, every male main character is portrayed as weak, awkward, or twisted. To add her fiction, she projects ideas and problems that, according to Bettie Page, are not true. Bettie did not leave the business because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious problems (although later in life she was reborn through the influence of her third husband, a minister). She left because she was in her late thirties, her acting career had gone nowhere, and she felt she was losing her looks. The hints of harassment and rape are invalidated in Bettie's own words, and are the director's attempt to claim that every woman who did what Bettie did had been killed by men. He does not suggest that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all of her instincts (which were not given to her by "sick" fetishists). Harron also makes no indication that Bunny Yeager, who has done many of Bettie's famous photo shoots, has also done many "cheeky" shoots with Bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer in the film. The only salvation is that Gretchen Mol was very similar to Bettie sees. Otherwise, there are other films and documentaries that are more accurate and honest about their lives and the people in them.
