This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am 64 years old and a football fan. I expected to watch a football movie. After about ten minutes, I began to wonder how such a bad movie (especially acting) could have got into a theater. Halfway, I whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained the facts behind the movie. Although I was slightly offended (and can see how some might be VERY offended if they were not Christian) when I was preached in a movie theater, that was not such a big deal. However, it was a great deal to be exposed to such predictability and unrealistic behavior, and above all to the quality of action. It is a suitable film for a church outing, but it is shown in an auditorium of the church and not in a theater. Do I go to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I go to a movie? Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely not!!!
