This was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but that's about as much as you can say. It starts with a good atmosphere; The hospital is accordingly sterile and alienating, the mood is "scary". And then ... nothing. Well, that's it. Only things that are clearly inappropriate ... and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and yet particularly intimidating creatures and the hospital they have taken over. I mean, come on, biker types? Some bands saw a bit too much Gwar. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite was the head demon, who looks pretty much like a middle-aged trucker desperately trying to threaten, while at the same time looking like he'd like to sink onto an Afghan couch, loosen his belt, open a can of cheap beer (probably a slot) and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen far scarier truckers. At truck stops. Drink coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Creepy !! <br /> <br /> The other monsters are even more cartoonish and even less scary. At least on the DVD, the videos give an explanation for their presence in the hospital ... They seem to have surfaced randomly in places, play some bippy "Metal" and make people a bit dead. Apart from a few good special effects and a drama that is not terrible given the lack of decent writing, there's nothing here. It's just a background noise movie.
