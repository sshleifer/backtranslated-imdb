I can not believe that I wasted five hours of my life with this garbage. The previous five-day offer of this author was very pleasing and I was looking forward to it very much. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Surprise Jones was the main culprit, either mumbling or babbling her lines, but the rest of the cast followed her example. Special exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old Stager, whose idiom was exemplary. Do not producers listen to productions before they air to make sure the dialogue is audible? As a result, I lost track of what was going on, and as the original plot line seemed to become a standard between us and the users between the Muslims, I soon lost interest. The end was an absolute anti-climax. A complete guy.
