I find it hard to understand why this piece of trash was completely repackaged. The only saving grace as a whole is the body of Ariauna in her sexy uniform. Your humor is also appreciated. It's definitely a plus, but unfortunately a magician would save that garbage. However, it must be positively recognized for its heroic endeavors and true professionalism. I can not say the same for Lilith with her whining voice, which is in your nervous system. She seemed disinterested and gave the impression that only her presence on the set was all that was needed. Aside from Ariauna's appearance, it's absolutely rubbish.
