I was very disappointed in this 1970's movie based on a Bernard Malamud story. This is essentially a story of possible salvation, racial bias and non-fulfillment of life due to mistrust. A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) only believes in the angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris basically gave up his life and just does not want to believe that Belafonte is an angel. If he believes in it, Fanny improves, but in the end he has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly. It would have been nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny talks to Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, who successfully named Miss Kaminska as director in her Oscar, named this film a brilliant 1966 performance "The Shop on Main Street." Kaminska is reduced to mostly bed scenes in the movie, and her friendliness in Her speech does not really convey the desperate situation she faces, she keeps calling for Ruthie, her daughter, who disobeys them by marrying out of the Jewish religion, and for the majority of the film she does not realize that the angel appears in her apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is confused and the scene in which the friend of Angel Belafonte confronts in her apartment is memorable, but all in all too short /> <br /> We do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. <br /> <br /> If you look at this movie, the theater must have left despair in depression.
