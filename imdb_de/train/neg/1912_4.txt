There is nothing new here. All the usual romantic comedy scenes to the taxi that rushes to the airport to keep the woman from flying away. The only thing that saves this is the acting of Alison Eastwood and some of the minor characters (wink and you will miss Gabrielle Anwar), who obviously had a bit of fun in bliss, and you do not have to go through the inevitable plot pain.
