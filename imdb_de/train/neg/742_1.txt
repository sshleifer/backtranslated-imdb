If this movie had a budget of 20 million, I'd like to know where the money goes. A monkey could get better CGI effects than wasted for that terrible piece of garbage for 3 hours, though I have to admit that the machines and Martians looked really cool on an original Playstation 1 game and early PC games from the mid-90s, when ever a game was made. What amazes me, where has the money gone? Pendragon films could have made a great movie with good old-fashioned models and computer-controlled cameras like George Lucas around 1975-83, and actors who actually look like they're taking care of what they're doing (or ruining in this case), about the same 20 million. This is probably the worst movie ever made! I'd rather sit for a 24-hour replay of Ishtar than watch this movie again. I totally hated it! I regress I say that this is the BAD movie that was ALWAYS made, because unlike in other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes or Santa Claus the Martians are conquered. These are films that are so bad that they have a special place in their hearts for them. There is no love for this movie and no room in my DVD library for it. I sold it to a man for a dollar. I bet the money for the movie was spent on alcohol and other vices for the cast and crew. Shame on your Pendragon movies! I want my money back!
