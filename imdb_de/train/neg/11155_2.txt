The only reason I ever looked at it was because I found it in my local library (and mercilessly berating it for wasting public money on it), and despite the abundance of tits and ass, it did not need it long to recognize that fast forward was my friend. Horrible directing, pedestrian cameraways, sporadically bad to almost passable drama, chintzy effects, and one of the worst screenplays I've ever seen, was the resentment of having a movie look alive for a long, long time. The best laugh is actually from the "making of ..." feature, where the poor involved in this HDV mess are trying to justify their lame efforts as if they were working on something special instead of something, that can not be absolutely forgotten next week. Waiting! Aside from the fact that somebody tempted Tippi "The Birds" Hedren, somehow, along with Kane "Friday the 13th" Hodder! I will never know how it came to be, and to be honest, I do not care. Beware at your own risk and do not say that you have not been warned. This is filmmaking in its demanding, anxious situation. It only gets a 2 of me for some good-looking naked women, and even then just.
