I bought this movie on DVD so I could get a sequel of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Luckily, Mike, Crow and Tom Servo are on show because the movie itself is not. Although there is an action, a story to follow, and a few actors who can act, there is nothing else. The movie was so boring, I firmly confirmed that I will never see it again without Tom, Crow and Mike. However, as summarized above, it was better than the movie shown in the MST3K episode.
