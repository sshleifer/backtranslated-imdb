I have to finish a movie as soon as I start, no matter how bad it is. This film was painful to sit through. The "sparkling" bullets, the reporter with "ninja" -like moves, the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets, and only hit innocent onlookers, the predictable outcome, and the whole bad drama were just awful , Like the girl who finds the reporter in the apartment of his friends and from "What the hell are you doing here (holding a bat)" to "Hey, you're cute, you want @ # $%! ???" in about 1.2 seconds .... just bad ... Save an hour and forty minutes and play with your children (or your dog)!
