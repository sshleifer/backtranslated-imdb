It was great to see some of my favorite stars from 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked wonderful. But that was it. They had no characters or good lines to work with. I did not understand or care what the characters do. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller female roles were good, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were very knowledgeable and confident in their little buddy parts. They showed talent and it is sad that they do not play in more and better films. Unfortunately, I had not thought that Dorothy Stratten had a chance to participate in this only important film role. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have some fans, and I was very open when I looked at it. I'm a big fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I enjoyed his latest movie "Cat's Meow" and all his early films from "Targets" to "Nickleodeon". I was really surprised that I could barely stay awake watching this one. <br /> <br /> It's ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where detectives and clients are romantically involved. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd, had a hit television series called Moonlighting that stole Bogdanovich's story idea. Of course, a big difference was that the series relied on tons of funny dialogues while trying to get along with slapstick and a few screwball lines. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's not "Paper Moon" and just a very pale version of "What's Up, Doc".
