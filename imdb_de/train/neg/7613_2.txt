The small Californian city of Diablo is plagued by mysterious deaths after Sheriff Robert Lopez digs out an ancient box. According to legend, the box is said to contain the 16th century Mexican demon named Azar. The sheriff's daughters, Dominique and Mary, are fighting with the evil and bloodthirsty demon. "The Legend of Diablo" is an absolute garbage. The film lacks fear and nerves, acting is amateurish and the direction is poor. The animation is the only aspect I'm a big fan of indie horror movie. For example, I loved "Torched," "Live Feed," "Bone Sickness," or "Neighborhood Watch." Unfortunately, "The Legend of Diablo" is a smash hit. Definitely avoid.
