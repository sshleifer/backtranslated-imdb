The animation looks like it's done in 30 seconds and looks more like cartoons than characters. I have been a fan of Scooby Doo since the premiere of the 1969 series. I did not think much of the Scooby Doo animation films (I'm talking about the TV series, not the full-length movies.) But some of them were pretty cool, and I like that most people found Scrappy Doo irritating, but this series is garbage. As soon as I saw the animation and heard the characters speak (and I use that term loosely), I flinched. Also, Mystery Inc. was a team, and without the entire crew congratulating each other, it seems like opening a box of chocolates to find out that someone has already eaten the best. What's new Scooby Doo was better than that. If you want to have a Scooby Doo TV series, add the elements that make the series last so long. The entire cast of characters and high-quality animations. You have to put this one again under the rocks, from where it came.
