Well, I can put an end to the question once and for all: "What's the worst movie ever made ... ever?" It's Flight of Fury with Steven Seagal. Sure, there are many famous bad movies, but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a Romanian movie that shows how far Romania has to go to catch Bollywood. It also speaks to how completely and witless Steven Seagal has become. This movie is so bad that you literally feel hurt after seeing it and you have to squat and cry in the corner of the shower, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. <br /> <br /> It was only released on video (I can not imagine why) and I suspect that the workers who had to do the DVD had to wear protective clothing and be advised on a regular basis.
