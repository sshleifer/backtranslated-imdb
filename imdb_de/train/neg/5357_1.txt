I do not know where to start. This movie feels like one of those cheap Saturday morning kids shows that they made in the late eighties in the early nineties. Like Captain Power or the Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy-sounding "secret agencies" and rogues. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that it is not even funny. The direction is terrible and there is little continuity so far. It seems like someone has just thrown together a few scenes and forgotten that there should be a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early, when several villains plant a blasting device in an agent car. For some reason, although the device is clearly called "remote-controlled," the bad guys decide to track them on their motorcycles as they drive away. This hunt continues. all the time with the bad guys doing ridiculous and completely pointless bike stunts. Stand on the wheels, do wheelies and so on. At one point there is a crash and one of the attackers is thrown off his bike. We see that the bike (clearly CGI) is thrown over the agent car, but the driver has disappeared. Then, a few seconds later, the driver and the bike return ... apparently unharmed by the crash. Although the car contains an explosive device, the attackers bombard the agent as they drive past him, then blow up their car. Which was also done clearly with CGI. Sounds confusing? It is, and so is the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to point out that I'm not talking about Lord Of The Rings type CGI when I say CGI. We're talking about the cheap, cheesy Power Rangers of the type CGI. I think it would have been better for Power Rangers. Why Savini and Todd made this movie, I'll never know, I can only guess that they are doing it for money to do someone a favor or because they were blackmailed into it ... probably the last one.
