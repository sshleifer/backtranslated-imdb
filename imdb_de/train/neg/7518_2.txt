Horror movies can be a lot of fun on a low budget, bad actors and some panache. I think the movie just lacks panic, because in one dull boring scene after another, people are making ridiculously harmless claw hands in the air. If it were not so boring, it could be funny. <br /> <br /> A horror film can go a long way with a tired concept like "college kids in a haunted house", much like the evil Dead Movies had a lot of fun with a similar standard plot. Unfortunately, Hallow's End does not go far. Actually, there is nowhere to go. It spends most of an hour building up faceless and anonymous characters with a seemingly endless interpersonal drama. I have nothing against character development, not even in a horror movie, but these are strictly one-dimensional characters (the Alpha Man, the Milquetoast, the ... um ... disposable characters that exist mainly for sex scenes.) Issues Over forty bloodless, booming minutes with them were more terrible than at the beginning of the bloodshed. <br /> <br /> Well, bloodshed implied anyway. When the college kids turn into the transformed house they put on for their haunted house (one is a vampire, someone wears OR scrubs and some white pancakes), they look pretty much the same as they did in their amateur haunted house Costumes did; The Dead Hate The Living is a masterpiece in comparison with a similar theme. There is not really a horror to talk about, and there is no real fear. <br /> <br /> I've been thinking about it from almost every approach. If it was a tight, exciting horror film (which would explain why things were moving so slowly), the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would devalue him. If it was a real horror film of blood and offal (which would explain the blow) ... where is the blood and the guts? And the anticlimax is one of the most exciting endings of a movie I've ever seen. It's a kind of movie that, though it has no narrator through the movie, is bowed down by voice-overs because the pointless dialogue just was not enough. <br /> <br /> This was a difficult movie I'm glad I just sat through a Christian horror movie. Maybe the "I know that there is hell" opening was not meant that way, but there are a few pointers (or a wrong direction - I'm not sure which one). Despite all the profanity of the film, a line like "gosh-darnit" is a bit absurd, and most crucifix worship, God-fearing and satanic fear, especially after some awesome T & A sex scenes (a heterosexual person), a lesbian). <br /> <br /> If it's a Christian company (the Highland Myst logo even resembles a crucifix), then this film is hard for the atheist camp. An almighty being can not be so bad a filmmaker. <br /> <br />
