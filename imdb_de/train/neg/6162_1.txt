"Smokey And The Bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but then nobody wanted it. It was a slapstick, but he had a brain. It had a very smart script with definable characters and a funny summary. The people came smiling from the theater. "Hooper" offers none of this. There is no reason to smile. If it pays tribute to the Hollywood stuntman, it looks lazy because it offers poorly choreographed combat scenes and one of the most compelling Autosch jumps I've ever seen. It all looks spotty, almost deliberately filmed badly. Poor Sally Field (like the girlfriend wringing her hands on the sidelines) gets her weakest role, without a single funny or smart line ("If you make that jump, I'm not here when you come back"). Burt Reynolds looks further into the camera and winks, but the joke is for any audience sitting by "Hooper". * from ****
