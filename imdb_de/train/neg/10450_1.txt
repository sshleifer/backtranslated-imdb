This movie was the worst movie I've seen since "Date Movie". I laughed the whole movie instead of being scared. It was funny how the snakes search for specific body parts of the passengers, for example to attack the eye, the tongue, the buttocks, the chest. If we have seen a national geographic channel, we know that snakes are not clamped to the body when they bite. At each scene, the snakes would bite the passengers and stay on the body biting the person. I think the producer did not study his information about snakes and their behavior. I can not believe I wasted my money on this movie. That's why I can not recommend this movie.
