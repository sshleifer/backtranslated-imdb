I'm always frustrated with movies that are obviously written by one gender. Especially when they obviously do not research enough to find out when something not only does not ring true, but also obviously rings false. <br /> <br /> The scene I remember is the one in the bathroom where Jack tells his soccer team-mates that he got Diane pregnant. In no way, in shape or form, would a man ever cheer on another man who would make a girl pregnant in high school. You may cheer if the guy with the hot cheerleader has sex, but I can also guarantee that the first thing the football team heard about it would not be a urinal. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that this movie is not working. I'm so serious, and it was not terribly bad, but come on!
