ANOTHER movie about a group of less intelligent individuals on a road trip leaving their original itinerary for either a shortcut or, in this case, a visit to a rundown show attraction. As expected, the results are not good at all, as some insane inmates who fled prison inmates years ago live on this special show. The father, who seems to be a professional photographer, just MUST stop and take pictures of the place, only to find that it is still inhabited. The various family members set off to see the various attractions just to fear them. Believing that they made it on their way, the car's tire explodes (surprise!) And makes them take refuge in the small town and shelters that we know are only inhabited by freaks (surprise! ). <br /> <This movie is as expected, with the family pursued and killed by the freaks. There are some objections to the family section, but these are probably the worst scenes in the movie because they are poorly executed. There is nothing remotely original, unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack, which is played in certain scenes and completely ruins the atmosphere and mood of the movie. Acting is about as bad as I've seen it for some time by all involved (it's pretty bad if your cast is outnumbered by the cast of "Camp Blood.") The special effects are lousy and the end has me arranges punch my tv. <br /> <br /> Despite all the negative, this movie was a bit fun for me. He definitely has a "bad, good" mood. I've done it all through the movie, and even as I passed the ridiculously cliched conspiracy, terrible acting, and kitschy special effects, I even talked pleasantly, though in the end I felt crazy and angry, especially because of the Movie is not so great at the beginning and the end makes the whole movie pointless. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I can list countless movies that you saw when you saw them. The difference is that most of these movies are better. Although this is not a complete waste, this movie is pretty bad not scary remotely. <br /> <br /> My grade: D
