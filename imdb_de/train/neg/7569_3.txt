It definitely fits into the period when the Axis & Allies played spy games all over North Africa and around the world. It's not the best movie, but certainly not the worst of the budget movies, as previously described by the Compilation War Classics. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was actually very good in one of his first feature films. I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Parke (called Parkyarkarkus). Why he never got bigger roles is a mystery to me. He played the perfect partner role and saved the movie ... imho. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie was part of a Superbox-Mart budget package titled War Classics. Eight eight-dollar films, which included other films that had never been heard, and some of which have decent stars trying to pay the bills. <br /> <br /> This script is ... well, not so hot. The cut & cinematography is ... worse. If you can handle all this and want to see the future Cisco kid and a great buddy who has never fulfilled his true potential, pick it up in any case! Otherwise there are other films from World War II. <br /> <br /> Thunderossa.
