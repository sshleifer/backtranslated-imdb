I tried twice to watch this movie, and both times I still could not get it to the credits. For the first time, I got through the first fight sequence and then lost interest. The second time, I managed to force myself to digest spoiled trading, lame SFX and extremely bad direction for over an hour. Pales compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Has anyone ever heard of the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco? For those who do not let me in. It's 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest box office hits of all time ... Atari decides to release a movie-binding game on the 2600 home console system. To end a long and financially painful story, the game ended very quickly and thousands and thousands of Atari 2600 ET games were dumped in landfills because they could not even betray or even sell them. What has Universal Soldier: The Return? to do with this story? Take a look at Rating 3.2 and find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie ... IMDb forced me to award a 1 in 10 because their rating systems are not as low as 0, not to mention the negatives.
