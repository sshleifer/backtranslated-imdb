I'm rarely moved to comment online on a movie online. But I can not understand how that was done. Who did it? How could you possibly have thought you could make a movie? Did you take a weekend course at a film school, get a nice big check from Daddy and kidnap David Badiel's family one by one until he agrees to attend? Or was he perhaps a longtime family friend / distant relative who did so out of sheer, inappropriate friendliness? I do not care, I do not want to know. Even he looks totally embarrassed, mumbles his lines and hides his face in front of the camera. In the meantime, the DOP must have been the goggles of Neighbors, there seemed to be absolutely no sound design, the script, the direction, and the editing were all miserable, and frankly, the apathy that overwhelms me now means I do not have to worry about it spend nothing of my life thinking about this movie anymore.
