We bought this series on DVD because of the many glowing reviews we saw here. I have given him three stars because there is little doubt that acting, directing and writing are sometimes brilliant. In fact, they are so brilliant that we have not seen the propaganda broadcast so smoothly in the series. If you look at it distinctively, you will see that the entire litany of right-wing extremist convictions is being proclaimed by the Fox (Faux) News Network. To avoid spoilers being given away, I will refrain from listing all dozens of concrete cases. A quick look at the conspirators found here on IMDb will reveal everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide "infomercials" and call them "news", with cute conspiracies and passionate ones Talking about some of the best actors is justified in the world. We watched a lot of shows and ended up disgusted when they adjusted the torture with Justice Minister Gonzales as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used by all of us in the name of protection. The series also succeeds in subtly degrading male and female gays by using them as plot devices that portray evil people. All in all, the complete litany of the radical religious right. The popularity of this program is undoubtedly used by future historians as evidence that America lost its way at the beginning of this century. As a student of history, I would characterize this program in a league of propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and some of Hollywood's propaganda for the American public during World War II. <br /> <br /> So if you want to use this as a teaching tool to show your students how subtle propaganda can be in any case. Be sure to purchase a low-cost, second hand copy so you will not be able to enrich the ultra-right wingers at Faux Network who produced this travesty.
