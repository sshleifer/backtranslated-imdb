I just visited the Russian forum of our TV station where this movie was shown. Well ... 99 percent of the active Russian audience is disappointed. We wanted to see more true facts about our space achievements in this film. But the authors had something else in mind ... :( We are a big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here, we are proud of all our space dreams, real achievements in this field and in science on the other hand The authors ask: Where is our LUNOHOD and where is hell our MIR station? I'm pretty sure LUNOHOD events happened much earlier than Armstrong's Walk on Moon and scientific mistakes - I really have here no time and not enough space!
