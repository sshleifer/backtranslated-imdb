If John Waters had written and directed "The House of 1000 Corpses" after being repeatedly hit with a heavy object around his head, the result would likely be something like "The Blood Shed". It's a little entertaining for the first half hour, but then it slides into a sort of insatiable scream of constant screaming and people doing genital mutilation with electric carving knives, cutlery, and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad at what he does in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that most viewers will not take long to forget it.
