As an Elvis fan, I can not understand how this project can be done. Is by far the worst Elvis movie of all time, totally funny, stupid and many mistakes in regards to The King. Come on, Elvis's grave in a public park? A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast are trying their best, Mike Starr is funny (especially as an imitator), Tom Hanks' cameo is a surprise, but the guy who plays the young Elvis is a shitty minute. If you want to watch an extremely cheap, insane, but absolutely funny, little movie about Elvis, I really recommend "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
