This time, the hero from the first movie has become human, using fist and foot combos against super-universal soldiers and a computer that went awry and is ready to conquer the world. I'm pretty sure it was the Double Team that convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in providing observable action films. However, this has tarnished his credibility forever. While Universal Soldier: The Return is not as boring as Double Team or The Quest, it's still pretty awful, with no style and flair of the original and no star-pairing. This sequel is made easy for kids who like professional wrestling. Looking back, not even the action sequences were so exciting and so this movie is a worthless guy. In other words, another clunker in Van Damme's assembly line. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (bad)
