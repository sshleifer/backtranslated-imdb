'Major Payne' is a movie about a major who makes life hell for his small group of marines. This movie does not really have much to offer but has some fun moments that are worth watching. But do not expect it to be an unforgettable movie. Just expect that you have to laugh through the movie and at the expense of others. The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy was hilarious, and that's really all I remember about the movie, except for the guys who want to take revenge on Major Payne. Again, it's not a great movie, and it's probably best to see it on a rainy day when you need a laugh.
