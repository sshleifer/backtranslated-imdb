Del - "You're the stupidest smart person I've ever met." <br /> Calvin- "Well, I had a brain, but they lost it in the paraphrases." <br /> <I think what I find most blissful about this bastardization of Asimov's work was the depiction of the character of Susan Calvin. In the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists who could think through a problem. Here she is just a girl in need waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith. <br /> <br /> There are transitory references to Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which are, however, retrospective with the CGI and action scenes <br /> Smith is sympathetic, as he is in most of his films, but frankly the story is not so good. You'll find it out long before these brilliant characters.
