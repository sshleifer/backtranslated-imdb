Hilarious "drama" about a few high school kids (I think) who like hip-hop without interruption, breakdancing, graffiti and trying to become a DJ in the Roxy - or something. To be completely honest, I was so bored that I forgot it! Even the people who love the music agree that this movie is terribly played and - as a drama - has failed terribly. We should find these children sympathetic and nice. I found her boring and boring. The one I really hated was Ramon. He's doing graffiti in subways and that's considered great. Excuse me? He disfigures public property that does not belong to him from the beginning. These "great" children are also attacking the city's electricity to hold a large dance party in an abandoned building. Um we should find a lot of Law Breakers that are adorable and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I could forgive everything if the music was good, but I can not stand a hip-hop. The songs were mediocre at best and they were non-stop! They are ALWAYS playing! It came to the point that I romped through the many endless music numbers. (Cut out the music and you have a 30-minute movie - maybe). There are some imaginative numbers - the underground dance fight, a really fun Christmas number and the climatic Roxy show. If you love Hip Hop, here is your movie. But if you are looking for a good drama, forget it. HOW did this get a PG rating? There are an incredible amount of curses.
