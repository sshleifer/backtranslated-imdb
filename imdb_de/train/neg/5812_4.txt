"This story is dedicated to women," says the introduction, "who fight for their rights since the beginning of the loose-leaf of Adam and Eve." When "politics" was filmed, the Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed women's suffrage, was only a decade old. The film deals with the exercise of political power by women as a constituency. Advocating prohibition and shutting down speech was a major concern of women at the time. The good-natured Marie Dressler (as Hattie Burns) becomes politically active after a young woman was shot and shot by a speakeasy. She wants the liquors to be sold; and is drafted into a Mayoral run after giving a huge speech at a women's assembly. Ms. Dressler is supported by her tenants, best friend Polly Moran (as Ivy Higgins) and her stuttering husband Roscoe Ates (as Peter Higgins). Dressler's run to the mayor of Lake City attracts opposition from men in the city; For example, Dressler orders the women to strike and deny them "everything" in the "salon, bedroom and bathroom". <br /> <br /> The movie sounds a lot better than it turned out. Honestly, the humor is not so good; and there are some funny and moderately offensive situations ("You look like Madame Queen" refers to an Amos and Andy character). And mixing shots and slapstick is not good this time. The producers might have considered making the film more dramatic by focusing exclusively on Dressler and the characters of William Bakewell (as Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Myrtle Burns). **** Politics (7/25/31) Charles Reisner - Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
