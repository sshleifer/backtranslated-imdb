College students evicting a convicted dormitory are being followed by an elusive killer. <br /> <br /> The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for Slasher fans. The production values ​​of the films are pretty low and the story is mostly routine, there's even a scary butt for a red herring. In fact, much of the story is pretty much forgotten, except for one or two brutal murders. However, the film is made really better by the surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric environment) and a rather bold, unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> The cast is mostly dull. Stephen Sachs is the best of them all because he has a pretty nice character. Also, look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a pretty normal B-Slasher effort, but the finale is worth enjoying, and for this viewer, the movie saved the movie full of bumblebees. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
