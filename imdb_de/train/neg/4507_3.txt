Apparently not on the payroll. <br /> <br /> A Japanese friend of mine actually laughed at some of the cultural absurdities she saw before her eyes. In a later conversation, she said, "Imagine a Finnish director making a movie about the American Civil War with blond Swedish actors as a union army and French as Confederates in Fnnish. Worse yet, the female lead role of Scarlet O'Hara in one Put on hoop skirt Missing the hoop and wearing a 1950s hairstyle: Maybe some people in Finland do not know that the hoop skirt "misses the hoop" or recognizes the bizarre Jane Mansfield hair, but in Atlanta they would not hurt their eyes or ears and laugh in the hallways ... excellent story and photography are damned. <br /> <br /> So ... seeing memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone with Japanese cultural nuances, actual geisha This is the theme of the movie! Hollywood is amazing in its shortsighted view of filmmaking They often do the big money things right, while painstakingly misrepresenting the details that really polish the refinement of a movie. I thought the last samurai would be the culmination of how bad an otherwise good movie about Japan could be. Memoirs of a geisha are both embarrassingly better and worse.
