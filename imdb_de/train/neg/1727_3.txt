We have a lake. We crashed an animated meteor. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with fins. Okay, let's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots called Arnie & Mitch to define the final definition of "comic relief." We also had to have a sheriff who actually does nothing in this movie and nobody listens. Aw shit, we're halfway through the movie and forgot to use a bad guy! Do not worry, imagine a guy with a mustache, let him rob a store to show he's a villain and make him appear somewhere near the lake as a dinosaur snack. That should work. <br /> <br /> A complete, awkward mess, this movie. His logic will twist your mind to make you laugh. The first movie with Dave Allen as "Stop Motion Supervisor". He then joined Charles Band for several years, until the mid-nineties, when money was available to the band, I guess. The dinosaur effects are adorable and the whole movie is damned funny. Unfortunately that's about the only good thing you can say. <br /> <br /> Good Badness? Yes. The logic of reasoning in the narrative should be reason enough to put it on the list. If not, Arnie & Mitch do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
