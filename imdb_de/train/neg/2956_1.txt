What did she think of? file: Whoopi Goldberg is going to play a policeman working with a talking dinosaur (!) for a crime with a madman who wants to start a new ice age. Uncomplicated cassettes are embarrassing and ridiculous, a high concept in search of themselves. Apparently this was a love work for his director Jonathan Betuel (who also served as one of the producers); Unfortunately, the final results are anemic to be charitable. Goldberg's mere presence on screen can often bring about goodwill and laughter no matter how bad the script is, but here it drowns, and you can see the unwelcome results. NO STARS of ****
