Sweet and playful, but lame and cheap. 'Munchies' is another Gremlins clone from the 80s. I'm not a big fan of imitations. <br /> <br /> At first it was the excellent 'Gremlins'. <br /> <br /> Then came the very average 'critters' <br /> Let's not forget the lousy 'ghoulies'. <br /> <br /> But the complete boxes would have to go to 'hobgoblins'. <br /> <br /> Is there more? <br /> <br /> Now for me, "Munchies" would have to fall somewhere between "Ghoulies" and "Hobgoblins". Actually, I probably found it more entertaining than Ghoulies, but I preferred the dark tone. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it plays its goofy nature (which is better for him), but due to this nature, Hammy acting (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips) may be more overbearing than liking you See only the munchies running amok. That's where the fun happens. Most lighthearted fluff, as the story focuses mainly on the munchies (who are either hungry, horny and destructive) in a series of supposedly comic encounters (a few moments work) in the small desert town as a few people take center stage in the hunt is stupid, but strangely captivating, thanks to the brisk pace. The creatures themselves look rather bland and lacking in detail as they are basic puppets tossed around. Where their personalities came from is that they can actually speak ... and with their attitude. Charlie Stratton and a vivacious Nadine Van der Velde (who was in 'Critters') were fair leads. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also appears. <br /> <br /> Uncompromising entertainment for undemanding people.
