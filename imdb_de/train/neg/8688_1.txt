If the only sex you've ever had is a livestock, the slogan for that movie is probably still misleading. <br /> <br /> This is by far one of the most boring movies I've ever had to try and watch lately. I found the DVD lying around with my friend, and I made the sad mistake of not burning it. <br /> <br /> I can not tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details about this movie. Just imagine, somebody would make a movie about things in c-span, only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate in c-span movie, but I could not say exactly what it was after I ran out of my eyeballs and threw them at Richard Gere.
