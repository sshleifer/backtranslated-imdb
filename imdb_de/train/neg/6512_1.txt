Without any affinity to any kind of filmmaking and a healthy appreciation of documentary films, I can honestly say that I was mad at myself for bothering to sit through the full length of "20 Dates." I will not waste your time with the plot, you can read other reviews. I'll say that Berkowitz's hypery, Woody Allen style was extremely annoying. They either wished he would stop the coffee or take some tranquilizers. For Berkowitz himself, it may be obvious that this film was a bad idea, as parts of it go into detail about his attempts to fund the documentary. Forgive that you disguise insults as compliments, but to Berkowitz I owe the ability to convince an idiot to fund this dreadful **** piece. I appreciate the limitations and intentions of the film here, but even if Berkowitz sets the standards he sets for himself, he fires and misses at all levels. In the end, I'm sure that many of these female companions were not hassle-free with a crazy filmmaker, so I doubt the authenticity of the film. Hey Myles, I loved your movie when I saw it for the first time ... when it was released as a result of Seinfeld or was a movie by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
