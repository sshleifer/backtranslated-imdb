Bonjour Tristesse has similar reasons as "The member of the wedding". A possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship between a beloved family member and an intruder. While critics love 'Member of the Wedding', I find Julie Harris to be a jumbo drag and an adenoidal, landscape-shimmering thespian in all her environment. This shows irritating, rich idiots as in Last Year in Mariánské Lázně, but this time It is a travelogue. <br /> <br /> In this Preminger film, film sequences develop, but the characters do not. In the first 30 minutes, he wants to blur the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, making inconvenient sexual readings possible. Once the conflict is established, Seberg can not deliver the depth the part needs. Kerr pulls the rank and turns the movie into 'Endless Love'. Seberg's empty narrative is something out of Strange Interlude - it's not good. I really wish someone other than Niven would be in his role. He spends so much time normalizing orthodox British behavior in all his films, he never comes to the character. <br /> <br /> In the most memorable order, evening dancing in the harbor becomes an all-round talent. Bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise "The Conformist". Kerr is on board to grab their hands and express another pain (as in Black Narcissus, Leguan's Night, King and I, Heaven Knows, Mr. Allyson, Tea and Sympathy, etc.). Really, Kerr was a terrible actress. I wish any movie with her could end in a fatal car crash or, better still, start with one. <br /> <br /> People who are uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this.
