This is one of the movies you see in the video library that you just have to get because it looks so bad. And indeed we could not take most of it. There was a lot of fast-forwarding. <br /> <br /> But then we came across a scene in which Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (her name somehow springs to my mind). Cripes. I've never seen a single scene from a movie so often (I guess forty or so). And I have never laughed so much in my life. You see, Englund has this thing to show his loins. I last saw the movie a few months ago, but I can not stop laughing as I write. Anyway, the scene is a montage of shots - Englund rips off the girl's underwear, Englund rides naked and a mysterious woman crumbles the head of a snake. That's absolute genius. You have to see it for yourself.
