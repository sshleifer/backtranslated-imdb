Beautiful bodies, beautiful colors and camera work, sophisticated dialogue, banal plot. The name of the prima donna, Camilla, and the flowers of the same name, which remind us of the similarities between Dumas 'La Dame aux Camelias', the movie Camille with Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and last but not least Verdi's opera La Traviata. Beautiful, not too virtuous young women, social outsiders for some reason, loved, split, brought back together just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene ... One forgives banal conspiracies and stupid unrealistic dialogue in the opera, but why should You Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful rendition of LA in the '30s, a Deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman, and wasting all the beauty of this mediocre turkey in which there is no beautiful song?
