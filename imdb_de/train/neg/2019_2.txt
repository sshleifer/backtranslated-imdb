Oh man, that was really shitty ... I could not even pull any stock value out of it ... and I sat on Showtime all the time ... naked scenes either ..... it's too late and only plastic Jenna Jameson is involved .. Shows how much discretionary money has to be put in Hollywood just to get your name on the final loan. I think Showtime had to throw something in at 1 o'clock in the morning ... Next time I think I'd rather watch the ESPN loop every 30 minutes ...
