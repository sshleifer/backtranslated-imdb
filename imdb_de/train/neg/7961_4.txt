Five years after the original creep show, another inferior horror sequel is written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three instead of five stories. None of the three stories is really original or differentiated. The first story is a terrible, formulaic story about an Indian wooden statue seeking revenge on the killers of its owners. The effects are really nice in this story, but it's just too familiar to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the older shopkeepers. The second story, "The Raft," is a story by Stephen King. It's about four teenagers who unintentionally spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of a secluded lake. Soon the children are screaming for their lives as a watery blob breaks in each one of them for no apparent reason. But instead of being exciting, the kids are attracted to bad dialogues and stupid saddles, which prevents us from really worrying about what happens next. There is also unwanted humor in this segment. The third and final story is "The Hitch-Hiker", a retouching that was actually overhauled for Creepshow 2. Then it was adapted for a famous Twilight Zone episode with Inger Stevens. "The Hitch-Hiker" is the best of these three offerings, but it's not without its problems. Lois Chiles plays a fraudulent spouse who ends up having to drive over a pickup, she thinks. However, we do not know if we should sympathize with her or judge her. As in many average stories of this kind, the characters are only there to tell the stories with their twists. The wrap around story with the thugs seems a bit out of place. Tom Savini appears as "Schleicher" in this episode. The good thing is that there were no further sequels. * 1/2 out of 4 stars.
