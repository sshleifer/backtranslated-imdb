I rented this movie about a month ago when I had nothing else to do on a Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless movie is "TRASH". Acting is done so badly. I've seen children in high school do a better job and no room to catch the viewer. On another note, the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked as if it had been shot with a camera that anyone can buy a radio shack. Hell, he does not show up until the end of the movie, and everything he does buzz songs and trudge some characters. There is no real murder, so this is not a real Slasher movie. Since I saw him, I have questioned a few things. 1. If it's "Serial Insane Clown Killer," this would not be a serial killer killing clowns 2. If your girlfriend is missing, why go into the woods to have sex instead of looking for her? Really sad. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is it that the only REAL acting was suddenly sprayed in vain? Did the performers finally decide to make an effort in their jobs? This movie is as sad as they come. My advice is to avoid renting it so you do not waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than shouting.
