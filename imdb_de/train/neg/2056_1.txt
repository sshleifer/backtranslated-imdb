If you loved the two classic novels by Edward Ormondroyd, you will be disappointed in this film. All the magic and romance have been modernized from his original story of a girl doing a good deed for a mysterious old lady and given "three" in return. Three what? Not three wishes, but three rides with a rickety elevator in the 1800s. <br /> <br /> The first novel is Time at the Top. The second one is All in Time.
