Where should I start? What is the best way to describe how horrible this movie is? <br /> <br /> Let's start with the pugnacious Hick humor. That is not very funny. Add some musicians who pretend to be actors - Meat Loaf is terrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Too bad, poor Carney, he should have known better than to make this film. <br /> <br /> And then there's the story. A roadie whose goal in life is to work on an Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose life's goal is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, when the movie is over, you can not have a plausible final scene as a - well, I will not ruin it's for you if you really want to see the movie. <br /> <br /> There are certain actors who let you know that this will be a "B" movie or maybe even worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role. That's a sure sign that the movie is not likely to be very good. Last but not least, the film meets the low expectations and even surpasses them by being worse than poor. <br /> <br /> Let's just say that. This is the movie that compares all the bad movies. And no one is worse than roadie.
