Feeding the Masses is just one of many current mediocre zombie movies that are looking for the hard-earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard earned money and let's just say that good old TheatreX has won one for this team for this team. Guess what the plans are about? Take on zombies. This time, for reasons of originality (?), This movie is filmed in Rhode Island. To be honest, I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie jump in Rhode Island. A government-controlled television station is said to maintain "normal" broadcasts so that the remaining citizens do not believe that there is any problem in the world, that is, those who never look or go outside anyway. However, I will say that some of the commercials broadcasted by this station were probably the most amusing part of this movie. There's actually some kind of story to it, but I do not care, because after a while, you either do not care or fall asleep. In any case, this has a lot of terrible acting to make all this "all seen" in front of the camera. Trust me, you can do many other things with your time than watching it. 3 out of 10.
