What's wrong with the Americans and their departure with a religious gobbled gook? To think that this is a bestselling novel is unbelievable, but to make a movie you need really good acting and a script that delivers. In this case, all the good actors flew to the sky, and Kirk Cameron, as a CNN journalist (!), Left to figure out why many people just disappeared. Oh yes, there is a subplot about a wicked world conspiracy and famine or something. The good news is that this is done so cheaply and with such an inhuman dialogue that it has a pure entertainment value in all its unintentional laughter. Not recommended for people with a three-digit IQ.
