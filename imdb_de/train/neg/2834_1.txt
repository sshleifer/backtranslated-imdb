I have now seen all four Bo Derek vehicles judged by her husband John. Of course, all are pretty awful, but this is certainly the pit. With the usual, weak action, bad scripting? from the director, of course? and acting, not to mention the star 's naked nudity, is about having lost the much older husband Anthony Quinn (she accepts the shotgun' s suicide by saying he 's always admired Hemingway !!), the but continues to appear and speaks with her. In fact, he wants to return to another, younger body, but only in the last scene! Derek is as always lovely and still naive (!)? especially during a jumbled middle pursuit from a hired killer in a spa. Quinn is usually larger than life (say: Hammy), but that makes his nadir easy; He also works for a majority of the time behind a piece of shiny plastic (which probably indicates a kind of limbo)! His "replacement" is obviously a handsome stallion with no talent or personality. The cast also features Hollywood veterans Don Murray (as Quinn's best friend and Bos business consultant) and Julie Newmar (as Quinn's guardian angel in the afterlife). plus a surprise gig by billionaire Donald Trump (who probably needed that in his CV)! It goes without saying that John Derek was his own cinematographer in the film, that the credits are filled with useless (and grumpy) words of thanks to the many people who helped us, and that GHOSTS WOULD NOT KNOW the board at the Razzie Awards 1990!
