Some things have to be clarified. The picture of Mark Ferris is not the Mark Ferris, who played in this movie. I know that because he was my dad. Please remove the picture. Mark Ferris was also the writer, at least one of them. I tried to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. It's been years, and if someone can give me a copy, that would be great. The movie was not that bad and he tried to compare it to today's world of Star Wars and other high-tech scientists. If you see it, just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it has. Make it easier to be a movie snob and enjoy a few less creative and innovative movies.
