I am a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. That being said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> To have a good movie, you must have a well-written script. Left Behind remained angry in this regard. For one thing, it deviates radically from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel into a two-hour movie, but in this movie I've seen changes that make no sense at all. <br /> <br /> Another thing is development without character. If characters are saved in the story (I'm not saying who), the book makes it clear that it's a long mental search process. In the movie it is fast and artificial. The book has been written decently enough, where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams, and Hattie Durham appear real, but in the film scenarios the fast treatment is given without substantial measures throughout. In another scene where one of the characters gets angry that they are being left behind (not again, who I say), it seems artificial. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I realize that I do not like to say that I did not like this movie, but I can not recommend a clear conscience to recommend a movie that I did terribly. Maybe it would have been better to make 2-3 films from the first book. In any case, Christians must realize that in order to be taken seriously as a filmmaker, we need to put together a high-quality film. I know that a lot of effort was probably invested in Left Behind, but that's how I see it.
