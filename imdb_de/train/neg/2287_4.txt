I only saw Gretchen Mol in two other movies (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco) and can not really remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl posing for pictures because it made people happy. She really did not think that what she was doing was wrong even after she left the shop and found her religion again. <br /> <br /> The photos that she made were certainly tame by today's standards, and that's it. It's funny to see that men with cameras are all excited and politicians dealing with the evil of pornography employ. David Strathairn (good night and good luck) played a great role here. Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biography of the most famous pinup girl of all time.
