This may be one of the worst killer animal movies I've ever seen. It follows the typical premise of a failed laboratory test, and a giant crocodile with a rapid growth chemical escapes. The monster looks too much like a dinosaur and has big tyrantosaur-like hind legs if it looks like an oversized crocodile. Everything about this film is unoriginal and is constantly "clich√©" from minute to minute. Why are there always two drunken Redneck hunters separating after dark? In addition, there is always a man and a woman who have a lame, obvious love interest while in life-threatening situations. Too much has already been said by me and I feel like I'm writing my time writing this ...
