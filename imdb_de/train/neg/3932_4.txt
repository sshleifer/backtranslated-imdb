This solid little horror movie is actually one of Renny Harlin's best. The story is pretty routine, but the atmosphere really makes it alive; In fact, the ghost story is almost a reflection. The real horror comes from the prison itself, and Renny H. spares no detail to show us how bad the conditions in this crumbled, leaky, rat-infested old hellhole (with a sadistic guard!) Are common in the lead role by some very authentic-looking prisoners (there are no pretty boys in this cast). Horror fans should check this out.
