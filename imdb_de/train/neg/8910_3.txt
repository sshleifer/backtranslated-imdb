This movie has a very simple but somehow very bad plot. The whole movie is about a girl being sucked through a gate into another dimension, and later it is reopened by a witch, while a group of friends (including the lead actor who is struggling to find his former girlfriend, one of the another is to overcome) Camper along with her new partner ... another girl ... that's right, they are lesbians and of course there is also nudity for no particular reason. Unfortunately, Demon is following the adult girl now. Unfortunately, none of this is explained. Where exactly were they? Where does the demon come from? How did she survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell trained them and made them a gladiator outfit? Acting is awful, I think, but it's hard to say because writing is so bad, maybe they just could not do it. I give three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty funny, even though they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it was not bad enough to be funny.
