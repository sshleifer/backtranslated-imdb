I hoped it would be the "thoughtful" little gem that people have reviewed. I love Indy movies and I expected to dig that too. Knowing what a hot button this topic is, I really expected it to be really entertaining, maybe even an outlook for outsiders you will like this I personally do not like the idea of ​​being peed on myself or cutting myself That's why I thought it was rubbish. bad script, bad drama, bad story, bad direction, bad editing .... i could go on. I have no idea why a reviewer said he or she made a political point by giving this movie a 10. This is misleading and ignorant. Voting for a movie on IMDb is not a precedent! It just makes other people think that a garbage bomb like this is okay as long as it's controversial (this movie is not, it tries very hard, but fails). <br /> <br /> You know the movie is bad if you pray after 15 minutes that all the main characters are dying terribly. Unfortunately, they die, but not in the painful way that would have given the viewer some justice or justification because he had seen the two hours of crap that they just endured. <br /> <br /> do yourself a favor, do not bother. I bought this movie in a .50 shop in my local .50 video store and I feel like I'm running out!
