This is certainly the worst west I have ever seen. The story follows a formula common in western and martial arts films - Hero learns that family / friends were murdered, so hero revenge undertakes, thwart the ineffective lawyer, rescue the abducted loving girl, and murder the expert Archenemy in a brutal duel. This formula was often successful - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most demanding execution you'll ever see. The scripting is abominably simple and offensive. It sounds like a high school scholar who has written the dialogue because of the lack of depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks synchronized. The cinematography is lame and the sets are sometimes just facades. The spectacle is pathetic; Sure, some of the performers could blame the script, but others can not use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role again. Every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he does nothing but lower the tone of his voice, and he just sounds like a kid trying to play macho. And when you talk about Chris Lybbert playing Hopalong, check out his duds (if you want to watch this movie): He wears those brand-new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working, dirty cowboy. If you enjoy an unfriendly movie that merely serves to honor the imaginary greatness of Hopalong Cassidy, then get it, but if you have more than two neurons, look for something else.
