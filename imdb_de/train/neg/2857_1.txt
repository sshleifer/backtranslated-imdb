I've seen a lot of original sci-fi channel movies since I started watching them in 2002 (My first was Sabretooth - which I think is one of the more funky features of the sci-fi channel). Their quality varies. Some of them are average but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), others are ridiculously bad and there are some that are really terrible. Raptor Planet is in the latter. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a laidback sequel to the original 2004 Raptor Island sci-fi channel, is a barely observable confusion of a movie with really horrible drama and lazy script writing. The effects that bring the dinosaurs to life (a combination of puppetry and animatronics and CGI and stock footage of Raptor Planet) are some of the worst-looking effects I've seen in a low-budget movie. The gore effects are not convincing. <br /> <br /> The storyline includes a series of commands that for some reason (I forget why) travel to a planet of extraterrestrial dinosaurs. That's right folks, the dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in space. What's next, sharks in space?!? The rest of the story is simple. The human cast is picked up and eaten. Meanwhile, we expect this in the numerous dinosaur movies and novels that will be released, but this is the first killer dinosaur movie I've ever seen that got boring with all the dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br /> But there are a few giggles in it. There is a scene in which a man is chewed by a Carnotaur (brought to life by stock footage from the original movie), which seconds later becomes a giant bird of prey. A little detail, this is the scene in which Steven Baur shoots on his own death scene from the first film. <br /> <br /> Although Raptor Island was not a good movie at first, it's a masterpiece compared to its sequel. <br /> <br /> Believe me, when I say that's probably the worst movie Syfy ever aired. It's damn near unsurpassable.
