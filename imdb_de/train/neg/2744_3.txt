I was bored around 10pm, so I saw this movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the kids behaved as if they were older than 11 years just tore me up. One of the children had a ring that allegedly killed people after about three years. I had the impression that he wanted to be a gangster. <br /> <br /> It is quite difficult to take small children seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They pretend that everything is such a big deal, as if Billy (the main character) does not eat the worms, then the world will go down a 5-year-old says "penis"), but not for teens or adults who do not spend their time want to waste.
