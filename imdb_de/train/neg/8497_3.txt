My title should be enough. <br /> <br /> It is amazing that a culture so rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) would produce such movements as the "nouvelle vague" film movement. France had a long tradition of artistic clarity and clever philosophy until the twentieth century. But once you give them a movie camera, they behave like WOOOHOOO LOOK WHAT YOU CAN BE! PLOT? THEME? PAH! LET THE MOVIE AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE ROUND & ROUND! At least that's not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with people's minds, oh-la-la, quel artiste.). No, Truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity. But also the security camera in a fast market. The two are indistinguishable. <br /> <br /> Haha, just like all the movie nerds you've got from film school: I bet the vein is just popping out of your throat right now. But do not go without reading the last sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> If you like French literature, you will hate. People who like this movie have probably never read other books than Jack Kerouac's Walks or perhaps "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Or maybe they've read the lyrics to The Doors songs and think that's deeply moving. Whatever your boat is swimming. I find it ironic that this film has given (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the best and most significant writers who ever lived. Nice try, truffle. However, they are not near the ballpark. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like an AIDS-infected syringe. <br /> <br /> If you are one of the people who like to think, then stay with Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and the Japanese masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara ( SUNA NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you're an idiot, enjoy your Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And for God's sake, push that vein back into your throat. You look like a cabbage.
