As others have noted, this film is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artist's life and I was very upset and insulted ... by transforming her rape into a tragic love affair, through the implication her rapist was responsible for "her talent "awakening", by the total disregard of her work, by the way she has made her a sex object, get the idea. I also find it disturbing that people who do not know Gentileschi will see this movie and leave that impression of it behind.
