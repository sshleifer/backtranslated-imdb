An obsolete "outsider-in-the-army" saga half-heartedly trying to be both surreal (foreign subtitles) and vulgar (the flatulence), but ultimately just a mix of many different kinds of humor followed by them very successful. Barbara Bach, the "The Spy Who Loved Me" Bondgirl, has only two or three short scenes. What a waste! (* 1/2)
