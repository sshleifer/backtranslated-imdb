What do you expect when there is no script and therefore nothing the director can work with? Hayek and Farrell and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just have nothing to say or react to. Even the earthquake was pretty poor. And I do not know exactly how the film follows the novel, but two have turned up the Jewish girl out of nowhere to show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some clich√©s mean nothing. And he even buries Camilla in the desert, instead of bringing her to LA for a nice Catholic funeral, where he could at least bring her flowers from time to time. Pathetic. And the set of L.A. was made ridiculously graphically. All the best? The window to his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. Was since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whatever it was.
