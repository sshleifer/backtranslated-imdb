The premise of the movie has been explained, and if you've come this far, do not pretend that I'm a movie critic. With that said, my own opinion of the movie is pretty low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike, but that goes back to the category of his not so great work with DOA 2 and 3 and a few others (many). <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be free Pass because it's a Takashi movie and nothing Takashi does can be wrong. This is a high school approach to the cinema. For the rest of us, we find an hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason (and yes, that takes the movie away), the tempo of the movie almost reaches the level of Rigomortis and the drama ... well ... Hmmm. <br /> <br /> If you are a Takashi fan, you will see it regardless of your interests. It lacks any originality (see the infinite story) or any character development that evolves from the main character in the face of another conflict rather than a superficial one. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, this is the first movie Miike Co-Writing has written for, but that does not mean much, as none of what we hope would affect Miike's personality in the Screen. All we get are some of Miike's small shots of the photography director. <br /> <br /> The film had the potential to be something great. The premise is not difficult to run wild. But this one seemed to be rammed into the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is, if you are only concerned with Miike, you should follow some standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then film his works like Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog and Bird People of China.
