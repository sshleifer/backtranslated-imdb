I'm a bit tired of people who use God's name to perpetuate their own bigoted view of the world. Well, I do not reject the idea of ​​Armageddon or the coming of the Antichrist, I reject the idea that only certain people who lead truly good lives (they appear to be predominantly white Christian children) will go to heaven We have to suffer through the millennia of hell on earth just because we were not good enough. God may be a judge, but I do not think he will measure every step of the good. Give some recognition to the Creator.
