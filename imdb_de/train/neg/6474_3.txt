This was the first sequel I saw (aside from Return of Jafar) and I honestly thought before looking at it that it would come close to the original. I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The story was basically the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody, who is not satisfied with life on land. She wants to be a mermaid. However, Ariel has saved her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her - and when Melody finds out she is upset and angry. And then she decides to run away and she becomes a mermaid. So she likes to swim around and Ariel sets out to find her as a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story does not sound that bad, but the clich√©s and repetition of situations from the first movie are just too obvious. In addition, Melody is extremely annoying overall and the movie is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There are also a lot of other new characters - Tip and Dash are two of them. You are not too bad at being characters in yourself - do not try to think of Timon or Pumbaa! The songs leave something to be desired, they just do not have the same magical energy as the songs from the original. Obviously, the animation did not have a lot of work, either in parts, it is restless, and not much imagination is used for the movements of the characters. <br /> <br /> Another piece of advice that you should forget Ariel's original character watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious, inquisitive teenager is 'bored' to a boring, boring wife and mother, and her signature red hair is all tied up. This is much better seen if you have never seen the original - you have nothing to compare. <br /> <br /> All in all it could have been worse - it's not as bad as other sequels like Cinderella II. But it's not in the same league as the original. But for your collection, if nothing else, as if Disney goes on like this, they will lose all their older fans.
