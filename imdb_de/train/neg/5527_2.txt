The uprising of the zombies is bad. There is nothing remotely about the movie. It is boring, lifeless, badly traded and badly written. I have often complained that the original Dracula is a bit slow for my taste. Well, this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride. The 65-minute run seemed to be 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story: An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of thought control through "Zombification". A man finds the secret and uses it to get the woman he loves to marry him. Once this happens, he releases the zombies under his control for terrible consequences. That's it. That's the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, I tried to figure out where I saw the male lead role. He looked so familiar. I had a lot of time to think about it. Nothing happened in the movie. Just before the "zombies" revolted, it hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I had recently seen him as a general in White Christmas. That's how I "entertained" most of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I did not buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of filmmaking compared to this movie. For what it's worth, I'll give it 2/10. (I do not go to 1/10, because, believe me or not, I have seen worse.)
