Gwoemul (The Host) - Due to the contamination of the Han River, a mutant animal is raging. The youngest member of the Park family is kidnapped by the beast and it's up to the rest of her family to find her before she becomes the beast's newest meal. <br /> <br /> First, I love monster movies: mutated bears, oversized alligators, pack of komodo dragons, all of them. Creature features are my favorite types of horror movie. So I really wanted to like The Host, but it should not be that way. <br /> <br /> There were three major issues: <br /> <br /> The first one is a quick look at the IMDb page. <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horrors / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Too many damn genres. It took itself too seriously to be a comedy and yet was too lighthearted to have a real message (though it seemed he was trying to make some sort of statement - anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-pollution) -Government). The drama was misguided and mixed in a confusing mish-mash of all the other styles. <br /> <br /> Second, almost nothing happens after the first monster attack. The central family is looking for their own family, while the governments of Korea and America seem to be doing nothing. And that's it, they just wander around and occasionally beat themselves, probably for a bit of comedy relief. This lack of action caught my attention, and apparently it did the same for the director, as whole storylines remain unsolved (a mystery plague invented by the evil Americans is completely forgotten and never solved). And finally, the movie is awkward politically. It paints Americans as stupid and evil, but does not give us any American characters with more depth than a cartoon villain. The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American and wise Korean moment. With a Korean morgue assistant who asks his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the Han River. The American coroner chuckles almost furiously as he orders the assistant to keep going. It's not just racist, it's also a lazy movie, and there's no excuse for that. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the monster is good, a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the movement effects are pretty cool and the first monster chase through the park is great fun. There are also some nice shots in the movie. Some of them strangely remind me of the way Firefly was filmed (shattering cameras, blurry shots, etc.). In the end there is also a beautiful scene in which the hero and a little boy he has rescued sit in the family mobile food stand. It is night and snow is falling, the street lamp gives out a cold light, but the food stand has a warm glow. Overall, I was really disappointed with this movie. I was looking forward to a decent creature movie and instead I get a pseudopolitical horror comedy. If I look at the comments on IMDb, I can not help thinking that if it had been an American production, it would have been planned. Just because it's a foreign movie does not mean it's good. There have been some great films from Korea in recent years (like the Revenge Trilogy and the Brotherhood), but this is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> For once I am for a remake. Improve the direction, improve the scripting and that could have been a nice movie. As it is, it is not worth spending a few hours.
