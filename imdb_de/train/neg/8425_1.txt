Really a disgusting, disgusting movie with little real humor. <br /> <br /> In particular, the character of the father is vulgar in the extreme (deliberately so obvious) and is portrayed in the most pathetic. crazy style. <br /> <br /> My wife and I found this movie terribly disturbing, with absolutely no redemptive features. Honestly, I wish I had never seen it before. <br /> <br /> I consider this British effort a sick and rough fix. <br /> <br /> Those who have enjoyed this film have a capacity that I completely miss: the joy of a show of profound depravity and misery. The producers should be ashamed.
