I see people write how great this movie was. It was terrible! The spectacle was at best below average. It made a lot of money because teenage girls were in the cinemas seven times because of Leonardo to watch the movie. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to know more about the Titanic. Why did it sink what many people thought of; maybe even a bit of conspiracy. Is anyone aware that certain people did not even board because there was a fire on board before take-off? No, you do not do it because you only see a rich girl who falls in love with a poor boy, and he paints her naked (did that stupid filth tell you that the movie was stupid?) I was crying in one scene , The scene as they showed the water filling in the ship. It looked like pool water! I think that this movie made so much money and the ocean water could not even look real? Unbelievable ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh, the band kept playing while the ship went down. Just ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor outdone him in the Nothing to Reality section.
