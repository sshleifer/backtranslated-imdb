I can not say enough bad things about this train wreck. It's one of the few films I've ever been tempted to get out of. It was initially a bad premise, first a pregnant man, but then they tried to make it a parody. What have you faked all these real pregnant men? This was the worst movie I have ever seen. If it had enough votes, it would be on the bottom 100 of the IMDB. If it were possible to give a zero, I would do it, and I would still feel that I had given him too much credit.
