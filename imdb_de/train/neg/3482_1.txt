So I know that I've chosen 1 in 10, but that does not really deserve more than half a star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic that I can not believe that one of the stars responsible for this ridiculously absurd project believed. James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were excellent in their characters, and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good, but the story was bad and I would urge anyone who sees this in the video store not to even pick it up and the back Cover, but just go away ... I do not want to understand what the movie is about because it's too stupid to pontify it. <br /> <br /> Do not rent this! It is terrible! Dreadful!
