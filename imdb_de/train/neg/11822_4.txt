I thought of Harvey Keitel, a young, freshly from the Sex Pistols John Lydon, then as a bonus the music of Ennio Morricone. I was expecting a classic old school Italian thriller that was produced in America. Istead, I have a hodgepodge story that never made sense, and a movie where I said: WTF !!! Too many unanswered questions and not enough action. The result: a potential cult classic was flushed to the bathroom. Keitel and Lydon work well together, so Quentin Tarantino can reunite these guys with better scripts. Oh, and the Morricone score: OK, but not memorable. All in all, not a waste of time, but not a "must", unless you are a hardcore fan of Keitel.
