I am both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this film is so accurate about Vietnam and WERE NEVER THERE. This movie is about as true throughout the Vietnam War as the strike against Rodney King over ALL police officers. Yes, bad things happen (and have happened), but in general, people are just like you and me. They have morality, they do not kill machines, they do not take all drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened much less often than the "hype" would have you believe. Oliver Stone has a knack for films that show the Vietnam War as a brutal bloodbath, but just as real as Star Wars. If you honestly believe the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favor and learn the truth. Fact: The Viet Cong and the NVA have done far worse things to the South Vietnamese than any US Army soldier. Fact: The soldiers of World War II generally treated the enemy far worse than the soldiers in Vietnam, and when they got home, they WELCOME. The good Americans who have served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect. Although the war has been badly run from a political point of view, no one could have demanded more from our soldiers, and it is a great disadvantage to claim that this kind of "most true" fiction is the way in which things really exist were.
