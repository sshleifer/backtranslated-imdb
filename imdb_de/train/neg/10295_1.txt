There are many presumptuous people out there pretending that this is a kind of beautiful meaning, and that stupid idiots like me do not understand it. Obviously that means we should stick to Hollywood slags. <br /> <br /> It has every artistic clich√© in the book - a bare hem - I think it's good that the director is one of the few chosen ones. Almost a self-parody that drowns in its own claim. <br /> <br /> The director of the (almost equally embarrassing) film 'Ratcatcher' returns with another piece that turns into artistic nonsense; It is difficult to understand and is obviously a study of alienation. The best way to describe this film is alienation for its viewers.
