This is absolutely the worst movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> First I would say that the acting was very good, and with all the actors. <br /> <br /> That seemed to be very unusual, and he succeeded in that regard. Similarly, the story revolves around a selfish wannabe who is an unsuspecting, talentless chronic liar whose source of self-confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers. <br /> <br /> This was worse than watching a car crash.
