This is a really pathetic little movie. Admittedly, the original (un) holy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns, with the third part "The Final Conflict" degenerating into a ridiculous negotiation about halfway through the film, which apparently provided only the necessary unnecessary wounded deaths the whole right to exist for the "Omen" series. But to suppress this leaky TV movie (beware of buyers of the Omen box on DVD - do not be fooled by the widescreen ratio of the transmission, this was and is a strictly small screen) on the back of a series Die in der Usually fine, demonic chillers were unpardonable, especially as advocated by the executive producer and producer of the first three films Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I would give it away if it were beyond the usual death scenes (hopelessly toned down for TV sensibilities) and some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Everyone involved in this project should be ashamed that this travesty ever made it to the screen, let alone masked it under the name of Omen. If a person is convinced by my criticism to avoid this mess, I feel better.
