The trailers for this movie were better than the movie. What talent and wasting money. I wish I had waited for this movie to appear on DVD because I would not spend at least $ 9. The film completely misses the target. What could have been a great movie for all actors turned out to be a B-movie at best. The movie moved VERY slowly and just when I thought it was going somewhere it was almost, but then it did not. Today, we need unpredictable twists and turns of the movie, and this movie did not offer any of the possibilities. The whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good, but not sure if it was as it was judged, the lighting, the delivery of lines, the writing or what, but nothing came of it. Much hype for nothing. I was very disappointed in this movie and I tell everyone that you should NOT see it. The cheesy saxophone music made the movie even worse. And the end had NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie. What a disappointment.
