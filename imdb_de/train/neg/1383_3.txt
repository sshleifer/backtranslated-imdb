Lame, cliched superhero action movie. I had high hopes for this film, and the HK buddy cop genre is one I do not despise, but very rarely do I see a story that is as banal and ridiculous as this one. That would have been forgivable, as is always the case with such films, if the plot compensates for that. The plot bears the trademark surreality and surpasses the supreme nature of the HK plot, but is not very involving, obscenely bloody, and indeed often completely incoherent (perhaps because of the reworking for the American release, but it does show in many Areas signs patchwork sites). I was very disappointed.
