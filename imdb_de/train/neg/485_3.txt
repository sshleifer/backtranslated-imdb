When I saw the preview, I thought: This is going to be a great movie. And indeed it could have been. The actress who played the main character was very credible and the beauty of the filming is undeniable. However, the dialogues cast a dark shadow over the entire picture. The language level was too familiar and too timely for an action that took place in 1610, and it took away most of the movie's magic. However, I have to congratulate the translator because the English subtitles were more sophisticated and appropriate than the original French cues, and this probably explains the good rating that the film has received in imbd!
