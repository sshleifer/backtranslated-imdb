This film has an o.k. Score and a not bad performance from David Muir as Dr. Hack stone. The beginning and the end of the credits, along with most of the actors and the "special effects" show that this is a low budget movie. There's nothing in this movie you could not find in other crazy scientists, horror / comedy, or low budget movies. Not especially for nude scene fans or bad movie lovers. This movie is just here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing special either. If you are curious about how I found and find it, you will see the truth of the one-line summary.
