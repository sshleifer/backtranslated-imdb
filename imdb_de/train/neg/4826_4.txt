I see what the director tried, but he missed the mark. The lead actor was really good, but editing his moments brings you out. The camera work, ie lighting and lighting, is a kind of amateur I could forgive if the direction were more fluid, but it was not. The sound was a bit off and that brings you also from the movie. I see that this director could do a bit better in the future, so not a total win, but do not expect a DVD movie to be nearly as good as 28 days later or anything else, keep your expectations low and you'll get more get it from it. At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh yes, and apart from the main character, acting was pretty bad, if you ask me. But I'm a movie snob, so take that for what it's worth.
