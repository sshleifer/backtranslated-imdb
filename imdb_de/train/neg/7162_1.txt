This movie takes a good idea, a 2000 year old mummified witch, and totally destroys her. Nora and Jim are alcoholics and go to Ireland to dry. They go to Nan and her uncle. The uncle has discovered a 2000-year-old witch in the peat. He revives her again and she has the shape of Nora. She can not be conventionally killed (more is pity). Nora, however, is working on a way to do that. <br /> <br /> This is a gothic horror movie made cheap. It's a huge mess. I have to ask why someone wants to make such a bad movie. I'm trying to learn sorcery to make it disappear. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL COST
