I just received the UK 4-disc special issue of Superman 1 for about $ 5. The additional material includes the 1951 movie "Superman" and "Mole-Men". So I hit it in the DVD player last night, and here are my findings. <br /> <br /> An initial disappointment - I did not check it out, and I think I mentally described it as one of Kirk Alyn's series. I'm not a big fan of George Reeves as a superman, and I had seen nothing but the weird clip of Kirk Alyn - but hey ho, whatever. <br /> <br /> This black and white production runs for less than an hour. It feels like a few episodes of one of Reeves' first television series, a two-parter compiled for the movie's release, though IMDb says it was shot before the first television series as a theatrical release. Anyway, it's a weird choice, for reasons I'll address later. I'm at an age when I remember television and film productions limited to one or two locations and sets. So there were no big surprises. However, for a low-budget movie, this movie is REALLY low. <br /> <br /> The story refers to the small town of Silsby (1430 inhabitants), which is mysteriously the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). The story begins when the foreman of the fountain hurriedly takes steps to close the well. This conflicts with the arrival of Metropolis reporters Kent and Lane, who report on the well at the behest of the oil company. While Clark spied on the fact that the drill had surfaced in a radioactive cave 6 miles down, some strange little guys (small in stature, big in the head, black in overalls and bushy in the eyebrow) emerge from the cap, and start with confused facial expressions in the city. <br /> <br /> Now take a deep breath, here's the rest of the picture. The little boys scare some kids, and Jeff Corey (who plays the city's Xenophobe) calls some friends to kill those "creatures." Superman enters (moderately ineffective) and catches one of the little guys who got shot and takes him to the local hospital. Corey's friends burn down the hut that the other little guy hid, and assume he's going to be killed, but he escapes and pushes her into the pit. Corey instigates a lynch mob (despite the sheriff who arrested him) to hang up the mole-man at the hospital. Superman stops her at the hospital and brings the injured Chappie to the shaft to bring him back to his companions. A total of 4 moles-men come up with a gun to fire at Jeff Corey (I call this an Aargh! Pistol because their only effect is to make Corey "Aargh!") And Superman saves him. He changes immediately because Superman is amazed how he saved his behavior. The mole men go down the shaft again. The end. <br /> <br /> Although the movie lasts only one hour, there is an inappropriate amount of crawling, herding and pursuing. I have omitted all "Mole-Man 1" from A to B. To look out that no one is following him. The mole men are never busy in any way - they have no dialogue - they just pop up, get chased and come back. They look a bit scary, but they are hardly the daring monsters that implies the city's response. Reeves is a pretty good Clark Kent - very much a hardened reporter, much more than Phyllis Coates' rather indifferent Lois Lane. But he is a terrible, terrible superman. Not only does he not look the part (at least his hair is dyed black, which is an improvement on the rather light hair he wore in some TV episodes), the way he plays is wrong in my book. I'm sure he was told to "strike the pose" (which Superman keeps on doing), but someone should have told him that it should be fists on his hips, not fists on his ribs. And he plays Superman as a pretty strict and sensitive schoolteacher - he does not really wave his finger, but he might as well have done it. <br /> <br /> And Superman walks around a lot (I say a huge amount - he's actually not that busy and a bit of running.) He takes off and lands a few times, but is not seen anywhere in the air Oh, some bullets bounce off of him and he uses telescopic vision as Clark, but no visual effect, in fact visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few that are present are not very good. <br /> <br / > I've tried to look at this effort in terms of the standards of the times: but even by these standards, I think it's a pretty flimsy effort, fortunately the production standards for the TV series were higher, and at least they did bothered to find stories that had a little more to offer. <br /> <br /> Something disappointing - I'm not looking back to it
