I've been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show. I had it set to record all the episodes because I thought I could really learn great new things. I could probably if I could get past Rachelle. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many of them will be staged to be like a reality show and to appeal to this class of spectators. It does not work for someone who is really interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This show should be called "Nagging with Rachelle". <br /> <br /> Since Ed is such a great font, maybe a second show that takes the environment very seriously would be a good idea. It is not necessary for some of us to undo things. <br /> <br /> I will not record episodes or watch the show, but let me know if a real green show is in progress.
