While some training scenes were realistic, too many of them portrayed military trainers as former Nazi types. Obviously, the people who wrote the script were either anti-military guys or made a movie for that audience, as some of them probably still do spent in the military prison. <br /> <br /> And I was really excited about the scene where the "hero" and his buddy (both private persons) are sitting in the captain's office, smoking cigarettes and talking to the captain as if he were their buddy , Such a thing never happened in training or in a formal situation, as was the purpose of the scene. In the end, I asked myself, "What was this movie about?" when it seemed to wander all around, with no focus except "I hate all authority". Thank god I got it from the library and did not pay to rent it.
