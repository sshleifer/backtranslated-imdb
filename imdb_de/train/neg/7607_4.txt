- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over and is determined to clean up the city. Not everyone in the city is happy with what she does. When the sheriff orders a curfew in the city, the local saloon owner (including a woman) hires a murderer who takes care of the sheriff. In no case could the owner of the limousine know that the sheriff and the murderer would fall in love. <br /> <br /> - The gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a pretty interesting concept and combine it with a bad execution. There is a good movie here trying to come out. In more capable hands or with a larger budget, Gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of the woman in the Old West. As it stands, Gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> - There are so many things that are out of line with the movie: a supportive cast without theatrical abilities, stilted and unnatural dialogues, and sets that look like sets. But the biggest culprit is the editing. I was amazed how many times a scene started with the actors (and horses) who were obviously waiting for Corman to call "Action". The best is the scene of two riders standing next to a building. Suddenly they take off and run around the corner, as if they had driven several miles hard. Or take the example of people who seem to be transported through the city. We see a man entering a building and appearing in the city a second later to board his horse. <br /> <br /> - It's not as if Corman has no decent actors to work with. Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were all able to perform well. But they do not have much work in Gunslinger. <br /> <br /> - I have now seen both the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I would strongly recommend the MST3K route.
