Could not go to sleep the other night. So I got up, turned the tube over and this movie started. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers bit more than they could chew. Just as ambitious as "Forrest Gump". But Gump read like a fairy tale in which an exceptionally happy man guides us through time. TGMB relies only on tired stereotypes to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway musical where the actors have to shake up. Each character had the purpose to fill a stupid archetype of the 60s. <br /> <br /> Come on as we meet Finnegan: hugging his black girl and getting a framed picture of MLK. Criminey, talk about hard hands. Why do not you just give him a T-shirt with the inscription "I Heart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Love is not great, man? Oh no, I did not have my period." <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not UCLA." Excuse me? LA was not square in the 1960s. Instead of taking the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, all we hear is that this brat whines about not going there. He was just a prop to show how racially tolerant the other kids are. <br/> <br /> It's true that historical plays do not have to be so cheesy. Take "dazed and confused". See how we meet football hero Randall Floyd. We do not see him first on the football field. In fact, we never see him playing football. We'll introduce him to the class and invite his nerdy poker friends to a party. <br /> <br /> In Dazed, feminism is not a coincidental by-product of a chick being crushed. It is much more organic, more serious than that. It was refined in the ladies' room during a flying discussion on Gilligan's Island. Serious ideas can grow in the most common settings. But real life is like that. <br /> <br /> Some of the heartfelt comments here say that the topics in this movie are still relevant. Exactly! That's why I'm so disappointed with this piece of baby boomer porn.
