Summary: Doctor Markov has developed a new theory of how to generate energy, knowledge that could bring the world out of balance. He keeps his knowledge secret and wants desperately from the Soviet Union. KGB, on the other hand, desperately wants the new technology. So you set a scheme in motion. During a rescue attempt to free Markov, KGB arrives, takes Markov to a secret location and lures him to divulge his secret by saying that they are in Sweden and working for the UN. KGB abducts Markov's estranged daughter as a backup. The CIA is now sending its best agents, a team of (Swedish?) Ninjas, to thwart KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter. The film is quite ambitious, but is missing in many areas. First of all, it is very dark, probably to hide places and bad effects that some scenes find difficult to understand. You can not see what happens. The second thing he misses is the martial arts, even though they are a ninja movie. Sure, there are some of fairly poor quality, but mostly the ninjas fire automatic rifles or explosions. The automatic guns are also a problem because they seemingly endlessly equipped with ammunition. And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets, while Soviet guards die like flies. <br /> <br /> What does that mean then? The idea and ambition come first. Some, especially for a Swedish movie, have decent action scenes, though not for martial arts. Some nice slow motion scenes and a lot of blood and blood. And some very interesting new weapons technologies that explode the victim's heart or brain. Mostly all the parts you are looking for in a B-movie. <br /> <br /> Since it's definitely a B-movie, there could not be a mistake made there. But if you expect it and watch it like a B-movie, it's entertaining. But remember, it's not just a B-movie playing in the eighties. Some girls, for example, except wearing ... say "interesting" clothes, have deadly doses of eye shadow and make-up. <br /> <br /> In all cases you will find information about cult status and ambition. Enjoy it and forget it then. <br /> <br /> 4/10
