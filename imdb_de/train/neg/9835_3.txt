Before I explain the "Alias" comment, I would like to say that "The Desert Trail" is bad even for western guests who stare at the "Three Stooges". In fact, Carmen Laroux is seen as a half-bad girl Juanita, if you hear her Mexican accent, you will immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita from the classic Stooge short film "Saved by the Belle". <br /> <br /> In "The Desert Trail" John Wayne plays the character of Moe Howard and Eddy Chandler plays Curly Howard. Like her Stooge colleagues, Moe is a continuous gag in the 53-minute film that Curly beats. Wayne's character, a rock chasing a tyrant, is not particularly endearing, but should be the good guy. <br /> <br /> Playing a rodeo rodeo cowboy Wayne holds the rodeo cash register in front of the gun and takes away the prize money he would have won if the attendance had been good - the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the Racetrack are worth the dollar (actually even less, after Wayne robbed the box office). There is no explanation for Wayne, who rips off the riders and is still considered the hero who gets the girl. <br /> <br /> Things get complicated at this point as the villain (Al Ferguson) and his buddy Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix - who would later play sheriff Micah in "The Rifleman") watch Wayne Rob see the cashier and steal the rest of the money and kill the rodeo manager. Moe and Curly are being charged. <br /> <br /> So Moe and Curly move to another city to get rid of the law and they change their name to Smith and Jones. Whom they meet first, but their old friend Larry, whose sister falls in love in the second half (Senorita Rita stays in the old town and makes no further appearances in the film). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister is raised by the radiantly beautiful Mary Kornman (nowadays, but at a young age she was one of the original members of the band "Our Gang" by Hal Roach). Kornman is the main reason to see the Mega Lame Western, and their scenes with Moe and Curly are far better than any of the others in production, as if they were using a completely different crew to film them. <br /> <br /> Also for 1935 the action sequences in this case are extremely weak and the technical film is amazingly bad. The two main scenes end with footage of a rider who falls off a horse. In both cases, the editor cuts off a shot of one of the characters rolling on the floor, but there is no horse in the picture, the footage is completely different and the figure has different clothes than the stunt driver. Elsewhere, stock footage is used liberally, and no one can convince. <br /> <br /> One thing to watch out for is a scene in the middle of the movie where Moe and Curly get on their horses and drive away from a cabin (to the right) while the group galloped from left to the cabin. The cameraman follows the two Stooges with a slow turn to the right and then makes a whip to the left to show the approaching group. Outside of home videos, I've never seen anything like that, not because it looks stupid (which it does), but because a competent director would never stage a scene this way. They film the two drivers as they leave, reposition the camera and film the approaching group as a separate action. Or if they felt creative, they would stage the sequence with the camera showing the drivers in the foreground and the farce in the background. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
