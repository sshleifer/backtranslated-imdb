Thank god I saw that with a friend and did not pay for it. The plot is terribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a television program. If you are familiar with computers or electronics, take care. You will feel that the movie is an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> The actress also set up Much Music. VJ Amanda Walsh shows the worst acting I've ever seen except porn. She's lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent. He is the one who wears the movie. <br /> <br /> I hate that I wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie! It's a shame that they call it a sequel because I was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.
