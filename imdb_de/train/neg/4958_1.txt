Not only did they misunderstand the characters, not only do the voices not only suck, the writers not only seriously need girlfriends, not only are the drawings really rough, but it seems they were created primarily for ages 1-6. The only episode I've ever seen was "A Mattter Of Family" because I liked the Robin character. And sometimes I think it's just a general copy of Batman The Animated Series. Example: In BTAS Bruce is friends with Harvey Dent, yes? In a story with two episodes, he transforms into the unlikely villain TwoFace. In the "Show," Bruce transforms with this Ethan guy and over two episodes, he turns into the unlikely villain ClayFace. That was just a small example (that may not even be true), but in a nutshell, this is the BAD attempt of a Batman series. And that says something.
