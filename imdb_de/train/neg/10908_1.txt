NOTHING in this movie is funny. I found the premise of giving a man the libido of a horny contradiction interesting and should cause some laughter. NOT CORRECT! The movie just does not have fun. For example, the main character passing by a goat that's hot in the middle of a cottage garden is not funny, but borders on obscenity. They play bestial in this movie on one level and it's just not funny. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs will eat anything, anytime. The main character who does this with anything, anywhere, anytime is not funny either. It becomes a clich√©. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is, I think, acceptable in the role. By that I mean that he is not a bad actor, but with lazy material it is difficult to comment on the quality. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of HUMAN's romantic leads (does one count the number of animals that the main character is interested in as romantic leads?), Seems embarrassing by the whole thing. She seems to be moving in a kind of vacuum, separate from all other actors in the film. <br /> <br /> Watch this film only if you want to be bored with tasteless, boring, repetitive material.
