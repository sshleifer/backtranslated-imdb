There was a Bugs Bunny cartoon titled "Baby Buggy Bunny" that was EXACTLY this plot. With the baby face, Finster had robbed a bank, and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into Bug's hare hole. He dressed as a baby to get into Bugg's hole to get the money. The scene in "Little Man", in which he looks in the bathroom mirror and shaves with a cigar in his mouth, is straight out of the cartoon. This was a funny 5-minute cartoon; not so much a whole movie. If you are really interested, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. It was much more original at the first time (1954). You also get even more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons!
