(Verderber) The only truly memorable part of this otherwise boring and lukewarm British kitchen is Steiner's Henna Conditioner, one of the worst dye jobs ever. That and the gorgeous caterpillar eyebrows at the old bad guy who was trying to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K admirably makes a damn boring and gray movie funny. I especially like it when Crow kills Mike with his "Touch of Death" and when he revives him in the theater, Mike cries. "Guys, I was dying, I saw eternal truth and beauty! Oh, it's this movie ..." That would be a let down if you had to return from beyond to see the rest of The Projected Man. The movie could make a fortune selling it as a sleep aid. Some of the puns in the movie were evil: Police Inspector - "Electric Shock!" Crow- "Shocking, is not it?" Police Inspector- "That's LOwe, all right" Tom Servo- "Very low, at the very bottom of the ground!" Police Inspector- "Can I get on?" Tom Servo "He's Dead, But Get Out" MST3K is definitely the only way to watch this Snoozer.
