STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening * Monday morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey before the name became synonymous with the name) Character in Die Simpsons) is a (typically) unorthodox policeman who gets results, but his superiors wound up something rotten. Instead of killing his partner's clich√© at the beginning of the movie, the plot takes a different turn instead and sees him traveling to Mexico, where a top-secret American super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities has just been smuggled along with the Crew being taken hostage by a group of terrorists. <br /> <br /> This cheap-looking, boring action movie (even for the 80s) was a bizarre career move for Gary Busey after he left an impression on the flame-haired villain Mr. Joshua in Lethal Weapon. He goes through the motions only with his cardboard character here, as nervous and crazy as ever (though Butthorn is his trademark for the bad guys), but without the material that supports him. Henry Silva is a Screen villain, but he is here as an Arab leader (in a red beret!) Completely misplaced, and the terrible script gives him some really rickety, boring dialogues that make his performance seem ridiculously wooden. He is just one of many acting actors, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick appear but do not add anything to the mix. After a boring first half without a lot of exciting action, things take a little bit over at the end, but it is not too late and none of this creates the task of having fun. *
