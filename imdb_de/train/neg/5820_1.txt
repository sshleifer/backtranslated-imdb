This movie is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I study French in college and thus understand all the dialogues, so the language barrier was not a problem. I have to say that it's really hard to empathize with the characters portrayed in the movie. There is only one professional actor in the cast, and I suspect there are no professional directors or writers. <br /> <br /> Although I rated it at 1 in 10, it probably does not deserve such a bad rating. This is just a futile effort to reduce the current overall rating from 7.3 to something more realistic. Possibly 4.3 would be a more accurate rating, since the movie is a real non-event event of about 100 minutes in length that you'll never get back its nut shattered, a movie twice as good and half as long. However, if you want to join the bandwagon that seems to be shooting around IMDb, you might as well give "Lost in Translation" a 10.
