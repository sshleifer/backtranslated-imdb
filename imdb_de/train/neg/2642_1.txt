Slow, slow, slow ... There is no mystery or excitement in this film. If you can not figure out who the "mole" is in the first ten minutes, you must be brain dead. The secret service must have been too, because he needed the whole movie to put it together. There are no compelling characters in the movie (not film). The tempo of the movie is slow, there are no tensions. The hired killer is an excellent shot, unless he targets Michael Douglas, as he can only hit large slices. The funniest scene in the movie is when the president's wife says the codeword at the anticlimactic end. It is loudly ridiculous. At least six people got up early and left the movie. I would have joined them if I had not sat in the middle of the series. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
