A woman asks for advice on the street to reach a mysterious city, and hears two gruesome stories from the local spinner, both associated with zombies. But maybe fate has something bad in store for them too ... <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles are absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, I must confess, it was so bad that I had gone through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It only takes 69 minutes and there are still tons of filler. You get a few skinheads doing a lot of push-ups, lots of boring, kissy kisses between stupid teenagers (the rhymed, tee-hee) and some good examples of why some people should never become actors. <br /> <br /> As for the title characters, they hardly have a footnote in the film. Why do you get more undead action in the intro than with the previous feature! Considering how pitifully eyes are blasted out of the eye sockets and eating brains (among other "joys"), this may be a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> And to top it off, it looks like it may have been filmed on someone's cell phone for transfer to Youtube. Jerky camera work, scratches on the print, flickering lights ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that it was made in 2001, not 1971. Even the clothes and the design look three decades old-fashioned! <Br /> <br /> If you think that I am unable to rate Chronicles that have not seen the full movie then go ahead. YOU try to get through, I guess you will not make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie-colored freaks before you make excuses and go. It's really ridiculous that everyone decided to go public, and frankly it will be much more fun to rest his drink on the CD than to torment the DVD player with this giggling apology for horror. Do not be surprised if you pack your bags and sheets in the morning and you are damned to see VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. What kind of 18-note horror does the woman have during the compulsory sex scene with a massive sports bra ?! See, the movie can not even get that part right ...
