I detested this movie. The original Phantasm had such a wonderful ambience and mystery. Like many seventies horror movies, it looked and felt like a scary, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 80's, pushed the action, but kept that nice attention to the mood. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is just awful. It tediously explains all the strange events in the previous films, reducing their power rather than increasing it. It shamelessly degrades images from the first phantasm like a cheap reenactment of the original. There are so many flying bullets in this movie that they look more like household pests than menacing death globes. Hundreds hang from the ceiling like Christmas balls swaying in the train. Did anyone - the prop master, the DP, the editor, the director - notice or care that they looked so mean? Even worse, Phantasm III presents a stupid, listless joke after another. How different is the intensity of the first film? The original phantasm used humor to relieve his relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to make countless cheap jokes about Reggie's horniness: some refer to the film's "flying balls". Maybe the crew got a kick with these jokes, but they have it on us.
