With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly one of the most idiotic movies ever made. The point is that ship waiter Shecky (Sandler) wants to be a comedian on the cruise ship. First, there is not a funny or smart line throughout the movie, frankly. It's so funny it's pathetic. There is surprisingly little gross or sexual humor, but the F-word is abundant. The budget is really low and that also ruins the movie. It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only have money to rent a small boat and only have money for 10 ship extras. The opening credits are cheap and animated, and it's just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else who sees it will hate it too. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. R for language.
