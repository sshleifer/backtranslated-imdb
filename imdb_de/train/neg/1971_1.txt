This movie is deeply disappointing. Not only does Wenders have a very limited musical spectrum of blues, it is also his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings to film that makes watching and listening absolutely boring. The only highlight of the film is the interview with a Swedish couple who talked to J.B. Lenoir had friends and shows his private video material and tells stories. Wender's introduction to the cinematic theme starts very interestingly - he alludes to world culture (or indeed American culture) traveling in space, but his limited view of the subject as well as the hilarious and extremely fascinating reproduction of stories from the 1930s Make this movie significantly as a sleep aid. Yawning. I had expected more from him.
