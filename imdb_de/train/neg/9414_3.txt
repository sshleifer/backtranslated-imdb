Despite the recognition on the DVD sleeve of the borrowed version, this film was a disappointment. Yes, it is far more realistic than other wartime films of that time to depict the mud, boredom, and frustration of the grunt, but unfortunately, you get away from it and think that EVERYTHING is about this film. There is no conspiracy and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not like a good war movie has to have a fight scene every five minutes. One of the best World War II films, Twelve O'Clock High, has very little action. But it compensates with crackling dialogues and mental tensions. The exception to "The Story of G. I. Joe" is a short battle section (on the DVD entitled "City Under Siege"), which takes place in Italy. Granted, it's one of the fastest and most compelling battle scenes of a war movie. But the rest of the movie is worthwhile not only for this highlight. Another turnoff is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is supposed to be a "Romeo" but does not go for a pervert. Sgt. Warnicki is a sympathetic, if faulty, man. How he got to Capt. Walker (Mitchum) says, as he volunteers for another patrol: "Every step forward is one step closer ... home." But the last step? one patrol too many? drives him over the mental edge. Too bad that the rest of the movie does not do justice to some otherwise subtle accents. Meredith's depiction of Pyle is practically comatose.
