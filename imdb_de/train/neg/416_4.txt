(some spoilers) - as if you did not know how it will turn out <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, and a very interesting topic - Invisibility. Every requirement for a great movie has been fulfilled. Unfortunately, these things did not matter at all. The movie was very stress-free for a week and terribly predictable. <br /> <br /> It's about a bunch of scientists who have discovered invisibility. After the tests on animals were successful, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself. Once invisible, it completely changes and recognizes the benefits of not being seen. From this murder there is a very thin line. Hollow Man is a sick movie. It suffers from the disease that many new films have: the special effects. From a challenging theme that could have led the producers to a thrilling psychological thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything that focuses on special effects without worrying about the actual value of the movie. I have to admit, the FX are fantastic, probably the best I've seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a movie good. That's actually the problem with today's movies. As with Verhoeven, most directors only care about spectacular scenes - and nothing more. Exceptions are very few, and probably Matrix is ​​the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great action. <br /> <br /> After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven disappoints again. Instead of a great movie, HM cr * p. There are only two reasons why you might see this movie: 1. The special effects 2. The joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I will not spoil this moment for you ...) <br /> <br /> Okay, what So went wrong with the movie? Everything. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> <br /> --- It's not tense at all. It should have been, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- It's too predictable. They know from the beginning who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven cares only about the effects. <br /> <br /> - - a lot of clichés. <br /> <br /> --- Of course, the villain wakes up a few times before he dies. <br /> <br /> --- Just like any low-quality horror, the first rule is to let characters be separated as much as possible. Every time someone is alone in the lab, a perfect sacrifice for Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the plot. Example: At the beginning, Bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab. After being invisible, how can he do that? <br /> <br /> --- The end: absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> --- After Shue hits Bacon in the head, Bacon drops to the floor. Then Shue and Brolin leave softly and slowly, without looking back. Is that normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, they "kill" him again. And then Shue yells "I heard an explosion" (happened a few minutes ago) and they suddenly run into it. Did not she hear this explosion some time ago? <br /> <br /> --- There is a scene where you can see the microphones above the actors. Come on, Mr. Verhoeven, I expected much more from you! <br /> <br /> So that's all about Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a great movie became a scam. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10 (for the special effects)
