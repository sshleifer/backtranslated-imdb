This garbage excuse for television is the most horrible garbage that ever hit Australian television. The roommates are boring, uninteresting, ridiculously unintelligent, and are selected so that you would probably try to murder them if you had to live with them. For me, Big Brother is the downfall of Western society, showing that as a society we are taking a steep slope to becoming brain-slacking idiots. What happened to television that was not aimed at the lowest common denominator of society as an audience? This can not be classified as entertainment. I think it is true that Channel Ten can remove your soul. It happened to Rove McManus, who was once a respectable comedian and became terribly frustrated after moving to Channel 10. Except for the Simpsons, which are made very smart.
