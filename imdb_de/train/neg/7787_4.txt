This is one of the films that is more interesting from an academic point of view than from the entertainment perspective. I make my ratings based on how much I enjoyed or entertained the movie, so I give it a 4th. But if I rated it as an academic movie, it would get a 10. </ It is filmed in a very interesting way, like a pseudo-silent movie with elements of sound effect and reality. It is meant to convey disjointed memory and fragmentation of the mind, and it is interesting in this regard. <br /> <br /> However, the movie has many vile elements that I find less entertaining. They are mainly disturbing. It also has some very interesting pictures and some interesting concepts, but some of the character relationships (especially between mother and son) are quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film will either appeal to you or it will not be interesting for me academically, but it was not a good watch, and I probably will not come back to it a second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you are looking for entertainment. 10/10 from an academic perspective.
