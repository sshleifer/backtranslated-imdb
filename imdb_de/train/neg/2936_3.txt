Also I was fascinated by the high rating (8.5) for this movie and was very disappointed. I had just seen some good foreign films and was looking forward to doing it three in a row, but it was not meant to be. I went with a Spanish-speaking friend who felt the same way. There is no big conspiracy, if that. I do not really need that in a movie, but it has to entertain or bring me somehow. The best thing I could say is that it's an old-fashioned movie, albeit with a very small ensemble. Sure, there are moments, but a few moments can easily be thinned out by 97 slow minutes of nothing. I do not understand the high rating for this movie. I give him a 3rd. <br /> <br />
