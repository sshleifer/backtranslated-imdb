Sorry, all of you, I know that this should be an "art" movie, but wow, you should have given weapons at the show so people could blow their brains out and not watch. Although the scene design and photographic orientation were excellent, this story is too painful to see. The lack of a soundtrack was brutal. The long beats were too long. How long can you watch two people sitting and talking? Especially when the dialogue is complaining to two people. It was really hard for me to get through this movie. The performances have been excellent, but how much of this dark, dark, unimaginative stuff can you take with you? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise this was a rip-off from Bergman. And I'm not a fan of his. I think anyone who says he has enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of it is "lying".
