I can not understand all the hype surrounding this movie. OK, if you like cheap splatter, you'll love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors, do not look at it. Personally, I really did not like the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired directly from the street. The dialogues are completely flat and you always know what's next. The overall quality of this film lacks the supposedly very low budget. When we saw this movie (me and three other people), we all had in mind that this movie was made by some people who had to do this, just to get their degree from a film school - with the least amount of effort. Another problem that really reduces the overall experience is the bad camera (very blurry) and the bad sound. The entire movie seems to be recorded with a single microphone.
