This is something of a low-budget movie made for television to boost the success of the original. I'm a fan of B-movies, and this movie might have been good if it did not have the name "Cube" attached, because the director and plot of the original was better, and this movie ruined my movie's taste for the entire series. The characters are annoying and clich√©d, there are problems with continuity and some real production mistakes. Due to superfluous dialogues, history hardly gets a chance to develop and suffers. They use more or less the same horror gimmicks and OVER throughout the movie, and because the first one was so good, that just turns out to be disappointing. <br /> <br /> If this is a standalone b-movie, I would probably give it over four. The rating "1" I forgive here was pretty much a statement about how the effects and intelligence faded completely compared to the first one.
