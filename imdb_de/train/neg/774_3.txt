This movie seems to have been made by someone who had some good ideas, but who had never made a movie before and did not think a script should be edited or even funny. When I saw this movie, I saw it for John Candy and mistakenly assumed that it would be funny. Instead, there was a stupid conspiracy of thought control and so many flat, undisturbed moments. And to top it off, Candy had delivered some of the cruelest lines I'd heard before. Despite a potentially witty cast and a story idea, we still have an amateurish and rude film that is probably too stupid for an average adult, though teenagers are likely to find some laughter. It's really a shame - it could have been so much better. I mean, Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy SHOULD have been wonderful.
