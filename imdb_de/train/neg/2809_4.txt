When I look back on my college days at Ohio University, there will always be an event to remember with good memories. Channel 23 is the OU's local access channel, and in the last few years, pretty much everything they've been broadcasting has been played. That included a lot of DIY movies, from a guy making microwaved marshmallow peeps and then scanning pictures online, to a version of Macbeth's 8th grade that just seemed to be learning how to do Squibs. In my opinion, Midnight Skater from the occupation of channel 23. The first time I saw it was at 2 o'clock in the morning. I should have learned. Or sleep. Or watch TV regularly. But no, that's all for pussies. My roommate and I saw Midnight Skater, and when it was done, I do not think any of us thought any of the movies had just happened. But surely it was a few nights later, and we realized that this movie actually existed. <br /> <br /> I could always talk about how awful it is, but it's the kind of fear that makes life worth living. The action is disjointed, the terrible action, everything that shakes the soul, but when God observes others with you, it is impossible to have no good time for it. It's like the first time you hear "Guts" by Chuck Pahalniuk. You hear it, you are disgusted and shaken, but five minutes later, all you want and desire is to experience the other evil horror that you have just endured. Long story short Midnight skater All his epic flaws make for a very late night fun. Also, I really want the theme to Midnight Skater. Kudos to the one who wrote and sang it. Sweet god, I love this song.
