I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing it, maybe I'll go back to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has some novel story elements, though it never really gets that interesting. This movie has all the features created for the drive-in theater market - ultra-low budget, amateur drama and a liberal dose of sex (for a movie of the early 1960's). In fact, I wonder if the movie was made because it was fast money making and because someone knew he could use some strippers as extras. The film is about a crazy doctor who wants to transplant the severed head of his girlfriend onto the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most potential donors are skanky strippers or models whose sole purpose in the film is to tickle as they strip off most of their clothing. However, they stop too much to make the movie worth seeing even for the naughty ones, and the movie is not really terrible enough to earn the reputation of bad movie fans.
