I recently saw this on a faded old VHS cassette and faintly remembered it. If you look at it now, it seems charming. <br /> <br /> When it was released, it was recognized by just about everyone as a parody of coming out as a gay teenager. To bring the point home, the mother reads a paperback copy of "1 Teenager In 10," the most popular book of the time. David Warner plays it as a persecuted vampire hunter, which of course is a hateful case. The list of visible jokes and jokes that made sure no-one missed the point would be too long to respond. The producers had a good-natured fun and doubtless hoped to brighten and enlighten. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea how a young audience would view this movie today. In some places where education and culture take place, the terrible torments that gay teenagers have been through are a thing of the past. But I'm sure there are many dark, uncomfortable corners on our continent where it's just as bad as ever.
