When a friend told me "12 Amazing Scifi / Horror Movies!" I was understandably a bit cautious. However, since the product was a gift, I did not really pay much attention to common sense. After all .... movies for free! What if they are a bit rude? After much deliberation, Alien Intruder was the first of these films. Ironically, it was the first choice because it looked the best. All I can say is, if this is the best of them, I shudder at the thought of what the rest looks like. <br /> <br /> Superficially, it had some good things to offer. Four (Count 'em!) Actors who were familiar to me. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I told myself ... "Billy and Tracy were some good scifi players (Star Wars and Babylon 5), so they did not want to sign up for a turkey Max is a seasoned soap actor who never really gets into the movie could .... but not too bad an actor A Jeff ... well ... he did the good and the bad when it comes to movies and TV. "I soon discovered that Jeff had decided," the ugly "to add to his repertoire of films. <br /> <br /> The first hint was in the opening scenes. Jeff enthusiastically rummages through an "I'm mad" scene before killing himself. Really an amusing cameo performance. Unfortunately, this is without much exaggeration, the highlight of the film. From there it goes downhill. <br /> <br /> Next we have the mission commander (Williams) sent to see what happened to Jeff and his crew watching his new shipmates from the ranks of ... the criminal element. But this assortment is not so much the Dirty Dozen - more like the unconvincing foursome. In addition, one of the illusions, a computer hacker, is shown in his cell on a laptop computer. Is not that a bit like letting a killer operate a gun shop in the truce? Pretty lame prison, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> When they finally go away, the effects are really terrible. It looks like the spaceship model collided one afternoon with a bored 8-year-old with parts of his Airfix kits left over. <br /> <br /> But the horror does not stop there. On the way to the area where Jeff's ship had disappeared, the criminal crew was rewarded for their good behavior by getting virtual reality on weekends, giving in to their male fantasies. All the best, and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the "alien menace" that begins there. But did they have to pull it out for such a long life? Alien intruder? Alien Boring, rather like. <br /> <br /> Finally they make it to the G-Sector and the alien presence lets them fight for their affection until only the good old Max is left. The end, in really optimistic rubbish film, indicates a sequel - as if! An appearance in this movie is also a character that I call "Sweatdroid". He's supposed to be an android, but apparently that was lost to the make-up crew, who provided him with sweaty features on every occasion. But do not worry, he's just there to put together the numbers for the body count. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins, to be honest, do very little in the film. They just stay awake, let alone act. And as I mentioned earlier, Jeff gets showered early, so his manicure does not tell much about the movie. Max tries his best, as do a few other actors, but the movie is just cruel, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The only but only halfway imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship naming convention. They are all named after musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the movie is boring and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Made in 1992, I thought, when I first watched it was one of those 80s video games. Looks like they made crap movies in the 90s, it seems. <br /> <br /> It is best to avoid it. Even as a beer and chips movie, this film is a stinker, but at least you can fast forward it, I suppose.
