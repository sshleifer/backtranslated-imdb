A friend told me about John Fante last summer after talking about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite author of Bukowski - an author with similar humor and humor, except one generation before. "Ask the Dust" was the first Fante book I read, and remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece about a sad, frightened young writer who introduced himself and the outside world as a cocky, masterfully gifted author who had no idea how to write about the experiences of the real world of which he had none. In the novel, the protagonist is a virgin, not knowing how to win the graces of women about whom he desperately wants to write in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, as he enters for his first sexual experience with a "wounded" admirer, and how he eventually leaves with nothing but the story of his failed attempts to love is biting and real without touching Hollywood end. Although the film remains true to the book for a while, it snakes its way into the cinematic trap of love that endures through racism, illness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is an idiot and Camilla is crazy, and her love was and is never the real thing, no matter how much they both wanted to find each other. This film broke the true meaning of the story and replaced it with Schlock. I can not believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that went so wrong.
