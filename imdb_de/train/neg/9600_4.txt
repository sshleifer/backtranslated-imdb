Very strange, but occasionally elegant recovery movie with no real story, but benefits from its stunning leading actress and a handful of cute, gruesome make-up effects. Daniella is a pretty twenty-year-old girl who carries the trauma of rape at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her to believe that she is the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf. She kills her brother-in-law during a nocturnal encounter and is hospitalized. However, she escapes again and accidentally devours more men on the run for police officers, doctors and relatives. It's all nice to watch and hear (really great soundtrack), but the lack of action and continuity quickly becomes irritating. Fortunately, lead actress Annik Borel rarely wears clothes and fills in the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire. The movie is too long, too funny and forgotten. The biggest surprise comes at the end when director Rino Di Silvestro suddenly and out of the blue tries to believe that his film is based on true facts. Yes exactly...
