It was supposed to be the last Freddy movie (and more than 10 years) - you'd think they were trying to make a good movie. But it turned out they gave us the worst of the series (and that says a lot). The plot made no sense (I can not really remember it), all the main characters were idiots (you REALLY wanted to see them dead) and Freddy's wisdom was even worse than usual. The only good thing about this was a short (and funny) cameo Johnny Depp (the first "Nightmare" movie was his first movie) (Freddy's childhood reaccounting) was in 3D. Well, the 3D view was moderately faded colors and the picture was out of focus and out of focus. Even the three flying skulls, which were supposed to be scary (I think), had the opposite reaction of my audience. Everyone laughed. Looks even worse on TV in 2D. Senseless and stupid - very boring. Skip this and see "Freddy vs. Jason" again.
