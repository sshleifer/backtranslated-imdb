I have read several good reviews that have defended and criticized the various aspects of this film. I keep seeing trouble with Megan, the idealistic political scientist trying to change the world. I loved her character. Maybe because I'm a 23-year political science student and I think I'm going to change the world too, so I'm referring to Megan. Besides, she is cute. She is not a supermodel, but rather a sweet girl next door. <br /> <br /> OK, so she cried and screamed a lot. It is very dramatic and seems exaggerated, but does not fit with her character? She goes to this show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point. She finds people who like such a show sick. I think she was arguing very well. As a young na√Øve girl, she is naturally afraid of what she has to look at. I think that she is exactly a young girl who shows moral courage despite her overwhelming fear. I also believe that, despite the desperate condition she was in, she has retained a certain dignity throughout the film. <br /> <br /> As for the film in general, apart from Megan, it was pretty much what I expected. It had excellent Gore scenes, compared to micro-budget standards. The plot might have a brief thought, hardly a reflection. It's basically just a dark, humorous, pointless Slasher movie the name implies. I love the sadism of the doctor. He tore off Megan's shirt again and again, not only for the cause of Sleaze (though largely), but to torment her before he killed her. The chainsaw hick was hilarious. For Slasher movie lovers he was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 10 points. He had a good backdrop, almost no plot and a mix of good and horrible drama. I would recommend it for a cheap thrill, but hardly a diamond in the rough, which is micro-budget horror.
