This is not only my verdict on this film, but also about most of what has been written about it. Do not get me wrong, I'm not a total philistine, I did not hate the movie because it was not enough like 'Police Academy 9' or whatever, I enjoy more than my good forehead or Arty stuff, I swear. <br /> <br /> 'Magnolia' is poor and I'm honestly a mystery why it seems to be so highly praised. Lengthy, selfish, wafting nonsense from beginning to end, there is so little that it could be believable what people love about the movie so much. There are some high profile actors who are fair enough, and no one shows average or worse performance. Also, my wife (a self-confessed hatred of Tom Cruise) tells me that it's his career that is far and away performing the best. But the plot is so completely disconnected that it moves back and forth between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail's pace that even when significant events that change lives are portrayed, they seem so pointless and uninteresting They're screaming for someone who's going to get blown up or something. <br /> <br /> It does not help that none of the characters can easily identify or empathize (well, I do not think so, but I do not like most people). They all elaborate on their rather insecure life stories, demonstrating their character weaknesses and emotions in ever-so-complicated details, and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to some degree. Yadda Yadda Yadda. Also, the soundtrack is terrible, with that brand-whispering, irritating quality that I had previously found unique for the music of Alanis Morisette. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was about three hours so enjoyable that they were forced to watch a series of "friends" as they were intermittently poked in the ribs by a grumpy goat. The little bit with the frogs is good.
