Has anyone edited this movie? Or was it just the DVD release that had huge thirty-second gaps between the scenes? It's okay, but I fell asleep the first time. Then I fell asleep for the second time and fell asleep the third time. Actually, the plot is not the worst I've ever seen, but it's in short supply. Acting is not the worst I've ever seen ... but it's close. The production .... well, I can honestly say it was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life! Not trying to be malicious, but Unhinged could have needed a bit more production. <br /> <br /> Please do not think that I am a hatred of horror movies or that I did not like this movie. I just had the feeling that I was laughing a lot more about the film than feeling like laughing with it. The cruel moments were not made too bad, but could have been better on a tight budget. The characters seemed awkward or they ignored everything, the end of the spins was pretty bad and the depiction took forever without much to show. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
