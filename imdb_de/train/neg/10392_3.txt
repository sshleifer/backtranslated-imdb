I'm not going to engage in a plot because you know what the movie is about, and there's almost no action anyway. I've seen several reviewers call ISOYG an "anti-rape" movie or even a feminist statement, and I just have to include the annoying hypocrisy of those allegations. <br /> <br /> First of all, what to do? We see on the cover of this movie? Right: a well-formed woman is behind. Whether Zarchi's attempt to file an anti-rape statement - and I do not believe it at all - is completely irrelevant. The film is marketing sex and the trembling of sexual assault, and the material is so graphic (everything except the actual penetration is shown) that NONE, but the hard core exploitation will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The rape (s) in the movie is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to see. There is something to be said in presenting such a terrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on apparently for 30 minutes, none. There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is somewhat developed (just moments before being murdered), so the scene does not move at all on an emotional level. Actually, it's only shown to show extreme sexual violence, and you can see from the movies that ISOYG is linked to IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that only attracts the exploitative population. <br /> <br /> Finally, some reviewers have praised Zarchi's so-called documentary style and the lack of a soundtrack. But considering how incapable everything else is in the film (drama, script, etc.), I suspect that these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because it literally has a camera stationed and its porn actresses do their thing /> <br /> I will not deal with my high horse and talk about the contents of ISOYG. I'm all for exploitation / horror and love video villains. In fact, I only give this movie three stars, because it really pushes the envelope as far as other films. But it's also done badly and after the rape has taken place it's just boring for the rest of the movie while we watch a lot of ho-hum, mostly bloodless murders and wait until the credits roll. <br /> <br This is probably worth a look if you're a 1970s hardcore fan, but I'll tell you, the film is pretty bad overall and is not really worth its notorious reputation.
