This step reminded me of stories from the crypt keeper. It has the same idea of ​​people, what they deserve. I think those are always the ones in a crypt story. The same goes for bad acting. Very bad spectacle. I enjoyed the movie and knew that most people did not like it and I did not expect much. When I watch a Stephen King movie, I do not expect much, as all his films are horrible compared to the genius of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I think it's great that Carrie looked like it was a real story and the whole book is a bunch of stories and theories. It was so good. I noticed, however, that both novels did not resemble the films. The endings were very different from the movie versions. I start from these two novels that all his novels are changed a lot and the ending is always cheesy. The end of Thinner is the worst. So cheesy. I want to read the book to find out the true end. I recommend anyone who wants to read the novels of Stephen King to see his films beforehand so that you can compare him. And so you will be very happy in the book. I intend to do this with all his novels that were made into films. I'm sure if they were made into films, they were really good books ... and the script was terribly wrong.
