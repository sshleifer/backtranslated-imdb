WARNING! This review shows the end of the movie "Scoop". If you do not want to know how the movie ends, do not read this report! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad that you think that "Annie Hall" was a coincidence. <br /> <br /> It gets a star because you can see Hugh Jackman's bare chest. That's the only thing "Scoop" is up to. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's misogyny, and his fixation on women who are young enough to be his granddaughter at the time, has had the ability to make films restricted at some point. <br /> <br /> The plot seems promising: One ghost, Ian McShane, instructs the fuzzy student Scarlett Johansson to investigate whether an English Lord, Hugh Jackman, is the infamous tarot, or not card-killer of prostitutes , A magician, Woody Allen, helps the girl. <br /> <br /> Despite the promising plot, the film lacks charm, humor or atmosphere. It's a surprisingly leaden, amateurish effort for someone who has made a previous film, no matter how many. Maybe Allen had a stroke that was not mentioned in the press. <br /> <br /> Much is said that Woody Allen, who is now a seventeen-year-old, unlike his previous films, FINALLY allowed a younger male lead role to get the girl. <br /> <br /> Not so. In fact, the plot is constructed so that the girl does not get anyone. <br /> <br /> There is an early scene in which Johansson gets drunk central for the movie without reason. and seduced by a powerful, older director. "Seduced" is a euphemism for what happens. It's kind of "Slam, bam, I have to go". It is unrelated to the plot and cheapens Johansson in the eye of the beholder. Why did Allen add this unnecessary scene to the movie? Because it shows that a powerful director - like Allen - has sex with the female lead. Allen also gets his cake and eats it. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not yet an actress. She does not know how to command the screen unless she wears a tight, low-cut top. She mimics Allen in a few scenes, and that just looks weird and sad. <br /> <br /> It does not help that her character is written as a doll that can not function without a ghost or the elderly and less than an impressive magician who tells her what to do on every corner. <br /> <br /> She is about half her age as Jackman, and she seems to be a very vague screen presence in their shared scenes. <br /> <br /> Spectators who are not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines, and Jackman deserves better too - a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and authority, and an actress that conveys those qualities can. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman gets cheated on the script in a similar way. Everyone obviously does not like the fact that Jackman is so incredibly handsome and young, and he gives Jackman nothing to say or do. Like Johansson, he is only used for his good looks. That's a pity, because, as Jackman has shown in any number of productions, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men," he CAN bargain. <br /> <br /> Here's the big story - Jackman, suave, charming English Lord, is really a killer. Although the movie says it's all about someone other than Allen getting the girl, she does not get anyone. Jackman, the man she fell in love with, is a man who has murdered a prostitute. Fine, Woody. A great way to punish your heroine because you are out of reach. In an aggressive aggressive touch, Allen robs his heroine as well as his own presence by killing his character, the Magician, and Scarlett Johansson all leaves alone at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> One final note: At my show, not a single viewer laughed at any point in the movie. Always a bad sign when a movie is advertised as a comedy.
