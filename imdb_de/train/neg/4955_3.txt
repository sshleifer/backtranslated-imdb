Given the recent and rather good Batman of the Bold and Courageous, now is the time to make a fatal blow to this flaw in Batman's life. As a big fan since the first revival of Tim Burton 20 years ago, I have been able to accept different tonalities in the character, Dark or Campy. This is just not believable: too many effects, bad intrigues and so few questions. What's great about Batman is the variety of his abilities and aspects of his personality: detective, crime fighter, playboy, philanthropist, etc. The Batman shows him only in his karate days. And how is it that the penguin is capable of such virtuosity when he jumps into the air, despite his vast abundance? And look at the Joker, a mix of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and a stereotypical reggae man, which Batman fan could accept such a betrayal? Not me anyway. Batman is much better without "The" article in front of his name.
