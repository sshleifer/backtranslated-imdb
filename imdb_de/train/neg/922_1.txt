This movie is exactly what you get when you really overstretch your skills. It's like someone who has just passed the driving test and then placed in a Formula 1 Grand Prix (not I would like to add the US Grand Prix as it can all because of short-lived tires and you could just win ), so short is this movie. Do not take this wrong, I love B-movies, about half of my collection is B-movies, but I do not think the alphabet contains enough letters to describe how bad this movie is. <Br /> <br /> First, the story (for a B-movie) is not so bad, it has the potential to make a B-Movie brand, not Friday's 13th potential, but still from Potential. But what really letting this movie down is acting. At no second I believe something. It's like watching QVC, except that the moderators of QVC have a stronger tan. <br /> <br /> In conclusion I would like to say that I have seen worse movies, but I can not.
