One of the worst movies I've ever seen with bad camera, crappy filter, movie was grainy, script was awful, I mean, come on, how predictable was the big fight in the end ... Some of the fight scenes were okay. I think some scenes were so bad that it was weird ... like Sorbo getting the horse in the end and riding in the end ... LOL, I really mean .. a horse? Oh, can not forget how the bad assassins roll around in the same vehicle throughout the movie. One might think that after the killing of key witnesses and federal agents, they would have been tracked down. ETC. ,
