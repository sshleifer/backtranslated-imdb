"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters of Chuck Jones. The "Loony Tunes" have a lot of spin-offs and different versions, some were good, others not very much. But "Loonatics" is the worst. , There was no resemblance to the original characters and the stories are boring and bad. The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic. This show just does not work. This terrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this should not be more than a bad joke. Lame! Zero stars
