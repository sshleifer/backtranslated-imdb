It's hard to put the awfulness of this film into words. A completely new vocabulary has to be invented to describe the total absence of something that is recognizable in "Rabbit Test" as "humor" or even "entertainment". As a small contribution to these future efforts, I would like to suggest this word: <br /> <br /> "Hubiriffic" (Adj.) A combination of "magic" and "grandiose"; Described were ambitious debacles like the movie "Rabbit Test". <br /> <br /> Joan Rivers and producer "Hollywood Squares" Jay Redack have clearly surpassed their meager abilities at this 82-minute festival of misery. Attempt to assemble a plane! A style comedy with a moldy collection of gags (note to Joan: German doctors were not funny since Vaudeville), which were separated from their graves in the Catskills - that's bad enough. But this cinematic crime is exacerbated by the directing style of River, which can best be described as "ugly," and a cast of yesteryear and in the future so eager to please them that they drown even the weakest dismissive gags in Adrift This Sargasso Sea of ​​Sap is a hapless Billy Crystal in his film debut role as a hapless protagonist of the film Lionel. Seeing Crystal in this picture is like watching a blind person walking in a minefield; Eventually, the Cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent state as a cheap joke after cheap joke explodes in his face. <br /> <br /> I can only speculate about the kind of audience that Rabbit Test might really like. Cabbages, mollusks and mild lizards are all possible candidates. But for self-confident, thinking people - I would highly recommend using bleach in your eyes before recommending "Rabbit Test".
