What an absolutely crappy movie that is. How and why this film was made and what the hell Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron were doing to register for this mediocre waste of time is a mystery to me. A strong piece of advice for anyone sitting down to watch a movie: DO NOT waste your time on this 'movie'.
