I will not describe the story because it was done elsewhere. We are great Clive Owen fans and when our Netflix recommended the movie, we were intrigued. <br /> <br /> No wonder that we had never heard of this "film", because it was a BBC Television film from 1992. Therefore, the poor production values, grainy picture, the jerky camera work and poor sound /> <br /> But the mechanics did not really bother you, because the story itself is let you sleep. It's an interesting human story, but not compelling, and there's hardly an end. They do not really care about the characters, because their life is as boring as your life when you watch this boring movie. Save the two hours and do something to make the time more rewarding.
