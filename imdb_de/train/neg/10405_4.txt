The fourth "Tremors" feature goes back to the year 1889. "The Legend Begins" in the small town of "Perfection", which was then "Rejection, Nevada". When the story begins, seventeen miners are killed by the dreadful "Graboids." Some of the characters in today's "Tremors" films have ancestry in the past, both figuratively and literally. The most obvious is the recurring Michael Gross (as Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Mr. Gross is incapable of firearms; So he hires gunslinger Billy Drago (as "Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot some "Dirt Dragons". <br /> <br /> This one has to get used to, as it takes place in the distant past. It's like a western with miniature versions of the original monster "Graboids". These tame "Dirt Dragons" are by far not as terrifying as their "Tremors" (1990). As a result, the characters in this movie spend a lot of time on the ground, which would not have happened in the original movie. It was strange that the citizens quit the fight as soon as Gross temporarily decides to leave the city. Why so helpless? Why did not Brent Roam (as Juan Pedilla) immediately get people to fight without Gross? Disappointing. <br /> <br /> **** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S. Wilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago
