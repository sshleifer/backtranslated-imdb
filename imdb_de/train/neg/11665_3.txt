I enjoyed the movie very much, emotionally, intellectually and visually. It contains neither violence nor sex or drugs or special effects and does not need them a bit. I keep up with the pictures, the story and the interspersed words of wisdom all the time. <br /> <br /> However: [1] Some of the foreign-language accents made it difficult to hear and understand the dialogue. [2] There is unnecessary excessive use of cursing (especially the F word, which is the only reason why this movie was rated R). [3] The film is well-balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotions you feel throughout the movie, except for the final resolution of the last few minutes, are uncomfortable, as some of the characters respond excessively dysfunctionally to the loss for too long. live too long in the depths of bitterness and depression. [4] I will not recommend this movie because he made background stories for 5 seconds that did not add anything to the secondary character he refers to or the movie - he just turned me off for the movie and stuck in my movie Brain through the film and then: The mother of the main character of German descent, when watching old films from the Second World War, "secret roots for the Germans". If the Nazis win the war, there would be no "local color" or art. I do not know Germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the Nazis were to win World War II.
