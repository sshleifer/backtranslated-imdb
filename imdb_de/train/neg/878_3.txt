I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people. The one who wrote the brilliant "A Double Life" and the funny "Born Yesterday" and wrote such great screenplays as "Adam's Rib" and "Pat And Mike" with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the one who wrote as annoying, sad as "Bachelor Mother", "Some Kind Of A Nut" and so on. The cast tries it, but the script is so tired and clich√©d that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are beaten. In the really offensive sequence in which Janssen's character tests Drivas' character to make sure he is not gay. An ugly sequence that unfortunately can be played in a movie today. "Ethnic" jokes are now completely forbidden, but "Fag" jokes are still "good, clean, family fun".
