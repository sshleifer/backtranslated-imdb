Guy walking around without a motive ... I'll never get those two hours of my life back. The man kept picking up identities and cheating on his pregnant wife. What did I think? How did that win a prize somewhere? I knew he loved his father, but otherwise the movie was completely pointless for me. What was the reason to go so much and go to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason. How did that enrich his life ??? Why did we have to see the dying old lady in underwear ???? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I think it's deep or something more interesting. I do not even recommend the movie to sleep ...
