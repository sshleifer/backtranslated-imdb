This is a rip off of the old Frankenstein premise. A renowned scientist is killed in a crazy accident and his father, a well-known brain surgeon, rescues the brain. It is then plugged into a robot body of its own design. His brother, an electric genius, gives the colossus the impulse to set thoughts in motion. The whole project goes awry when the creation goes insane. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not developed. The script is missing. And it's funny that this is not scary at all. Well, very young children will like that. If you are fully awake at 3 in the morning, this is night. Night. Night. The main characters are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played the 'Colossus'.
