Dr. Mordrid is scary. I would not recommend an adult or child to see this, unless they are already murderers. There's so much filth in this movie that it hurts my yes. Speaking of eyes, there are eyes in the sky against the backdrop of stars. Only the devil himself could have imagined such a bad thing. I borrowed every copy I could get in local video stores and crushed them with a 5-pound crucifix. This movie should remain trapped in a basement beyond the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell. That's where this movie belongs. I suggest, if you are looking for scandalous entertainment, hire All Dogs Go To Heaven or Angels In The Outfield. These films are worth seeing. If you commit a sin and you want to love horrible movies, you have to pay Dr. See Mordrid.
