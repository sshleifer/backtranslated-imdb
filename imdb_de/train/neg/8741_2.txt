After five minutes it becomes clear that you have seen everything before. It is a boiler room. It is the company. And it is the lawyer of the devil. And there are NO new elements here. Except for the all-to-clear Bill Gates allegory. Conspirators are always good for filming, but why must it be so extreme? Boiler room is a good movie because it seems - at least for a while - realistic. Everything is wrong in antitrust law. For example, how realistic is it that your boss pays a scammer to be your girlfriend so you can work harder and control you? I would give it 1, but the soundtrack is OK, so 2/10.
