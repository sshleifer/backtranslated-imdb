Raymond Burr plays the assassination of his best friend (Dick Foran) as a lawyer, thanks to his affection for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). It was a full year before he started working with Perry Mason, so the film could be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting. <br /> <br /> There is not so much else interesting here though. Lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one-dimensional and the motives for her crime in the secret are obvious. There's an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who also loves the Femme Fatale, but the Burr character is pretty straightforward. It's frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr playing these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his stopping delivery does not match his character here, as is the case in most of the movies I've seen him in. The whole Tension is said to refer to the title of the film and to the way Burr's character sets up the Lansbury figure to imply himself (the double risk that she's likely to be tried again for the original murder). He does this with a very large tape recorder that she does not notice when she comes into the room, I think. <br /> <br /> A few maybe unintentionally funny moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done TELEVISION.
