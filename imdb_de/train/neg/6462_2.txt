This wretched film shows that not even some of the best in Gollywood can save a real landfill. I've already wasted 91 minutes ... IT. <br /> <br /> If you look at it now after Brando's death, it shows how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors had become. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland? Why? <br /> <br /> I have to fill in more lines to accept this. I have to fill in more lines to accept this. I have to fill in more lines to accept this. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie. I'm overdue to do something interesting. Bye.
