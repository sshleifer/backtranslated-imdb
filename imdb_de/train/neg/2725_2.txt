Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexican "border policeman". He serves as the father figure to young immigrant Danny De La Paz (as Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be the best man at his upcoming wedding. Savalas is tough, but boss Eddie Albert (as Commander Moffat) may be tougher. It's hard to stop the smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (as Chico Suarez). Alliances can be on the move. <br /> <br /> If you find the possibility that "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" declare explosives repulsive, you should avoid "The Border". If not, you may not have your stomach for "realistic" cow slaughter. Although it is not worth much in the end, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> ** The Border (1979) Tony Richardson - Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
