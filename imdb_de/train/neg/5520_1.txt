This movie was portrayed as a comedy in the trailer. It is an extreme tragedy. It got me sick in my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make a movie like this, they should be human enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not have seen this movie if I had known. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. I'm tired I really wanted to have a funny comedy and I'm extremely disappointed. It's been a few days and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie. I've never been so disappointed in a movie and have never written a commentary on a bad movie. I really believe that true deception was involved in this trailer, because if they showed the true intent of the movie, no one would have seen it.
