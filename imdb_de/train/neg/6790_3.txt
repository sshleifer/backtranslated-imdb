Ohhh the brutality, ohhhhh the dying race, ohhhh the feeling of loss, ohhhh the prejudice! God, when are you going to stop crying Revisionists to analyze westerns because they are screaming out loud? S ** t happened. If it breaks your socially mature sensations, you should go back to the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection. <br /> <br /> Boring, boring and very tiring celluloid waste - especially with regard to Coburn / Hackman / Bergen. Nothing interesting or fascinating here, unless you are obsessed with the desert dentistry of the 19th century. Maybe it was a bit better without the constant distraction of the Mexican with the bad tooth. A monument to the stupid ultra-left creeping sensitivity of the 60s / 70s. It is practically impossible to sit through the whole movie. I think I would rather have my eyes fixed on the entire Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 horses / 10-all-deader'n-hell.
