I think that's one of Kenneth Branagh Shakespeare's weakest works. After so much effort, how much ado about nothing etc., I thought that was bad. The cast was weaker (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoli, McElhone ???), but my biggest criticism was that they mingled with the work of the Bard and cut out some of the piece to use the musical / dance sequences. <br /> <br / You just do not do Shakespeare and then start playing the game. Sorry, but that's just wrong. I love a Cole Porter as well as the next person, but do not understand Shakespeare. Skip this and watch "Prospero's Books" if you want to see a brilliant Shakespearean adaptation of the Tempest.
