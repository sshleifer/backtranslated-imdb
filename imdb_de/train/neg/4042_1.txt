This movie is beautiful to look at but looks like really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) makes no sense. But it is very "artistic". Many shots of half-dressed actors wrestling each other and looking each other in the eye. Many artistic shots through windows and with people who are not in the picture. Marbles and wistful wandering people. Lingering close-ups of faces and bodies. When you come with the cat to a threesome on the roof, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY on the screen. But you will only wish that the two fuck each other and get it over with. If you have always wanted to see a bad Russian gay porn without cash, your wish was fulfilled.
