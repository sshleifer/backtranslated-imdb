The plot is so manipulative that at every parent's decision it completely relies on the most unimaginable and unthinkable decisions of the adult. The children are great in terms of charm and delivery of the lines, but as I said, the whole plan depends on every single adult who is a complete idiot, and therefore in this case more sense of their actions (and at the same time) the only way to explain the actions of the boy to total mistrust). Why should cute little boys take a baby off the shore? How did the baby come to shore and was the LAST place to be searched? Why should the two boys NEVER be informed and at the same time, when a baby is missing, no one is cowardly about running around with food and diapers with all this excitement and literally looking for any other place they were looking for. It's just not possible to ask the audience to believe that. The request to believe it would be a legal process (even the informal attitude) is too insulting to show anything.
