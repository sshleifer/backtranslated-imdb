This film is a perfect example of an excellent book ruined by a movie. Jacob Have I Loved is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no story, plots disappear and the editing is awful. The music is directly from a synthesizer and sounds incredibly awful. The spectacle of Bridget Fonda is decent, but the acting of everyone else is absolutely amateur. I would recommend this film to someone who is studying to study as a producer, as a study of how not to make a movie because it is full of bad cut scenes, bad transitions and plays that would have to be re-recorded! Read the book and do not waste time with this movie.
