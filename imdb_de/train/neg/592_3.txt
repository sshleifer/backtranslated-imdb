Franka plays everything out of the train window in this British horror movie, which plays in the London Underground and plays with the usually reliable Franka Potente (Run Lola Run). Franka plays Kate, a businesswoman who comes to friends on the way from an office party falls asleep at a subway station to wake up and find herself imprisoned and being chased by "someone" or "something" with murderous intentions. <br /> <br /> Plotting and unbelievability are common There are very few moments that are actually nervous / scary, but many that are just boring. All in all an unpleasant movie that should just stay underground forever and do us all a favor. <br /> <br /> The only plus here is the inclusion of well-known veteran actor Ken Campbell, who is better than him? that even includes "Erasmus Microman"!
