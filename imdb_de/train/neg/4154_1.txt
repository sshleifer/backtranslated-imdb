Vampires Vs. Zombies was not the original title. It was actually ... <br /> <br /> Nasty Lesbian semi-vampires and two zombies hit by cars: Special guest appearances by Bob, the lesbian Gypsie-Witch and her dog, Random Woman with special powers and the catholic school girl short skirt zombie choir. <br /> <br /> Also on the box: Warning: No plot - only the author and the director will understand the end or anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I love bad movies. I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I even enjoy the lesbians. This movie combined all three with a vague and confusing (or nonexistent) plot, horrendous (I mean, REALLY BAD) dialogue and random STUFF and PEOPLE who have nothing to do with anything (or did they ... I do not know what was going on in the world). Oh, and I can not forget the green oatmeal 'zombies' in latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap that they could not cover their zombie hands with oatmeal and paint). Anyway, the result was that agonizing BAD movie, if you could call it that. <br /> <br /> Was not the end useful? The vampire was really a nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient? Where were the Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, where were the vampires anyway? You really could not call one of the vampires. What ever. <br /> <br /> Never borrow or buy this movie. If you are really curious ... okay, I will understand. Seriously, even lovers of BAD movies can not stand this movie. It should be number 1 on the bottom 100.
