Well, I love Bela Lugosi, do not get me wrong, he's one of the most interesting people ever to make a movie, but he's certainly done his part in clunking. This is just one of these. <br /> <br / Lugosi plays dr. Lorenz, a doctor who has inexplicably acquired his license. However, he does experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful. It has been shown that she is 70-80 years old, but Lugosi seems never really explained in his mid-50s, which is why he is married to this old woman. Nevertheless, these treatments or experiments have been involved in giving some kind of sweet-smelling substance to brides that are at the altar, but they then pass out as dead. Then Lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on the way to the morgue and take it back to his lab, where he finds himself in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic state. Then the stolen brides have encountered a needle somewhere in their body, perhaps the neck, and then the needle is pushed into the chest. Lugose's wife's body is to bring her back to youth and beauty. We never really see where Lugosi puts the needle or what he pulls out of the brides, but somehow his wife is restored. Given the age one cries out in pain because Lugosi's wife screams a lot until she returns to her younger state. The help of Lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this film. A funny old witch and her two deformed sons. One son is tall, a lumpy-looking, slow-acting guy caressing the sleepy brides, and the other son is a mean little dwarf ... little person, to be politically correct in today's world. At night, these three are piled up in Lugasi's desolate sleep. Those who are 3 and how they became fear therapists to Lugosis, like many other things in this film, are never explained. <br /> <br /> So a female reporter is given the task of her coarse editor to find out where the stolen brides will go to. First, among all the stolen brides, there is a rare orchid that can be found on them. So she wonders and it is said that there is a world-renowned orchid expert living nearby, who happens to be the one who developed this orchid. This expert turns out to be scary, Dr. Lorenz. She quickly finds him and turns his little horror house upside down. I'm not sure where the police were, but they came to mop up after the reporter had done everything dirty work. <br /> <br /> It seems that Lugose's movies always had some kind of unnecessary stupid storyline that brought the whole thing to a high stink. I mean, a world-renowned orchid expert kidnaps brides by sending them a spiked up orchid that he has developed himself? D'OH! <br /> <br /> Later it turned out that the young ladies do not even have to be a bride for the procedure to work. Why should Lugosi continue to kidnap brides from heavily guarded churches for his experiments and create all the attention and headlines? Why not just take a prostitute off the street like a normal spinner would? This clunker reminded me very much of another Lugosi stinker, "The Devil Bat" ... the same silly storylines and bad drama and the same stupid reporter gets villainous. <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - he's scary enough and scary enough to interest you enough to keep watching him. The woman who played the reporter was just a terrible actor ... she had no emotions at all, she delivered her lines like a machine gun, spitting them out as fast as she could. Everyone else has also blown a lot when it comes to being good actors. <br /> <br /> But this thing can be seen, if only for fans of Bela Lugosi.Lugosi has always been so even if the picture was a dog, he was intense. He must have known that he made horrible pictures, but maybe he also knew that if he gave everything, he had something of that intensity, he shimmered through all the bad conspiracies and the bad spectacle that surrounded him. <br /> <br /> And he was right ---- We horror fans will always love Bela Lugosi. He gave everything He was in front of the camera. We give two guys for you, Bela.
