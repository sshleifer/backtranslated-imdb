Two Qualifiers at the Top: I think Joe Don Baker can be good or even great with the right material and the right director (the "Cape Fear" remake, a small role in "Goldeneye", "Walking Tall"). I even liked Baker in "Mitchell" for playing an anti-hero that turned out to be unlikely. Yes, MST3K's coverage was hilarious, but they made a lot of cheap recordings on Baker - which he did not deserve - to keep things alive and entertaining - he was appropriate to the level and tone of the movie and he was the best part of the movie film. <br /> <br /> "Final Justice" seems to be more, but despite the exotic locations and the theme "Cowboy Frontier Justice" it is a bit weaker than "Mitchell". , And the main reason is that Baker's character, as written, is an idiot. The film has the notion that Baker, as Baker embodies Old Frontier Machismo, challenges its opponents to old-style Mano-a-Mano Quick Draw contests. And because he's so tough and macho, he always wins, even if he's injured, wounded, inferior, and so on. <br /> <br /> That's an imagination with a lot of potential (it worked for Gary Cooper), though it is so condemned the movie in the status "B". But Baker is so damn stupid and obsessed that he unnecessarily provokes three of the evil man's stooges to a showdown in a public market, with civilians everywhere. He could just have led them to the headquarters of Chief Bad Guy (which is why he was following them) and they would never have noticed. Or he might have gotten the drop on her and forced her to surrender, and had one of the followers bring him to headquarters at the top of the gun. But no, he has to be a hot top player and a macho fool, so he gets a kid taken hostage in the ensuing shootout! <br /> <br /> This is a guy we should admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically like this. Most of the supporting actors are somewhere between OK (the followers) and pretty good (the boss villain and his dad, two well-known European actors) - they just go through the motions, but they are professionals and even reared it are decent) , But through all of this, Baker's character draws stupid, unproductive stunts and mistakes that kill at least two relatively innocent people, plus a few baddies that may have been kept alive without the use of lethal force. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film plays 90% on Malta or the Mediterranean. Here you can see many beautiful landscapes and many exotic extras. And really, Baker himself is on the grave side and a bit dyspeptic, but he's not that bad ... certainly not the weapon that these critics (including Mike and the bots in their hilarious coverage) seem to think. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is good for video wallpapers, but the viewer should not bother with it.
