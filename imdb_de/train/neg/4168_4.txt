Well, this movie started funny, but deteriorated quickly. I thought it was rather "adult-oriented" humor based on the first few moments, but then the movie was switched to a mode unfavorable to the Disney channel guy, especially in a go-kart racing scene was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is beautiful, but has a real Italian accent. The film looked very independent and had a low budget. There was a very sweet moment, which I'll just call the Serenade scene, but overall this was a Yawner. The laughs are very rare and far apart. The surprise at the end of "Mr. Fix It" is so ridiculous that I'm more crazy than anything else. It might be worth a look if you can watch it for free or watch TV, but do not waste your money buying or renting this movie.
