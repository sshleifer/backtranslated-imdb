Wow, I've just seen this on TV as one of the "spooky" movies they show around Halloween. Was that rated G? There was nothing that made this movie scary or worth watching. Other people say that this is a parody, but I do not think so. For a parody, you need something called "humor." This low-budget crap party had no sense of humor, and it did not make sense. Basically, you have a stupid-looking monster (man in a rubber suit) who comes out of cupboards and kills people, I think, because you never see the monster inflict violence or bloody after-effects on anyone. The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so that's probably good enough. The military is trying to faintly kill the monster that is not much taller than a man. You have a very bad goal. Then the military FLEES! Wow, has this movie made the US military pathetic or what? Although the monster is hard to kill, it does not do much different than slip around and roar. Oh, and occasionally a second head jumps out of his mouth and screams. It was a little more interesting, but a total alien rip-off. What was the deal with the scientist who was playing xylophone to put on the monster? Due to the poor sound quality, it was difficult to understand many dialogues. And why did the monster carry around the main human for so long? Why did not the monster get in the closet when it had a chance? Why do I insist on giving meaning to the meaningless?
