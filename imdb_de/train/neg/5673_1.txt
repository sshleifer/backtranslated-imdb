I quote Oedpius Rex because it is a tragedy that this movie was even made !!! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I'm definitely not a Uwe Boll haters like most humorless people on IMDb! <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll movies like Postal and Tunnel Rats are hilariously bad and therefore entertaining. But honestly, this movie was just awful. I hated it so much that I would rate it with zero stars if I could. The story is just crap! There are four-fifths of the movie to build the plot, and then they have the middle, which are just scenes of gruesome, gruesome, tasteless murder! The ending ends with a "Villan Wins End" that is perfectly acceptable, but it certainly could have been more tasteful! <br /> <br /> I am not against Uwe Boll (as I have said) nor against violent movies! I f ** king love violent movies! I loved the Saw movies, the hostel movies, the Tokyo Gore Police, the New York Ripper, the 28 movies, dog soldiers, My bloody Valentine's Day, the last house on the left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, every Tarantino movie, every Sam Peckinpah even cannibals for the Holocaust! But this! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> That was just cruel, sadistic and perverted! And check out the movies I just performed! If I liked Cannibal Holocaust and not like that, then it must be bad! Uwe, do not go back to sleep! You're funny when you're easy-hearted, just like Ed Wood. This was just a terrible experience! After seeing that, I felt terrible! <br /> <br /> NOT TO AVOID !!!!!
