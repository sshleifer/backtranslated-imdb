Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as GIDEON. This film could have been a classic if Lambert, like Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM. Too bad As history matters to us in life, the supportive work of Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors, and Shelley Winters was superb. 3 out of 10.
