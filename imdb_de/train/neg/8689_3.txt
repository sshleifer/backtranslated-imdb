The main problem with "Power" is that there are also features that consist of pointless characters and subplots that do not add anything to the movie. After a while, it gets boring, waiting through scenes that do not connect to find something that drives the movie. It could all be passed on as character development, but they are either recycled from earlier scenes in the film or are just too shallow and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to flower the supporting cast. He would have to cut some characters (Hackman, the woman) and focus more on others (billings). It could have been a big, tough political thriller instead of a jumble that gets lost in a sea of ​​bad writing and bad behavior. A fact that stunned me in view of the cast. Even the performance of Gene Hackman was unsurpassable. Denzel Washington is the only real actor here. Gere and the others have done much better in other places. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet has to return to the fierce one-man shows of the Seventy (ie Serpico) and stop reclaiming his success with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe". It has not worked yet, Sidney, and it will most likely never happen. Leave the ensemble dramas Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
