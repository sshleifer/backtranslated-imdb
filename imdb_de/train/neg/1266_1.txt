If there is a hell, it contains a screening room where GRAND CANYON plays in an eternal loop over and over again. One might hope that the presence of so many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline and Mary Louise Parker - would make up for the presence of Mary McDonnell (whose penitence is to watch her own films for all eternity). , But no. Apparently they injected these other actors with a McDonnell serum. The whole affair is presumptuous, exaggerated, insulting (if you're deaf or know someone cooking on blood in the ridiculous TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is full of vile, self-inclusive people, but never gives us a reason to like, understand, understand or even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, they are unbearable losers, without which the gene pool would be better. There is no plot to talk about, no character development (these people will NEVER develop), no breakout performance, and most bow writing you can find in a movie. The best of GRAND CANYON? His title. This is a big hole in a movie.
