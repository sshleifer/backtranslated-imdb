The easiest way to describe this movie is as satire. The goal of satire is quite large, from the US government to the American company. It is not stinging satire, but rather a dumb one. <br /> <br /> Consider as a mixture of the film Kentucky Fried, the Airplane Series and Police Squad, which is with a much smaller budget and not done so funny this film. I can see how this film is a satire of many science fiction catastrophe movies of the 50s and 60s. I see this movie as a major influence on Tim Burton's Mars attacks. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple enough. Genetically engineered giant tomatoes become "crazy" and attack people and cities. First there is a coverup and then it goes to war. In the film there are different characters and characterizations: Lois "Fairchild" (a Lois Lane clone), a very ambitious presidential candidate spokesman Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent who has not worked since the Bay of Pigs), a useless president (which is only able to sign his name and attack New York), an even unsuitable Congress, a run-down marketing CEO and Masons team, consisting of an obese East German "female" swimmer, a diver, a crazy paratroopers from the Second world war II and an African-American panel of experts (dressed as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally as a tomato). Did I forget to mention many, many tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes, small tomatoes over huge plastic tomato over mashed tomato to tomato juice and eventually people dressed as tomatoes. <br /> <br /> In addition, you also have a few musical numbers. They are not that good and seem to be dubbed. The best piece is by far the theme of the movie ("Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"). It's way too catchy and you can end up buzzing or singing in public. Be warned. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of different situations in real life as well as various entertainment genres. I do not think I was made to laugh, but mostly I smiled and scratched my head. I definitely recommend this movie to fans of B and C movies, but only as a pawnshop. <br /> <br /> celluloid rehab
