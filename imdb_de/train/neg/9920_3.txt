I love the music of Clash and I love the music of Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. I went to this movie and hoped to learn something about the man behind the most part. But I came out of the theater and did not know much more about Joe than I already read in Wikipedia. The film never really accesses the person, their thoughts and feelings. What they did was gather the little stuff they had, blur blurry videos, and interview some people about Joe Strummer around the campfire. It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all and that the director only wanted them in the movie to let more celebrities say, "Oh, he was an inspiration to all of us." Like Bono or Johnny Depp (who were apparently asked to keep his pirate costume to take advantage of his recent success in Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped to sell his version of the "greatest punk rocker and hippie in the heart" that had ever lived, and made the person holy without really enough to know about him. Sure, as a fan, I enjoyed watching the band's pictures, listening to the anecdotes behind the songs and stuff, but in the end, I had the feeling that it was left over, as the portrait of Joe Strummer in 60 would easily have can be said -90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie if you are a fan. Otherwise, listen better to the music of the Clash, or even better the undeservedly unknown Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer had previously reached the pinnacle of his musical development His death, which blended all his rich influences into a stunning sound.
