Come on, Tina Fey, you can do better. As soon as the movie started, I knew how it would end. Sure it was funny sometimes. Even laughing loudly. But there is not enough laughter to save this movie. I do not recommend the purchase. My best bet is to rent it, but that's all. Baby Mama has some fun scenes, but is predictable and does not have the heartwarming ending she's after. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher form a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher were both great and that's good. That's not the best. Baby Mama had a great supporting role. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add to the size of the case. <br/> <br /> Another pregnancy movie hit the cinema world. After the big knocked-up and Juno Baby Mama looks very average by comparison. Knocked Up and Juno are hilarious, heartwarming and have an end that leaves you with a smile on their face. Baby Mama's end was not funny and boring. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year and she does not try to be. I recommend it, but do not expect it to be totally funny. Expect an average comedy that does not give the big emotional end that it tries to have. I give baby mom ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
