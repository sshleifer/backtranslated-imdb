I like animated shows. I enjoy the Nick rate, including Hey, Arnold. However, moving a TV show to the big screen is not easy and just does not feel big enough. It was more like a long episode of the show and it just did not progress that well. Judging by the behavior of the children we had with them, it did not fare as well with them.
