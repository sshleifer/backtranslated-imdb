I am an 11th student at my high school. In my Current World Affairs class, a kid in my class had this video and suggested watching it. So we did. I am firmly convinced that we went to the moon because my father works for NASA. Although I think this movie is the biggest crap I've ever seen, the guy who created it has some serious balls. Did he first have to show how JFK was shot? And how dare he use all those biblical quotes. The only good thing about this film is that it causes debate. What's good in my lessons, we have weekly debates. This movie has not changed my mind. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and make another movie. Michael Moore, the next film, could be called "A fun thing is on September 11th" or "A funny thing happened on the way to the White House".
