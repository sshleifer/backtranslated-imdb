William Russ is the main character in this TV movie. He left his family behind only to reappear and begin to pay off his debts. But he tries to stay away from his family. This is where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in with various roles to convince him to come home. <br /> <br /> The story is average and they actually managed to win and use a former star (Peter Falk) to a pretty good degree. But William Russ was not a true star. However, it seems that his acting is still fine. <br /> <br /> I found the delivery and the story very cheesy as everything was predictable. For the past 20 minutes, I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like this. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a below-average movie. In a letter rating system, it would get a "D".
