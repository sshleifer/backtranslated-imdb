If you do not mind playing with your feelings, then you have nothing against this movie. On the other hand, if you enjoy British crime puzzles, follow the clues and see how they logically fit together in the end, you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to this disappointment: <br /> <br /> * While the police are using the CCTV cameras early to gather clues to the puzzle, the huge truck becomes who has blocked the sight of children just before their disappearance, not pinched camera. This is a critical part of the mystery. It is contradictory that the car the children were in was caught in front of the camera, not the big truck so important to the mystery. <br /> <br /> * The film makes a great effort to show the sophistication of the equipment while tracking the movements of the children fall down, but misses the opportunity to use the same sophisticated equipment by bringing vehicles that may be the crime scene Tracking down on camera-visible locations next to the crime scene as part of the development of clues. <br /> <br /> * On the left in England. The director does his utmost to park the car on the right side of the crime scene park, a few meters from the flower kiosk, if it could easily have parked in the back or even next door; As the huge truck did. <br /> <br /> * The police research team is so meticulous to find a dumped cell phone in a sewer several kilometers from the scene, but can not find blood evidence of the head injury right on the scene, even though it only hours away from the scene after disappearance and without intervening rainfall have secured. <br /> <br /> * Search Dogs were not used at all to find the missing children; This is from the land that is known for hunting dog development for hunting and hunting. <br /> <br /> * It's illogical that such a highly publicized message would not show up to the presumably innocent truck driver who stopped at the station flower kiosk. <br /> <br /> * It's illogical that the mother is so extreme and goes to great lengths to leave carpet fiber under her fingernails for her potential assassination mediators - even if she tempts her daughter to do the same - while she does just could not have crawled out of the unguarded camper. If she felt she had to ask her daughter to get some carpet fiber under her nails, she might as well ask her daughter to call for help or even leave the mobile home, which is in a crowded park. <Br /> <br /> * The suspect who kidnapped the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow / muted - justifying his unconscious drowning by the mother? But he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and to fully exercise his rights not to incriminate himself. There are more inconsistencies like these that lead to a real disappointment. "Five Days" is a very weak British crime story.
