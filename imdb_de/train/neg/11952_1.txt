Aykroyd, his first film after the death of his longtime friend John Belushi, shows much weariness as he tries to dissuade a character who would have been a breeze to Belushi. Instead, "Doctor Detroit" gives bookmaker professor Aykroyd a weird, violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as Mom. That's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, cook a school dinner, protect four ladies of the evening, and attend a Pimp's Dinner (or something like that). No wonder Aykroyd is stunned most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? <br /> <br /> Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon in this movie. At least something good came from this messy mess. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. They want good Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers". They want bad, see "Doctor Detroit".
