After Disney's funny live action George of the Jungle I had high hopes in this movie. Big disappointment. Naked plot, bad appearance, bad visual effects. This movie relied on lame one-liners, idiotic (and pointless) product placement and the most annoying kick in this gadget-car thing. I took two young children to see it, and they were bored. The only laugh from this movie was the bad standby mode when a laugh had to be shown that a guy got it in the bar!
