I saw this movie as a very young girl (I'm 27 now) and it scared me for years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this movie, from the way it was attracted to music to (obviously) violence. My parents are still arguing over who has allowed me to look at it, and both say that they would never watch such a movie. I think they just say that I know that I have such strong feelings. 0) I'm just reading the book (out of curious curiosity and the fact that it's a classic) and it's really a great story. However, I do not think that it should have been done to a cartoon. Ever. Well, maybe kids found it strange these days, but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks, and it's still hard for me to see rabbits in a similar way. Gives me a little palpitation every time. Yah, I'm a kiss, but I strongly recommend that all parents who want to show their children this movie instead read the book or check it out first to make sure they agree with the content. Not everyone finds it as disturbing as me, but we are out there; 0)
