I'm a big fan of the Batman comics and was disappointed when I could not find Batman: The Animated Series on TV anymore. I was excited to learn that there will be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I saw the first episode on the day of the premiere and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the animation is very bad. It looks like a cheap, crappy Japanese anime. On the other hand, pretty much every modern cartoon is like that. <br /> <br /> The character designs are even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red version of the Hulk, the penguin is a kung fu master, Mr. Freeze is an undead thing with an iceberg on his head and the Riddler a Gothic-Marilyn Manson-Look-Alike (which is weird because I do not expect people obsessed with riddles and puzzles to be Gothic). <br /> <br /> The worst character design is that of the joker. They made him a monkey / demented Bob Marley / kung fu fighter! The Joker is said to be Batman's deadliest enemy, but in this show he's hardly a threat because his crimes are so stupid and pointless. In one episode, he wanted to put his Joker poison in dog food! Oh, how bad! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is persecuted by the death of his parents, which is why he fights crime. This version of Batman does not seem to be haunted by his parents' death and is not interesting at all. He is not a detective, just a fighter. If there is an enemy he can not defeat, he does not investigate the enemy to find out his weaknesses, as a detective would do, he just builds a huge battle robot to defeat them. Often, this show does not even feel like a Batman show, just another brainless anime that is nothing but pointless fighting. <br /> <br /> What I hate most about this show is what they did to the bad guys. They've taken everything that makes them sympathetic and understandable, turning them into stereotypical evil villains. Man-Bat is the biggest example. In the comics he is a tragic scientist studying bats to find a remedy for his deafness. When experimenting with himself, he accidentally turns into a giant bat creature. In this show, he is a mad scientist who purposely wants to turn into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason. Almost all villains are like that; None of them, with the exception of one or two, have any actual motive for their crimes. <br /> <br /> The worst characterization is that of Mr. Freeze. In the comics, Freeze was a mad scientist until brilliant writer Paul Dini wrote the BTAS episode "Heart of Ice," which gave Freeze a new lease of life that made him a more tragic, three-dimensional, and sympathetic villain. The episode was so popular that fans saw it as its source and even served as a source in comics. Even the crappy movie Batman & Robin used it as its source. In this show he is a little jewel thief before he becomes Mr. Freeze. After becoming Mr. Freeze, you know what? He is still a little jewel thief! Great Origin No wonder they used it in the one developed by Dini. <br /> <br /> As a Batman fan, I do not like this show just because it does not look like comics, because I also like BTAS, the Batman cartoons. It followed Tim Burton's Batman movies and obviously the great Christopher Nolan Batman movies. None of them was 100% loyal to the comics, but they were still very good. The problem with this show is not that it does not look exactly like the comics or BTAS, it lacks any depth that makes other Batman media so popular. <br /> <br /> I have given so many chances to this show, but the more I see, the more disappointed I am. I miss the good old days, when Batman cartoons were a treat for all.
