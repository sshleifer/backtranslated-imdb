One wonders why anyone would try to reheat successful movie appearances that have already been seen, as is the case with this film. "The Wedding Date" is one of the best examples of why you should not even try to make something new under the guise of a new story, something that should have been. If a project like this one continues with the approval of the studio's big honchos, then you're going out with big stars and shining production values, that's how people will come for the stars. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that did not happen in this misguided attempt at comedy. The problem seems to be the way the scriptwriters transplanted the story to London. This essentially seems to be a typical American situation that can not even correct the attitude. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have so much chemistry like oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Since Kat and Nick have no conflict from the start, the viewer is not drawn into the movie as the creators thought. It's clear that Kat will fall for Nick and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best asset in "Junebug," acts like a shallow girl willing to keep her lie and not come in to the man who loves and marries her. <br /> <br /> For those who are interested, the end credits are close to seven minutes!
