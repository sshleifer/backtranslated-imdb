I had eagerly awaited the first screening of this movie since it was presented to me on DVD for Christmas. After reserving a special place for them last night, I sat down with my daughter (17, and a student of film studies), with chocolate, of course, in anticipation. We love Jane Austin. <br /> <br /> Already after the first two minutes we knew that we were sunk. The shaky camera settings and angles, generally poor cinematography, directing and wood performance had already made us shallow and dissatisfied. Desperately we looked at this. <br /> <br /> Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked strangely and without any reason directly at the camera into the camera, broke our hard-won "fantasy of the moment" and captivating us directly to an almost "I'll find you" pier-type. <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with the script and instructions, blessing him. I hope they paid well when he drowned in a huge wave that predictably broke the seawall and wet him and his fellow actor. They were almost swept into the sea. Health and safety would have had a field day! Poor Rupert spit out seawater to deliver his line. There probably was not enough money left for a re-shoot of this scene. Anyone with a sense would not have tried on such a day. <br /> <br /> Apart from Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige was the only convincing performer as Lady Russell, but her efforts soon outweighed those of Anthony Head's convincing portrayal of the annoying Sir Walter Elliott. <br /> <br /> Towards the long-awaited end of the movie, Captain Wentworth seemed to honor Anne with a strangely bizarre visit every two seconds after bothering to avoid her for the majority of the movie every two seconds. It was as if he had developed a memory disorder that caused him to forget his real reason. In contrast, Anne was hyperventilating from pillar to post in search of the good captain, who had managed in the meantime to call in almost three or four minutes almost the entire bath we are told, without even sweating his. <br /> <br /> We did not see any of Anne's charms across the screen. In fact, we wondered what the charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain, stupid, mindless Anne, and why anyone, anyone, did not mean to make Sir Walter just shut up. <br /> <br /> The ultimate kiss, usually our favorite girl, was pulled out painfully. As they approached, Anne opened and closed her mouth, giving the impression on the screen that she was chewing gum before her lips finally met. Eww! <br /> <br /> The nicest thing about the last night was the chocolates and half-hour exchanges between mother and daughter about how bad the movie had been. <br /> <br /> What a pity ruin such an enchanting and captivating story filmed in some of England's most beautiful landscapes. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, Jane.
