This is definitely one of the stranger films of the 70s and it is mainly responsible for the beginning of a decade of Bigfoot hysteria. It is also notable for the small touches of madness throughout the movie, especially when the dark, melancholy first half is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDE (one of the other users points out that one of the songs is dedicated to a character, Travis Crabtree who paddles in a canoe for a while, then ... leaves never to be seen again). Although it is now painfully outdated, it is still a fun, frightening movie that I can show kids, and anyone who loves either Bigfoot lore or the hillbilly culture of the 70s will surely take a kick out of it. My favorite part: A guy gets so scared that he jumps his head through a door (!?) And the narrator explains, he had become unconscious of "shock". Uh, I'd say breaking a door with a head is more likely why he got unconscious, but whatever. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars or 7/10 if you like the bad Americana.
