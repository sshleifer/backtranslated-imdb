OK, I'm not Japanese. I know something about Japanese culture and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Besides, I'm Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humor. <br /> <br /> Well, if this point is set, I can comment on the movie: I have no idea what the movie looks like. The Japanese audience, Mamoru Oshii, is a pretty good director - despite the overly pedantic postmodern ones Things in the style of Talking Head, and even that was curious and somehow interesting - and I'm surprised he came up with that. I'm afraid it's just one of those cases that got lost in translation, but as a European viewer looking at the movie with subtext-overloaded English subtitles, I just found it terrible. The jokes seemed to be bad, the script was overcooked - I mean, give the audience a break and shut up, you damn narrator - so I'd almost blow my head off because it's fast talking and absurd Action gives. <br /> However, I found the animation really cool. The idea is great and well used in these animated scenes. The feast of the eyes, however, ends as soon as the characters are set aside to begin with an endless, not funny mumbo-jumbo speech about still images. It's just a desire to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical character scene. <br /> <br /> I read that Mamoru Oshii is actually planning a sequel to it. The idea was good, but terribly exploited. Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie, or maybe it will be more and more dubbed scenes. But hell, if you think Talking Head is tight, Amazing Lifes from Fast Food Gifters will lead to a stroke. <br /> <br /> Of course, all these comments are based on the experiences of a European. It's probably useless to the Japanese, maybe it was a really funny movie that got lost in cultural boundaries and translations. Could be.
