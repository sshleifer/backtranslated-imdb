I can not see the charm of this series (which is supposed to be Sci-Fi). It's really just "let's see what soap is going to happen this week" and oh well, the Cylons are involved in flashbacks. <br /> <br /> The Zylon "Babe" nailing the other guy is pretty lame T & A was added to the show. Every time she shows up, I'm amazed that WTF is about to happen. And do not even try to shame me on "Story Arcs." <br /> <br /> It's a soap opera with CGI effect. Apart from the original premise, this is not science fiction. <br /> <br /> This series is not everything she worked up to. If you prefer a trendy, edgy, dodgy, annoying, and vague camera for the video camera, this show might be for you. As nerds seem to rave about this show, this is a clear indication that the opinions of vocal singers have changed from Picard's TNG.
