Wow you are way too nice !!! Corny, Corny, Corny So I feel for this movie. It started off well with a good idea: A guy (Edward Asner) escapes from the jail dressed as Santa, a bunch of kids He thinks he's the real Santa, so the wrong Santa Claus asks the kids to join him help to find a bag of stolen money. The movie is like a Christmas version of "Whistle down the wind". The movie starts off well, but little by little Cheesier and Cheesier gets to the point that in the end it gets ridiculous and you can not take this movie seriously. For example, you get the guy Scrooge called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois), who is a total douchebag who treats his little son like a bunch of garbage, he treats his son so badly that he does not buy decent clothes for him, the poor boy wears jeans with holes But a 45-second scene with Fake Santa visiting Sumner and at the end of the film, the guy is happy to sing Christmas Carol and give his neglected son a hug ... yeah, that's how Corny is ... I'm all for a good movie, especially during the Christmas season, and I'm a big fan of seasonal TV movie, but this is too over the top for me. It's a shame because he started well, but the second half of the movie is a supernatural element of the movie that just does not go with the rest. It is not terrible, there is a solid spectacle, especially from the children, but there is much better Christmas movie.
