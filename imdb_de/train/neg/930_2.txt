Some children are hiking in the mountains, and one of them goes into a big tunnel and discovers old mummified gladiators. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other wanderers. <br /> <br /> This thing is just so pointless that it's crazy. Here is a short list of things that make no sense: <br /> <br /> 1) A man and a girl are in their tent and they believe they hear something outside. The guy goes to an examination and finds another hiker out there. Then he hears his girlfriend screaming, so they go back to the tent - arrive the next morning?!? He was only 50 meters away! <br /> <br /> 2) These two fools then hear another girl screaming (What, 100 yards away?), but do not investigate because they're afraid they'll get lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another man and a girl walk around, and in their tenth scene together, the girl informs the boy that due to the circumstances, the protocol no longer requires him to speak to her as a professor. I mean, what the ...? Firstly, that is really a stupid thing to say; secondly, in the first nine scenes in which they were together, he never called their professor. <br /> <br /> 4) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her and tells her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to hurt without killing. Um, yes, we somehow noticed that she's wounded and not dead because she's up and running around. But thanks for the treat. <br /> <br /> 5) A girl is shackled in Demonicus' camp, and if anyone tries to free her, she instructs that person to seek help. Um, look, idiot, if she released you, which would take about 5 seconds, it would not be necessary to get help. <br /> <br /> And it just goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent letting the two idiots get lost in the woods, then they fight, then pitch a tent and ignore the cries of their friends, then wander around a bit. It's so damned boring and pointless that I half turned off the DVD. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are personable, especially those who spend most of their screen time. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume pulling his face up to look evil. He runs, or should I say, Scampers around, as if he were gay. The special effects are comedic, acting is usually terrible and nothing makes sense. <br /> <br /> Overall, this concept might have turned into a funny fighting film when more time and effort was spent getting rid of the ridiculous dialogue, creating characters with really likable personalities, having a kind of logical flow and perhaps Demonicus even giving a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit. But no, instead we get that pointless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death.
