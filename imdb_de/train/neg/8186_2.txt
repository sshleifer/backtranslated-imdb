Has anyone read the script? This is one of the worst writers and directors of the year. The three great actors Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson could not pull this film out. About two-thirds of them looked as if Giamatti's eyes were saying, "I can not believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on the really bad Christmas movie list. Not enough lines, but what else can you say? Okay, the movie just does not move with Vaughn's competitors, his character is just a scary guy you just can not get past. It was just a lackluster passage no one seemed to enter.
