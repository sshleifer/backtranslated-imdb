A pretty crazy whodunit with a completely black actor trying to figure out who was killing the trumpet player who was about to go to Hollywood to grow up. Was it his wife? His girlfriend? His would-be girlfriend? Her father? His butler? The newspaper man? Who knows? And who cares? The result is just a little too low, and the actors here do not really get me into the mood to be interested in one way or another. Why snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music is okay, but there is not much of it, and most of it is pretty "let's get it over with". This is not worth your time. There are better, completely black casted films.
