I was waiting to go to the theater with tickets in hand and was expecting an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie that could finally draw me on to movies about robot technology. Instead, I was disappointed by every aspect and once again proved this amazing special effects can not help a boring conspiracy, which in my opinion was the worse this year. Since I was also dissatisfied in this film, Will Smith did not show anything new in this movie, but I've never seen his acting changed since "Men In Black," which in my opinion was the only success. Since then he has had to retire and not spoil his name with titles like "I, Robot" or "Men In Black 2". 4.10
