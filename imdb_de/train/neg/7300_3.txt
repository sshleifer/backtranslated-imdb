This film is about a group of five friends renting a cabin in the woods. One of the friends discovers a terrible, carnivorous virus. Suddenly, friends make a desperate attempt not to commit themselves to the disease. "Cabin Fever" is a terrible movie. First, it tries to be many genres at the same time. Should it be a homage, a slasher, a black comedy or a scary movie with an unwanted comedy? Nobody can say it. First there is a serious scene and a second change, it becomes funny. When the movie tries to be funny, the humor is pretty boring and excludes the end. I really liked the end. <br /> <br /> But apart from the end, I was pretty disappointed and disgusted. The violence is scary to look away from the screen more than to be afraid. The sound changes in every scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary and sometimes completely random. In fact, you can see a girl doing karate in Slo. What should we get from it? The same girl would bite one of the characters. Was that funny? I dont know. <br /> <br /> Some performances were decent and many were pretty amateurish. I did not care about most of the characters. I liked the plot, but the execution was terrible. As a horror movie I did not know what it wanted to be. I found it neither funny nor tense nor scary. In the end, you are indifferent and think, "What have I been through?" Unfortunately, you never know the answer to this question.
