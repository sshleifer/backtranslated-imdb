I saw this movie as a preview of an art exhibition by Matthew Barney. It certainly prepared me. I almost skipped the show and in retrospect it should have been. <br /> <br /> Apart from the big score (Bjork) and the rich photography, the content was mostly boring and predictable. I really needed someone to wear beads to find out what the pearl divers were up to. The film mainly consisted of a stupid mix of Japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology used in a mock hunt / harvest. The film "culminates" with enough unfounded shock art to turn the belly. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the movie? While others may argue that it is an anti-whaling piece, one could argue that it also warrants whaling. Personally, I believe it was Barney's attempt to "flash" the audience with his anal, fecal, self mutilating and cannibalistic fetishes, do not mind this movie. The message is dark, the tempo slow and the cultural references presumptuous. If you're looking for shock art, you'll better hunt in one of the many "undead" films or hunt down an old copy of Hustler and take a fake caricature.
