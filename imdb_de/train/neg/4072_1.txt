I watch bad movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. No ounce of humor, no ounce of talent everywhere. <br /> <br /> I am LAZY. <br /> <br /> I usually see a bad movie and a curse. That was so bad that I actually did a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess I fell victim to. It's even too lame to use a room freely. So boring. Check out 'Bloodsucking Freaks' or 'Shock, Shock, Shock' to find the absolute crap that deserves entertainment. This mud looks awful, is terrible, and who made it should feel terrible.
