This is another bad movie you should probably avoid. The storyline could be much "thicker" than it actually is, and would be better than a blockbuster movie. <br /> <br /> The acting leaves something to be desired, although you can not quite put your finger on it. <br /> <br /> This is one of those you see on late-night TV, maybe in the US just because you can not fall asleep. Watch it if you want, but do not expect too much.
