I saw this movie on March 21st this year. Must say disappointment. But much better than "Tridev". Plot is crazy. Told by Prabhat, who lives with his father, his wife and his little brother. The movie begins when he saves a bride. Anyway. Azzhar Jhurhad is making a plan to kill his young brother. He makes a plan by sending few men. They come to a school that is supposedly Prabhat's friends. Kill the child. His father throws him out of the house. He and Aakash go to Kenya to find him. Sun performs well, Chunky was the most annoying, Naseerdun is wasted. Vivya did well, Sonam was wasted, Jyotsna was wasted, but cute looking movie was cute. Too sad he had to kill his character. The girl was cute, but annoying. The other kid was doing well. Alok did well. Kiran was adequate. Amrish and Gulshan were good. Cinematography is excellent in both India and India. Kenya.Script is weak, but has some good dialogues. Also draws. The movie.The music was fine.I Only one song liked "Saat Samundar", the lyrics of this song were good. The other songs were unforgettable. Do not look at this. Evaluations 3/10
