Understand that I'm watching the movie I saw. I realize that almost all nudity and bruises were cut out of this film, which completely destroyed it. When I saw names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson, I knew that I would not get a horror classic, but at least I expected there were unnecessary boobies and bloodshed. But no, this must be the most slaughtered modern horror movie. I mean, it's easy to say that there are many more in certain scenes, but they suddenly intersect, or the scene ends right at the beginning. How do you screw cannibals and pornstars? I mean, that's a winning formula. I wonder if the director slept with the wife of an executive or something, because it's literally amazing how much of it was cut off. When I read about it in Fangoria a few years ago, I was upset, it looked like a funny movie, but unfortunately the real movie is trapped somewhere in a vault, and we have to endure this piece of excrement called Evil Breed. I hope someday a unrated cut will be released, as I think a good movie will be in this mess, but it's best to take a twelve-pack of Bud by then, because that's the only way you can do that Go through the film.
