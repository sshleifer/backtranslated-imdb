This movie is bad. If you think about watching, there is only one decent scene in the movie that lasts about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraways topless scene). The rest of the movie is terrible. I think school games are probably better acting. The action makes no sense at all. The set was pretty lame and it was not even good to make fun of it. It was just boring and very, very bad! I looked at Starz and thought it had to be decent at least. The mini description sounded like everything was alright. At the beginning of the movie, the girlfriend seems to kill herself for no apparent reason after watching a horrible music video. The transitions between the scenes are very abrupt, and it's like someone puts a lot of clips into a movie without thinking about how to pass them. Just cut from one scene to another, no smoothness. A bit like my accidental shift from talking about the bad movie to explaining why the plot is shitty. The sound gets quiet in some places where you can barely hear it, and then the horror screams of gays loudspoken at random parts in the movie are heard. It is the same tone every time. This is officially the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Storyline: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame Meter: 1,000,000 / 10
