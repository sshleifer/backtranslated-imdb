I do not think you can get much worse. Put bad actors, false limbs, and three stupid stories together, and what do you get? This B-rate pointless apology for a movie. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows the bad video quality, and the drama is just very pathetic, especially when you look at the 25-year-old as a grandma posing with the pose of a grandma bun over the ears. Plus, the man is fine, but the woman is pretty ugly. "You look great!" NOT! The werewolf in this case was the best of all three, I would say, but he still is not impressive because it was all just a bad costume. The face on the woman was later decent for Halloween, but not for a werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> The more stories you go through, the worse it gets. There are two lesbians in this next one who are completely ridiculous. The whole thing "I also want to be a werewolf" "How can you do that to me?" Was stupid to say. You asked to get over it now! The werewolf is not even talked about ... it's a rat! <br /> <br /> The third does not make sense ... Almost forty-five minutes of running and boring tales make up this story and the whole thing of change still does not make it interesting. Boring! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... who could not even hear some parts was stupid. The effects of the animals were either rat or pork-like, which was stupid. They could not use lion sounds. I do not think good movies use that. Well, if you enjoy B-prices, that's good for you. I've been getting this movie since I'm a hardcore werewolf fan, and I'll buy ANY werewolf movie and watch it several times, but that's just me. If you prefer good, do not waste money. I beg you!
