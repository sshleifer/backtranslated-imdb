The sitcom "The League of Gentlemen" follows the life of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictitious village "Royston Vasey". The different scenes are connected by their common environment. <br /> <br /> In the first series, a sketch show, the main feature deals with a new road being built by Royston Vasey. Consequently, more foreigners visit the small city. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of a "local" shop that is actually far from the city, do not like foreigners. Every time a visitor enters his shop, they kill him. In my opinion some scenes are somehow tasteless and not funny at all, for example when the couple uses two engineers who want to build the new street. Edward drums while Tubbs dances half-naked around the victims. <br /> <br /> Also, Pauline lives in Royston Vasey. She works at the local job center. Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman does not want to lose her job. If an unemployed person gets an interview as a firefighter, he does not allow him because he is not ready for the job yet. <br /> <br /> Then there's Barbara Dixton, a transsexual taxi driver who goes great about detailing "her" sexual conversion. <br /> <br /> In addition, the vet, Mr. Chinnery, always kills animals instead of healing them. In one case, he comes to a farm and is led into the living room, where a dog lies in his basket. The farmer goes outside. Assuming that the dog is the sick animal, he is euthanized by Mr. Chinnery. A second later, the farmer opens the door and holds the "real" sick animal, a sheep, in his hand. Some inhabitants are a husband and his wife, who are visited by their nephew (his son) friend is incidentally killed by the shopkeepers). The couple is very tidy. For example, you have towels in different colors. Each color represents a body part. They also have thousands of keys that are marked with different colors and classified exactly. <br /> <br /> The actors are playing very well in my opinion. By playing women, the scenes become funny. The costumes also suit the actors. Tubbs wears a scarf and some crazy characters, like Edward, have unappetizing black teeth. The show has a lot of dark humor, typically British. The set design reflects the mood of the series. The village and all houses look gray and have decayed. There is often fog around the shop, increasing the threat. Even the village sign is threatening: "Welcome to Royston Vasey, you will never go." <br /> <br /> Although I think the actors do a good job, this kind of series is not my taste.
