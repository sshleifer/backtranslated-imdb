But let's face it ... it has a few nostalgic sighs from me. <br /> <br /> The show is just so great that it has a few hiccups. I'm getting a new season and just making it through as if I had two days to live. I like the idea of ​​wrapping it, but it was much more of a season-end episode that would explain the following: <br /> <br /> Dr.Cox should not be bald for a few more episodes. The only explanation I can imagine is that they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to resume the beginning. <br /> <br /> and that my friends, why the hellbird is bald. Anyway, the show is great ... bringing Season 7.
