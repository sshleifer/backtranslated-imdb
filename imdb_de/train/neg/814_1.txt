This movie was just bad. Just about every cop clich√© of a police officer is present and will be considered. Bad guy is coming from it? check. Partner? check. Crazy personality hit with the partner? check. Beginners with something to prove? check. The rookie shows a grisly veteran. check. The only ones who had not touched it were idiots who shot themselves in the foot, and they avenge themselves, but I guess they save those old chestnuts for Dooley's next outing. Add girl power to the battle of the sexes, along with tired, old-fashioned skulls and trivial exaggerated material, like Dooley's prize-winning car that's constantly being dumped. Avoid this at all costs.
