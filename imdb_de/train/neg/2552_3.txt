This is a documentary, it's not like that, it was filmed like a documentary, but I guess it was just because they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy movies. This has just been released on DVD in the UK as "American Pie style comedy", that's not it. <br /> <br /> Basically, it follows a group of teenagers who go to Mexico for a cheap schnapps in the spring on their way to Mexico, and endeavor to finally have their virgin friend laid there. Throw is a few dwarfs, even on the same kind of search, and you have a nondescript story of drunken teenagers trying to get some girls. <br /> <br /> Considering rating 18, this has very little nudity and practically zero sex scenes, mainly I appreciate that the rating applies to cursing, of which there are many. <br /> <br /> If you like crude Jackass behavior without humor, this may be your thing, if you have brain cells links I would probably avoid that!
