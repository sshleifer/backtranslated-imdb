I'm rarely moved to make that kind of comment, BUT having sat through the most horrible films of the Rankin, I feel like I really deserve to say what I feel about it! I could not make it to the end and became half a dozen or more walk-outs (about 1/3 of the audience) after the clumsy plot, sad dialogue, and offensive characterization had just become too much. This movie is all pose and no art. all style and no substance. It is burdened by terrible acting, a really terrible script, indifferent cinematography, and output at the student level. How it was financed, started and ended is a mystery to me. I bet you get a million quid that will never be published. The right critics would rip it up. a really bad movie. A really, really, really bad effort AND that is without mentioning that the born newborn is getting into a deep fryer. completely pointless, absolutely light, badly put together; This movie is a terrible embarrassment to British cinema.
