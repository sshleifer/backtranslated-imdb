This film was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technology. I got up and watched as everyone waded out of the theater, their faces exhausted, as if their lives would flash before their eyes - the eyes wandered to their neighbor and asked if it was just them. I mean, how could the movie really be bad? Nobody will admit, it's a classic case of The Emperor Wears No Clothes. "Who am I to interview a movie that contains a man stopping a jetliner?" The fact remains, however, that every public thinks what I am writing. I actually plagiarized their faces. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Lois will only get excited by the Force, she will not even drink a cup of coffee with the Superman With Glasses, who will not stop jetliners. It can not be the look in "his" eyes on the depths of his soul or the like. In the old Superman she had some connection with him, obviously he was not the number one priority, but it strengthened her character that she was "torn". I bet Henry Kissinger won that lois even before Clark Kent. <br /> <br /> And now it's official, Kryptonite faces Superman, which makes eating at McDonalds with the Avg. Person. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN "ONE" He loses his Earth Father, then finds his true super dad, the story fascinates every step of the way. He is a human being, he refers to people and he has love for people, he refers to disciples, he refers to people who feel different. He tells. The Superman Returns Superman seems to deal only with supermen and he seems to "just do a job" by saving people. <br /> <br /> There's something about Clark Lois likes, she's really in love with him inwardly, but she can not, and when he comes into the picture as a Superman, he throws love on the rocks around. Without Superman, she would have fallen in love with Clark (at least the film indicates whether it was the intention or not). Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN, Clark is like a bunch of horse mangers for Lois. Literally. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN TWO I just looked at it again. As a child, I "thought" I enjoyed the action, but now I know that it was the HISTORY that kept me and saw her over and over again. If I had seen Superman Returns as a child, I would have hated it too, I think. <br /> <br /> There's so much heart and soul in this movie that it's sick. Superman gives up his powers for love as a world conspiracy is going on. Meanwhile Lex Luther has something fantastic up his sleeve. SUPERMAN THREE Now there is a three-way love story between Superman and Lana and Clark, only humanity wins and Clark's inner nature beats Superman's power, because when his SUPER moral nature is over and he is SuperHUMAN (man does with his superpowers) she does not see the power of Superman she falls in love with, not SUPERpowerman, but SUPERMORTALman she loves - and who is really SUPER. And when she tells Clark she "prefers" him to "Superman," he is thrilled, he has reestablished a human connection. He wants to be accepted who he is, not just for his ability to bend steel. This is the kind of people who are missed by Superman's RETURNS. Clark - Super sneezing to help the child strike - humanity again. Plus, it's an INERESTING use of superpowers. He not only uses pure raw power. <br /> <br /> He crushed the coal into a diamond for his wife because she had to sell hers. Love is the only thing that moves him to use his powers other than save. <br /> <br /> Superman Returns seems to have nothing at stake. Even in Superman Three we see the damage caused by the world domination plans of the Nemesis. We see suffering, we see how it affects Pryor and other people and people in the middle. There is no harm, especially not. emotionally from Lex Plan to sink the US. We see a crystal ball thrown into space. Superman had to be very creative in the first three superman to stop the conspiracy against him, he could not just access his superpowers. In the first case, he had to stop two missiles flying in different directions and then break his universal mandate and clear the story to save Lois' life ... (this was before THIRTY YEARS AGO !! ") In the second, he had to Outsmarting three guys he already does more than that, but in combination with Lex's genius and the villains' immoral tactics, Superman's overpowering was not enough, he had to fight and outwit them ... In Superman III again, his superpowers were not enough He had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything, he could not use any obvious aggression on the computer because this was calculated in advance so he had to use a benign acid only after the computer had responded to the aggression the computer was deadly, and he found this acid earlier when he could not simply use his superpowers to extinguish a fire because it was a chem It was fire, so he had to use his superpowers. He could not carry water, so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire. Now in Superman Returns he simply threw the island into the outer space, like a night for UPS. He does not have to figure out anything, he only uses his "superpower". And Lex Luther's brilliance showed at the precursor of a junkie who was just the garbage out. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that he threw this island into space after being stabbed with a Kirptonite KNIFE In the bloodstream AND the island itself spilled kryptonite spores into his face, but he just turned his eyes and nose away as if it were not Gray Poupon he was looking at.
