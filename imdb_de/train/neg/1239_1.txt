As a big fan of the "other" PLANET OF THE APES movies, I borrowed this DVD despite my distaste for Tim Burton. Again he does not disappoint with his uninspired direction. Even the make-up of the monkeys looks secondary, which is unforgivable given the monstrosity's monstrous budget. Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS was not proof of that). I was ashamed of real talents like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Undoubtedly, they were motivated by their paychecks, as it could not possibly have been the clich√©d script. I rented this DVD for a special $ 1 night and I still feel attacked.
