This deliberately bizarre adaptation of the Borges short story is typical of Cox. His strong visual feel is, as usual, broken by the horrific half-baked drama of most cast. The film is definitely in the surreal tradition of Bunuel's Mexican era and sometimes looks as if a poor man were looking at the elements of Lars von Trier's crime. Cox's obvious preference for single takes, jump cuts and ambient sound recordings counteract the film's effectiveness. Worth a look, but ultimately disappointing.
