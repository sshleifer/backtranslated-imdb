1914 was a fantastic year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in movies and he appeared in more than 30 films! Although most of these films were not very good, they gave him the chance to slowly develop his film personality. In this film, however, the well-known character "Little Tramp" was still in development. Sure, Charlie looked the part, but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often struck people for no apparent reason, kicking or doing other nasty things. <br /> <br /> As for this very small movie, it's interesting to see the cast. Although Chaplin is unfamiliar today, she starred alongside Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain - all exceptionally popular stars at Keystone Films. The problem with this movie is that while it has some nice scenes, the plot is very vague and inappropriate. Chester and Mabel reached the racetrack (a common theme in Keystone productions - it must be near a racetrack). Charlie and Mack appear and sneak in. Mack is being persecuted by the police while Charlie chases Chester and steals his girl. In the end, the police take Chester and Mack away for no apparent reason - and Charlie stayed with Mabel (strangely not deterred by Charlie's evil behaviors) This is a big, quiet comedy freak or film historian who matters only in the evolution of Chaplin , What he and the other actors actually do on stage is not unusual for a Keystone movie, but today it's not very funny.
