I remember this film, which was exhibited in 1970 in Barcelona (Spain), for a period of one week. Although it may seem incredible and I can not explain why, this film was exhibited in a theater dedicated to ... art films and great quality (Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel and ...). .. the projected man). Few people saw it (fortunately people, no doubt), and there is no evidence of this very boring SF film in the Peter Nichols science fiction encyclopedia or the author of the original novel. Very significant I remember, after all these years, a no-story, a lot of special effects that actually look ridiculous, and nothing more. It seems that in some countries the term is 90 mm. and in another 77 min. Well, it just means a little more pain.
