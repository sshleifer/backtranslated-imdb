The views of Earth allegedly falsified by NASA have recently been compared to historical weather data for the time of Apollo 11 and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records during the day. <br /> <br /> This seems to undermine the whole argument in the film that the image of the "whole earth" is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft's window. <br /> I'm waiting for Bart Sibrel now to claim that NASA's historical weather data was forged, though that would undoubtedly replace any archived newspaper copy with a weather map and those in private hands are still a problem. <br /> <br /> Ah, one answer: "Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data is a charming but weak and gullible argument, what about the rest of the film footage and evidence in the film "A wise man once said something about eating seven mosquitoes and camels, do you feel this could apply to what you're trying to do here? :-) This film is full of irrefutable evidence against the US government's claim that the lunar missions were a success, and that the man is now the true master of the universe, things are almost never quite what they seem, just look at the movie, and I'm telling you that you'll see things a little differently than before. "<br /> <br /> First, weather data does not come from NASA, it comes for hit agencies around the world. Second, the weather data undermine a big claim in the film. Third, the remaining allegations of the film are by no means "full of irrefutable evidence" but thoroughly debunked. Sibrel believed he was doing this. He was a previously secret piece of film, so he edited it and added his own interpretation. Unfortunately, his source film is public domain for him and the pieces edited by Sibrel contradict his claims.
