Ok, first the good: Cher's performance and cinematography. Although I'm not a Cher fan, she does a great job and her part was well written. The cinematography was well done and feels romantic. <br /> <br /> The Rest: a thin storyline, Nicholas Cage's performance, and a completely unobtrusive and feeble attempt to portray an Italian-American family from New York. First, every time Cage opened his mouth, I flinched. I do not know what accent he wanted to use. Honestly not, it was certainly not a New Yorker or Italian accent that I've ever heard. It was pretty surreal. And it was not because I'm a bit stricter on accuracy. His voice boomed only in my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances. Second, and this is a pure anecdote, but I have many Italian relationships, friends and acquaintances in New York City, and frankly, I have laughed more and enjoyed the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family than in this film. And that would be a boring night in the house. What a disappointment.
