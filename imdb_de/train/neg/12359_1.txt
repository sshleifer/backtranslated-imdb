I thought that was a really awful movie - in fact, I actually screamed a few times when I shouted at my TV. One or both of the gay male leads were mismanaged; There was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo looked like he would rather kiss a dog. The film deals with their long and tortured advertising, highlighting every break and make-up, but the reasons are not described in detail. These reasons would make for some interesting characters, not for the fight or make-up scene in bed (lame, even if you liked the movie.) Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters, but it does not make the movie worthwhile. Save your money.
