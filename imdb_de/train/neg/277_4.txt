Adapted by Dashiell Hammett with the help of Hellman, the Lillian Hellman play becomes a curious project emerging from hard-nosed Warner Bros. Paul Lukas, who repeats his role as Broadway and wins the Oscar for Best Actor, pulling his American wife and his three children across Europe before finding refuge in the States (across the Mexican border). They settle in Washington with the wife's wealthy mother and brother, although a frontier worker living in the manor house is immediately suspicious of newcomers and spends much time in the German embassy playing poker. It seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus, and when we realize what the heart of the material is (the wise, honest, direct refugees who teach the perplexed Americans how the world has suddenly changed), it seems to be a little condescending - the viewer is literally put in the place of relatives and read aloud. Luke has several third-act speeches that undoubtedly awarded him an Oscar, but for most of the picture he seems to have little to do, but he enters and leaves, enters, and leaves. As his wife, Bette Davis speaks like no other and brings out her big eyes, but the role does not leave her much color. Her children (all with different accents!) Are alternately funny and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has no role as an enraged wife (and the angry texture that makes her seem completely wrong). The intention here was to show us tasteful and tactful, just because a man from the time of the Second World War may be a German who does not make him a Nazi sympathizer. We get that in the first few minutes. The rest of this tasteful, tactful movie is exposure, defensive confrontation, and ultimately compassion. It should be an intoxicating mix, but it's rather dry and sluggish. ** from ****
