I thought that I would never find a horror movie as bad as "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but this movie competes with it. <br /> <br /> I'm not a person who sleeps when I've watched a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the start of Trance. I woke up and started to see it again. Why did I deserve this? The whole movie was agony, I have to use the fast forward to see it completely. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why one of my favorite actors of all time (MR. WALKEN) did this thing. I have to think that he did the director a favor, or that he really needed money, because film by film he does, he ruined himself; and so fast ... <br /> <br /> What about the movie? It's not a creepy, stupid plot, the characters are awful (but I liked the ones played by Jared Harris very well), the effects are very bad, the absence of deaths and blood, etc. in three words it all has. And I mean it. I can not stand how a director can make a movie like this. <br /> <br /> However, when I was disappointed, I saw in the video cover that the movie was presented by "Stephen King" I think he could never present that crap, right? (I rented it in Argentina). I do not recommend it in a million years. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 2 out of 10. (As I say in my review "Return of the Texas Chain Set Massacre", there will always be a worse movie, so it does not deserve 1 in 10)
