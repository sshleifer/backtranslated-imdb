Someone told me that this is one of the best adult movies. Since then, I have discredited everything that this person told me after this film. It's just awful. Without going into detailed descriptions of the different scenes, take my word for it, the sex scenes are uninteresting at best. Jenna in normal street clothes was the high point of the movie at first (she looks good), but from then on it goes downhill.
