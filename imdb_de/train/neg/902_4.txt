I suppose this movie is relevant today because it was an early Sofia Loren movie. She was 19 years old when the movie was shot in 1953. <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie because I wanted to see some of the early works of Sofia Lorens. I was surprised when she came in front of the camera after her skin was browned in brown make-up to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Today, this would certainly have been regarded as a bow and to avoid filmmaking. It was really annoying to see Mrs. Loren in the whole skin color. Yes, this movie would have been done better if the real opera singers made this movie. Then the vocals and actual facial expressions of the real artists would have been obvious. I disagree with others' comments on whether the real opera singers are older and heavier. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as Ms Loren was at the age of 19 and still is today, the film would have been better recorded even though it was performed on stage. After all, we do not see any beautiful young people on stage, while behind the stage "old opera singers" sing behind the stage. Do not forget the success of the deployment of serious opera singers. All you need to do is refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the J. G. Wentworth Company, with the opera singers singing on stage as professionally as they praise the company's product. This is one of the best and most entertaining TV commercials ever produced. <br /> <br /> The quality of film printing also makes this production a little worse. The color ink has faded a lot and that can not be helped. <br /> <br /> To improve this movie on DVD, the production company should add English subtitles so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the text is saying. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator who launches the scenes for 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie because of the story of Aida or the fact that this is an opera. Apart from Ms. Sofia Loren, none of her fellow actor is known or remembered by this writer. Instead, watch this movie if you're a fan of Ms. Loren and want to see her at the age of 19 - no matter what the production is like. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
