Not the best movie by actors. The director has focused more on the star of the projected actor than on a good entertainer. Maybe he is a hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it. But that's definitely not worth it for a neutral audience. The combat sequences are a total comedy. The music is average. This movie was the biggest flop for the actor. Despite the film's hype, the film has failed miserably. Do not even think about watching this movement, even if you want to kill time. You can watch a cartoon instead. A good movie fan can not digest this crap for 2 1/2 hours.
