I am a big fan of war films and have some experience as a Vietnamese combat doctor with the technical details. I've worked with the bomb boys more than once and have only respect for them. Other veterinarians and particularly Iraq veterinarians have very well summarized the inaccuracies in this film. Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy and therefore fails very much. No bomb disposal facility or unit would have tolerated this rogue server for more than 5 minutes. Military units value conformity and discipline for a reason, it saves lives. The opening scene was particularly annoying. The guy with the phone would have been shot immediately. The screaming "stop dialing" is not an effective deterrent. From then on things got worse. The scenes with the sniper were particularly outrageous. As others have noted, an average EOD guy does not know what it's like to be a sniper, and to believe that every Arab sniper believes that goodness really makes imagination strong. It would simply not happen to abduct an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge. Someone could shoot him, but that kind of risk is limited to the movies. I could go on, but as I said, others have pointed out these things in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it wins any prizes, it reflects once again why "La La Land" is so named.
