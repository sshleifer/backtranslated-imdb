Wow, I'm a big Henry VIII / Tudor fan and that was ... interesting. The only one I saw was Catherine of Aragon. And wow ... just wow. I have seen bad acting before, but that reached new heights. If the actress who played Catherine, umm .. cried? She whines and screams and I have to admit that I've been rewound many times ... many, many times .... funny, funny stuff. The only person who showed any slight talent at all was the actress Anne Boleyn played (I could be biased, but I'm a bit obsessed with Anne Boleyn, she was a really fascinating woman, I also know a lot about the Tudor era and read that the characters were not very well represented, they were all very stereotypical, so watch this movie only when you're ready to see a very important time, and the important life of those involved becomes a laughing animal ,
