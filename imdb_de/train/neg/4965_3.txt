For such a great classic story, the environment (location) Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I blame the script, which completely lacked the dramatic tension. The club history section is useful and would have reinterpreted the literary classic. For some strange reason, this rubric was dropped early. Knowing that was shot in 21 days, says to me, "rushed" and it shows, unfortunately. Now we have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I say to FX, I can endure really fucking CGI, but the script has to rock and this was just too slow, spartan and lacking in drama. I would blame the actors, but ... since I write more than acting, I choose my colleague.
