I saw this movie because he really enjoyed Gregory's girl many years ago. That was a jerk. The plot was a bit disgusting as the teacher and his friend perverted 14-15 year old girls in very short skirts. Former commentators seem to think that this does not matter, but I found it rather uncomfortable. If you have children at school, the last thing you want to do is to believe that every younger teacher is looking for his students. We were surprised that the censor let that through. Besides, the movie was just a waste of time. The script was bad and John Gordon Sinclair was trying too hard to restore his schoolboy's image, a little crazy and off the wall. Why someone wants to strive for him in this performance is incredible. This movie has failed for me in all points. Terrible Please do not waste your time looking at them. Life is too short
