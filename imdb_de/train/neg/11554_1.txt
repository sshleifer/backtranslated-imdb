This movie is an embarrassment to the filming. I can not believe it was even performed as a comedy - not funny. The script was not only cruel, but also the casting people should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but after that ... 99% of the rest of the cast ... ouch. Pretty much everyone ... wow it's hard even ... wow. Here's Rule # 1 about the comedy "Do not try to be funny". In Canada there are many very talented actors who can do drama and comedy - none of them was used in this movie. Canadian nepotism and casting directors help maintain bad movie production in Canada. I realize that this is actually a "US" movie, but look at the director, the actors, the location, and so on. I just saw it on Bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this movie. Again there are many great movies that can not get airtime and they show that crap.
