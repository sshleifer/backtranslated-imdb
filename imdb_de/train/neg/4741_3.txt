Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good strong action but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie. I am a younger teenager and I did not enjoy this movie very much. I thought the impact was terrible, but they may be entertaining for younger kids. The Matrix moves have ruined the action, you know it was totally unreal. Then there was the Yen Lo, an evil spirit who occasionally possesses random people and homecoming where Wendy was anxious to win. It ends up like a typical feel-good movie when Wendy and her cousin of the Buddhist monk Yen Lo defeated (and destroy him forever). Wendy is learning a lesson ... bla, bla, bla. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
