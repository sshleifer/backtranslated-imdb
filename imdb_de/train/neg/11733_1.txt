I'm shocked that there were people who liked this movie. I saw him in Tribeca, and most of the viewers laughed at scenes that should not be funny. I felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience, but honestly, the storyline needed a major overhaul. It did not make any sense at all, the characters questioned, what exactly is that, what are they snorting scene, are they hopelessly addicted and figuring out how to do that? Also, the end has just tasted the cake ... I will not spoil the great ending ... but it fit in pretty well with the rest of the horrible plot / screenplay ... watch this movie for a comedy if you have to. ,
