I do not believe in AIDS conspiracy theories, but it's sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatically. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering and paranoia of fear and dying often caused such dark fantasies. This is particularly true of the politically radical and sexually extreme peninsula of San Francisco. The city known for its beauty is rarely uglier than in this movie. A sense of darkness and decomposition permeates every scene. <br /> <br /> While acting and acting can not be described as successful, the films retain a unique cultural context and a depressingly dark mood that at least partially saves the film a complete loss. In fact, I found Irit Levi the most interesting as a cynical and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) Police officer. It is interesting, but not necessarily convincing. <br /> <br /> Highlights: The film uses the harshly tragic Turandot as an effective motif and there is a sublime, silent cameo by iconic performance artist Ron Athey.
