I saw this movie a few months ago with some friends. Today I still laugh when I think about total stupidity. Alone the first few scenes were funny. I will not spoil anything for those who want to see it, I do not want to ruin the laughter. Needless to say, the whole time I saw this movie, I figured out what exactly the meaning of the characters in this movie is. In the end, however, we all got bored as the initial merriment and shock of a movie that was so fortuitous subsided. There is no action and no trace of decent action. The figures are about as well developed as those in the "Learn to Read" book of a kindergarten. They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting.
