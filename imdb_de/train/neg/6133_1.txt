Kurt Thomas plays Jonathan Cabot, a kind of gymnast who trains for a special game in which he is hunted by a group of ninjas, but these ninjas have no chance, especially as Cabot is a gymnast! Taken as a whole, Gymkata is a damned bad movie, the cruel drama, terrible screenplay, and really incompetent governance make the quality under human standards, but this movie is so horrible that it really gets very funny. I mean with dialogue like "I know, I'll oversleep you!" or "Ha! your through!" only add to the dummy value that Gymkata gets more then. Besides, it is (cleverly) the only movie that is a hero, a gymnast who finds things to swing in the heat of the moment.
