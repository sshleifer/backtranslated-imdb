I find that several Ben Stiller films will come out or come out this year, but maybe he should insist on quality, not quantity. "<br/> <br/> Stiller's Reuben is raspy, without charm and one of the worst performances of the year Stiller's Schtick gets boring - he certainly has a weird talent, but he either has to find another fancy or take a break, to find material that's actually funny, because his films turn painless from painless to torturously bad. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a pity, because they are a good, A clever actress with a promising career, as long as she spins more films like "The Good Girl" (where she's great) and less like "Along Came Polly," she'll have a career she could be proud of /> <br /> Aniston is desperately trying to overcome the limp material she's working with, but it's a daunting task for any actress, except for a few moments with Alec Baldwin as Reuben's boss Stan and Philip Seymour Hoffman as best friend of Reuben Sandy is nothing funny in this horrible movie. Other minor characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azarias accent is not only stupid, he is terribly inglorious. <br /> <br /> The premise of "Along Came Polly" was certainly promising. Unfortunately, it took a writer who could actually turn her into a good comedy instead of that lame, boring, boring apology for a comedy.
