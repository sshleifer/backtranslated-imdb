This movie somehow reminds me of A-Mary-Kate and Ashley, only worse. I think only of the rich sisters, even if Alysons was more the actress. In this movie, Amanda Michalka was sometimes okay, but Alyson's acting stank. I think after the high school musical they had to come up with some ideas and that was definitely not the case. The story was not great and I think they should have gotten two other people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big Alyson Michalka fan and this movie did not make me any better. I think they should definitely sing and watch this movie only if you have nothing better to do (which I did not)
