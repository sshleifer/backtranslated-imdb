Maybe someday the TV will be so brutal. Maybe Big Brother was just the first step in the direction in which Stephen Richard Bachmann King described the endpoint. But enough of it. If I say too many words about the serious background theme of this film, I am doing exactly what the producers hoped to do with the selection of this material. It's the same with the 6th day. No matter how primitive the film is, it provokes a discussion about its theme, which serves the producers as a public. Let us NOT claim this. The social criticism proposed by this plot is just an alibi to allow for the production of a speculative, violent film that is more for the sale of videos than cinema. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book. I do not dare to criticize Stephen King without reading him, but when I saw the movie, I thought he could not make a bad book out of a good book: in a typical 80s set with the music of the 1980s and a few minor actors Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself as a cop in a cruel television show before murderers. The audience cheers. <br /> <br /> Along with ?? Predator, this is definitely the dumbest film from Schwarzenegger. 2 out of 10 possible stars.
