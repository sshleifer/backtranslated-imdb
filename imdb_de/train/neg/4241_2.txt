Yes, Madsen's character was right - while talking to the woman from the TV station: the LAPD is a corrupt, violent and racist police force. And this movie does not change that. Okay, here are the good police, the moral police, even a black man, a Christian, a martyr. But that's a fairy tale, admit it. The reality is not so. And especially for the action fans: The shooting is boring. It's just shoot and shoot and shoot. Nothing more. If you play Counter Strike, then at least you have something to do. The only moral of this movie is: The LAPD is good now. No bad policemen anymore. If you like uncritical, euphemistic commercials for the police and military, check out this movie. It's the longest commercial I've ever seen. (2 points for camera and editing).
