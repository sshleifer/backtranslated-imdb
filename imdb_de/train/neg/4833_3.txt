Yes, this movie is a real thief. It has stolen some brilliant Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war heroic film to increase acceptance (support?) For the wars in which the US is still struggling. I do not really want to go into politics here, but come on, that's clearer than the summer sky. Hurt Locker has nothing really outstanding, no real conspiracy. I really feel in Hungary in the 1950s when the party told people what they like and what they do not like. The same propaganda films were produced at the time, except that they were black and white. Even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the genre "US wars are cool," you certainly have much better movies to choose from.
