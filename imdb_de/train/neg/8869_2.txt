With the release of "Farligt förflutet" the Swedish film industry has reached a low point. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has led a quiet life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund). One day an old friend of Stefan comes with a favor to ask him. Stefan should do a small courier service. He is to bring a suitcase full of heroine through the Swedish-German customs. Unfortunately, things are not going as planned in Germany and Stefan has big problems now. It's always nice to see a Swedish movie that breaks the traditional family drama. Unfortunately, if the people involved in the production have no idea how to write, shoot, or cut a movie, the result can be catastrophic. The content can be concluded with: bad acting, an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogues. The only highlight in the film is the unprovoked sex scene with the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund. It only takes a few seconds, and it'll take about ninety minutes more, let's just say, what it really is, crap.
