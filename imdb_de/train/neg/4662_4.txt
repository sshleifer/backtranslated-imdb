The writers probably had no experience in the army and probably never looked at a history book, but I still give the honor of this cheaply produced war film to have taken a long look at the role of black soldiers in World War II. <br /> The action is confused and unbelievable - every episode of Combat! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing New York giant Rosie Greer was worth the money I paid for it. The art direction is the fifth installment - the men are wearing Korean war uniforms and it was pretty bad weather when the US Army reached Germany in 1944, not sunny as shown here, and I do not think the terrain resembled Northern California. The script never makes it clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. It's a nice touch, showing that some men wore Springfield rifles instead of M-1, which would probably have been used to equip secondary troops. <br /> <br /> This basic idea of ​​action (racist southern officer commanding black troops) would have had to be extended to large budget production, and it is not too late to try it now. You have to accept that for what it is, and I admire the creators of this movie for bothering you. I remember hearing that a while ago and thinking it was shot in Italy, which would have made more sense because in 1944 black combat troops were in action there.
