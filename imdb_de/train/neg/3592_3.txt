For a fan series, I have to admit that Hidden Frontier is not that bad. Checking this series, however, can not be based on whether or not it is a fan series. The initiative itself is commendable. The creativity too. I think they are people with normal jobs and a lot of enthusiasm for Star Trek. But do all this work. Use all these resources. All the time and still to take all these shortcomings. <br /> <br /> First the acting, and the lines are terrible. For the most. The dialogues belong in a military show of the 70s, not in Star Trek. The Captain (Mr. Squinty) looks like he's going to burst into laughter at any time. And most characters just read their lines. The directors should be aware of the fact that "repetition" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also think that the series was made in the style of "Two Takes Frakes" who made many TNG episodes and films. Also, I could not help but believe that most actors are typical trekkies. Without going into this assumption. <br /> <br /> My biggest concern about the whole project is the quality of the publications. When they first decided to spend so much time and resources on this series, why did not they make them available in decent quality? Using the low-resolution, fast time format is a talent waste. Even the "Higres" episodes are considered bad compared to the standard quality series. Using the Xvid codec would have greatly enhanced the experience with a larger resolution and file size. If a problem band was the problem, setting up a torrent tracker would solve the problem. <br /> <br /> Let's hope the crew decides to refresh the series and maybe release it on DVD to give quality to the project.
