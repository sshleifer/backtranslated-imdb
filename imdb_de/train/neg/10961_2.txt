Although the film may have been "true" in relation to Lewis's book (the script was literally literal), he did not manage to capture the size that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this one. The mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) are * drawn *, and as in the previous review, the flight sequence on the green screen was very hard to swallow. I almost laughed to death when I saw the humanoid beaver with its huge, stiff suits and teeth; I almost cried when I heard the wolf howling of the wolf - a man in a gray, fluffy suit was screaming as loudly and as girlyly as he could. <br /> <br /> All the acting is enormously enforced, especially that of little Lucy Penvensie ... I could only endure so much indignation and despair in the fourteen hours that I felt. The actress who plays the White Witch seems to be more on stage with all her histrionics, where a booming voice, arms spread and a brave effort at some Shakespearianem would be more than welcome. <br /> <br /> The sets feel claustrophobic, whether the scenes are indoors or outdoors. Inside, it's as if the BBC could spend only $ 100 building a set. Therefore, it is very small and all characters are constantly huddled together. White Witch's Castle is a run-down, rotten English castle with styrofoam statues and bad light. When the Penvensie children wander through the forest - actually - every scene in the forest - feels like they are just wandering in circles. <br /> <br /> The only thing that looks decent in the movie is Aslan, but you can bet the BBC probably burned the movie's budget while building the mechanical cat. It looks great when it stops and before it starts to speak, but once it gets moving you can not help the poor man in the lion's suit. <br /> <br /> Yeah, if you're an inveterate Narnia fan, you may want to watch this version simply because it preserves every word Lewis has ever written - but Lewis was certainly not a scriptwriter and many others Dialog feels clumsy and awkward on the screen. During the scene where the children are with the Beavers, preparing to flee from the wolves, Mrs. Beaver is incessantly: "Oh, just one more darling, and then we'll be ready," the children emphasized at the same time screaming and sigh and moan of "NO, Mrs. Beaver, PLEASE!" - a scene of comic relief that is so inappropriate (they are supposed to be FLEEING in front of imminent danger and not wondering if they should grab the sewing machine or not) distracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have. In fact, the whole movie is riddled with such faux pas movies. <br /> <br /> I would recommend seeing the new Narnia (Disney 2005). The new movie, with updated effects, spectacular computer animations, great timing and a beautiful and insane theft of White Witch (playing her role with the subtle evil of a seasoned politician as opposed to a screeching banshee) captures everything of the size and splendor of the world of Narnia, without affecting the least of Lewis's original vision (I think). Lucy is much nicer (NO Bock, YAY!), Just like the beaver (and realistically tall), and the brave BBC Edmund has nothing to do with the divine, desperate-hungry-for-acceptance-insecure-and-fear -An inferiority complex Edmund, who introduces the new Disney version. <br /> <br /> If you do not like losing time by making fun of Campy movies, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
