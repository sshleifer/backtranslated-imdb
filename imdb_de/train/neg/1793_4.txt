An interesting concept vampirism that has something to do with a virus (but already several times) Overall, the film is too long and moves a bit. The processing could have been narrower. I'm sorry to hear the problem with the credits. Maybe the movie was put on the market. The lighting was sometimes too dark. The worst technical problem, however, is the audio. The level was good enough to hear the dialogue, but many of the interiors echo, which is very distracting. Either they were not careful when recording, or the sound mix could have been better. Too much background noise came through. He should have got someone to make sound effects for the martial arts scenes. The slender clatter of swords that were beaten up did not sound like an epic fight. Especially in the fight scenes, the cut had to be narrower. <br /> <br /> Acting too shallow. I'm sorry, but when I see the same person writing and playing in a movie, in my experience that's a red flag.
