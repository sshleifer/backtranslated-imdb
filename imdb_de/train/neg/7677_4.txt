I stopped looking lost in this episode because I thought that Ana Lucia and Libby's death were needless and really depressing. Then I found out that they had Libby around to die in the next episode! Gah! I can not deal with it. <br /> <br /> I liked this show in the first season, but in the second season it definitely has decreased. I found the little religious feud of Jack and Locke annoying. The death of Rodriguez & Watros' characters was the last straw! <br /> <br /> I am giving this episode a 4/10 to end the end of this series, written by alias legend J.J. Abrams I hope his show will improve in the future.
