I can not imagine that anyone would ever want to see this movie in a million years. Not because it was one of the worst ever made (it was not like that), but mainly because it's about 20 years old and coming out of the mainstream. I tried to find out where I saw an actor before and it appeared. Well, yes, a kid stops playing the little league because he does not like nuclear weapons. This causes great media attention and a quick fix to the Cold War. The end. A fantasy, to be sure, but one that was so thrilled that John Lennon would blush. Since terrorism has supplanted communism as the one that has terrified us, this movie has no relevance except as an (in-depth) review of those times. Writing, acting and the film industry are similarly underdeveloped. The reason I rated it as high as I did was that I saw this movie about fifty times when I was 5-6 years old and still has a small place in my heart mustard. So, if the law of large numbers applies and anyone decides to watch this movie, you should realize that there are far better ways to spend your time, but much worse. (I will for the time being refrain from a John Q. tirade.)
