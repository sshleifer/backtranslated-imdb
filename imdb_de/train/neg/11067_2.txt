I'm a big fan of the real thriller genre, but I could not stand this lazy piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was meant to be erotic, right down to the porn soundtrack. There was no way of knowing what made Dahmer tick, no exploration of who his victims were. Nothing but "look how scary this guy is." And I have to give the filmmakers so much - their Dahmer is the scariest thing that has ever made the screen vile.
