When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it was a scary movie. Apparently it was not like that. I have no idea how this movie was shown on this website. FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is wonderful of all the actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The movie begins with a man with a scroll with a stamped signa. He breaks the seal and certain catastrophes happen. The water turns to blood, the oceans die out, the moon turns red, etc. <br /> <br /> The female figure was also annoying. Many things she did not make sense. Like when she sees a leaf with a date on it. Coincidentally, it's the date she's supposed to give birth to her baby and she's freaking out, asking for religious people and asking religious people what that all means. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <The two worst things in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God told him to kill his parents, and the end, Demi Moore dies after giving birth to his baby and putting his soul into it br /> <br /> Something happened here. The mentally retarded person is shot and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore comes to a hospital in the middle of a serious earthquake and gives birth to her child. She touches the head of her child, transmits her soul into the child and then dies. Then the apocalypse stops. <br /> <br /> Why does God suddenly have a change of heart? He becomes angry when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man, and then he is forgiven when a lonely woman transmits her soul to her baby. <br /> <br /> * End spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty stupid. It is another religious end to world propaganda. The acting of Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and all others is excellent. That's about all there is. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars. Good spectacle with a lot of nonsense!
