I love the portrayal of the 30s and 40s in the movie. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than willing to love this picture. but . , , <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No, no good. The only entertaining aspect for me was that Colin Farrell's character is an insecure author. This script approaches the audience, though it deals with the luscious theme of racism, like an ABC Afterschool Special. It did not sound like he was "acting", Sutherland was, and his minutes were few. Stale approach to a tired conspiracy.
