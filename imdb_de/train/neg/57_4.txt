What does the executive producer do in a movie? If I remember correctly, it is the person who raised the financial support for the film. In a large number of films with Sean Connery, you may find that he is also the executive producer, which means that Connery has collected the money himself as he is an important player. Unfortunately, it should also be noted that a large number of films were filmed "with Sean Connery" solely because he managed to raise the money because he is a major Hollywood player. This is usually an indication that the executive producer and the star are reading the credits. The movie is one and the same. The movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle whose story / script is not designed for scratching.

In the course of things, Mrs. Davis (who has trouble tweaking two sentences) is likely to get into more outlandish and less probable situations Hawn, who is also the executive producer of the film. Do you understand what I'm saying if the story / script is not working right?
