The basis of a television series on the works of popular authors is no guarantee for success. Yorkshire Television learned this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books of Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the collective title "The Racing Game". Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, a former jockey who had lost his eyes after an accident in which he lost his right hand just to replace it with an artificial one. Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma (and looked like one of the bad guys), while Mick Ford (who played the irritating Chico Barnes) always reminded me of a horse's butt when he was on the screen. For six weeks, this less-than-dynamic duo ventured out in the countryside, plundering nefarious plans to repair races, usually using the same methods - blackmail, abduction of riders, or doping horses. Yorkshire Television threw money on the show, but to no avail. She became violent, sexist, far-fetched and quickly repeated herself in the nude's yard.
