OK, I got this movie halfway, but without the Book Group, even though he has at least proven he can act if he wants! (The part of someone who has a heart attack is a bastard of the bad movie in terms of acting, screenplay, and overall plausibility.) It seems to be an intake of Human Traffic, but that's not the best movie ever, it's at least original and had actors whose delivery was not like those of serious but desperate GCSE students trying to get top marks. Not as much as Human Traffic as a bit of a car accident!
