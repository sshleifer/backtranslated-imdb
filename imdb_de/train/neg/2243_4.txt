It's not even worth a check, except as a warning to potential viewers. It is a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress following a studio while filming a World War II drama. There is no fear, no tension or surprises. A shocking moment that looks a little too stupid to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and boring, although occasionally really nice edits are made. The story never comes together and the movies are really just a total bust. 10.4.
