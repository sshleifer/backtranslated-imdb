The brain (or head) that would not die is one of the more contemplative low-budget films of the early 1960s. It is very hard to imagine how a script that is so disgustingly sexist could have been written without the intention of self-parody. And the themes repeatedly voiced by the female lead role, Ginny Leith - a severed head kept alive by machines, I-Vs, and clamps - seem to confirm that the film should simultaneously exploit and criticize gender stereotypes. Shadow of the undervalued box-Helena. <br /> <br /> The gender movements are abundant and about as irritating as an army of angry ants. The dialogue is hyperbolic, overly dramatic and unbelievable, and the drama is just OK (but not consistent). Why did I give this movie a 4? Because a part was clearly thought about. I'm not sure at what point the movie actually tried, but it seems clear that it's unusually nervous and ruthless (without the blood and courage that today's audience expects). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there are really no heroes in this movie and none of the characters are particularly personable. All in all, this is a rather painful and disturbing look at the early days of American Pop Sexuality of the 1960s, from the point of view of a woman who remained alive despite a missing body after a fatal car crash. Her lover threatens to sew her a fresh, high-quality body and force her to live with him. She is understandably unenthusiastic about all of this and has to make friends with a creature almost as monstrous as her friend. Oh, there are also some vague references to the clich√© of the 1950s / 60s about the ills of science running amok. <br /> <br /> Recommended for B-sci-fi students and doctoral students in gender studies. O / W is not recommended.
