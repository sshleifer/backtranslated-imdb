When this movie was released in 1997, the "special effects" as they are, were bad. They would even have been dated back to the 1980s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s had the same or better SFX work. Certainly no one involved in the production of this film sought an Oscar. It's a wild departure from director Fred Olen Ray's usual stuff, most of which have the word "bikini" in the title (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls from the Lost Planet, etc.) and are little more than just T's & A films Here we are rated with a movie with "U" and aim directly at the children. You have to give him recognition for diversification !! This was a small direct video cult hit that later led to some sequels - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career went downhill fast after the 1982's "ET") plays the "invisible mother" of the movie title and returned for the sequel. Russ Tamblyn (whose career has been in freefall since the 1961 "West Side" story) plays the vicious Dr. Woorter, and one can say that most of the cast was at the point where they were ready to work almost anything just to pay the bills this month - except maybe the young Trenton Knight as Josh. It's rather something to say that even though he worked before this movie, this kid actor after the sequel "Invisible Mom 2 After all, he was not all that bad for a child actor - neither better nor worse than his more experienced co-stars. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, these are The "invisibility" effects are not to say the least, the direction is bad, the writing is obvious and the acting is not something to write home about but there are also films, and for all unt For ten years, this movie is undoubtedly good to see. Most adults will probably want to do a vanishing act themselves while it's running, and I would not accuse them a bit!
