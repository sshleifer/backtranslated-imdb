How can you tell that a horror movie is awful? Of course, if you can not stop laughing! The plot was well covered by other reviewers, so I'll just add a few things to the hilarity. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have placed the situation in South America, others in Africa, I thought It was on any island in the Pacific. Where exactly this happens seems to be a mystery. The cannibal trunk is made up of two black women, black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa beating the drums ... the devil god is a big black man with a terrible fall of pink eyes. <BR /> <br /> One of the "craziest" moments in the movie is when "Pablito" hangs his partner on a tree covered with an orange substance that I suspect is blood (that's actually funny) and then his partner's head falls into the ground and "Pablito" steps in a bit for what I call "shit and giggle" and the eyes are actually moving ... <br /> <br But of course The "freak" disappeared when you realize that the eyes have moved because the movie is just bad ... <br /> <br /> I had not laughed that long, and I definitely recommend this movie for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do ... grab a case of beer and watch this movie, you'll love it! If you're looking for a real horror or gore movie, do not worry.
