Marilyn Miller made only three films before her untimely death - the wonderful SALLY (1929), the comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and the trifle - SUNNY (1930). It's pretty poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical - even though she has four dance numbers, she only sings two songs (WHO? And ONE MAN ALONE). The rest of the score, including the sparkling theme tune, is thrown overboard, though the latter can be heard in the background. Miller seems overweight and amateurish - no star quality. Even her dancing is perfect. The film is written very poorly, stock of stale and listless jokes and stupid situations. If you're interested in Miller as a performer, have a look, but stay away for general entertainment.
