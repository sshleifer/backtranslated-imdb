Carlo Verdone once succeeded in combining great comedy with clever and subtle social analysis and criticism. Then something happened, and he became another boring director Il Mio Miglior Nemico can be more or less summarized in one line: "working class = friendly and warm, while upper class = snob and cunning but love wins in the end". <br /> <br /> Such a banal clich√© for such a smart director. <br /> <br /> There is not much to talk about in the movie. Every character is a walking stereotype: the self-made man who forgets his roots, but who becomes "good" again, the spurned woman, the rebellious rich girl, who falls in love with the honest, but poor fellow barely average. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing in every way.
