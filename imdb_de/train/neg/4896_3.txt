I start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really liked the songs, everything about them was great, the costumes, music, lyrics (if the translation was good :)), choreography, everything <br /> <br /> I have the crab scene and the cooking scene loved. <br /> <br /> But that's it. <br /> <br /> I understand Arty Cinema, Blablabla, but too much is too much. Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of auditory and occasional groaning, really ...), too much boredom (no movie should ever be boring, no matter how deep it should be!), Too many porno-like ones Scenes (I really understand, I understand that they made a porn movie there, but really, really, that's too much) I really think cinema should be to look at and this is definitely in no way to be seen. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for the songs.
