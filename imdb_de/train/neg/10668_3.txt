This movie had some great actors! Unfortunately, they had forgotten to act. I had hoped the movie would get better over time, but the drama was so robotic it was doomed from the start. It actually seemed that the actors were reading a script all the time. Maybe it was the musical score or the director himself, but one thing is for sure, the make-up artist is looking for another job! The face powder was so thick that you could see it on the faces of the actors! Would not recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder he never came to the cinemas. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods are ashamed of you for not giving everything. The plot was great and needed much more.
