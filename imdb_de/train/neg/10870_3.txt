Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million. His uncle has paid 3 women Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to accompany him and ensure that he does not stumble on prospectors. Such a lady Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) appears on the ground to disapprove of the women. We're following the story of girls being offered more money to appear on a show, rather than their escort role, which they agreed to for the three months Bill is in New York, while Bill joins Cleo and one other woman meets. In the end, love is in the air for Bill and another ............. <br /> <br /> Image quality and sound quality are poor in this movie. The story is interspersed with musical numbers, but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not that good either. He is pleasant enough, but he only really comes to life when he plays drums or trombone. There is a very irritating character playing a taxi driver (Roscoe Karns) and the movie is just boring.
