(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "actioner" (and I use the term loose) that I've been trying to watch for over a year. I have finally reached the end and now I wish I would not afford the repeated efforts. <br /> <br /> To save two hours of your life, I tell you that he is plotting - A guy who has the ability to project a long blade from his arm returns home to his mother see. Things get ugly after being beaten up by an old friend's mafia friend. He takes his revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home. The mafia moms send their men out for revenge while the cops look for him. <br /> <br /> Very little is said. There is really no explanation for anything (such as why they locked up their girlfriend in an asylum) and most of the action is all off the screen. The movie essentially consists of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody, who looks intense and says nothing, killing people (outside the screen, most of the action happens off-screen). It looks good, is well played, and if there was a reason for it, there could have been a good movie. Hell, I wanted a feel for real character development or background story (we just know the guy was picked as a kid). The movie lasts almost two hours and feels like six. If they did not tell us, they could at least speed up the pace, making them seem to move too fast. No, instead we get the hero on a boat. The hero in a bus, the hero runs, the hero looks distraught. It really annoyed me, thinking that this would have been a good movie if they had just done something, or if someone actually said something useful other than giving instructions to "get that guy." <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 It's about four hours (all my attempts to see that), I'll never be back. Only for those who want to see a brooding Russian action movie with very little action
