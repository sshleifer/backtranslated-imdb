This is one of those movies that seemingly tried to ride the martial arts wave fever. A bit like Billy Jack, I think. However, while Billy Jack had a notable martial arts scene, there are none in this scene unless you consider some gentlemanlys and clashes as such. We are introduced to the star who has described that he learned judo in the Marines. I've been to the Marines and although they've pretty well established themselves in boxing, I really do not remember the emphasis on judo. As a result, the opponent Macsmurs, James Macarthur, refers to the judo as he apologizes for why he, a wrestler of the state master, was so easily defeated. Lame.
