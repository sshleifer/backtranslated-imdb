This is a simple story, but it feels very manipulative. It lacks the pathos, because it leaves no room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection. <br /> <br /> The animation is well done, but I think it is too present. I would have liked more pictures from behind, more space in the background and maybe that does not feel so cheesy. <br /> <br /> But for a Hollywood style movie, it works OK, but Aardman is very derivative films and that bothers me. Maybe a longer movie will test if this manufacturer can do without voice-over. <br /> <br /> I think the voice-over is too lean.
