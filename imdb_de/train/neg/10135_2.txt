I just saw this movie on Starz. Let me go over some things that I thought could be improved. Acting, writing, directing, special effects, camera crew, sound and lighting. It also seemed that the authors had no idea what the film was about. Apparently in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, one could buy a sophisticated stealth bomber that could become completely invisible for $ 75 million. Nowadays, these things cost about $ 3 billion and they can not become invisible. Apparently you can fly from the US to the Middle East in an hour. There was a completely random lesbian scene that I did not mind, but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it. The camera randomly enlarges the actors and jumps to random scenes. Oh yes, since it's a Steven Segal movie, it's predictable as hell. All in all, I wrestled with Snakes on a Plane at the top.
