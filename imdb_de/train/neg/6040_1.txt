Where to start, this movie started bad and ended badly! It's made up of extremely bad drama and unrealistic effects that huddled in my seat, seriously, my cat could have acted better than that crowd. Some of them were actually ridiculous because they were so incredible, d. H would rate this lower, but they have nothing else! So, pay attention to my warning and if you are not so bored that you are close to suicide and want to have a good reason to continue your suicide mission, do not bother with it. I am still shocked that this could actually be made public, this should be a crime and all those involved should be arrested. I assume you have the key now, so I leave it to you to decide.
