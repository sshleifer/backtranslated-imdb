Simon Pegg plays the role of Sidney Young, a stereotypically awkward idiot Briton who works as a prominent journalist in this American comedy. After a happy break, he starts working for the respected Sharps magazine of the reliable Jeff Bridges in New York. It's more the devil carries Prada than Shaun the Dead. Kirsten Dunst, who works well with Pegg for laughing, does not care for the unwanted love interest, but they do not set fire to the screen with their passion. <br /> <br /> Sidney faces some emotional challenges and tries to decide if this is the case he should forget his journalistic principles to get material in the journal. Of course, he is ultimately seduced by the glamor and glamor of the celebrity world, especially the young star Sophie Maes (Transformers' Megan Fox). Fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if Pegg himself has ever experienced similar emotions with this film in real life and Run Fat Boy Run is considered one of the UK's best comic talents ruined by the US /> <br /> All in all, this is an unforgettable comedy. Please come back to us Simon, we can forgive and forget.
