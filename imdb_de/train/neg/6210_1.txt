This is the worst movie I've seen with Lindsey Lohan since "I know who killed me." <br /> <br /> After seeing this movie, I can assure you that you expect nothing but frustration and disappointment should you decide to see it. Hey, Tim Burton, I used to be a big fan of you ... did you even show this movie? I seriously, what the f% # k? <br /> <br /> Without betraying, here is the story in a vague nutshell ... Nine wakes up, he makes things, his actions and decisions are irrelevant. .. and the movie ends. Oh wait ... here comes a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler alarm! Spoiler alarm! At the end of the movie .... it rains. I think part of my soul died during the movie.
