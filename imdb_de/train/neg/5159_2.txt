When you watch this movie, it's like eating a banquet out of nothing but meringue. It looks great at first, but does NOT offer satisfaction - none. <br /> <br /> The plot is a jumbled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil. So how is it possible that with this basic plot AND Robin Williams the movie is still so bad ?! It's because the picture looks completely devoid of substance - much like the horrible Popeye image that Williams made at the beginning of his film career. The film must have cost a fortune, but maybe there was not enough money left to hire writers who had graduated from elementary school. I'm not really sure why it was done at all - it was certainly not meant to be any kind of entertainment.
