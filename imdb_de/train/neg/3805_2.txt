Um ... this movie is shitty. A LOT OF. <br /> <br /> I read some of the other reviews. Apparently, there are many people who think that everything Woody Allen writes or plays is automatically good ... I've seen some of his films, in vain hope that I'm missing something. But no, they just suck. Badly written garbage. The characters are all very clich√©d (not to mention stupid). The plot is ... I think it should be mysterious. IM not sure. Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, any other movie you've seen of him. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Woody Allen, check out this movie. If you are under 50, do not bother. (If you're a fan of Woody Allen AND you're under 50 ... well, you're atypical, I do not know what to say.
