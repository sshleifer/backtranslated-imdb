Who has to go to the bone: David Jannsen was 38 years old and played the father of Robert Drivas, who was 31 at the time -25 in the script - which still puts Jannsen in parent classes in Junior High). I assume that the AMA wrote a medical miracle in medicine in 1938. This film has not aged very well and now it is his main incentive to see only a snapshot of Sin City (circa 1969) and all the constant smoking and funny hair (Drivas has an atomic comb that makes him look very much alike) Hip Cousin It) and trendy fashion that went along. If anyone remembers, LV was not in London right now ... The city has been baffling mob and codger players these days. Drivas is sexually ambiguous; His father says he may be gay (in a sad irony, Drivas himself died of AIDS at the age of 47), and the soap conflict is due to the problem of the generational gap (um, as if one could call a gap for 7 years). Sonny Boy wants to be his own man, and Dad wants to pull him into the casino (Caesar's Palace!) And equip him with girls (including the horny Edy Williams). Interestingly enough, the son does not seem to mind being thought gay - unusual for the time, and a cute Brenda Vaccarro is nearby to beat him flat. What nudity is is terribly lame - just what it took to get the public into the 'early' days of the MPAA rating system (which was then G-M-R [16] - and X) for an 'R' rating. The cut is awful and there are stupid fools from The Committee (a neo-avant-garde comedy troupe of the late '60s who mercifully disappeared from the map within a few years). Don Rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer ... he is apparently preparing him for a position as floor manager in the much better CASINO two decades later. In order to give away nothing, they would have dealt with Mr. Rickles's character with power tools and a hole in the desert. Curiosity, at best, far from Joshua Logan's usual work. Dos / slides. Now look again CASINO ...
