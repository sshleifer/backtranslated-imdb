The movie stays in the gray for far too long. Very little is said in the course of the film, which causes many strange sequences to have a deeper meaning, but due to the way they are told, they only become eerie and unintelligible. It somehow forces you to look at the movie again, but in no way will I do that. I saw this movie in the morning. I'm sure if I saw this movie in the evening, I would have fallen asleep. For me, the movie was like a "blade runner" of a poor man. <br /> <br /> The film leaves too many questions and improbabilities. This leaves the film a meaningless and lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Even the strange look of the film does not help much. The film is cut in half CGI halves the real life, but not half as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative, as would be the case in later films such as "Sin City" and "300". They even made half of the movie's characters on a computer, which was a very pointless and strange choice, though the character animation did not seem too impressive. Sure, the futuristic environment is still handsome and the movie was obviously not cheap, but its style was overly and in that case, that's not really positive. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines are also absolutely terrible and uninteresting. The main god of the movie is constantly saying lines like; "I'll do that, but it's not your concern why I want to do it." Then do not say anything, Mr. Horus! It is irritating and very easy to put into a movie if you do not want to explain anything about the plot. Even the deeper questions and meanings of the film are confused by the twirling of the film and its screenplay. The actors have still done their best. They seemed to believe in the project and were sure that what they were doing would be special. So I can not say anything negative about her. <br /> <br /> The story and the movie are anything but original. It's rip off many classic and semi-classical, mostly modern sci-fi movies. It may also be the reason why the film made a very superfluous impression on me. <br /> <br /> A failed and uninteresting experiment
