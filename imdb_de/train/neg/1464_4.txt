I watched as I hoped to find something that I did not know about the most notorious man in modern history, and could not help believing that the story was rewritten in HITLER: THE RISE OF EVIL. Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to meet one of her admirers. Hitler appeared with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Excuse me for asking, but did not the authors confuse Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana of SCARFACE? That's bad enough, but what really offended me is that this mini-series lacks whole parts of the historical context. Germany lost the First World War, and the Allied powers made Germany pay a high price for it. It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride, and therefore they turned to National Socialism. The German humiliation of the twenties caused by the Allies seems to be completely absent. Therefore, HITLER: THE RISE OF EVIL can not be taken seriously as a historical document, and I have not even mentioned that Himmler and GÃ¶ring are conspicuous by their absence. <br /> <br /> There is a positive point in the miniseries and that is Robert Carlyle in the title role. Okay, some of his manners are wrong and his voice is a bit too loud (archive footage shows that Hitler had a gentle, seductive voice), but Carlyle is a charismatic actor who manages to convey Hitler's own charisma on screen. Comments in the British press that Carlyle looks more like the Sparks synth player than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and he gives one of Hitler's better interpretations. <br /> <br /> I liked the performance of Robert Carlyle, but I hated everything else about this miniseries and wondered why on earth it was ever done. There is nothing that serious history buffs can recommend
