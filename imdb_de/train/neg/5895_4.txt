Is Miike like Chabrol, the art alternates with dirt and sometimes confused the two? Does he agree with the value of fifty / fifty of an assertion for Chabrol? Do we see too much or too little Miike here? I dont know. I dont know. I dont know. But I could easily fill ten lines by quoting the steals, allusions and clich√©s of Chakushin ari (One Missed Call). Others here will meet most of them, but maybe not Ochiais Saimin (hypnosis) for the filthy television program that mocks the supernatural things. Only once, when Yumi hugged the zombie-like mother, did One Missed Call frighten me a bit. <br /> <br /> Another interesting point: Renji Ishibashi (who looks like Christopher Walken) as a detective. Ishibashi in auditions of abusive backstory, and as Dead or Alive's boss Aoki drowns the vat of excrement and more, he may be the most convincingly evil character actor I've ever seen. So here he is a policeman.
