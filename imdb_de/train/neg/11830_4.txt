OK, maybe a 13-year-old like me was a bit too old for this movie. It's about this spoiled rat living in a palace. Then a sewage rat flushes it in the toilet! He lands in this rat town and meets this girl rat, who has a jewel that wants a greedy frog. He will do everything for this gem, after these two rats he sends a whole army. He plans to take the gem and flood Rat Town! The cool part about this movie are the snails. They all make sound effects. They sing, make sounds, it's great, it's also pretty funny. OK the bottom line, it's meant for 7-year-olds. Otherwise, a great movie to see a younger family member. I did not think the animation was real dream art, more like WAllace and Gromit. I thought that they had eased a bit. The movie was just decent, but it's not worth spending $ 9.50, sorry.
