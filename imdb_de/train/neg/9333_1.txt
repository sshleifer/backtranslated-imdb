Awful!!! I do not want to be too negative, but this movie has an IQ of stupid monkey. What a disaster. I just could not believe how bad this movie is Just awful, the music sometimes like a soundtrack for Lawrence of Arabia. I've just seen this movie to see how much worse it can get that can hang down on my body falling to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor, but who knows, maybe he's in a financial crisis to take part in such a fiasco movie. , , , , This film should have been presented to all students in all film schools, just to teach them a lesson on how to make a movie
