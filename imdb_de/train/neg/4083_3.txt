I saw this movie when it was released, and my dislike for it has been with me all these years. <br /> <br /> Here's the reason: <br /> <br /> Greenaway's goal seems to be to take every literary image at Tempest and literally do it. If a figure said, "My heart flies," we would be shown a real human heart with pigeon wings fluttering across the screen. <br /> <br /> This process makes some lush tableaus, but in the end it's easy practice. And it gets deadly boring. <br /> <br /> I do not like the joy that other viewers have found in this film, but it's worth noting that not all viewers were excited.
