I think this sucked on ice because it left the cube and gave us lots of information about who and why. The original CUBE never left the cube, and it left everything to your imagination. However, this crap festival gives you everything. and I do not like it ... Although the acting is solid, I think the reason was a downer, because it was made by people other than the ORIGINAL filmmakers, if Vincenzo Natali this prequel or even the I think it would have been better made and would have remained faithful to the source. I recommend you stay away from this movie and HYPERCUBE, another movie I do not even want to talk about ... (I gave him a 2 only for acting)
