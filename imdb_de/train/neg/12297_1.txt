Witchy Hildegard Knef catches a group of people in a remote hotel and pulls them out in a twisted, disgusting way. I thought I saw everything until an unfortunate man was crucified and then set fire to the head. Hildy is also quite a joke: she takes a gnawing harpy and closes her mouth ... Then she hangs her up just in time for a blazing fire in the fireplace! "Witchery" made me sick. It hurt my eyes. I was ready to write it off as the worst film ever made by competent people ... until the finale. I have to admit that I loved the end. It is a boy and his toy tape recorder, cornered by Linda Blair. The scene lasts only about a minute and the movie is over, but you know the old adage is, "If you have a great ending, people will forgive you everything!"
