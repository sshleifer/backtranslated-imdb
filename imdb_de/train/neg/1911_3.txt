Formula film of a guy who wants a girl, a guy who will lie to come alongside a girl, a guy who makes the best friend to help outrageously (comedus reliefus, no?) To help Fooling a girl, etc. and with rare exceptions from a few Z ratings, it was done better. <br /> <br /> Stale plot aside, the leads are attractive and there are a few good moments. Jonathon Schaech did a better job, and his acting was about to be called. Not a complete loss, but nothing new in this lukewarm affair.
