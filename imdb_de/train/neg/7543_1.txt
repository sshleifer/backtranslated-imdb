A soldier is at the side of the road, making sure everyone keeps to the speed limit (doing his job); He then turns over a woman who seems to be a mother (in the backseat is a child); He then tells her what is going on and BAM ... they are killed. Okay, that's the beginning of what I personally thought would be a good movie. When I saw this movie in the theater, I was with some friends. This was our first evening after the summer so we wanted to watch a good movie. We all decided to see an exciting thriller that looked good to everyone in the group ... that was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Not only was I wasting $ 7oo on a movie ticket, but also having to endure torture for the brain. This film started with a mystery and tension and I seriously thought, "That can not be bad" ... I was so wrong. The whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense; Even if you can overcome the bad acting, the "not-so-scary" storyline, and the all-out mess of this movie, you'll still be confused. That's not because you're not smart enough to understand it, but because no one with a brain could understand what this stupid movie is about. At the moment you may be thinking, "Oh man, I just have to watch this movie to see if it's as bad as this person says". GET THAT NOW HAS THOUGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD !!! I try to spare you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it is so bad that it makes no sense to even consider it. Please do not make people the same mistake I thought this movie has potential ... it does not. I give this movie 1 out of 10 points (if I could give a zero, I would do that), and I do not recommend anyone to watch this movie. This freaking movie is over.
