Ouch, what a painfully boring sci-fi movie! And that is especially sad, because the first 15 minutes were so full of action and full of possibilities! During the intro we follow a bunch of nervous security officials and hire thugs chasing a doctor who has escaped from a mysterious lab with a briefcase full of top secret files. When he is about to expose the supposedly terrible and inhuman events in the lab, he is executed. Numbers ?? From then on, the "action" switches between two places, the above lab and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator (or something), and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the opposite of worrying. More like boring, pointless and vague. The scientists chose four random people with no living relatives, and it is really important that they speak the truth, even when a huge machine reads their contents. They all hide dark secrets from their past and people suffer when they are revealed. However, I do not understand how these tests could ever lead to a device threatened by humanity. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt it. Even less interesting are the interactions between patients and doctors, because actually none of them has a personality. Basically, "The Brain Machine" is just a couple of lame people living in a terribly decorated room. The movie could have been half an hour shorter if not thousands of buildings had stopped! The transfers from the laboratory to the villa and vice versa are indicated EVERY SINGLE TIME by a five-second setting of the places. Either the makers needed the upholstery or they just assumed that all sci-fi spectators are idiots who can not notice a change of location themselves. For the tenth time in just five minutes to stare at a deserted pool with a villa in the background, gets pretty annoying, I assure you. James Best's performance as a reverend with mental issues is pretty decent, but a man definitely can not save that thing from a waste of time. Avoid!
