This film is a vehicle for the Schwarzenegger clone Alexander Nevsky. His charisma, however, is not enough to lift this movie beyond the level of his bad script. He has little to add to his Arnie Act. Michael York is quite pathetic as a begging diplomat. Seeing him attend his D'Artagnan act from the time he was a better actor made me uncomfortable. Come on, you can do it better! <br /> <br /> The story is full of holes and inexplicable relationships. At the top of this bill is the informer of Vlad, who sounds like an American, but from the context apparently seems to work for a Russian government department In the communist regime, all Russian characters are still very communist. In contrast, Vlad is allowed to drive a commercial vehicle rolled up as a company car. The action scenes are badly shot and therefore not very dynamic. <br /> <br /> No need for a movie ...
