I've bent all the way through the movie. First of all, the idiotic conspiracy has little to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood has been trying to create a kind of comedy chase. Imagine, "Englebert sings Hendrix". <br /> <br /> Take nothing about this movie, to be exact. The name Parsons in the title and stealing his body is only used as a springboard for a low-budget pursuit film, a blatant attempt to fetch a few dollars from the Parsons heritage and his fan base. Grams father was long dead in 1973, the other global characters are fictitious, none of which has anything to do with Gram's life or death. <br /> <br /> If you're a Gram fan, I advise you not to watch this movie I wish I had not. It is sad to see that something special is treated as such shameful food. I would swear I could hear Gram turning in the grave while the movie is playing. If you are unfamiliar with Gram's life and heritage, do not take anything in this movie as a representative of grief. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram was still alive and saw this movie, he would kill himself. On the other hand, he might be afraid if he knew that this movie would be the result.
