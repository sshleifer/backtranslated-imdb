This is the worst piece of crap I've ever seen - actually it was so bad that I did NOT have to look at it :-) <br /> <br /> The CGI is sooo bad, it's fun! It's not even close to the crappy CGI animations in Spawn, it's that bad, har har har ... <br /> <br /> I'm amazed at the fact that some distribution companies have actually spent money on the release this on DVD, but I guess they'll make more money out of it that way, because the production cost was no more than a few hundred dollars. <br /> <br /> It's so terrible that a kindergarten class could have done it. <br /> <br /> See and laugh!
