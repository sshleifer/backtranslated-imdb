The chart for descent, if it can actually be called a chart, has two notable events. One at the beginning - one at the end. Together, these events may account for 5% of the total movie time. Everything (and I mean everything) in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill the minutes. I like annoying movies, I like dark movies and I do not mind dark scenes - but if you expect me to play hazy / dark (literally) scenes without a story for 60 minutes, then there's something else coming up. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses, is totally wasted here. And no, she will not get naked, not even in the NC-17 version that I saw. <br /> <br /> If you want to throw away a few hours and see "Descent", take a nap instead - you'll probably have more interesting dreams.
