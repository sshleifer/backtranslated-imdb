I liked the original premise of this movie, which made me chase it, but the problem I quickly found is that you know pretty well what will happen in the first 20 to 30 minutes (the double come behind the mirror and take over all). <br /> <br /> There's no real twist (which is fine), but the final revelation does not make much sense (how can she fight with uncertainty and fear around the world?) entire movie if she's a nasty one Idiot is beyond the mirror?). Admittedly, the scenes 'beyond the mirror' were frightening when they first appeared, and the murder of the blonde is actually scary, but in the end unfortunately it seems to be a movie that looks like one Looking for a story or a more engaging script. The accumulation of the atmosphere on the atmosphere and the creepy sound design for 80-90 minutes does not really matter, it actually gets pretty boring.
