Oh man. While Chevy Chase and the band at SNL have reached new heights with the Sketch Show format, this fails at every level. Fortunately, Chevy is barely involved and can not be held responsible for this tripple. It's really, very bad. Although it should be a political commentary on the US at the time of its publication (1974), it remains neither funny nor acutely observed. The sketches are far too long and any satirical effect they may have is lost as they all end in utter boredom. This is credited as Chevy's movie debut, and I am glad that everything he did afterwards made it better. Avoid even if curious.
