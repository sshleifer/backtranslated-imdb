Who thinks that this film was not appreciated for its funny genius, must have smoked with the two Stoners in the film. This movie is NOT undervalued ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparison between this movie and The Naked Gun or Airplane, as the last two movies are well written and funny. Class reunion is not one of those things. The sad part is that it had such a potential (good cast, good storylines), but the good jokes are rare. The scenes that were meant to be funny were more annoying than amusing. The Stoner boys, the vampire, the blind girl ... NOT funny. The only funny character was Delores (the one who sold her soul to the devil). National Lampoon made some really good movies (Animal House, Vacation), but this is not one of them. I certainly expected more from John Hughes.
