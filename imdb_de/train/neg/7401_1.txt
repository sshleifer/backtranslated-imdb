* Sigh * Let's Finns, take a stupid idea, blow them up and try to market them as cool. Lordi is a mediocre band at best, and a single gimmick will only get you that far. <br /> <br /> To all you idiots market: This is the reason for the inherent minority complex that often happens in Finland trying to export something. <br /> <br /> Lordi is not scary. Lordi is lame. Lordi is OVER. <br /> <br /> I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this idiotic idiocy. Sure, they won the Eurovision. <br /> <br /> No, wait - you won the Eurovision. That's it. I rest my case.
