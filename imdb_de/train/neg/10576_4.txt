I was very excited when this series premiered in 2005. The premise was very simple and engaging: each episode would be a one-hour mini-movie directed by a famous, notable horror director. When I finally saw her, it was a bit disappointing. There were some good episodes from this first season, but all in all, it was a mixed mix. I attributed it to the learning curve and thought that Season 2 would be much better. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was in shock. At least the first season had some good stories here and there. Season 2 (with the exception of "The Black Cat" with the excellent Jeffrey Combs) was a total loss for me. The episode "Sounds Like" may be the worst thing I've seen on television in the last 10 years, and most other episodes are not much better. I really hope the third season will be this year, but I'm not holding my breath.
