This is the kind of movie that should be embarrassing to anyone involved. Bad direction, exaggerated acting and a conspiracy that shows only by force. I thought, when I saw it for the first time, maybe it was a satire of the media and how it shows violence, but it's not like that. I'm not sure what makes the movie worse. Oliver Stone does his worst director. From scenes in which Woody transforms Harrelson's face for no reason, or from Robert Downey Jr.'s dreadful performance as Wayne Gale, who is a reporter who looks totally crazy, this movie is just a mess.
