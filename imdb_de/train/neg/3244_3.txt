The effect of this story on a psychiatrist dealing with competitors is so brutal that I have to assume that this was the intended intention. The sets are artificial and I never felt like watching a movie. It seemed like the actors were just reading their lines instead of reacting to each other. While the film contains elements of the early film noir (except that it is in color), the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to realize that it is a parody of the genre. <br /> <br /> In the face of the presentation No appeal to me, I expected at least an exciting story. Usually I'm pretty slow when it comes to storytelling stories, but you could see what came here in the first fifteen minutes. At the time of "I forget the $ 80,000," I thought that this thing is really ridiculous. You can not believe a psychiatrist with experience in gambling addiction to be so stupid. If at some point she had behaved like a normal, intelligent person, the whole story would have fallen apart. <br /> <br /> This wood production left me cold.
