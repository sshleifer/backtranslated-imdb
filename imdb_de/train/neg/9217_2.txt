Yeah, the only thing that makes this movie memorable is that it had a younger Tom Hanks who would be a relevant star in Hollywood just a few years later. However, here is not a movie that will bring its talents to bear to a great extent, and the only other thing that can be considered entertaining in relation to this film is the scene in which it thinks it sees a monster and to go through a guy. Yes, this movie is about the evils of a game in which a group of people uses their imagination and tries to develop interesting scenarios. Basically, an after-school special is about the evils of the game. Dungeons and Dragons have been cleverly renamed as Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the creators of the film felt that nerds should not have fun unless they went out and minors drinking alcohol, taking drugs, having unprotected sex and bothering other weaker children, like all popular kids. No, these bad people played a game that actually needed a brain, the sky is no! Not that, when they have a brain, they are actually able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups. Yes, I think this movie is absolutely stupid and a waste of time. Granted, it could be a movie against addiction, but there are far fewer people who died when dungeons and dragons went too far than to say what drunken driving claimed in a month.
