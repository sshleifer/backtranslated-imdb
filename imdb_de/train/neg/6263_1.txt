Henry Sala's "Nightmare Weekend" is a lazy piece of mud from Troma. This is a youthful, sloppy and stupid low budget horror movie about some teen girls spending the weekend in a mansion. The professor's evil assistant lures the girls into a bizarre project She uses a brain implant to turn her victims and her data into zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a completely braindeaded piece of rubbish that has a lot of nudity and some cheesy blood, not to mention a ridiculous music is terrible and the script is completely incoherent. Why such a piece of crap is widespread, is not me. Avoid it like the plague. 1 out of 10.
