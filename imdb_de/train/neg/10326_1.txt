Canadian television once again trumps and creates another show that remains unexpected after its premiere episode. <br /> <br /> Last time I recall that sitcoms should cause a reaction that we call laughter in the business. How fun is it to beat the stereotype of whites who believe that all Muslims are terrorists? OK, maybe a joke, just to keep it with the masses. But not 30 minutes. It's about hitting a dead horse. Even SNL would be able to give up after a commercial break. <br /> <br /> Let us also have a little conflict with these scripts. Will she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break fasting in Ramadan? When will Ramadan begin? Ohhhh, that's Emmy, who gets stuff here. <br /> <br /> And the characters! What characters ?! It's all cardboard cutouts, without anything interesting that would take us from one situation to another. That's the point of the situation comedy. We need strong, interesting and dynamic characters to make us stand out from the television every week. We need to look after these characters to worry about the difficulties they will face next week. If I never see these characters, it's too soon. Luckily I can not remember any of their names (hint to CBC - that's not a good sign). <br /> <br /> And the acting is so bland. It's more of a casting problem than the actors. None of these people actually embodies the characters they play. They only seem to do their part as if they were working on a movie of the week. Sitcoms call for actors who live and breathe this character - falling in love with them - where they are inextricably linked to the character of the sitter. Watch every American sitcom and you will see how easily identifiable characters are. Part of the problem is that the actors seem to see this project as a platform for bigger and better things, rather than being their only big figure in their lives, for which they will spend the next eight years with the portrayal. This disinterest in the characters and the project shows. But to be honest, considering the lame concept and terrible writing, the actors do not have much to do except say their lines and try not to hit furniture. As another commentator mentioned, this seems like a TV movie and not a sitcom. <br /> <br /> And the director or lack there! What can I say, Canada has so much talent? Check out the comedy channel featuring Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up. Take a look at the Trailer Park Boys (not the movie because he bit the big helium dog). Watch every American show to see what potential our talents have, because many of our stars are looking for decent work. <br /> <br /> Give credit to the CBC because they really know how to promote an event without an event. Do you remember "The One"? No, do not even try to learn the names of the characters on this show as this will surely go the way of the dodo. <br /> <br /> Let's all hope for a full-fledged ACTRA strike, so none of this happens for a long time from Ceeb.
