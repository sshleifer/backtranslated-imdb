Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully filmed movie, no doubt about it. And the drama is generally excellent, at least in terms of the way the characters are portrayed as they are scripted. <br /> <br /> However, so many small and big details are just wrong that it bothers me too much to be able to fully enjoy it. A small detail that characterizes the nature of lack of sensitivity is a scene (no, that does not spoil anything) in which Mameha rings a bell on a snowy winter day hanging on the door of the house where Sayuri lives. The bell she rings is a fuurin or wind chime - it only hangs on houses in Japan in summer! People in traditional Japanese homes had no doorbells - they just opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think that this is such an insignificant detail, but I would compare it to a movie about America, where a Christmas wreath is hanging on the door in July and no one thinks he has anything.) And do not even leave me start with the totally wrong hairstyles of maiko and geisha, which are vaguely panasian / chinese / kung-fu-ish, and nothing like real things. I think that this rather unconcerned attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray is also reflected in the attitudes and depictions of people and situations. <br /> <br /> So I think the less you know about the Japanese culture and the world of geisha and maiko in Kyoto (which is "Miyako"), the more you will like it. I honestly believe that this movie could be so much better ... it's just another Hollywood version of "Exotic Japan".
