The movie is similar to its long title and approaches the 90s mark. The beautiful sets are here with all that has made the Hamer production values ​​a trademark, but Paris, drowned in fog, is a sign of indolent neglect. The story is obvious and can be summarized in a dozen words so that nothing unexpected and nothing more than 5% of your attention is expected. <br /> <br /> The directing is heavy like a direct transfer from The actors are usually stiff as wax figures (ok, that's a hamer feature, only sometimes it's better in the overall package). My conclusion: This movie is rubbish, the time I spend that evening, not worth it. Eternal life is a boring affair, and I should have hoped that those in charge of programming at the Cinemathèque knew better.
