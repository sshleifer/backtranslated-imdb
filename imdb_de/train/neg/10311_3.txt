SPOILER ALERT In this generic and memorable action movie, Lorenzo Lamas makes his usual hard guy and handsome boy, and his future, real-ex-Kathleen Kinmont is the ass-fuck in the hot lady Alexa. OJ Simpson is a detective who passes by his already missing public personality. Translation: Cable TV filler. There is not enough skin to qualify as a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> The script has some gaping holes. Best / worst moment: In a scene where O'Carren's death reigns, OJ's partner expresses his dislike of the morgue. OJ answers that some of the bodies are pretty hot, or words about it. This vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough. But in the face of the killings that took place shortly after the release of this film, it is truly appalling and therefore entertaining in an unintentional, horrible way. I was so frightened that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose. That's a guilty pleasure. BC
