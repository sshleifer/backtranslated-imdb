Such a bad movie should be withdrawn from all branches worldwide. The movie is so full of boring, boring, uninspired characters and with a main character with such an annoying attitude and dry voice that gives a thoughtless voice to every action and every feeling, and holds the record for the most sophisticated movie I've ever seen have. Since I had paid the money for it, I felt obliged to go through it and how I regret it. My head hurt because of the awfully boring characters and their pointless, plundering lives. A group of kids who have zero knowledge of everything, all cool and worst, have terrible dialogues and just pondering while the main character tries to get a date with the girl. Boring, so much so that my friend trembled with hatred and I flushed with embarrassment that I had thrown away six pounds. The DVD was on eBay the next day and I could not bring back much of my money. Avoid like the plague.
