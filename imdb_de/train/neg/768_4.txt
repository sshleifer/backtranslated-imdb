I agree with most Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary format change. Columbo is a unique policeman with unorthodox police methods. This movie looks like a remake of other common detective dramas from the past. And that's the worrying point, because Columbo is no ordinary detective. First, I can not figure out the title of this movie. It is misleading. Maybe a better title would have been "The Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Secondly, Columbo hides a piece of evidence without giving the reason (at least to the viewers) why he does it. I'm glad that Peter Falk has returned to his usual Columbo. <br /> <br />
