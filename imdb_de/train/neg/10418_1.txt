THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN MOVIE! <br /> <br /> This movie is like a "bad trip" for children under 5 years old. For a month, my 4 year old would ask from time to time, "Why was the rabbit bleeding from his mouth" or "Why was the bulldozer burying all the rabbits?". (And that was not the worst). We stopped for about half an hour, but the damage was done. Intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. Luckily he finally forgot the wretched thing. Whoever the film should be marketed for children, should be charged for a fee. ... (censor me, my conscience is clear.).
