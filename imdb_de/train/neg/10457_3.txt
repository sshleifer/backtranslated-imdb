What can I say? I'm a secret fan of action and horror movies. Especially when it comes with humor and allusions, but I'm not a fan of Snake on a Plane. <br /> <br /> There are three potential attractions for this movie: ?? The comedy of the situation; ?? The horror; and ?? The novelty of hundreds of snakes is an airplane. <br /> <br /> First, this movie is not written as a humorous horror or as a comedy. There are only 1 or 2 points in the movie where you will smile at yourself. If you want to get the feel of the movie, the trailer really turns the movie into a horror story. <br /> <br /> Second, if you expect a movie full of action and shock, you will not be disappointed. It does not stand out from other films, but it always keeps your attention. Third, although the novelty of Snakes of a Plane does not abate, but you'll forget about the movie theater. "What was all the hustle and bustle around". <br /> <br /> I know this movie has a high rating, but it does not count. A) Many of the reviews were written before the film was released and, B) The distribution of user reviews has much less variation than the normal 77% of respondents who rated the film at 10/10. 10 - Why such a huge gap?
