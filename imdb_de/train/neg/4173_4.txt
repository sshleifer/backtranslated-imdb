Man, I have to say, when I saw the trailer, I was excited. Futuristic soldiers vamping their asses, led by genre veterinarian Michael Ironside .... in space. I mean, I did not expect high art, but it looked like a potential B-movie classic. This was undoubtedly a television pilot who was later turned into a feature film after he was not recorded. Okay, I'll start with the movies, some good points, the action was for a lower budget movie, and the CGI and locations used were passable. Now to the bad ones, first Michael Ironside was there, and his performance here ... well, it was cheesy and not good. But like I said, he was not much, anyway, so I can not blame him. One thing that was really stupid was the PETA-type group for vampires. No, I'm not kidding. It's the stupidest, most incredible thing I've ever seen, and it's taken seriously. Also this film commits one of the main sins of the film B, he annoys a lesbian scene and does not deliver. Most of all what sinks in this movie, nothing really happens. Since it was intended as a pilot project, the script is almost non-existent and has no regular end. Even the chief villains only come in towards the end. If ever a movie was needed for the Sleaze and Gore factor, then Vampire Wars. Finally, I would like to say that the main crew of the spaceship were all very capable actors and could very well leave this mess behind to achieve bigger and better things. They just had nothing to work for.
