I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for his film. "Summer Of Sam" gives the impression that the film is about the notorious serial killer David Berkowitz. It is not. It's a bleak, earthy portrait of New York's street life during the hot summer of '77, when Berkowitz terrorized that city. <br /> <br /> The film features several young fictional characters in an Italian-American neighborhood and their reactions to the city's son by Sam's threat. There's Vinny and his wife Dionna. There are Richie and Ruby and some other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not sympathetic. They are routinely annoying and sometimes unbearable. Lee then refers to her high, chaotic life, filled with anger, lust and general uproar. There are at least two lengthy battle scenes between Vinny and his wife, superfluous disco dance scenes, countless gabfests ... I've always wondered: where is the movie editor? By now, with all this mass, the film gives the chance to convey any sense of fear or fear that arises from the threat of the son of Sam, who is too much in the background. Lee is more successful in showing another kind of threat emanating from vigilante groups in the neighborhood. <br /> <br /> The acting is consistently good. Combined with disco music of the 70s and elaborate attention to costumes and production design, in 1977 you really feel like you're in an Italian-American neighborhood in New York City. <br /> <br /> However, the film's atmospheric authenticity is not nearly enough to offset a vast, overused script about the lives of roughly irritating people.
