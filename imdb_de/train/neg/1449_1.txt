Before you continue reading, you must understand that I am not a neo-Nazi. I'm just trying to understand Hitler correctly, to make sure nobody like him comes back to power. <br /> <br /> I saw that series and thought it was awful. I mean, OK, it's interesting to look, but is it really? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First, Hitler was not angry all his life, the series shows an angry Hitler, even if he is a child. Second, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter. It is very likely that Hitler was in fact gay and had spent his life fighting to stifle this mystery. Third, people will hate me, but it's true: Hitler was charming. How do you think he made it to power when he was so hateful and ugly? Because he was charming. This is a common point I found in the interviews with people living near or far from him (of course not Jews). This series was terrible, because if you think that Hitler was just an angry bastard, ugly and of course not charming, you're wrong. If you think so, let people like him take power in countries, and you do not want that. If you really understand how Hitler managed to come to power and stop thinking that he was terrible, you can find dangerous politicians like him (of course, remember that he was elected) and stop the topic before it's too late /> <br /> Life is important to protect it, this series is just terrible to show us the truth. If we continue to see Hitler like that, another will take place just like the first one.
