I have a high tolerance for the weird, but frankly, some films go far beyond the weird - to the point of hurting your brain. This is such a movie. Trying to understand or even explain it is impossible, and I think the movie is best understood when you take drugs - that's incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a very cute Japanese animation that includes a cat. Out of the blue, however, there are tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things that ask me if I lose something in the translation. But even if this is the case, why did we have to be treated with pictures of a magic trick in which a lady with a smart, defecatory body was dissected, puking, setting fire to animals, etc. All of this really seemed random and quite awful. Strangely, and I do not know why, some see it as a genius. I just do not understand.
