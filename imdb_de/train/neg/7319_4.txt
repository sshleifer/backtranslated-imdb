If you get to the scenes with Albert Brooks without his shirt, try not to choke a fur ball. <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I've seen most, if not all, of his films, but it was the first time I watched those films. Modern Romance is an interesting attitude to love. There are few films that handle the desperation of love as well as Modern Romance, though Chilly's Scenes of Winter of 1979 are very close. Both are essentially concerned with obsessive men who are psychologically drawn to their respective wives. <br /> <br /> Where Chilly Scenes of Winter borders on stalking, this film has a more solid foundation for the theme of love because both people are already in a relationship ... and out of the relationship .. and again it. <br /> <br /> And because it's a movie that was released in 1981, he's in terms of styles and the like of his time. That's the main reason why I like this movie. My basic rule when it comes to movies is, "If it's shit at least, it can have historical relevance," you know, time capsule stuff. <br /> <br /> Which leads me to the horrible scenes of Albert Brooks Sans Shirt. <br /> <br /> The man is hair. Very hair Like he's wearing a black, curly fur sweater. And worse, he looks almost burned. It is not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without shirt go on and on. In the early 80's hairy men were considered normal and nothing shocking. But in 2009, the sight of something like that is just revolting. Sorry, Albert! I wish someday somebody said "Hey, let's try this scene, but if you're wearing a simple T-shirt, I mean, you could scare people." It's just very bad and I'm sorry for the poor pretty actress who had to deal with Albert Brook's nude body on hers. She probably pulled her hair out of her teeth for a few more days afterwards. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's an OK movie. It could have been better if I had not seen Albert Brooks without his shirt for ten minutes without interruption, because that would forever affect my view of this movie.
