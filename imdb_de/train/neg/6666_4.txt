I really wanted to have this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I do not want to spoil this movie - do not worry, from the beginning you know that something bad is going to happen - but here's an example of how sloppy this movie was put together. The cowboy and "Twig" ride up the ridge. The cowboy has a mustache. The cowboy and "Twig" get into a shooting range and run halfway down the ridge. The cowboy is shaved clean the rest of the movie. Sometime between the shooting and the downhill, the cowboy had time in the dark to shave on the back of a horse.
