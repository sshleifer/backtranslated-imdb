I saw the live musical at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts for the first time and it was absolutely stunning, breathtaking and had such a fantastic continuity in the plot and dialogue that I liked it more than most of the musicals I put on seen the stage. The interesting thing is that you NEVER saw Zach's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was strong, guiding the direction of the entire production. When I heard that they made a film out of it, I waited with bated breath, but when I saw the movie version, I was so disappointed that I felt betrayed. The film lacks the captivating mood of live production, and you can never connect with any character. Personally, I would like to see the live version again, and if it's ever revived, I strongly recommend that you commit to it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.
