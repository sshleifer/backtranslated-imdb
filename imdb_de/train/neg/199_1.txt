This is a terrible movie, a terrible script, a bad direction and a nonsense ending. Also bad performances, except for Clancy Brown, who is being criminally under-burdened here, and Michael Pollard. Watching the movie was a purgatory - you have to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one below. <br /> <br /> The film presents a father and a son who look as if they could not all have been possibly related. The part of the male lead role is not well written and acts uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female leader and her brother, the policeman, also have no meaning. Therefore, a big action from her at the end of the movie makes no sense in terms of the script.
