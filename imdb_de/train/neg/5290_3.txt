Usually I'm not one who cuts a movie. I try to see the good points and not concentrate on the bad ones, but in this case, there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you want to do something so bad, why bother? Part of the movie takes Anne's face while she takes a deep breath, playing violin music in the background. The other part is filled with poor and wooden plays. Rupert Penry Jones is expressionless. Jennifer Higham plays Annes younger sister with modern manners. Anne is portrayed as meek and selfish, which is okay at first, but she stays the same throughout the movie and you see no reason for Captain Wentworth to fall in love with her. Overall, the production lacks a sense of time, too many mistakes that need to be overlooked, how to run the concert, kissing on the street, walking around on the street without a hat (why was this scene ever in the movie?) The scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written, to sum it up, a horrible movie, very disappointing.
