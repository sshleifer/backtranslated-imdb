The synchronization / translation in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise boring and derivative zombie movie. I have not laughed so hard in my life while watching Zombi 3 (and I've seen some really bad synchronizations in my life, believe me). Seriously, the filmmakers could post-edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars. It's just so funny. <br /> <br /> But ... If you're laughing from the couch in a fulci zombie movie, that's not your thing, then AVOID THEM ON ALL OF YOUR COSTS.
