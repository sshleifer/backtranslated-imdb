Even if you subscribe to this movie's tricky anti-free trade policy, it's still the same tired note that's played over and over again. Even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair, who is committed to a return to the first principles, Reverend Billy is a pretty serious figure to recognize. The Clownish Reverend is the sort that wakes up every morning with no ethereal pretension to seeing his own face on television before he goes back to bed that night. He has a pretty wife, I have to admit, but it would take tons of more to save that dreary mess of a movie. The endless bus rides are the worst part - with progress bar - you can imagine - by a colored line that moves across a map. Aww, did you suspect. Well, it has the advantage of being short. Is that the only good thing I can say? Hmmmm. Yes, afraid, so.
