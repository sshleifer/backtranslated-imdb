I felt that the movie was dry ... very disappointing, no conspiracy ... I waited for something to happen and nothing to dry like a bone ... a waste of money ... One of Robins worst films Williams ... if you do not believe me, wait a few months, it will appear on DVD, because that seems to be a pattern for films that do not fare well in cinemas as they are being loaned out before the end of the year This is one thing you will not want to see or say why I spent my money on it! And because it's such a new movie, there were only 8 people. That was on a Friday night the 9:50 show. I also felt it took a little more excitement or something to keep us awake. When the characters talked in the movie, the voices were also very quiet, you could not hear what they were saying.
