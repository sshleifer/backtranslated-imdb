Rather stupid attempt by a Hitchcock mystery thriller that unlikely exchanges espionage with archeology and is based on the Robin Cook novel; Incidentally, I have recently acquired further work on his work - COMA (1978) - in honor of the late Richard Widmark. Director Schaffner had just made THE BOYS FROM BRASIL (1978) - a similarly imaginative, but much more arresting suspension, and unfortunately SPHINX was a false step from which his hitherto impressive career could not recover. <br /> <br /> Despite its size and reasonably decent line-up, this one proved to be a critical and commercial flop - especially since the narrative is simply not very exciting: in fact, it is quite bleak (faint attempts at horror) the archaeological heroine unbundling, rotting corpses in abundance and even endured an attack by a barrage of bats - notwithstanding that Lesley Anne-Down is the charming leading actress who stumbles across a lost treasure - she was actually hid by a local sect, to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners who have acquired much of the country's heritage (under the pretext of culture) for far too long. Sir John Gielgud emerges in an ungrateful state early on, as the antique dealer, who sets out on the path of prey, pays his "treason" with his life. <br /> <br /> Usually this happens Some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be - so that apparent allies (such as Maurice Ronet) are eventually exposed as villains while they are an ambiguous character (Frank Langella I saw in a West End performance in London in early 2007 from "Frost / Nixon" (which now became a movie) from Down's adversary to her lover and back again when he decides the wealth of the Egyptian High Priest Menephta to make a national treasure.
