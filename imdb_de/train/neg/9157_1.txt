Her first indication that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video, not on film. The story is complicated and the production is amazingly sloppy. For example, when the title pair lands on an airplane that has allegedly landed in Vermont and wanted to celebrate its relationship in a civil union ceremony, the plane is shown in an airport-surrounded airport. Her ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palm trees, that would not take five minutes in New England. On another plane trip, the introductory shot shows a departing FedEx cargo plane. Presumably, they could only afford the taxes. Regarding the plot, this movie expects you to believe that Victor, Arthur's devout Christian brother, is kicked out of his church when the church learns that his BROTHER is gay. Not only that, but the pastor finally has Victor arrange with a batsman who kills Ben and Arthur "to cleanse their souls from sin." Apparently nobody in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. If it were not Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this film would have no redeeming qualities at all.
