In fact, using the original nature documentation of bats used by THE BAT PEOPLE is one of the most effective of all. There are footage of waving bats hanging from the ceilings of caves, swarming bats flying out of caves or whirling around caves near the mouths of caves. That alone is enough to worry: Imagine everyone is raving about you? And indeed, they rave about a scene that should have been a show-stopper sequence that happened about forty minutes ago, a downright inappropriate, weird sequence in which a floating swarm of bats seem to be attacking a police car and squirting across the windshield, like bloody eggs. The problem is that this sequence happens about fifty minutes late to save the movie. Most of them consist of one or more people running around, screaming, swarming around with their arms and excitedly moaning about a poor goofball who has been bitten by a bat. <br /> <br /> The fear is, that he comes down with rabies, which in fact is shit, so that the holiday is ruined, as the action summary at the top of the reference page of THE BAT PEOPLE actually points out. Here is an effective summary of the movie: A young couple goes on a romantic getaway that gets ruined when the guy is bitten by a bat. They bravely try to keep it up, but he starts raving and convincing that it's a bit more than rabies, that he can not control himself, and everyone should stay away from it. <br /> <br /> Well, when someone foams at the mouth, covered in sweat, their eyes swirling around like a cheaper muppet and shouting at you to get away from me, you escape him. You do not try to give him drugs, you do not try to tell him you love him, you give the guy his place, go home and try this scenic getaway next year. <br /> <br /> But no The people in this movie are all idiots. They insist on pushing the guy to the brim, and he pops out, mutating into a semi-nude bat style and killing a number of unimportant secondary characters. Nothing wrong with that, but the film forgets that it's a low-budget creative feature and tries to be a kind of psychological study. Instead of a monster movie, a lot of people are running around trying to get this guy to take a pill. Eventually he runs into the mountains and looks much more human than he should. People insist on following him and pay the expected price. <br /> <br /> The main disruption of the movie is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty tips, and the movie should have been after the guy, after he had turned it into a bat Person and not to travel there. It takes a good eighty minutes to get some steam on this front. Some interesting character sketches characterize the always entertaining Michael Pataki as a township police who has lost his moral edge, and the late Paul Carr as a friendly doctor. The message is not fully understood. <br /> <br /> The film is awfully boring, about fifteen minutes too long and misses the opportunity to be a nice, memorable little creature feature about a mutant run amok like the Italian horror favorite RATMAN I looked at today and was unfortunately encouraged to try this one here. Me and my good ideas, though the scene with the police car was a howler: too bad we could not have had another twenty minutes of it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
