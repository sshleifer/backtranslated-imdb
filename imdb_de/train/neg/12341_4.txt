Horror parodies are not just part of the 21st century. Before the "Scary Movie" series, there were some examples of this genre, mostly in the 80s. But as I said, most of these films are hit or miss. Some like 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark' usually rise above it, but others like 'Saturday the 14th' and their sequel do not bring the laughter. But among all these films, there's a particularly big culprit, and that's "Transylvania 6-5000," which is a huge waste of time for many reasons. Some of the stupid humor is amusing. A stupid but catchy title song. Some good Transylvanian locations. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: threadbare plot. Mostly boring pace. Most of the humor just does not cut it off. The monsters have little to do and little screen time. I thought that was supposed to be a parody of monster movies? Lame end, which will probably make the audience angry. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: This is a comedy? If so, why are the really funny parts so little and far apart? Comedies should let us roll on the floor, do not roll our eyes and yawn, it should hurt that it is over. I can not believe that Anchor Bay released this tired rubbish. I admit that it's not one of the worst films ever made, but it's not worth the time or the money, even if you're a fan of the actors. See "Transylvania Twist" instead. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
