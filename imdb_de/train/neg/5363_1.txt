I did not think this movie was worth a bad screenplay, bad drama except Janine Turner, no imagination, stupid plot, stupid husband and unfair divorces. If you have never seen this movie, it is not worth relieving it. The only good thing was that Janine Turner has done a good job. Terry's husband is a stern defender who has won many cases and even got guilty. He thinks he's so smart, but he's really just a nut. Her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her. Nice girl, huh. Yes, she is a real peach, is not she? It is not a day at the beach either.
