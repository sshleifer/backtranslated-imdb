The poster, which described this as "Plotless and Pointless," took literally the words I would have used in my subject line. The only thing I want to add is "dispassionate". For a movie shot by a real couple with lots of graphic sex scenes, this movie creates that a sultry situation should be beyond the freezing cold. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during the sex scenes, and the viewer could also take a Valium and make it. Besides, please, the women in the audience have seen that WAY used too many used tampons in their time, and any guy who looks forward to Willem Dafoe pulling a bloody tampon out of his wife's sheath really needs to be treated br /> I think the key to the movie (if there is one) is the restaurant scene, where a waiter explains to sleepy Dafoe what a "deconstructed jambalaya" is. (All ingredients of the dish are still separate and not cooked together.) This movie is a "deconstructed thriller". All elements are there: creepy, isolated house, dead spouse, scary violins on the score, crazy caretaker who comes and goes as he pleases, car accidents and deaths, characters with a secret past. Basically every thriller clich√© you can think of, but NOTHING comes together. Everything just sits there and never intervenes in a coherent plot or even an artistic mood. In the restaurant, Dafoe passes on the "deconstructed Jambalaya". Future tenants of this mess would do well to leave this deconstructed thriller in the video library shelf.
