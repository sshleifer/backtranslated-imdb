When I go to the movies, I stay awake and look at it or if I did not like it, I would go to sleep, but that was sheer crap, I actually got up and went out! .... That was a bad script together I hated it. They should not have discouraged Brendan Frasier, he felt much better. This was not as good as I expected, considering that I really liked George of The Jungle 1 and the graphics were not as good as the first, for example the bird, and whenever he crashed into a tree. I hope the director pays attention, and he has to rethink the next films he makes ... terrible! I really would like to give Ursla a good job as she made the movie worthwhile (until I went out) ... overall I give this movie 2 out of 10 points
