This movie was seriously horrible. Acting was the worst! It was worse than a student movie. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor was the old lady. At first I thought it was an old movie. Then it occurred to me that this is no excuse! I have seen older movies with much better acting and such. <br /> <br /> The music was terrible. It was really choppy. The editing was bad (most of the dialogues were out of sync.) Overall, this movie does not even deserve a 1st. I just looked at it because I was so bored and the movie barely entertained me. It was just ridiculous. The left little finger of my dead grandmother could make a better movie than this one.
