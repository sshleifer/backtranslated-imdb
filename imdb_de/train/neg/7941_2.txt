As the 2000s came to an end, the adopted daughter of King Kong went ahead and gave her show a rousing announcement as the end. <br /> <br /> As Miss Winfrey pulled herself up, I laughed and screamed wildly at Old West Indians. <br /> <br /> So what's Oprah doing? She takes famous people and puts them in her show. What famous people? People who have suffered (just like them, except that these people have lost more than their virginity), they have melted faces (true story), missing limbs (true story, see the end of the paragraph) and abuse of spouses (too many, too many). and somehow they come to the show and tell their story as if we had not heard them before and after painting and painting (bethany hamilton, i've heard that since the first day in october you lost a poor on a hai) 31 , 2003. Do not tell me you have no hard feelings.) But the biggest thing about Oprah was probably the 1993 interview with Michael Jackson after he was accused of being a child molester. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has died in the meantime. But that one particular show told about Michael's personal life, which not many people knew about at the time. The real influence of Oprah comes from middle-aged women and football mothers. They seem to believe that sometimes she is like a personal Jesus. But all I see in Oprah is a big ghetto lady who made it big, and she just shows how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I'm glad her shows will end soon. We need better TV programs.
