What the hell was that? Obviously, someone in the same semester read Stephen King and Sartre. We get mixed with existential fears and cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing, but each one was saved by terrible music, CGI or acting. Even the work of David Lynch sometimes feels like that, and just like his interesting shows and movies, it's way too long. And unfortunately it is only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast was attractive, and that's on the limit. I suppose it touches the feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness that we all have, but just does not make the characters so sympathetic that we care about their destinies ... whatever they were. The last scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous.
