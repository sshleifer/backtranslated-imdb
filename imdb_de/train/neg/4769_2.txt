Unfortunately it was wrong. This movie has stunk from beginning to end. It was hard to see because I watched Clarissa every day on Nickelodeon. I loved her. The next thing I found, she made in Maxim and she was great! I did not hear from her until I saw this movie about an accident. I could not believe she would see such a thing with her name everywhere. It was all wrong, but it still looked like someone in the team was really trying to save a sunken ship. Too bad, I hope she keeps playing and I would like to see her with a real cast in a real movie.
