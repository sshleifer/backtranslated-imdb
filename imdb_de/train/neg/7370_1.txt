I have seen a lot of Seagal movies and although most of them are not great or even good, this steaming crowd has set the bar for bad movies. Something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something. Who are the good guys and the bad guys? Hard to tell. Most of the film consists of cut scenes between people in dimly lit rooms, complaining about how good the Seagals character "Mashall" is. Acting: Blows. Voice Dubbing What about the awful overdubbing voice ?! Could you find someone who sounded less like Seagal? Maybe Cheech or Chong had the voice over as well, maybe that was at least entertaining. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring and completely stupid. Avoid it at all costs!
