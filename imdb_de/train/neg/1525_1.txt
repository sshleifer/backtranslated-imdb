I watched this on a weekend afternoon, as there was nothing else. It would have been more fun to chew my feet and probably less painful. I urge everyone to see this, just to see how annoying a movie can be, but it was intended. With every useless attempt at humor that was carried out in such a childish, incomprehensible, and poorly executed way that I could not believe, I flinched. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas. I think I am exaggerating? Now give it airtime and think again. Terrible, absolutely terrible. If this was not a prank, the director and all others responsible should be removed and shot immediately after being forced to watch this movie again.
