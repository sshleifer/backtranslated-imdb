A typical action-action movie: A good police officer gets entangled in a jumble of crooked policemen and Japanese gangsters. <br /> <br /> The okay result has decent performances, a few fleeting moments to giggle, and some fair action sequences - and there's also a chance to see beautiful Danielle Harris - who makes the most of her eternal typography as rebellious teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> ** from ****.
