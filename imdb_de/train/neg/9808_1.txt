Worst show I have ever seen. The story is about a group of teenagers who, for some inexplicable reason, have superpowers, and when they use special equipment, they turn into strange, ill-designed suits. Acting when she is not in the retarded-looking suits is decent. Not good at all, but not the worst I've ever seen. But when they wear their suits, the actors' spectacle gets worse and worse. much, much worse. The hyper-animated idiots have a myriad of unnecessary movements that they make. Even when they talk, they look like they have seizures. The bad guys are stupider than the Rangers. Each episode, a weak, idiotic villain, has a plan to destroy the Rangers. He / she then sends a troop of hyper-animated aliens to attack the Rangers. The rangers then initialize their 10-hour transforming animation and then destroy the aliens. Then the ill-designed villain, who can either be an armored villain who actually looks evil and is a humanoid ladybug-like creature with trumpets on his back, shows obvious signs of mental retardation. The Power Rangers defend the villain, then the villain turns into Godzilla, be it through a rain cloud or a nuclear missile (yes, they shoot nuclear weapons at the creatures and the creatures become giants). The Power Rangers spend 5 minutes hyper-animating and summoning their Zords. These are obviously toys for which the producers of the show have used special effects to make them look real. The Power Rangers win, the villain goes insane, they all teach a "valuable" lesson and the show ends. That's it. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, fake kung fu fights.
