OK ... this movie could have been so good! All generations have been exposed to and love Thunderbirds, and this film has had some of the qualities one would want in a good Thunderbirds movie. The craft itself and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, while the designs we fell in love with were retained. Sophia Miles was just fantastic because Lady P and Bill Paxton were not exactly what I imagined Jeff Tracey would be, but they were solid enough ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we became asked to believe the eight-year-old I could fly 200 tons of machines. <br /> <br /> It's not so much the fact that the movie was about the kids, and I felt Jonathon Frakes hit me with a wet fish and laughed at my hard-earned money in the movie it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so obnoxious in the movie and that he seemed to fly the machines as well as his brothers ... who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some damn simple machines that can be used if this is the case. <br /> <br /> The movie did not seem to know if he wanted to be serious or farce. It tried to pay homage during satire, and generally fell flat on his face. 3/10 (2 for the machines, 1 for Lady P)
