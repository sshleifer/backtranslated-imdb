In the whole low-budget story. This movie has to be one of the worst. There are some humorous sides to the movie, but in general it was just awful. I just can not understand which person can not walk with a few snails. I mean, they have to be one of the slowest creatures in the world. The only thing that's worth in this movie is the attempt to bite a man in the finger. That was pretty amusing.
