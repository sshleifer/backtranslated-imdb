I bought this movie for 1 euro without knowing what it is all about. I thought "hmmm, a movie called mutilating man must be, at least not very funny, at least filled with Gore". It was not funny. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I do not mind disturbing movies, but this does not mean anything except that child abuse is not a good thing. hmmm ... The quality of the pictures was terrible. Acting ... there was no acting. Just a crazy guy who mutilates himself for over 90 minutes. This is probably material for the weapon of sicko in extreme blood. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention. It is not worth your time. It's just awful. I wish I had never bought that. <br /> <br /> You should mutilate the guy who did this
