Spoilers below, but keep reading or you'll never know the terrible fate that awaits all planning to rent "Rodentz". <br /> <br /> On a moonlit night in a remote research lab, it's about getting a major medical breakthrough deadly. A chemical compound created to "chase and destroy" deadly cancer cells has been dumped in the basement of the building from the hazardous waste disposal system. Now, the rodents involved in the laboratory experiment on the upper floor are not the only rats in the facility that are becoming the modified species. Professor Schultz, a leading biologist, has just discovered that the addition of a new enzyme now allows his "Hunt and Destruction" formulation to regenerate for the time necessary to neutralize deadly cancerous tumors. When three different amounts of the new mixture are administered to three different rats and the remainder pour down the faulty "waste hazard" sink, shocking side effects lead to a night of horror ... right ..... <br /> < Seriously, that's probably the worst movie I've seen this year. It all screams "low-budget!", From the horrible drama to the special effects that are among the worst I've ever seen. The characters are cliched idiots and act in a stupid, predictable way: walking through dark corridors alone, looking for a cat, stumbling and falling, so that the "rats" can catch up with them, get in a small room, etc. <br / > <br /> While some movies are cheap, this movie really takes the cake. Every corner is cut, everything from reusing earlier shots, filming the "lab" lines from different angles to make it look bigger (which reminds me - why have only TWO guys worked in this damn massive building?!? !?!?), music and special effects that could be performed on a children's workshop PC. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming dung heap - the special effects. Just horrible. The computer-generated rats look so wrong in every scene that even the stupidest movie fans could see that they are computer-generated. And this huge rat suit - OH MY GOD !!!!!!!! Seriously, shall we believe that the freaking beany baby is a monster? Just pathetic ........ On the better side, some of the Gore looks pretty cool, especially in terms of budget. <br /> <br /> The actors suck everyone. No one involved in the production was interested or knew what they were doing. I wasted enough time on the review. Just take my advice, it's garbage. 1/10. <br /> <br /> About the DVD: The transfer is shitty, the sound is passable and the director and two of his friends have a commentary track on the record saying they have absolutely nothing to do with the film but were there to ask questions and make comments. All three of these subhuman primal muds are so incredibly stupid that they should be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others. I do not want to waste any more time on you or my readers because I'm starting to remember more than I would like about this movie ... DVD rating: 1/10.
