Weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali bring this to a halt. <br /> <br /> Flay is the worst. Definitely a trick pony, I think they could have got other American chefs to come to the table as Iron Chefs. The kind of dishes this duo really offers do not reflect the creativity of the original Iron Chef series. I do not think Batali actually went to the cooking school. There are many great chefs in America, I just wonder why they do not appear on the Food Network. <br /> <br /> It would also help to have more local ingredients and maybe co-hosts that can handle it. I like Alton Brown, but he is a bit too funky / witty for this role.
