This film is about a group of alien gay black men who are exterminating women on earth to create a gay universe. <br /> <br /> I saw it with the intention of seeing how bad it was. Still, I was shocked at how bad it was. It looked more like a movie shot 50 years ago. Acting is, if anything, extremely bad. The sets and props are so ridiculously fake and make any college movie look like a mega budget. And the special effects are ridiculously simple, in fact the jaw, as others have commented, but jinx embarrassing. <br /> <br /> You have to be very intoxicated or in an altered state of consciousness to appreciate this movie. If I had come from Denmark, it would be very embarrassing and humiliating for my compatriots to produce such a frighteningly bad movie.
