Most French films I've seen and enjoyed have been more than action, but that's fine. I found her interesting, well photographed and with fascinating actors. (However, at some point I wondered if Gerald Depardieu was like that in any French movie ever made.) It seemed that way. <br /> <br /> This movie has the same interesting pictures and a good start. But then it got to talk, talk and talk more ... what a drama is good, but not a murder mystery. After a while I almost fell asleep when I saw that. <br /> <br /> In fact, the movie was more of a play with almost all the scenes played in one room. If you love games, you should like this ... but I want something more for a murder story.
