Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie. The best thing was to make the surprise increase slightly in a few moments. <br /> <br /> If you forget the (failed) startling dimension and look at other sides of the movie, you're disappointed again. The acting is OK but not great. The story may be interesting at the beginning while trying to get what's going on. But in the end, one understands that there is not much to understand. "Creepy" elements seem to have been added to the screenplay sometimes without reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawning) Watch this movie if you have nothing interesting to do, such as cutting the movie Carrots or looking in the clouds.
