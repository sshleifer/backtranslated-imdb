This movie was long and boring. Surprising that it was chosen for Cannes, though they tend to like pretension. The point is that Guernsey, in contrast to other Dutch stars of the arts like Kerkhof and Kruishoop, feels completely empty. Even more, it has no cinematic quality. A long opening shot does not mean a cinematic depth, it's just a boring shot. The story was not interesting and the characters had issues that I could not identify with at all. The actors did not shine under their direction and seemed temporarily lost. Leopold tried, but she is not the talent I had hoped for. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They really made waves in Dutch cinema. Leopold was making another attempt.
