I guess the movie attracted me for both the sound and the lead actor. That's why I gave him a chance, by director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is used by the police, in particular by Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush). He must be forced to form a gang and oppose them to erase his own and his family's names. That's really all I can say about the story because I did not really pay attention to it. With Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger does a pretty good job, and that's well worth it, and the movie has flashy moments, especially with a shootout towards the end, but I can not say I enjoyed it because I did not see it all. OK!
