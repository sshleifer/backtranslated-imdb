THE ALARMIST is so abominably written that you think why in the world an aspiring actor like David Arquette is ready to be in it. It must be one of the weakest acts I've ever seen, and without humor, it borders on the edge of the boring. It stumbles to a terrible conclusion, which seems to happen only because the director is bored and just wanted to cope quickly to get home for his dinner. Stay away!.
