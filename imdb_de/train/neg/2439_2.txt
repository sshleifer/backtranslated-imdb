"Intensive Care" by Dorna von Rouveroy is without a doubt one of the worst horror movies ever made. This extremely cheap Dutch Slasher movie offers a bit of gore and a lot of absurd situations. A horror veteran George Kennedy is totally wasted like Professor Bruckner. Abnormally, the storyline is slow and the climax is ridiculous. A famous surgeon has a car accident. He lies in a coma for seven years and wakes up and bleeds around. "Intensive Care" is clearly influenced by American Slasher films including the series "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th". The murders are funny and the dialogues are stupid. Still, if you are in the right mood, you can look at this piece of garbage. They'll laugh until it hurts You can believe me!
