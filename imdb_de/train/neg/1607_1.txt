This "documentary" is a talent proof used for common purposes. The fact that it is being financed by the Venezuelan government means that the legitimacy of seeking the truth of what really happened in those terrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela is inadequate, which even we, the Venetians, are not sure of <br /> There are ways to lie, and the directors of these things lie both in omission and in knowledge. <br /> <br /> The political process in Venezuela is too complex for foreigners to easily understand. For example, * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * show pro-Ch치vez protesters shooting at an empty street (what did they do that for?), To say that they did not kill anyone, but did not show the pictures we all saw here, opposition protesters (and a journalist) dead or injured across the "empty" street. They can not explain why the police chief on that day was the only one who could fly over Caracas, and did nothing about the snipers on the roofs of the buildings near the Presidential Palace, which would show how inefficient this would be the security measures be to protect the president. A few days after the "coup," the chief of the responsible military guard in the National Assembly (our congress) was asked why they had not acted against the snipers, and he said, "Because they were not there to act against the president." Is not that a confession? <br /> <br /> There is so much more, the fact that the Supreme military announced the resignation of Ch치vez, and two days later he said he lied because "this is politics" and today is the minister for Internal Affairs of the Ch치vez Government. <br /> <br /> It would take thousands of words to explain all the lies presented in this "documentary" made to sell the world Image of the good old Hugo Ch치vez, for the poor and the bad opposition that wants him at any cost, if the truth is that 60-70% of the population rejects his government and that percentage also includes the poor. <br /> <br /> I hope that those of you who have seen and bought this can see another version being made. b A group of Venezuelans showing no less than 30 lies. The propaganda of the Nazis has returned!
