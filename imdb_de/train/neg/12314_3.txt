Maybe I'm getting really old, but he just missed me and the old Funny Bone. Certainly there must be something bad about this Irishman (that's me, Schultz!). Lord, Lord, what would I give to see the light! First, Phil Silver's manic energy, wit, and drive were part of the comic education and general education in life, if you will. Although it is possible that the series with the first title "YOU'LL NEVER RICH" (1955-59 *) could be included in the CBS TV Network with another person in the title role of Sgt. Bilko, it is very hard to imagine another actor / comedian in the business wearing the stripes of this corporal. Such a strong identification is inevitable, if not the same kind of career that destroys a nightmare that it turned out to be for some other people, like Clayton More ("THE LONE RANGER"), George Reeves ("THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN") and Charles Nelson Riley ("UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK"). <br /> <br /> A major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the television screen of the 1950s to cinema in the 1990s is collective memory. Without knowing what percentage of viewers remembered the Bilko character because he had seen the original run and early syndication revivals, their numbers were certainly considerable; Even a large proportion of the adolescents had recently seen repetitions of Bilko. It was obvious that the new movie and the source were miles; or even light-years apart. <br /> <br /> In order not to be considered a completely square, old nagging, let us consider a few other points. <br /> <br /> Today, 14th day In the year of our Lord, 2007, swear under oath and confirm that I have been a Steve Martin fan for almost 30 years. I also have the wit and talent of Bilko '96 co-stars Dan Akroyd and the late Phil Hartman. After all, it was the talents of such people and so many others, alumni of "NBC's Saturday Night" and "SECOND CITY TV," that made the last quarter of the twentieth century laugh. But a BILKO reissue; it just did not click. <br /> <br /> If the movie had been made as a service comedy (he always liked it!), but without the Bilko show name, he would have gotten an identity of himself From grumpy old guys like me, she'll more appreciated. <br /> <br /> Well, we've had so many sitcom and cartoon shows that have been filming lately. What's next? How about somebody doing Hal Roach's army comedy series from World War II? DOUBLEDAY & AMES and the first animated series of the television channel "CRUSADER RABBIT"? Remember where you first heard it! POODLE SCHNITZ!
