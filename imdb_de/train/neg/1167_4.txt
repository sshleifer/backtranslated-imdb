I really tried to like this movie, but in the end it just did not work for me. I have seen most of Kitamura's output and found it very variable. Alive, like all his films, has an interesting plot, some nice sequences and a lot of creativity. These qualities are painfully close in Alive. The plot is cool, if not so original, and would have made for a pretty ace movie. Unfortunately, the tempo is painfully slow and the movie needs an age before it reaches quite predictable locations. The action is almost passable, the last fight is pretty cool and the former is OK. The former is also affected by too fast camera work, resulting in less coherence. There are some pretty visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue, but the movie still struggles. The characters are neither well-crafted nor well-played, and the setting and general color scheme are monotonous and boring. The movie is not completely terrible and has some interesting points. Maybe a judicious use of the fast forward button can improve it. After about twenty minutes of running, this could be a pretty decent science-fiction thriller. But the full-length movie is boring. Recommended only for very patient and determined Kitumura fans.
