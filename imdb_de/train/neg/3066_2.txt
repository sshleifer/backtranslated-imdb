This is a terrible remake of a marginal but popular movie from the early 70's. I have seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20-minute movie that runs in 2 hours or whatever the runtime. Cheesy story, which, by the way, is completely different from the original. The main involvement of the government was far-fetched. There is no flow from one scene to the next. In the original you could get a beer or go to the bathroom and still keep up. <br /> <br /> It took only a few hours for the oil pan to be changed on the car. It takes many times longer than in real life. Car guys notice the stuff. Even the fool or fools who abuse a 1968 Charger and a 1970s Challenger should be shot with a blunt bullet in the heel. The fact that they are not "car drivers" is painfully obvious and their death is not saddened. <br /> <br /> The actors lacked any emotion, everything was cut and dried. A step over a monotone. A Barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, the radio DJ said that the challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). This is total garbage. Can you say aerodynamics or lack of it? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste your time watching this.
