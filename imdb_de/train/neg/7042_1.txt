This must be one of the worst movies ever made. Even for a biker movie that is an absolute low point. The minimal action involves a group of cyclists taking over a small town (as original!) And the city dwellers' attempts to fend them off. Why do not you call for outside help? Who knows? The fight scenes are obviously fake. Adam West and Tina Louise are there, but both have little to do and both look ashamed (understandable). This movie belongs in the garbage heap!
