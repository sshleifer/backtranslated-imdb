First, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> Anyone from former Yugoslavia, who is not an extreme Serbian radical, will agree with me. This movie shows the Serbian side and only the Serbian side. Serbian crimes were not represented. Fortunately, everyone can see that this film was made by Serbians, so there is no neutrality. All the "pros" who were interviewed are not professionals at all. One guy read only one book written by a radical Serb, the other is genocide deniers, etc. etc. Even Slovenians were indicted in this film. And the whole war in Slovenia lasted a few days just because the Slovenians were lucky. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia and YNA could not reach Slovenia through Croatia (after the war between Croatia and Serbia had started). Every Slovene is outraged by all the allegations in this film. <br /> <br /> Any reasonable Croat will agree with one thing: independence was too early. Maybe all major conflicts could be avoided. The mention of World War II and some unrelated things, however, was a truly pathetic attempt to justify everything. Imagine that Japanese bombed atomic bombs in Seattle and Washington, and that this was justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They find no evidence of YNA strangers slaughtering Serbian civilians near Vukovar. But you can find the tape with the reporter who states that his allegations about Serb civilians were lying near Vukovar. Everything over the internet. And the director forgot to mention the whole bombardment of Vukovar by YNA (now on the Serbian and Montenegrin side - and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegrins). And let's not start with the Chetnik movement. In the beginning it was just a resistance movement. However, the director somehow forgot to mention the cooperation with the Nazis, including Ustashe, ethnic cleansing and renewed fight against the Yugoslav partisans. There are thousands of other things, but everything can be easily checked. There are many misleading things in this film. Only a few allegations are true. Every Croat is outraged by this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not think I have to mention the Srebrenica genocide refusal, the genocide that has too much evidence. Imagine the film about the denial of the Holocaust. This movie is the same. According to this film, the Bosnian Muslims bombarded Sarajevo. Every Bosnian Muslim is outraged by this movie. <br /> <br /> Somehow the director has forgotten to mention the short occupation of the Macedonian country (FYROM) by the Serbs. <br /> <br /> Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians and Macedonians never came to the Serbian border. If you are not a Serb, and you actually believe some of the stuff from this film, you know that the Serbs have a kind of propaganda stating that Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are indeed Serbs who invented their story. So ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of Serbs will say that this movie is "extreme" and "pro-Serbian". <br /> <br /> And the Serbian radicals are very, very happy with this movie (there are about 40% of Serbs who vote for radicals). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my points here. There is very little truth in this so-called documentary, and my advice to everyone is to inform yourself before watching this movie. After that you will only laugh at all pathetic accusations. <br /> <br /> Watch real, neutral documentary films about the death of Yugoslavia.
