I'll forego the usual comparisons with a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic New York personality, because frankly, making comparisons with grumpy loser Josh Kornbluth is an insult to any director. I will not even mention the spot-on satire "Office Space" in the same breath of this celluloid disaster. However, I can compare it to waking up during my own operation. It is painful to look at and you wonder if the surgeons really know what they are doing. Haiku Tunnel is the kind of movie you wish you had unplugged in the early stages of production. It was cruel to let it live, and as a result, audiences around the world will have to suffer. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film? if it actually has one? It's not even worth discussing, but for the sake of caution, I'll do that. Josh Kornbluth, a temporary worker with a serious commitment phobia, is offered a permanent position. His main task is to send 17 letters of high priority to his boss. But he can not fulfill this simple task ridiculously. My reaction? Big thing! This is not a story? It is, at best, a transient thought - one that should pass with respect to any filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The main actor? if you can call him that? is a clumsy buffoon of a man, with chubby facial features, a receding, untamed hairline and a range of facial expressions ranging from ripples to disturbing shapes. Where or where did the director find this jewelry? What are you saying ???? he is the director? Oh my mistake. To play oneself in the own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing, but I suspect that Mr. Kornbluth as a human is not so convincing, let alone an actor. Rest assured, this is not an aimless character murder, but I have never been so excited about the presence of an actor on screen! My frustration was further affected by his incessant monologues between the scenes. I mean, as if the viewer needs a bit of intelligence to grasp this drum, Kornbluth insults us further by saying, "Do not tell" the action "explained" (first rule of filmmaking: "dramatize the exposure"). Who does this guy think? He has no charisma, no charm and judging by his Hawaiian shirts, no sense of style. His casting agent should be shot down with pinpoint accuracy. <br /> <br /> The supporting actors do nothing to alleviate the intense boredom I felt, with one exception. Patricia Scanlon makes a very funny appearance as Helen, the former secretary who was driven mad by her old boss, makes harassing phone calls from her basement with a flashlight under her face. This made me giggle, but the moment passed and I was back to check my watch for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie title is also a misnomer. The haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Do not be fooled that this is a kind of house movie because of its presumptuous-sounding title or the fact that it's only played in a handful of cinemas and has not made any money at the box office ?????? There is a very good reason for that! <br /> <br />
