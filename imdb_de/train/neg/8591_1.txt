I'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood chipper is more fun than this mess. This ends the destruction of a former movie classic. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith we have the death of Lucas' career. He wants us to swallow the Annakin, is Vader nonsense? I never believed that it was true. This movie confirms these feelings. The story has not worked since Phantom Moron, and every new movie piled up the crap until it was all over, a toy parade. I have to go. I know where to throw new stones. You want spoilers? Here you come. Luke and Leia are NOT related. Vader is NOT her dad. Duke Countoo should have changed sides as long as he still could. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been good to anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke in the first two films. Annakin did not build a C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his mother for putting him together from the ground up. Chewbacca has fleas. All this confusion with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed on the stupid Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she had any sense, she would not have come from Annie in a bright year, but she had said what George Lucas wrote for her. What an idiot!
