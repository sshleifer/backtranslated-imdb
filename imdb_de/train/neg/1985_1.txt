The costumes, the dialogue and the historical accuracy are terrible. For example - Stacey Dash and the hanging scene. The sling was accurate (as far as I could tell), but this sling broke the person's neck. Ms. Dash gets stuck at the end of the rope until the rope is shot. This species did not strangle the person, she killed her at the end of the garbage. <br /> <br /> And before they raid a bank (in a flashback) they stop in the street A group hug - with their bandannas hiding their faces - was obvious to the people on the street. <br /> <br /> The bad editing - that's a battery under the shirt and it's obvious that the clip from The Long Ride shows them the ride and then reverses the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that they kept the scene with the horse in the dung - it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was crap.
