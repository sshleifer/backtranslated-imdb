Hood of the Living Dead and all the other films shot by these guys look like they've got together and filmed with their buddies who had no talent one afternoon when they got bored (lines are completely incomprehensible and not convincing). I find that 95% of amateur films and 90% of home videos are better than this movie (though the similarities between them justify the comparison). "Hey, let's see if anyone is stupid enough to buy our movies!". I hope nobody else was like that. I apologize to those involved in the film because this review is a bit harsh, but I was the dope who read your fake reviews and bought the movie.
