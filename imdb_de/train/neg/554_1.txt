This movie is awful. The script is bad, the script mediocre and even the sex scenes are worthless. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely missing. This film was shot in a dark, shady and monochromatic style (a la "War of the Worlds"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original movie. Greg Morrisey's brooding character shows a facial expression throughout the movie. The twists and turns of the original plot are sadly lacking; The few that exist are simply anti-climactic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, which has been faithfully continued in this sequel, but it's not enough to make up for the other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which a "Basic Instinct 3" should be made would be if Michael Douglas agreed to join the cast.
