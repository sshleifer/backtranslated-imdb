Wrongly charged, Rock Chums buddies John Wayne (as John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (as Kansas Charlie) change their identity to "Alias ​​Smith and Jones." Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler is said to be "Rev. Smith," but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith." At no time are they as entertaining as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; although Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than anyone else, career-wise. The pretty blonde Mary Kornman (as Anne), who grew up from her time in "Our Gang", is very interested in Wayne. She and Chandler have some sweet scenes with Wayne. If you're not a fan of low budget John Wayne movies of the 1930s, this movie will not make you one.
