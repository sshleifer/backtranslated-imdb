Well well well. As good as John Carpenter's season 1 was in "Masters of Horror," this is the exact opposite. He's certainly proved that he was still a master of horror with "Cigarette Burns", but "Pro-Life" may be the worst thing I've seen of him. It's welcome beyond time, despite the running time of less than an hour. The script is nonsense, the characters are cranky and unsightly, and the conclusion is absurd. <br /> <br /> And for those who actually bought the DVD (one of them was me); Did you see how Carpenter describes the film? He is really proud of this and talks a long time about it as his best work, and he praises the script. And in the commentary track, where he notices an obvious flaw that has made it to the final cut, he just says he does not feel it necessary to correct the mistake, and he just left it there. I'm afraid the old master has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope that I have proven wrong. <br /> <br /> I would like to make a positive comment and mention that the creature effects are great though. Technically speaking, this film is first class, with effective lighting concepts and make-up effects.
