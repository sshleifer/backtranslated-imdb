I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean. He is the only rewarding presence in this film. Still, do not see this movie. Although he is good as a main villain, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I did not care about the characters (except the little boy) and I did not care if the stars crossed or died. The movie did not make me believe or believe that these people were actually interested in each other. I read a lot of "classic" novels after watching the movies, and this movie made me not even read the book. The story seems so boring. But I can read it and read it to save the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actress who played Lorna was also in Sense and Sensibility and she was much better at it. Take a look at Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E has great movies with novels like Pride and Prejudice. Or a miniseries like the Forsyte saga. Look at her, do not worry about Lorna Doone.
