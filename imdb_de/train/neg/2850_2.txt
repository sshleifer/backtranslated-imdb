If I had realized that John Wayne was in this movie, I would not have seen him. It is humiliating for the Japanese, unhappy for Hollywood and embarrassing for any thinking person. But most John Wayne movies are like that. Hollywood in the 1950s still believed that everyone in the world loved Americans when the truth was (and is) slightly different. The film deals with the isolationism of Japan from the 19th century. Maybe it should be Hollywood that should be isolated. To make it as brief as possible, this movie is a jingoistic gossip.
