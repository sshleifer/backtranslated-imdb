Shocking! <br /> <br /> In 1965 I saw Jury Gagarin alive. He was sincere, unpretentious and friendly, he felt good and looked like an educated and intellectual person. I saw a clown in this movie! The actor looks like a fool with concerned gestures and mimicry. You made a cartoon! The real Gagarin was someone else! Do not believe in this movie! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after the films like "Taming of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading Chertok's "Rockets and People" and "Korolev: Myths" books and facts " by Golovanov I was shocked by a troublesome scenario, bad drama and production and many inaccuracies in "Space Race". <br /> <br /> The film is the boring rendering of historical facts known in Russia - many interesting facts known to us Some of the facts and details were perverted - for example, Korolev was not a prisoner in 1945 (released in 1944), and in 1940 he was not in the Kolyma goldmine, but in a special prisons design bureau The designer in the prison design bureau and the dead prisoners were not buried, but in the film, Korolev worked as a grave after 1940 (because prison guards wear shoulder straps on uniforms) IMHO ha the movie writers do not have any deep knowledge of this part of the story and they can not make interesting films.
