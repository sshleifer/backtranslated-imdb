I've seen Arthur (the TV series and the books) years ago and never loved the show (if you're a fan of this cartoon, I'll excuse you if I spoil it, but that's really what I think.) Many people liked it but I did not do it. <br /> <br /> The characters of the schoolchildren seemed to be struggling all the time (especially Arther and DW) getting tired of Arthur's plaintive attitude towards everyone and his sister DW (however, the name was spelled out) and DW was an ADHD (or ADS) -like 4-year-old sister of Arthur who sometimes demanded (which was sometimes the reason that Arthur got upset about her routines, like her imaginary girlfriend and her stuffed animal collection, etc.) Arthur's friends are like teens and not like the Arthur books, and parents do not care. <br /> <br /> The biggest cartoon was Rocko's Modern Life, not Arthur (no offense).
