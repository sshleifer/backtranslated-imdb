This entry is certainly interesting for serial fans (like me), but still largely incomprehensible. The plot is confusing, as is the continuation of the sequel. Some striking effects to be sure, but we never figure out what that really means. <br /> <br /> Try to see the workprint version "NC-17" that contains the gore that has been re-evaluated "R".
