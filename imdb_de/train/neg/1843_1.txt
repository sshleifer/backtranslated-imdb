Impressive. Just awful I was a fan of the original movie and reluctantly sat by Part 2, 3 and improved. 4,5 and Freddy's Dead were pretty bad. But NOTHING is as bad as Freddie's nightmares. Freddy acts as Rod Serlingesq presenter of this anthology series. <br /> <br /> I can accept that Freddy became one punch after the other, but at least in the movies, Freddy's magnetism carried the movies, but here they were so badly made, they looked like high school productions of a horror series. The poor actors, if you really want to call themselves, were obviously exactly what they paid for. I'm almost sure this was a breakpoint for two types of actors. One is just starting on the Hollywood ladder, is brand new and ready to take on any part that would deny the porn job they got offered last week, or experienced actors on their way down the Hollywood ladder ready are to take any part that would take them After they had to take this porn job, they were offered last week. <br /> <br /> I half expected Dana Plato to be a guest star, but she was already dead when it was in production. <br /> <br /> To initial Nancy's line in the original Elm St: "Whatever you try not to fall asleep watching this."
