One of the worst movies I have ever seen. How do I define "worst"? I would prefer to pull both eyeballs out and then be forced to tap on them than ever to see that pathetic filth again. Somehow, One-Hit Wonder Zwick creates a movie that simultaneously offends Elvis fans, Mary Kay saleswomen, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents, and the rest of humanity with a smart, sloppy farce. How Elvis Presley Enterprises was able to use the rights of the current Elvis songs in a movie with a central premise that reads, "The only good Elvis Presley impersonator is a dead one," is a mystery to me. The worst part of this mess - and that requires some work - is the mangled script: in 1958, Elvis 'words and songs that he would speak in the' 70s are quoted! Worst special effect? This Oscar would go to the idiot who decided that Elvis' tomb, possibly the most photographed / recognizable tomb in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued to it, and is somewhere in the middle of a park. The biggest crowd in this movie might be Elvis fans. However, rampant stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge, no FBI badges ... and I could go on and on) actually undercuts conventional wisdom. Pooh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. This is really a horrible, terrible movie.
