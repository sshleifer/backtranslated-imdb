It is very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making films. They get worse every time. Niki and Flo (2003) is a depressing sting into the camera. It is unfortunate that out of the many films shot every year in Romania, the worst of them are sent abroad (eg Chicago International Film Festival). This film without plot, drama or script is a waste of time and money. Rating: 0.02 out of 10.
