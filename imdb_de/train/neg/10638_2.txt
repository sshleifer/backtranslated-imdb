The proof that not everything that touches Tarantino turns into gold. This is definitely plastic. It's easy to see that without Quentin's involvement, that would probably have been on the shelf for years, assuming it had been produced in the first place. It's about a woman who is fascinated by death and gets a job that cleans up after the crime scenes. Angela Jones is not convincing in this role. William Baldwin is better than the serial killer holding Jones in employment! All in all, pretty poor.
