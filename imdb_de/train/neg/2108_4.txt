Some brides are mysteriously murdered on the altar, and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue. Newspaper author Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious murders. She discovers that before each ceremony, the bride received a rare orchid (allegedly from the groom) containing a powerful drug that succumbed to her. Patricia tells us that the orchid was first used by a dr. Lorenz, who lives with his wife in a remote estate. In reality, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes by putting the brides in a suspended state and using their glandular fluid to keep his wife forever young. Patricia and dr. Dr. Foster (who works with Dr. Lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife) is trying to get Dr. Forcing Lorenz's hand by arranging a fake wedding that finally puts Patricia in the hands of the crazy doctor. This movie had a very good opening role, but ended with too many shot shots and other weak scenes. The cast is decent, Walters and Coffin deserve it better, but that's life. Russell steals the show (even against Lugosi, who does not give any of his more memorable performances, even when he looks at his monograms), as Countess Lorenz plays the part with the qualities of many of the stereotypical features of many Hollywood prima donnas today. Weak and constructed ending too. Rating based on B movies, 4.
