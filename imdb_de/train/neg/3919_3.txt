This movie is not as good as any think. The actors are low and the story is very funny. I respect the imagination, but Lord of the Rings is fantasy ... Conan..is fantasy ... THAT IS NORMAL HK-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENT ... Why did they absorb this splatter tongue, making it all worse. The only good thing is the camera and the job of the tailor.
