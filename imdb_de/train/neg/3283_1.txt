OK, we all love the Daisy Dukes, but what about this cast? Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not one thing about this girl and Daisy was not stupid Uncle Jesse was probably the one who came closest to the original. No insult to Burt, but I've never noticed that boss HOg is so big. That was part of the humor humor that was of his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK, now they get the cast Jessica Simpson Has anyone looked at her husband? He brings Luke Duke together for a tea !!!!!! Obviously, these producers did not pay attention to the look of the old cast. The screens were never present on the Dukes !! This turned the movie from the beginning. I give a huge thumb down.
