The cover of the box of this movie bears the name of Kyle Minogue, but she has the same fate as Drew Barrymore in "Scream." That's the first thing that paralyzes this movie. They try to market a movie with someone who is in it for five minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course we have to have this movie with young hip college kids who do not know that there is a killer. To top it off, Molly Ringwald from the 80s is a famous movie. It's a good career move for Molly to get some money in a crappy movie in Australia so she's not being ridiculed in the States. In any case, this stupid movie is a stupid horror movie that was never finished because that stupid creature kills anyone who is in it. Throughout the movie, we should guess who the killer is. Long story, remember our little friend Molly, she saves the day ... or does she? <br /> <br /> This step is just bad, rent it if you want to torment yourself, or just break it down on the floor of your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Do not spread the horror.
