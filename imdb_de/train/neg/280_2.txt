God, I was bored watching this pilot. I had expected a lot from that as I'm a big fan of James Cameron (and not just since "Titanic," I could add), and his name in the credits that I thought were a quality guarantee (Then again, he also wrote the leaden Strange Days ..). But the thing miserably failed to grab my attention at a point of its almost two hours duration. In all that time it was not much beyond the two-line summary, and I would be trying very hard to find any kind of contiguous conspiracy out of the jumble of strands going nowhere. I also do not think acrobatics has outperformed a normal "A-Team" episode. As far as Alba is concerned, yes, she is great, of course, but the fact that she shows the entire film with only a single expression (pout and nonsense) soon makes me bored with her "gal wit a attitude". You can count me out of this, Mr. Cameron!
