I saw that in the subway last night. The involved actor first caught my attention. The first scenes were Attention Strippers. Some funny something sad. Good character development. I felt like the last third of the movie was diverge. If it had not been for the beginning of the movie, I would have stopped watching. I kept watching how it was connected. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I have the feeling that it never happened. Above all, I did not like the length of time several characters spoke Yiddish (?). Was that the other shoe? <br /> <br /> Would I recommend? No, I do not think so. As other critics point out, much of the slang is outdated (1960s), but it was not too distracting. The end totally rejected me.
