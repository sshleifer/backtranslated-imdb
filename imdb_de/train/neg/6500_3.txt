I'm sorry if half of the world insults you, but life is confusing enough. I do not have to see it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, great. I even looked at Fracture and knew it would be a steaming bunch of Quentin. But this thing is not well taken, and it is not daring - even if it is artistic. Well produced movies have reasons for cuts and quick edits, not these "oh, but it's a realistic interpretation". This thing will hurt your head. It's the fastest moving picture you can not take anywhere. I still love AH, and I always give it a chance. But if you do not have time to see bad ideas on the screen, just skip it.
