This movie pretends to be a character study of perversion. Some critics have believed that the film is psychologically deep because perversion is portrayed. Considering the abundant material, it is surprisingly boring and flat, with no motivational substance. Why is the main character the way she is? You will not find out from the script. Try Bunuels Belle de Jour to better handle the same theme (and a more entertaining movie).
