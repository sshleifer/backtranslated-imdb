I rented this one to see Vanesa Talor again. She can act, but has no chance in this clunker. The opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes. Must be from an archive because the movie is shot directly on video. The production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ more professional. There is a really cheesy animated statue, but no other noteworthy effects. This movie is bad, but not funny. The players would do well not to mention it in their CV.
