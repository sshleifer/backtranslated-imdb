Before watching this movie, please read the reviews available on the internet about film forging the movie, especially the widespread fact that 7-8,000 Muslim men from Srebrenica were driven out and shot by Serbian paramilitaries. The documentary filmmaker also belongs to various pro-Serbian American organizations. Please look at this movie critically and read the reviews beforehand. Most reviews argue that the documentary filmmaker goes too far in his arguments, even when raising questions concerning conventional wisdom regarding war. A review in NYTimes by Stephen Holden states that it would be "inaccurate to label this documentary pro-Serbian," but one should include both the presentation of facts, many of which are from reliable sources, and the lack of these facts question Serbian troops. I do not advise seeing this documentary, but I advise you to look at it critically (as you should anyway anytime).
