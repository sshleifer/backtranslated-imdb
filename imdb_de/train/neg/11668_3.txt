There are beautiful landscape shots. Authors who put banal mouths in the mouth of the actors. For smaller actors, this show would be silly. "Art has to raise humanity, or it's BS." Not so, because the art of all the above also stimulates humanity and expresses the dark side. The main character even says that those who do not drink hide the dark side. Wrong, he lived in the dark and suppressed his dark side by drinking and being one-dimensional, without broadening his horizon with anything other than landscapes. There was no respiratory organism in his work nor expression of his pain. The artist was limited to only a dozen landscapes. The discussions between the characters were the elementary school. I tried to like it after reading the first wow comments here. I had to dig deep to see those I agreed with. I think the great comments come from those who are involved with the movie. I was only moved once towards the end. The boy was far too passive. The scenery was beautiful and the music ridiculous. Only my opinion but for me nowhere.
