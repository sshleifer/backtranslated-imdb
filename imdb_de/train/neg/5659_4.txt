A disappointing end to a season that started off so well ... Exodus Part 2 and other notable episodes were among the best on TV in any series, as this was pretty bad <br /> I'm not sure If the episode was a disappointment, but the cheesy guitar music that accompanied the final sequence was ridiculous and would have been more at home in the original series. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if senior executives disliked the slow end of lower notes and wanted to jazz it. They failed and spoiled everything. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that this is not a trend for the future. Nevertheless, at least we have seen the return of a certain person, even if she was a bit bizarre made foolish
