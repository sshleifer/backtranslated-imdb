Originally aired as ABC movie of the week. These are two young, innocent students who are taken to a prison camp in a small town in the south. They are not allowed to talk on the phone and nobody knows they are there. What follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and humiliation, which leads to a very disturbing result. <br /> <br /> The TV version was (for their time) grim. No nudity and the punches were pretty tame, but the general sense of sloppiness has diminished. The unrated version is even worse - there is plenty of nudity, the violence is extreme and in a particularly disgusting sequence we see a crying female prisoner forced to undress while a lesbian guard "uses" her. YUCK! There is nothing wrong with commercials, but this one goes over the edge. It feels like the filmmakers enjoy torturing and humiliating these poor women - all of this is slapped in your face as if you were enjoying it. The unnecessary downbeat end does not help. <br /> <br /> I give him a 3 because the acting is good - but that actually makes it harder to watch the movie. A sick, sloppy movie. Not recommended.
