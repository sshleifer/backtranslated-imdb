I am a Christian and I say this movie had terrible acting, unreal situations and a complete fa√ßade for Christianity. You might as well see "Remember the Titans" and at least not mix Christ in a football movie like a steroid for losers. Let me make some really urgent comments on what bothered me in this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. The school was in Georgia and was a white academy. I have not noticed a single black student or student at school. I'm dealing with the white "Christian" academies in the south, and they were built for no other reason than to re-establish segregation. This is worrisome when it comes to Christianity and Christ's life-changing film. (Note: I loved the black trainer-coach as if he had made up for the completely white team and all the black 'Giants' players.) <br /> <br /> 2. The uncritical response of all Christians to this film. Can I get some people to say that it's bad acting, bad filming, bad writing and, in short, bad compared to other films. If we compared this to another football movie, would he have the same charisma and energy? <br /> <br /> 3. The half baked Christianity that was shown made even less sense for me than the unrealistic end. If Christianity is about just reading and praying a little scripture to begin a complete change of life, then do not be surprised if no one listens to what Christians have to say. We want to sell Christ as a panacea. It does not have to be sold and it does not have to be tied to such whimsical lifestyles. No wonder anyone views Christianity as anti-intellectual with this unreal presentation. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that this movie may be inspiring for some people. It will not be for most. There will be no real picture of struggle and intimate tension. For me, the most important thing is that it is by no means Christian or expanding. It has values, but it's too short to get carried away by bootstraps. If you live with people who have difficulties and / or live with people in the Third World, this film will be hollow, as most churches today live in their religion.
