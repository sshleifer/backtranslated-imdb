Once upon a time there were angry people who made a movie about a guy who was shot into space, supposedly to visit Saturn, but only for a few shots of solar flares, and then he gets a nosebleed, and before you know it, He's in a hospital connected from head to toe, and then an overweight nurse with a badly fitting uniform comes in and gets eaten by the guy who was supposed to melt everywhere, but never seems to lose weight, and then NASA , or at least a man at NASA, gets upset and calls another man to hunt him, but the guy they sent to chase the melting guy must go home first and eat some soup, and his peculiarly shaped wife forgot the crackers, so he can not have crackers, and then he has to go out and look for the melting guy with a Geiger counter, and that sparks It does not really ionise, so it really only follows the tracks of half-eaten corpses, and then there's something about a sheriff and two ugly old people in a lemon grove and a woman with a butcher's claw D a kind of industrial plant with triggering guards, and I will not can say how the movie ends, all I can say is that Jonathan Demme is in there somewhere with a guy with the stupid name Burr DeBenning There's a justice in the world that makes anyone who's in this movie a hideous, allowed violent deaths and was unable to make more films, and the world lived happily ever after - the end!
