Protocol is an implausible film whose only salvation is to stage Goldie Hawn with a good cast of supportive actors. The story revolves around a sombre cocktail waitress who becomes famous after she accidentally rescues the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes down through the movie and Goldie's charm just does not save this movie. If you're not a Goldie Hawn fan, you should not necessarily watch this movie.
