The first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters. Suddenly, however, everything happened too quickly, a lame reason for Akshey Kumar to meet three girls who were very loud, both from Akshey and from John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the film, Paresh Rawal was good but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri. Overall, this film was the biggest disappointment that the film does not do justice to its trailer. Save your money and do not watch this movie, have a look at Hera Pheri and Hungama again! <br /> <br /> sum it up: a cheap stage show performance and the appearance of the movie, no story or substance feel good music from Preetam, the man who bought us Dhoom! go on! Filming in a room, newcomers (female cast) were okay as it was their first movie, but established actors like Akshey and John were utterly disappointed that an established director like Priyadarshan is giving his worst movie of all time!
