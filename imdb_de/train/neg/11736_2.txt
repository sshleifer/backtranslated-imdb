The week before I saw Iowa, I saw the Art School Confidential, where a discerning student shoots a movie and can not decide whether he wants art or violent exploitation. Iowa could be the movie he made. I can see elements of much better movies in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. In addition to artistry, both films had good character development and related storylines. Iowa. This movie stumbles to an absurd end. I have to admit that it had consistency. This movie is bad from start to finish and not particularly bad or better in any part. The actors did everything they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. She shows that she is very talented, very funny and sexy. But why does she have to demonstrate it in that damned ball?
