I actually saw this movie in the original release in the cinema. It was painful to see Peter Sellers so embarrassed. The story was incredibly lame and hard to follow, and the end was ridiculous. It was only sad to see how the powerful had fallen. I'm not going to say that I'm a big Peter Sellers fan, but I really enjoyed the Pink Panther series and I felt like he did a great job with Being There. But this movie should never have been done. From what I read, he produced the film against the advice of his fellow man. Okay, but that still does not excuse that the movie is actually released.
