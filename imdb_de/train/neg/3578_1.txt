This movie can not be redeemed absolutely. They recorded a lewd story, missed it, wrote it wrong, missed it. It has bad dialogues that were poorly executed in a meandering and trashy story. <br/> <br /> As bad as art fails, it fails even worse than the trade. Who could have been the target market? Which age group Which interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone should make a movie about how and why he made this movie. That I would have to pay for it. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies and this is rated "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choice as the three most unsolvable movies I've ever seen. Anyone involved should be forced to talk to VanDamme for all eternity. I challenge you. Look at this movie and do an academic exercise - how can you do that and make it worse? I can not imagine a way.
