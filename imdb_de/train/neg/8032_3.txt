This had a great cast with well-known stars like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a number of lesser known but well-known names with shorter roles. There was also Technicolor, one of the few films shot in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now the bad news ....... unfortunately I can not say much positive for the story. It portrayed the James guys in a totally positive light ... and Hollywood has been doing that ever since. Why these criminals are always the "good guys" is unclear to me. This movie enchants them and turns their enemies - the railroad people - into evil people. The latter was so exaggerated that it was absurd. Well, that's the movie world for you: evil is good; good is bad. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood: Here's a news flash - The James guys were criminals! Really - look it up!
