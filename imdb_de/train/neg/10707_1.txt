Where should one start? This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The editing is the worst of all times, the sound effects were terrible and the sound processing was crazy. Most of the film you can only see here are the crappy kick effects with jumbled conversations in the background. I had to turn up the volume just to hear what was going on ... and what should I hear? Probably one of the worst screenplays ever made. I can not believe that people actually have something green for this movie. I think I could put a crap in a box, send it to producers and then let them finance a movie for me. Dolph, that was already common, Dolph. Nothing else has to be said. The bad guys were bad, the protagonists bad and the movie was a stinker. If you really want to know what NOT to do when writing, directing or editing a movie, check it out!
