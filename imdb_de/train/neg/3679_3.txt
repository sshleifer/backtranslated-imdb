This is a Japanese movie, but it also speaks a lot of English. It is a beautiful film with beautiful pictures showing the scenic beauty of Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, this was the only redeeming quality for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants to watch a young woman sulking 90 percent of the movie because her husband, who is a "picture", is much older than he announced? Granted, that could be a shit ...... but overcome it! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes does she make a change and loves him. At that time, it was too late for most viewers. We were asleep until then.
