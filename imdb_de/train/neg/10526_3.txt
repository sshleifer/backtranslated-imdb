Boring girl film at the Reform School, which plays something like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck there after escaping from her abusive father. Once in de facto prison, she is raped by her fellow inmates in a gang. <br /> <br /> Overlong (even in 98 minutes) with a completely meaningless ending that makes the entire movie seem pointless /> <br /> The 15-year-old Linda Blair is doing her best to avoid that she shows her body when she is not dressed, but she slips a nipple shot during a shower scene. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of *** *
