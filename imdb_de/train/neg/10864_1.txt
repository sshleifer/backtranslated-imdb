The reason I intended to give this film a chance to spend two hours of my life (in fact, it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to understand and, hopefully, appreciate Indian cinema. All I've ever seen was a couple of older films by S.Ray. <br /> <br /> Browse the IMDb. I came across these and after seeing the rating of 8.7, I came to the conclusion that this must be the one that opens the doors of unknown and brings artistic enjoyment. Oh my god, how wrong I was! The only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that most of the 970 individuals who have voted are Indians, and their only company outside the Bolliwood production were Adam Sandler films. <br /> <br /> With this rating this movie would be ranked # 9 IMDb List of the 250 Best Movies About Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I'm really not in the mood to review and criticize, because there's nothing I should remember about this painful experience. My only hope is that there are many Hindus who will find this movie the way it is - just stupid, with a wealth of kitsch and cheesy music.
