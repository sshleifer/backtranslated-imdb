the only scenes that made me laugh, where those with christopher walken (the crazy movie director) were just bored of the rest of the movie. Nothing happens in the first hour. jones douglas is really overreacting. julia roberts routinely does the former ugly duck (yeah right!) in the girl next door (where did i see that?), who gets the guy What would happen to the main characters? If cusack really fell from the building in a suicide attempt, the movie could have been more interesting.
