Well, what was fun ... except for the fun part. <br /> <br /> It's my second lowest favorite, I even thought it was worse than "Lazarus" and "Ghost in the Machine". <Br /> <br /> Let's start with the good. The teaser, it was incredibly well done and also emotional. I'm the big animal lover, and it was fun to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. <br /> <br /> But then there is all the bad, and believe me, there are a lot of them. It made little sense, so these animals were kidnapped and impregnated by strangers? whaaa ??? The dialogue was pretty awful too. There were about one or two quotable lines. <br /> <br /> and worst of all, it was very uncomfortable for me to kill so many animals. In the end ... what's the point? They all pretty much died. We did not learn anything, we were not entertained and I could not even find Sophia's death sad ... just frustrating. <br /> <br /> * Star. Too bad, since Season 2 was doing so well.
