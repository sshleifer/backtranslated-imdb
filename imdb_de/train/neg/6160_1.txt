I would not say that this is a * bad * movie. Unfortunately, I feel that the more you know about fencing, the worse it gets because it becomes completely unrealistic. I've been fighting since I was 14, and this movie shows it very badly. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have a little fencing background), but most of the other actors - especially the students - seem to be lost.
