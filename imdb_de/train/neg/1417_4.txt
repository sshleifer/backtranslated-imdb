While on the beach, red-haired brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mumy (as Arthur and Petey Loomis) find a seal. The boys baptize their creature "Sammy" and spend the summer with the sandy sea lion. When it's time to go home, the boys suffer separation anxiety. The young Mr. McGreevey decides that she can not bring "Sammy" back to "Disneyland"? uh, "Gatesville" - but the young Mr. Mumy grabs him anyway. At home, they try to hide "the way seal" from adults, and of course? Kidnappings follow! <br /> <br /> **** Sammy - The Way Seal, Part 1 (10/28/62) Norman Tokar - Michael McGreevey, Bill Mumy, Robert Culp
