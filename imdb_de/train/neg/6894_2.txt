It's sad to see what a movie has been trying to do, and it's obvious that it lags far behind the mark. Film students should understand this as a lesson and warning. Would the graduate have an idea. He wants total control. He writes, directs, produces and produces his cinematic masterpiece all by himself. Normally, his concept is far beyond his budget. Usually he writes an overused script with every tag line he can come up with. Normally, he's more interested in the big momentum of the story than in working with actors on individual scenes. He usually ends up with a movie that is weak in his attempt to do wonders on a budget. Usually he ends up with a series of encounters (we can not call justice by calling them scenes) that feel like a 12-year-old. And usually he ends up with poorly played scenes that the viewer can not grab. If you look at judges from this perspective, you can immediately see that it's just the usual price.
