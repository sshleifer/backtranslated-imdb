In the unlikely event that some up-and-coming directors read these comments, I would like to give some advice (from the perspective of the viewer) (for free!). If you want to make a seriously exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to parody exotic adventure movies, continue. DO NOT try to do both at the same time, it will not work. For example, if you've killed and beheaded a goofy "comic relief" character and then shook a tree with a monkey and dropped a coconut on a cannibal's head, you look like you have NO IDEA. This is boring, meandering, cheap, racist ... you get the picture. A few clever moments and a few insights into the nudity of Kathy Shower (far too biting here) are hardly worth the effort. There is a reason why everyone has forgotten the existence of this film. (* 1/2)
