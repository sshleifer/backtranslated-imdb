Not a movie, but a lip-sync collection of performances by acts that were part of the British invasion that followed the Beatles' dynamic entry into the music world. Some of these acts did not attract much attention on this side of the pond, but many of them did. Presented are: Herman's Hermits, Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, Peter and Gordon, Honeycombs, Nashville Teens, Animals and of course the Beatles. <br /> <br /> It's so much fun to see these young acts beforehand. They sharpened and polished their actions.
