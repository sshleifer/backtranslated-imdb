David Lynch's rude and cruel capture of South Park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clich√©s about families in the suburban families. The father is a horrible monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large, circular mouth hole, from which the most terrible guttural sounds resound, the son and the mother are permanently horrified, incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life. A number of equally absurd characters are featured throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not famous for his comedies (eg On the Air, aspects of Wild at Heart), and I do not like comedy in general in general. However, there were a few scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh. There are some clever animated films - where Lynch communicates in his characters through a syntactic arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions (which never really differ in Dumbland) large reaction areas. <br /> <br /> I think Lynch I really tried to give his audience a straightforward, if disturbing, animated comedy. Interestingly, he preferred to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low-humor humor (ie Most Will Farrell films) as he added elements of vicious social criticism and classic cartoon violence and gross humor. Although the mix here does not work really well, it's nothing, if not Lynchian. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing for Lynch fans.
