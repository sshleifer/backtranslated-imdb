I grew up with the original series of the sixties and I can tell you one thing, there is NO comparison. This movie was absolutely ridiculous with a live flight suit. A Martian, who has assumed different forms. Special effects that looked like something that would make a little kid. In contrast, characters were developed in the original and the audience developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight in this movie, yes, actually there was one when Ray Walston finally performed in the end. He wore dark glasses and was referring to living on this planet for 30 years as a kind of homage to the television series. But the real uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
