My Take: A tired formula Christmas comedy. The laughs are tired and the talents behind them seem to be too. <br /> <br /> I love the holidays as much as the next guy (though I often have a bad case of the holiday blues), but it seems like it's just a dumping ground for a series of holiday comedies every day Year poor films would be, but that does not make them less painful during the season. As if we already have enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (three and * sip * still count), who wants to see a movie about his brother? In an act that would be part of Disney's SANTA CLAUSE franchise (except occasionally gross humor and Santas "Little" helper wearing a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a 116-minute premise for a joke. Sure, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a brother, but where is it going? <br /> <br /> It's really a shame. FRED CLAUS is blessed with a cast that could have turned into a funny Christmas comedy, which is likely to melt away with the snow, but it would have been so much better. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we believe he really is the long-lost brother of never aging Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti), who invites his good old brother to visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) hesitates, and worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to watch Santa Claus closely, and his THIS is about to be closed. Hah! And guess who plays Santas mother! Kathy Bates, of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa's Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! I do not know if I would praise the casting or beat it. Here are some familiar faces that add a touch of quality, but there is not enough to work with. <br /> <br /> As far as the humor is concerned, the best FRED CLAUS could possibly do with Santa's brother is his exact opposite and a joke about a DJ-elf. I have to admit that I had a few giggles Fred joined in a group discussion for prominent brothers (where Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone are added), but the giggles start and end there. What's worse, the movie even succumbs to the sentimentality that makes us feel "good" and get a lesson about "what Christmas really means." Apparently Christmas for Hollywood gets so much of our leftover Christmas money as it gets. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** from 5.
