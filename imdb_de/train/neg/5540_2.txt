After seeing the uprising of the zombies with future Oscar winner Dean Jagger, I had a burning question. How was a society that created these ultimate warrior combat machines ever defeated? <br /> <br /> That's the question you'll ask yourself if you take the time to see Revolt Of The Zombies. Towards the end of the First World War, the French discover a cult from occupied Cambodia in which these undead creatures, who can not be stopped with bullets, form a brigade of monks who take the Huns by surprise and prevent it. <br /> <br /> This frightens the living feces of all involved so that an international expedition is formed to destroy the secret of these zombies so that no nation can get their hands on it and rule the world. But we have got some dissatisfaction in these ranks. The first is the sinister villain Roy D'Arcy, who murders the Buddhist monk who has the secret, and the second is Dean Jagger. Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac, as we all know, and he is determined to court Dorothy Stone of rival Robert Noland. I think you have an idea of ​​how that comes out, especially since a race of zombies did not take place. Do not conquer the world for a country. When he received the Oscar for Twelve O'Clock High, Dean Jagger must have been shaken every time he thought about this movie and the spark of the dreadful dialogue he attempted to give a spark of sincerity. Moral of the story, you could make the ultimate warrior with the zombie potion and zombie vocals, but you can not make an ultimate love slave.
