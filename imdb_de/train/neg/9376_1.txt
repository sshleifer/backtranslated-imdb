As I watched this movie, I got sick. I grew up with Pippi and it was always a pleasure. When my wife came to Sweden, she looked at the oldies and laughed very well. However, this American version should be renamed and never be displayed again. It's terrible from beginning to end. How can they make it that bad? Well, I guess somebody blames the translation, ha ha ha .. but they are never near Pippi. Can this film never be seen again and never be broadcast on a program? Burn the movie and save the kids. If you want to watch Pippi, then watch the original movie and laugh well. WE LOVE PIPPI IN NILSSON, sorry Tami Erin, you will never get up as Pippi. "Well, I think the director stands for it ... you watch this movie at your own risk ... it's really a waste of time ...
