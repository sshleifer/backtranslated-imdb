Unimaginably stupid, superfluous and humiliating closure of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it seems that director Rachel Talalay intentionally turned Wes Craven's initial premise into a big, bad and tasteless joke. This is not just the worst entry in the "Elm Street" saga. It's also one of the most embarrassing horror films ever made, and fans of the genre get insulted! The story is stupid, the character drawings are ridiculous, the structure is all unclear and ?? most ?? The special and visual effects are similar to those of a Tom & Jerry cartoon. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Did we want to be petrified when a freddy Freddy Breckin turned Meyer into a video game character and stuck him to the house walls? The story takes us back to Springwood and it looks like Freddy suddenly has a middle-aged daughter. You'd think he mentioned that in one of his previous adventures, but no? There's only one teen who survived in Springwood, and Krueger uses it to connect with his long-lost daughter. Another reason why this last installment is so terrible is the utterly illogical structure. The John Doe boy is introduced as the lead actor, but then suddenly dies and the storyline continues to revolve around two adults! How about this: Freddy Krueger, who has spent five whole movies killing only teenagers, is finally beaten by two adults wearing 3D glasses! Somehow ruining the whole essence, right? For me, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a terribly overrated series, but until now even the weakest posts have had at least some redemptive elements. However, "Freddy's Dead" is simply unbearable and nobody should waste their precious time watching him.
