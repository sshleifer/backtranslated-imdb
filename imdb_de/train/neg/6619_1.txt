This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in the cinema !! Could not wait until it ends. To make matters worse, there is a 12A certificate, so no one is shot, only bodies that fall to the ground, even Babban, who was killed, was cut off !!! Too many scenes were cut to include younger viewers, as the creators thought this would have catastrophic consequences !! The acting of Amitabhs was great, but this 'Basanti' wannabe and the other idiot who plays Devgan's mate can not even act. Devgan was wasted !! <br /> <br /> I would not look at it again for free and I advise everyone else who reads this to do exactly the same thing WHAT YOU WERE IMPORTANT !!
