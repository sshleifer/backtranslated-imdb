If you're not already familiar with the pop stars that star in this movie, save yourself time and stop reading this review when you've reached the end of the next movement. <br /> <br /> FILM AND GO WATCH SOME OTHERS. <br /> <br /> But if you insist on reading, consider the following: <br /> <br /> Lame vehicle for Japanese teen-idol-pretty-guys with nonsensical, entangled "plot", It takes little time to scream. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie makes sense. It's an endless line of people expressing different emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, for no good reason. Of course we can see that something unbelievably "dramatic" is happening, but we just do not give a CRAP WHY, because there is no backstory. <br /> <br /> When this movie is over, you'll be sick and tired of those stupid, lanky, girlish faces. You will be outraged if you have been watching them all the time, smiling, sneering, crying, acting mysteriously, being "serious", and any other meaningless expression that they are slapping into their faces. <br /> <br /> That some idiot would Always go so far as to label this bland rubbish as the "soul" of one of his "actors", should unequivocally prove to you what the trailer and the myriad comments on this site will not say: <br /> <br /> Only the "converted" mindless henchmen will like this movie, the majority of them teen girls with a pathological worship for anything androgynous. Freud would have a field day. <br/> <br /> If you are not one of those mindless "fans," stay away from hell from this abomination.
