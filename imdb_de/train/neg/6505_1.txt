A confusing mess from start to finish. As you said earlier about the Beatles songs, there was a secret message when you played the LP backwards. If you had the patience to watch the scenes of this movie from beginning to end, you would be just as disappointed. Apart from all that psychedelic hodge from flashbacks and false starts, the clearest characters were the movie makers, who were supposed to avenge themselves if the movie was not sorted. There was nothing to like about these two. Overclocking, shouting and threats were delivered in a comic style. I think that one-dimensional was an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe the Artsy guys are rolling their eyes and reveling in the fact that we Plebeians other than they just did not understand it. I'm afraid there was nothing to get. And the two cardinal sins of every bad movie were born from beginning to end. A nonexistent and pathetic act, if you want to call it that, and by far the worst, not a single character that interested you in the least.
