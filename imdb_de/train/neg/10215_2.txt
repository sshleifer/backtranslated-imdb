A terribly senseless and bad boring movie. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say, no characters going beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes, and relies on a clunky centralized concept that is neither original nor treated in a vaguely innovative way. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is utterly wasted on what he might have hoped for in response to Jim Carey's Truman Show, and will replace his usual screaming routine (admittedly very funny, if you forget Talledega Nights) for pretty much nothing. <br /> <br /> Emma Thompson is no less than slightly irritating (some of the reviews I've read here, she's calling for an Oscar nomination, is ridiculous), while Maggie Gyllenhaal has a passable job with a very weak script It was nothing but her education as a former law student who had left Harvard to become a baker because she loved making people happy. You're welcome. That she finally fell in love with Ferrell's "character" is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Marc Forster's attempts to enhance the film with computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired nature of the material he has to work with. <Br /> <br /> I had the choice to either see or see The Prestige for the third time. I wish I had chosen The Prestige.
