I discovered this movie on IFC and thought it would be interesting. In "tiny" love stories, some of the stories in this movie are really carried away. The fact that none of these women had names makes you almost suspect that the actresses talked about their own sex lives, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit, I want to see more romantic views of the first sexual encounters again, like in "Strike! (1998)", when Odette asked Sinclair's acquaintances after their presumed first time, and Tweety asked, "Was it nice?" <br /> < Some believe that re-enactments and flashbacks could improve this movie. I think that would make things worse. It does not have to be a hardcore porn to get my attention, but somehow I just expected more.
