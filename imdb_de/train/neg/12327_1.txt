A previous reviewer said the movie was not so bad. What?!?!?! The film glorifies child abuse. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked, so we give 5 out of 10 stars. Why not all 10? Since the filmography was "agonizing", the shocks of the child were "unrealistic" and the fat friend "irritating". Nowhere in the review does the reviewer express the indignation that an American movie in 1981 showed scenes of a child having sex with an adult woman. I caught this steamy movie loaf while staying in a Showtime hotel. Even if the fat friend had played a storm and earned an Oscar, I would have to give the film only a star. The fact that Howard Hessman starred on television at the same time as he appeared in the WKRP is particularly ridiculous. But do not take my word for it!
