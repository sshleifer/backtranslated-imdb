I did not know that Willem Dafoe had so much money that he would be ashamed of this shocking hammer blow in this monstrosity. Hell: I donate the money that I would send to Ethiopia when he is so desperate. I've never seen such a pathetic and disgusting movie ... who paid for it? They are either tax evaders or crazy. A five-year-old would be ashamed of the conspiracy, and I would rather get cancer than the hour I've already suffered. All those involved were to be detained for a year in the sodomy wing of a Third World prison. Avoid at all costs. I would give it minus 10 if possible ... unbelievable.
