I write that because somehow I felt that Dark Remains was a good movie. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's certainly not good. <br /> <br /> A weak script, weak actor and weak director. Even if they can not afford a big name, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive leading actress? It was painful to see a simple actress through the film with her boring performance. The story was a clich√© and badly written. The special effects were minimal. The "suspense" tricks used repeatedly here were hard to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Dark Remains is no worse than some of the Masters of Horrors episodes. But not quite the same with quality films. Dark Remains is only recommended for hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss a movie of the genre, even if it's a bad movie. As for everyone else, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.
