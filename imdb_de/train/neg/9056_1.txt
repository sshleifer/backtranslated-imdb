I've seen some fucking movies in my life, but this one has to be one of the worst. Definitely 100s material (imo). <br /> <br /> We follow two couples, the Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and the Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in a car on a drive to Reno. <br /> <br /> Lonnie is apparently not very happy with his sex life, so he cheats on his wife with Candy, who desperately tries to have a baby. Roy is not sure if his sperm is okay, so he's being examined by a doctor. Now I had read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend did not and she broke out after about 20 minutes: "Oh yes, she's getting pregnant, but her husband can not have babies." Spot on, as this movie is so predictable. As well as boring. And annoying. Meaningless. Offensive. Terrible. <br /> <br /> An example of how much this movie stinks. The two couples headed for Nevada in their big car when they were stopped by two policemen for not stopping at a stop sign. The boys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a beer crate. This scene is not only pointless and not important (or even relevant) for the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talking and talking and talking without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> I still have to puke when I think about the end. Roy does not seem to have any problems down there, so he's the child's father. How often does that happen in the movies ... Try something new! The betrayed woman finally forgives her husband and best friend for the matter, and they all live happily ever after. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best scene of the movie is at the end with a few shots of the Grand Canyon. Why could not they just leave the camera on the screen for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> You'd expect more from this cast (though Thornton really tries), but you can not really blame them. Schreiber, you are ashamed! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
