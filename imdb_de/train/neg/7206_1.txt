Well. Where should I start? Let's just say that. Avoid this movie at all <br /> <br /> costs. It is based on a cartoon series. The movie makes the cartoon look <br /> <br /> like Hamlet. Filled with disfigured actors who seem embarrassed to be <br /> <br /> here, lousy camerawork, horrible music and enough product placement to make you never see Yahoo! Again, this movie is really the bottom of the barrel. To quote the New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett go through this image with the gay abandonment of men who have discovered a rare kind of paycheck in the distance "<br /> <br /> You should look at some of the millions pay that they deserve for watching. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
