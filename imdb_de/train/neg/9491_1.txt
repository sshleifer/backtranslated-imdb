With this movie you appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. There is exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. For once, Hamilton makes relatively soft soft focus shots. However, what I found difficult to do with the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when she was filmed, the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing, especially with an older man involved, makes me quite restless. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area to make her look even younger than she is. Come on, sex is a beautiful bygone time - between consenting adults. I also found it strange that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the movie, at least not a real one.
