"Say Yes" is one of the flicks that you hope will get better, but never. It's a kind of "mindless psychopath" who decides to threaten a craps test by an innocent couple that's so popular with videographers. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is clunky and poorly translated in some places. The acting is equally bad, especially from the villain of the play, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that by not winking and trying to speak in a deep voice, he makes his character menacing, if he really just seems a bit simple. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves a special mention of how idiotic it is about any belief. The "heroes" do not find it weird that their pickup threatens to kill them. The "heroine" manages to overlook the villain twice if he's only one foot away from her. The villain passes a police checkpoint (while wearing a blood-covered shirt and a bloody head bandage), showing the policeman a burnt body in the passenger seat of the vehicle he is driving. The villain is hit with a shovel and pierced with a pitchfork, but never seems to be hampered by these more severe injuries. And do not even let me start this terrible ending. Sheesh. <br /> <br /> The only plus in this film for me is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very pretty, but really no more than a mediocre actress. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie looks like a poorly-written, limp-looking and shocking attempt to duplicate "The Hitcher" and "Spoorloos." But it fails on each round of lack of talent among all involved.
