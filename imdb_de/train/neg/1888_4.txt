This movie reminds me of "Irr√©versible (2002)", another artwork film with a violent and radical attitude of human nature. I did not like the movie, but I can not say it's a bad movie, it's just something special. I also remember "Camping Cosmos (1996)", where a few lower class residents live in a seaside camp in Belgium. The same description of how people live together, against their will, and with all the confrontations of characters that do not match. I also thought about the books of the French writer Emile Zola, who was a writer of naturalism. I did not like the movie and I do not like the people who are there. They all look so vulgar, without any good basic taste. One might ask why they live, they all seem to be a member of a great farce forced to live against their will. Or you could say: hell is in this world.
