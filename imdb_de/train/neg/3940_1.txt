This movie is a joke, and Quinton should be ashamed to pose as a Modesty Blaise movie. If you can not sleep, rent this movie. The stick figures who call her an actress, who is supposed to be Modesty. Blaise must be the most boring person on this planet. Maybe it could be used as a hat stand in the background of a real movie. Nothing in five minutes, thanks who ever invented the fast-forward button. If you see this movie, if you can call it RUN. I can not help but think about which Third World country could use the money wasted on this crap. This movie is boring, the actors are a boring waste of color and a waste of air that they breathe. If you want to see Mostey Blaise movie, then watch the movie they made in the 60s.
