I can not believe that I actually saw that, but I just wanted to know if this movie would end up being unintentionally funnier and funnier. and it did. The climax was the worst performance defender ever gave - so realistic that he was too funny even for a fictional story. No one on this planet can behave in court like she did. and probably the worst prosecutor in the world. Why was he in court at all? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove guilty. A simple search for her house would have led to the finding of the rings. but not go he preferred to say "objection" two or three times during the entire process - that was it. The blond lunatic received a truth drug to prove her innocence but not Brett. The madman had almost a board altar in her house that could prove her sick obsession. but not again. During the court scene, I felt a silent urge to remove the needle from her hand and hit her head several times. Even real crazy people do not look as stupid as "I'm innocent". and what does this movie tell us? Never marry a woman with a life insurance: as soon as she falls down the stairs, her husband is put in jail, guilty or not. bad, bad men.
