Please be warned: Although this movie was a pretty bad story, it was one of the cruelest movies I've ever seen. Remember, before you sit down on your couch to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> This is how it officially starts with a party. Only your average party, but there's a guy. He loves Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. To memorize his face; it will help later. <br /> <br /> So Kate goes to George Clooney anyway (did not I say the plot was bad?) and picks up the subway. That's the middle of the night London Underground, but she's just so stupid. The timetable says the next and last train in 7 minutes. Now Kate, the stupid party girl, decides that she can take a nap in the free 7 minutes. Usually she misses the train and gets locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie just keeps going. Blood, guts, limbs, and even certain parts of the body that I do not want to mention are slashed and cut, and finally amputated. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a typical horror; pretty, but fat lady in women of the type distress and sick, weird psycho. Or as is the case, Creep. <br /> <br /> I would say try it if you are interested in Saw, Hostel or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but for the rest of us, you are shouting satisfaction Horror needs a lot of thanks.
