It is hard to believe that this is a sequel to Henry Fool. Hard to believe that both films involved the same director and the same actors. While Henry Fool is refreshing, witty and funny, Fay Grim is slow, boring, and goes nowhere. Where did the joke go? I am amazed. <br /> <br /> It's been 10 years since I've seen Henry Fool and many of his dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fay Grim hurts to see. This is not the fault of the actors who are good (Parker Posey) or great (Jeff Goldblum) - the blame lies in action, dialogue, and even filming (a small budget is no excuse). A huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I could not pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, so disappointed ... if you enjoyed this piece, you would not enjoy Henry Fool so much ... the two films have absolutely nothing to do with each other ... there is no continuity in the personality of the characters ... it's all cheating to get fans of Henry Fool to watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> I shut it off now - Henry in a kind of prison with a Taliban?!?!
