When I was younger, I thought that the first movie in childhood was really good, so I decided to see the sequel. This is an example of why some movies should not have sequels because the first movie is usually the best and it is. Now that Ariel and Eric are married, they have a daughter who is not allowed to enter the house because she is worried about Ursula's sister (Morgano, the villain of the first movie). When the child disembarks, she asks Ursula's sister to turn her into a mermaid, as her mother did. Ariel then goes back to the sea to find her. The same good voice artists, it's just the story that would have thought a bit more. Appropriate!
