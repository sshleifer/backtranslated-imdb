I should qualify this title now that I think about it. Checkout is not completely worthless. I had the opportunity to see it twice, and the second time I laughed at the cost of the film. I think it's worth something. and it's also worth it for the agonizing pain it caused me at the first sight. As another reviewer noted, this film is literally choppy. Not a single original thought went into this movie (which makes the commentary on the originality of the premise completely confusing to me). The film is nothing more than a long series of clich√©s that are strung together and presented as a film. It's definitely not the next staff, it's definitely not original and it's absolutely not "good, clean fun". The film is an absolute ordeal for the uninitiated (seeing it for the first time after seeing it for the first time can be quite funny the second time in an insulting way). When I looked around the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone, apart from the elderly, was bored or painful from the movie. In some of the most emotional scenes where Nick chews out his mother, the audience is actually scared because it was done so badly. I even heard someone moaning in the theater, something I had never seen before. I do not care where you can see this movie, be it at a film festival, in an indie theater or wherever. do yourself a favor, skip this movie with a vengeance. Unless you are like me and can not resist the opportunity to see the really worst movie ever made.
