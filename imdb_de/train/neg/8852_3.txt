To be honest, I did not look at the original howling, but the scenes I saw made it clear that the first howl was a great movie. so great that seven terrible sequels had to be made. They started with Howling II: Your sister is a werewolf. I got this movie on VHS from my uncle when he gave away some old movies he bought when Atari was brand new. I just saw it last night, and it was not really bad, it was just weird. I mean, the whole thing about Sybil Danning, who was on three occasions with two of her werewolf minions, was just inappropriate and quite disturbing (but somehow hot). Christopher Lee was about to prick a dead Karen as if she were a vampire, etc. This movie was actually a kind of mish-mash of Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except for werewolves because everything Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) about Werewolves said, had pretty much peeled off from any other vampire movie (stake) in the heart, garlic must die the creature of the night NIGHT, and the ruler of werewolves lives in TRANSYLVANIA. Not much for acting, but the worst came from Annie McEnroe. I swear, at some point in the movie, I've found that the werewolves tear their necks out because that damned throat always had to say something. Anyway, the plot is pretty stupid and clich√©d, so there's no real reason to tell you, you could just read it on Wikipedia. Incidentally, what really makes me uncomfortable about this movie is the fact that it is the ONLY movie from all seven sequels that is in any way related to the original (not with Howling IV (1988), which was a remake) the original, or in other words, a continuation based on the same novel). So do not see this movie. There is no real horror, hardly any werewolves and only terrible special effects. 3.10
