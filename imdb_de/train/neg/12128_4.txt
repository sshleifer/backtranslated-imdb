If half of the footage seems strangely familiar, you'll see far too much of this bloody Italian cult crap! The notorious demigod Lucio Fulci not only produced this film, but also reused the most sadistic kill sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) "Cat in the Brain". The opening scene, in which a prostitute is brutally beheaded with an ax, can be seen in Fulci's later film, as well as another handful of murders and sleaze moments. Andrea Bianchi's "Masssacre" fails miserably as Giallo, as the search for the sadistic killer among a film crew shooting a horror movie is anything but captivating and exciting, but it's still a good conversation when in a cheap horror trash stands . The incoherent script introduces a whole series of hideous characters, all of whom are potential lunatics, but none of the red herrings that Biachi brings up is plausible and you can spot the killer almost immediately. What is still to be enjoyed are the truly fake make-up effects and the hilarious drama of the ensemble cast. Whenever there is no bloodshed on the screen, like between the first and second killings, "Massacre" is a slow and almost unbearable experience with its inhuman dialogues and absolutely exciting photography. Fortunately, in the second half women are impaled on fences and men are repeatedly stabbed with rusty spines. The music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative. My advice would be to skip this puppy and go straight to the "cat in the brain" mentioned above. In this case ALL great moments of "Massacre" and a few more are shown.
