Gritty, dusty western by director Richard Brooks, who delves deeply into the genre, keeping all the usual clich√©s intact. The horseracing of the early 1900s attracts an unremarkable cowboy (Gene Hackman), a polite player (James Coburn), a cocky boy (Jan Michael Vincent) and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly playing Candice Bergen). Once the preparations are cleared away (with the predictable arguments of whether a woman should attend or not), this becomes a rather compelling entry, but it does not break new ground (it rather resembles the era of Gary Cooper). Good-looking, if the overlong piece has macho momentum and a fine throw, but the mechanisms of the action quickly become tiring. ** from ****
