Badly structured, poorly written, loaded with clich√©s and flat dialogues. Not a single scene is lit. The actors struggle with a painfully boring scenario that can completely avoid surprises, conspiracies or conflicts. You know where to go from the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> For a movie that's set in NY, he has almost no feeling for the city. There are a dozen other indie films that make it magical on a small budget. It seems like it was filmed in Toronto. <br /> <br /> If you occupy Natasha Henstridge, why would you dress her in loose sweaters? Why make Vartan look boring and dull? Where is the attraction? I felt like I was seeing a below-average Christian film of the week in which he was so asexual and moralizing. Steven Feder's great success is that he convinced people to make that bland film.
