My favorite memory of the show and the band was when I met a bunch of friends who are NBB haters and had a big fire. We took a CD of their songs and the DVD of the movie and some pictures of the band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy jig around the burning stuff while singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead". That was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid of a capitol god that shit that show. I hate it so much. Get rid of the fucking car. You are really shitty! You really ruined the whole channel! No offense or anything, but you need a life, I mean, who does a stupid show with a stupid lead singer who can not even sing! You guys really sound awful and have a life as hobos or something, except Roselina. She is really pretty. But still, you guys!
