This film was written by the excellent McGovern and directed by Frears. This movie was a slight disappointment. It seemed too short. She has spent far too long creating the atmosphere of the Hovis and laughing at the Catholic demands. Then very quickly the fascists and socialists fought for the attention of the family and the terrible conclusion.
