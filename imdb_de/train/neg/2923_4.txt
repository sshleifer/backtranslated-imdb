The plot was quite interesting against the background of the Russian revolution. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest, as the film was partly filmed there. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry between the two main characters, so it was hard to believe the love story between them. The love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirckland was really stiff and almost icy. Rob Stewart was pretty charming and boyish, so she looked more like his older sister than his girlfriend. The end, when we finally found out who was after them, was pretty weak and made no sense at all. I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot better if the relationship between the two actors was a bit more credible.
