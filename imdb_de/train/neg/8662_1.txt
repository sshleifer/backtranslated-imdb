What a horrible movie. I love monster flicks, but I could not even see half of the horrible drama, cardboard, and abysmal special effects. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. The characters either come from an endless supply of suicidal dumb cannon fodder or they are empty and boring sock puppets. The plot is formulaic, cut and paste, standard science-run amok-drivel. Even the CGI is terrible. You know it's bad if you can not even rely on the movie to be a feast for the eyes. No surprises here, just as old as it is old. This is really one of the worst movies ever made. Director Roger Corman was supposed to be hung from a pole to allow children to use him as a pinata.
