I heard about this movie and I knew that it was not really good. But I started watching the movie (in my movie channel) and was interested. This could be a really great, dark black satire related to today's media morality. The small feathers were good at every competition. It builds on something I do not want to miss. But when the so-called show starts, everything becomes implausible, cheap and pretty stupid. Here, the author should have added something that makes people think. But instead it's wrapped up and assumed people are so stupid. <br /> <br /> The end is so bad that I give him a 1.
