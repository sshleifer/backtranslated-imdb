I saw this trailer and thought, God, this movie is real, who would want to watch this movie and at the same time I thought my girlfriend turned to me and said, "We have to see this movie". I said, I saw this for about 5 minutes and tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap fear, but there was not even that. It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The director has no influence. No perspective. The same settings were used again and again. Again he has not built up tension. The cast was probably just said that the scream was just screaming loudly. I would love to see the script because the first 40 minutes were mostly annoying, girlish giggling and bad music. There was absolutely no character development. Basically, I know we're going to terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a serial killer of the stalker. This is genius! hmmm Acting was what you hopelessly expect in an Australian soap opera, this main character of the Blondie god, who upset her. Her longest line must have been half a sentence, and each time she was in front of the camera, she just pulled another rude face. <br /> <br /> Please listen to me if you have a taste in movies If you like this and you do not have a good choice, I wish you good luck and smuggled into an iPod or a magazine. I can not believe this movie was made!
