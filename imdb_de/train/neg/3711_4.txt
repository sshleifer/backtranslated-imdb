I had not seen the movie trailer when I saw the movie, instead I relied on the opinion of a friend. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie falls flat in the face. <br /> <br /> During the film, Rock delivers some funny jokes, but unfortunately the movie lacks comedy. The film seems to integrate both laughter and love in one, and this effort fails. The love story in the movie is (fortunately) straightforward, but it affects the movie too much by making rock serious and bland. After all, the film is primarily intended to be a comedy, with laughter as its main concern. Not much of it in the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty uninteresting overall. Some parts were discontinuous overall. If the side occupation is fun, they certainly did not do a good job. The few angels from the sky tried to make some jokes that were dry and boring. The first subordinates of the first incarnation of Rock were also bland. However, if there's one thing they've done right, they make the rock funnier by comparison.
