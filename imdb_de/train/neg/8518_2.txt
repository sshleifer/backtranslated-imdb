I'm amazed at how many comments on this show are about how "real" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe because if Veronica Mars is anything, it's over the top in a big way. <br /> <br /> The acting chews with enthusiasm at the scenery and the actions have holes that one could drive a truck through. I do not really call that. <br /> <br /> It is so serious in his desire to be "relevant" that it only shows how cut-and-dried the reality is of Rob Thomas and his staff. Overall I found it a slumber party at worst and more than a little annoying at worst. Kristen Bell looks like she could be a good actress, but it's hard to say what the show's style is all about.
