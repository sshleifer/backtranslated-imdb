I was very surprised how bad this movie was. Nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only bring the film so far. I was hoping for a repeat of Hero, but that's much, much worse. <br /> <br /> This film is the reason why kung fu movies had a bad reputation at all. No believable characters (even in the animated world of kung fu movies, these characters are ridiculous), virtually no plot and ridiculous story turns. <br /> <br /> This movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you I'm trying to make a play with a kid. Every time you think your stupid battle makes sense, they make another ridiculous turn that makes no sense ("Ah ha, you just think you've got me with your superpowers and 10,000 beam cannons, but I have mine Vitamins eaten with plutonium. "And Teflon, so your blasting guns do not work and I'm invulnerable to your superpowers .... Tap, do not trade infinitely infinite.") Children can continue with this madness because they do not care is, if they really do it Everyone listens because it's fun, but for the VIEWER, especially for the adult audience, this long movie is worse than a fight with bad gas. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD Note for kung fu filmmakers (a) if you have a knife in your hand It hurts when you are not on PCP In this case, your kung fu is not strong (b) If you repeatedly hit the Fall back and a knife in it, it will hurt more and do more harm unless it's a fake prop, (c) when you stab yourself in the heart with a knife, you die, especially in old porcelain where there are no emperors Permanent around the corner there, (d) kung fu fights do not last for hours 3 feet of snow fall, and (e) sometimes it's worth explaining your characters and their motivations. <br /> <br /> Look at Hero again, because at least in his own little world, it's understandable.
