I saw this movie yesterday and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkward incredible script for five hours (or how long it actually was). From the beginning every element of this movie is incredible. This movie has made me giggle several times, but it was above all a shock that the director / writer actually expected us to put together the many chaotically scattered elements that were trying to make this film, Gray (Graham) and her problems with intimacy , Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have too much in common unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Interesting, fascinating. But instead of deconstructing this story into something credible and tasty, director Gray takes up these ridiculous phrases, which make no sense at all. As an LGBT individual, this film seemed to reflect what all heterosexuals think about what we are going through in the coming-out process. (I'll be offended if the writer is weird.) If the cute chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (who, by the way, was understandably compelled to do so) would not have been, I'd rate them three stars.
