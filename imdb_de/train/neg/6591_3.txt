That's the sound of Stan and Ollie turning in their graves. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to list the basic flaws of this movie because they are so obvious that they are self-evident. Small things like The All New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy, though the stars have been dead for over 30 years. Little things like that. <br /> <br /> A bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons that happen to be called Laurel and Hardy. As bad as that may be, it could have worked. If you have a really bad idea, try to cast two cast members to spend the duo. Okay, they may claim to be nephews, but the end result is the same. Bronson Pinchot can be funny. Okay, forget his crazy alien "Cousin Larry" in Perfect Strangers and look at him in True Romance. Here he stinks. It's probably not all his fault, and like the director and the support - all who are better than the material - he was probably just desperate for money. There are those who claim that Americans have difficulty controlling an effective English accent. This cause is not helped by Pinchot here. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Only in Stanens hallmark he comes closer, although the Yelp is exaggerated to boredom, about which you can write anything. Gailard Sartain is a little better than Ollie, even though it's like saying what's worse - kicking a dog or kicking the neck maker? <br /> <br /> Remember the seconds-seconds originals, intuitive teamwork and innate amiability? Well, that does not exist at all, replaced by two stupid old men and jokes that were so wrong that you could park a bus through the gaps. While the originals had plots of land that could be summed up in a few panels, here's a lengthy mummy hokum (and what a lousy title!) Blending in with the fraternity scenario of the boys. I can not claim to have seen every single one of Laurel and Hardy's 108 films, but I think it's a safe bet that even Nadir leagues were ahead of her. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the main problem is that the originals somehow played themselves or at least with their own accents. It felt at least natural and informal, unlike the fictional cartoons Pinchot and Sartain. And since when has Stan made malapropisms and so many? "I wanted to give you a standing cremation"; "I would like to marinate my friend." Stop it! <br /> <br /> Only one noteworthy moment is an indication of Bozo the Clown, the cartoon character who shared Larry Harmon's L & H comic. Of course, Harmon got the name of the copyrights (how confusing to see a Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and producer of this travesty. <br /> <br /> Questions abound. Would Stan and Ollie make strangers if they were still alive today? Would you glass mummies with broken bottles? Did Stan hit his genitals with a spear and end up with a big CGI finale? We do not hope. <br /> <br /> I once laughed, but I think that was just unbelieving how horrible everything is. Why was this movie ever made? Who did the makers think? Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen, an absolute disgust that I was sick of after the first five minutes. About as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a hot poker and burning stinging nettles are shoved violently in the back.
