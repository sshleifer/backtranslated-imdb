This is one of the worst movies ever. I like cheesy movies, but that's awful. Where are the pictures in the movie that are on the box? I think more money was spent on the DVD box illustrations than on the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Why does a company release a DVD whose cover is so misleading? I feel like an idiot because I rented this movie exclusively on the box. While I was working on IMDb, I would have had to do some research and make a list before going to my local video store. I can not blame anyone except me. I want my money and my time back. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Curiosity is what motivates you, but instead you can look at cocktail umbrellas instead. It will be much more fun. You were warned!
