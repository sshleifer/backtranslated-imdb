I absolutely loved the script in this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this movie from me, rated 1 in 10, was Lacy Chabert's performance, which I thought played the different characters very well. For me she was definitely the highlight of this movie. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was pretty as always, but I found her role rather boring, so you can not say that her acting was great. <Br /> <br /> As for the male lead, Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me primarily of physicians in 1980s cheese series. <br /> <br /> Everything I could have lived with. But the terrible, terrible, terrible end / solution, the role of the Psychic and even the role of the Psychic were just a few of the worst writings I've seen in a long time.
