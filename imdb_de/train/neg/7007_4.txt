That's a pretty bad movie. The plot is sentimental mush. I'm assuming the production values ​​are okay, decent photography, unobtrusive alignment, and all that. Mark Hamill was terrible. I have never cared much about him, and this film confirms this perception. No wonder he has never made a career apart from his Star Wars films. I just say "Buh-Bye, Mark," as he sinks into the deserved darkness. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts has completely stolen the show. She showed charm, beauty and acting in one performance. I remember seeing her recently in Texasville and noticing her beauty. It's interesting to see her ten years ago. Anyway, if you're not interested in Miss Potts, run away from this movie and scream for the hills.
