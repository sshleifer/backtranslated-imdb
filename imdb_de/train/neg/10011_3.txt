This film is about a male escort involved in a murder investigation that took place in the circle of powerful male women. <br /> <br /> I thought "The Walker" would be exciting and captivating, but I was wrong. The pace is painful and painfully slow, that even after 40 minutes, nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour could be shortened to ten minutes. It's slow. <br /> <br /> The absence of thrills or action scenes makes boredom worse. It is almost shocking that even reasoning scenes are so simple and without emotion. Maybe it's the stiff upper lip of the higher social class? <br /> <br /> It is sad that "The Walker" becomes such a boring mess despite such a strong cast. The fault is the bad action and even worse pace.
