I expected a comedy like the "Big Mama" movies. Instead, the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and love story. <br /> <br /> There are three actions in this film: the first involves Madea and her taking care of a foster child. The second concerns a woman who is betrothed to a rich man who abuses her. The third concerns a relationship between a single mother with two children and a single father. <br /> <br /> There is really little comedy in the movie. There are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. For example, Madea slaps the foster child with a belt (in a comedic way) to convince the child to align. The child is actually turning. It seems worthwhile to beat children. <br /> <br /> There are plans for rape of children (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with old men meeting young girls who are related to them. (The Ogling takes place at a family reunion.) The movie jumps from Plot to Plot, so you always get out of whack. Is this a comedy, a love story or a drama? It's really nothing ... except wasting time and money.
