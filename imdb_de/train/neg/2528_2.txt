The Van is a feel-good movie about a man trying to lure girls into his new van to seduce them. The only thing that does not fail this film is the precise representation of Van Fad in the US in the late 70s. It looks like it was completely made by amateurs. It's garbage, but I loved it! I have to admit that I'm a fan of 70s garbage! Hope the IMDB Bottom 100 does it! <br /> <br /> 2
