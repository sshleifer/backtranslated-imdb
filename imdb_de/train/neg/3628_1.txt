The dream of a kind house maven. Overrated, overrated, exaggerated; An arrogant blend that not only earned the Best Picture of 1951, but was dwarfed by the competition from the start. Place in the sun, detective story, tram called Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible; They call it when it came out in '51, it's better than this arthouse crapola. The final ballet is a hit for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the wrong movie. Few actors were less capable (acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron in their day. My # 12 Worst of '51 (I watched 201 movies) and is one of the 5 worst Oscar winners.
