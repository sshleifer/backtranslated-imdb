I saw that on TV recently? or rather, I switched occasionally to another channel to watch infomercials when I could not stand it any longer. It was bad. Really, really bad. Not "that bad, it's good", just bad. How was it funded? Who thought that was a good idea? A fellow actor auditioned and was told he was not good enough to play a bad guy, but I think they said "save and save you from this steamy pile of @ # $%". I bet the rest of the cast got the option. To be fair, the actors were hard to judge because of the appalling fake American ascents. The shooting was dulllllllllllllllllllll. The action was awkward and stilted. The dialogue was crazy. By far the saddest was ship. In reality, the Interislander ferry is a shabby boat, and she does not do well on film. Instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crewliner, with lamina pieces wrapped around rusty polls, I'm not joking that they could change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness. Stupid stupid stupid. Do not look at this movie, not as a joke.
