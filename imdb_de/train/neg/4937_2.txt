This is a 30 minute show about a joke. The joke, Cavemen are not treated fairly. Hahaha !!! He can not dial a phone because he is a caveman. Cavemen are not as smart as humans. Oh my god, these cavemen are so straightforward. There is no humor in this show. They can only run away this joke for so long and have already done so with the Geico commercials. This show does not deserve a window of opportunity on national TV series. <br /> <br /> This show tries hard to be funny, but it just is not. When I watched this show, I thought it was about to do a "Bachelor's Gone Wild Show". That is, they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. The crying caveman is annoying. The caveman with the glasses is too smart to be a caveman (HAHAHA !!!). All three have personalities, but I can not figure out why I'm not interested in them.
