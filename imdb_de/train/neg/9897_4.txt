I think this is a good movie to spend your time on, but not for any historical value. The depiction of Cleopatra reminded me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> The twist of the facts is ... funny! She was born while feeding her people!?!? Oh please ... A pregnant queen of Egypt (especially this one) would not care to go from one room to the other! They tried to make them saints for God's sake! And the way they justified her murdering her own sister ... indescribable. Cleopatra was the best politician of her time. Their decisions were anything but their feelings and morals. She has done everything for two reasons: strength and self-preservation! She was born into a family where she had to fight for her survival, which she did very well. Everything on their way was either murdered (their brothers and sister) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). Unfortunately, Octavian was too powerful to kill, and too ... gay to be seduced. So he was her end ...
