Of the ten actors who represented Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed the most personal, but in this script, the audience is far ahead of the famous detective. When the jockey, Douglas Walton, stares hypnotically into space and observes something like "I have to ride and be killed," I thought it was stupid that no one took it after being killed. The police considered it suicide because he said he would do it! After the hated horse owner Gene Lockhart was shot and killed, Frieda Inescort does the same, says she will go out to be killed, and then fatally jumps out of a bus. I laughed when Lowe finally shouts, "I have it," as if it were a revelation. However, the guilty party was cleverly hidden and there was considerable pressure as it began to hypnotize Lowe so he could jump off the roof.
