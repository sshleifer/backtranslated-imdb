This movie had the potential to be far more than it was. Not only does it not only accomplish achievements, it also produces vicious, self-righteous sermons. John Cusack is even flatter than Midnight of the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time he should have a southern accent, which he loses noticeably several times several times. Al Pacino does his job, but seems to be running through this movie and collecting a paycheck. He is good as always, but hardly outstanding. <br /> <br /> Supportive Cast - cast romantic interest for women, adding little or nothing to the story. Speaking of history, a convoluted story that "really cares", where Cusack is the self-righteous mayor boy who just has to look for "the right one" to get done this way. Cusack's character in the end loses all credibility from which he preaches and is evil without revealing it. The last scene makes the penultimate stupidity seem profound. It is also completely inaccurate, but I will not abide by the law. <br /> <br /> This is a bad result, according to number film. It seems interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a preacher, proselytizing, self-righteous movie for the last hour. It is better with thoughtless crap than this garbage heap.
