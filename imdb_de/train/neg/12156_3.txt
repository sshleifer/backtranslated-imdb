Jesus Christ, I can not believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I just watched because I'm so in love with Jordan Ladd. But watching this movie almost took me off her. That is absolutely terrible! I could have watched the Survivor Series 93. <br /> <br /> The main actor in this area was so bland and generic. I would love it if the big Mistuharu Misawa Tiger had driven his ass through a glass window. I was in awe every time he said "sea" and "hut". I would kick him in the ass. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. A true angel. But she could not even save that joke of a movie. Unfortunately, she could not even pretend she was off her nut when she took this truth drug. It looked weird. <br /> <br /> I also loved the piece where Jordan accidentally poured yoghurt over her. It reminded me of a time when ... is not true. <br /> <br /> Anayways, watch this movie because it's awful.
