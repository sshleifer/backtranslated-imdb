Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen. I was ready to go after the first ten minutes. The only people laughing in the theater were the Tweeners. Do not get me wrong, I love stupid, stupid movies just like the next girl, but the premise, the writing and the humor stunk. It seemed to me that they felt like "Napoleon Dynamite" - strange and random scenes that would lead to a cult audience. Instead, it was forced, awkward and weird. <br /> <br /> The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I felt so terrible that she (and Sissy Spacek) had signed up for this awful thing /> <br /> Thanks for not paying for it ,
