Terrible movie. If there is a Turkish movie that you should avoid in 2006, then this should be Banyo. What a waste of time. Apart from a few cheap laughs, this movie does not get anything, nada, zilch, nil. The dialogue is cheap, and sexual stereotypes are omnipresent. The director has to watch more movies before trying to direct his own. The red-haired woman shows examples of what an actress should not do. If you are interested in learning how not to act, this is a perfect example of bad behavior. The only good thing I can say about the movie is, wait, wait, there's nothing good I can say about it. I really did not like to write so much about it. My goodness!
