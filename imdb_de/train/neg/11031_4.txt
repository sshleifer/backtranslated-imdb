It is interesting to see what the director has tried with this film. But the problem is that it is not very good. There was nothing really original in the movie, and while the plot was well presented, the main characters were all a bit too shallow and you did not bother with any of them bad photo leaves something to be desired, but I think you can not expect too much from people who just make a low budget movie. It's unfair to review the movie and compare it to other high budget movies. But unfortunately you have to do that too. By itself it is not very good. And it's still not very good compared to others. But it is not without good points! I liked the story. It was pretty well built and well connected in the end. In the really dark scenes sometimes it was possible to build up a scary feeling. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film can not impress. The characters are virtually nonexistent and we are not interested in any of them. Each of them could die, but it is possible to determine the definitive "survivor" at a very early stage.
