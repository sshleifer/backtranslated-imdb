If all this is what the Watchowski have to offer in terms of a backstory to the Matrix, then I really have to question the claims of all fans who believe that the films should be registered at a deeper level. The second Renaissance, while visually stunning and beautiful, is clich√©d and ridiculous. How many times have we heard the story of people who rely too much on technology, people who are too eager to go to war, people who are basically destroying themselves? Here is nothing new. And I have another question. In view of the conspiracy of the second renaissance, the machines are not the good ones! The machines have been suppressed for generations by their cruel human superman. They defend themselves, gain their freedom, and strive for a peaceful, harmonious coexistence with the people who reject them in favor of a comprehensive war, which of course the wiser machines win. If this is the backstory, we should not look for Neo, but for the machines! The people were cruel and oppressive while the machines were brave and compassionate. Since I do not believe that the Watchowski would prefer the machines to humans, I have to assume that the second renaissance was simply a misguided attempt to create a backstory.
