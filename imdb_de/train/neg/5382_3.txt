Definitely the product of a young spirit, this piece can appeal to the 1920s who are still trying to find their place in the world while obsessing on every neurosis. However, I can not imagine that the large amount of narcissistic umbilical hernia, trivial theme or trivial content would be particularly interesting for anyone over 30. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, for whom the filmmakers evidently only contempt, are hyped into comic effects to such absurd cartoons that they are in no way really related. <br /> <br /> However, one must give the filmmakers, who are obviously grown up in the video generation, some stylistic points and apply every imaginable editing trick in the book to speed up an otherwise nonexistent plot. There are two points to keep in mind here. Beware of Festival favorites first. Second, even though we live in the age of Youtube, not every account of his earthly life deserves treatment on the big screen. But these young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if other 20-year-olds find something to identify with, it's all the better. Still, I could not help but think at the end of this movie, how this youngest generation, just growing up, will face so many challenges and complications in the real world. In an age in which every child is always convinced how special it is and that it deserves reward every 15 minutes, resilience and the ability to cope with adversity are not exactly the strength of this generation.
