I saw that this movie did not know anything about it before. The plot was terrible, missing large information gaps. The film did not have the "fight of jokes" for me. The actors just spat out a lot of nonsense and sometimes forced me to grind my teeth in pain as they kept grunting. The plot was predictable, except for the stomach-arousing homoerotic scene at the end (I'm not homophobic but physically sick in the stomach), even the end was predictable. And you could see that Detective Jude Law was in a costume. Everything from fake accents, horrible dental work, facial hair in the costume shop. The whole movie just felt like a wasted time of my life. This movie had the feel of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as puppets and the house as a window to watch the show, in my opinion really down to earth.
