Wow, what a disappointment! The fact that people think this film is scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct rip-off of "The Ring". The history? Was there one? Not in my opinion ... just a few eye-catching shots. The whole movie was a boring, stupid mess. I think there is always a market for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. This is the worst horror movie I've seen in years. And that Buffy chick? Well, she is a bad actress! As vivid as Barbie and just as talented ... No, wait, that would be an insult to the talents of Barbie! I suppose many kids helped this movie at the box office because it was PG-13. Had he rated R, he would have bombed IMO! Silly movie!
