The only reason I comment is because I finally found out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably did it all at the same time this week, Dr. Cox bald, because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed. The latest episode when our dearest grumpy, Jesus-loving sister Roberts dies. Dr. Cox shaves his head. They have for some reason unbalanced them and forgotten that they have lost continuity. For the shame, scrubs. You have already made mistakes earlier. I remember when Elliot tries to go out with Scott Foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show has to improve it.
