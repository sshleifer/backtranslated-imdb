"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" (an amazingly unusual title) is just a bad movie; It has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing special. Yes, the CGI backgrounds look interesting, but the result is that it's taken up with an annoying blur. In addition, the film uses music in the same way as "Gilligan's Island" or the Scooby-Doo cartoons - IT NEVER HITS UP. Terrible, just awful. There are also no fresh ideas, just gobs and gobs and gobs and ... etc., which come from older films and series. There is no gatekeeper here, the movie just seems to exist because he can. Save your money and your time. Not entertaining at all.
