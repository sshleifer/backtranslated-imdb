Too bad that neither the animals nor Eddie Murphy had anything to say it worth. This movie is just boring. <br /> <br /> Kids movie? If you're trying to take a nap, then maybe. It's just 90 minutes some eyelid-chewing animal-lip animation that's not funny. And the lip-sync makes the old Godzilla movies look brilliant in comparison. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy threatens with a suppressed, unobtrusive delivery that is painful to experience. He seems to be trying to change his old mania, but to what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original version of 1967 are lost in this transformation, or whatever it is. A city wants to harass some forest creatures and accuse them of doing bad things. Not really. And Pluto Nash can psycho-babble with them. Things are chained with a few boring jokes to a boring, uninspired conclusion with no surprises. <br /> <br /> Rent the movie '67. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons.
