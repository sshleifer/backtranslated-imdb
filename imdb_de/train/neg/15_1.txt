That's it. That's one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Retire the trophy and give them to these people ... there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Even three days after I've seen this (for some reason I still do not know why), I can not believe how terribly awful this movie is. It is so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story, or something that was ever to be created and brought into our existence. That brought me to the question of whether people really are lying on the earth or not doing good. I felt disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This kind of movie truly harms us as a society. We should be ashamed. I can not really stress that our global responsibility as human beings living here and creating art is to prevent the emergence of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It's an embarrassment. I do not know how on Earth none of these actors, writers or the director of this movie sleeps at night, knowing that he played a role in "Loaded". I do not know what kind of disgusting monsters love to watch this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> When I say I love a good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad". <br /> <br /> But this ....... this transcends the border of "bad" to a whole new dimension. That is embarrassing. This is the bad thing, where you know everything that will happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence, BEFORE they happen; and not just like a second or two, I mean after looking at the first five minutes before. <br /> <br /> Every cheesy "effect" is used shamelessly and over and over again to a disgusting point. I really never want to see the effect of the "shaky" camera "drug kicks" or "crack cuts" or "cut deviations" or "ANY AMAZING CUT". This is meticulously boring, repetitive and torments only the audience. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be very specific here. The most disconcerting thing about this film is that, given the production, the production seems to make a pretty decent amount of money actually put into these excrements. Personally, I grab the shoulders of the director if I ever see him and shake him up in submission. He demands that he run home and swallow two liters of Drain-O, or I will do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever need a new form of inhumane torture for our POWs abroad, show them this movie over and over again in a padded cell. Believe me, I think they will become more extravagant with the suicidal process after the 72nd time you're doing it all. <br /> <br /> Stop these films, they are just the meanest of all facets of our society. You're welcome. Stop. NOW.
