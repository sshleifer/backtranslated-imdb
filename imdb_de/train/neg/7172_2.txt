A good cast and they do their best what is given to them, but the story makes no sense, the characters' actions are inexplicable, and there are too many moments of unintentional humor, as if a man were killed by being pierced with pieces of a record or if they got the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her with a bottle over her head, and she grabs her hostage and pouts. The scene in which the two witches and their victims (played by the same actress) are together in the house, is like a 3-Stooges routine together, and the action raises the question: If the witch own the soul of this other woman want, why not? Does she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate pursuit? Not to be missed is the glasses of Christopher Walkin and his autonomous explanation of the afterlife (paraphrased): "The ancient Egyptians - they are little materialists - they expected the body to last forever, like a used car you raised. They knew you could not drive in the hereafter, they had to get out and walk. "Huh The end is totally incomprehensible. Seems like they just do not have a movie anymore.
