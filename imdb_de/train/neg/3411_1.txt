Mix exotic tropical locations, tightly packed babes, explosions, good-looking Dudley Do-Right clones, a top-rated movie star (Martin Sheen), a little martial arts, and a sexy lust (Tracy Lor .... I'm sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH Lords) and you would think you were looking forward to a fleeting fun. Not so! This is a dreary television movie, and though he likes to be a Charlie's Angels offer, he is nowhere near as good as the original series, or even the gawdawful, irretrievably stupid, final C. movies. This abomination is best described as the Andy Sidaris movie with THIRD RATE. Nowhere as fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket To Hawaii", though some of the fight scenes are decent. The girls spend too much time posing and trying to look snappy and it gets annoying after a while. There are better genre things out there that are. Oh yes, and the "babes" are not as hot as they think they are. Terrible soundtrack ... if it's there.
