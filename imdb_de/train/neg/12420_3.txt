It just is not enough here. There are a few funny spots, but not really enough. I was very disappointed because I love silly movies. I expected this to be a hidden gem. IT WAS NOT. It was a secret crap. I looked at it all the time. I thought, "Gosh, I could do better and I'm an idiot." Do not believe the few good reviews. I was sucked in by them. At no time did I laugh out loud. Maybe that was funny or innovative in 1987, but today it fell flat. This movie had promises, it just did not bring it. Maybe if they rewrote it a few more times. I can not fault the actors. They were not the best, but they just did not have much to work with. This movie failed because of worn out writing. Very disappointed.
