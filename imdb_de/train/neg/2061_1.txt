The only movie I have ever seen. Amazing, because I paid for myself and my date and really cheap. But my mind could not stand the dirt, especially because I could have written more pleasurable material while I tied it up and gagged it. Worse, it's not funny. It was not funny at the time and it's really not funny now. Worse still, this film marks the beginning of the end of a truly intelligent, sophisticated comedy. It is a youthful, truly sophomoric screenplay, and ideas began an era (to date) in which cheap laughter and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in the film. Which gymnasium did not think of it? The beginning of the end.
