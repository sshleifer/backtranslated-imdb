Review: Full moon. A creature, a giant werewolf, is hunting. Not for meat, not for blood (not that you do not mind taking a bite on the way), but for a partner. He is hunting for a girl. No girl. The girl. The girl who is pure (and also a werewolf, though she does not know it yet). Three, check well, two cops (after the first scene) and an old bag lady are all they can stop, or they even know that the thing that kills and eats many people around full moon is a werewolf. This particularly powerful werewolf, Darkwolf, approaches the girl. When he gets it, humanity is doomed to fail. Now the cops have to find the girl, convince her that there is not just someone, a werewolf who wants to rape her and maybe kill her, but that she's a werewolf herself. And then they had to stop him ... <br /> <br /> Comments: This is one for the boys, the teenagers. Many scenes with half-naked girls, more or less important for the plot. Mostly less. Well, I guess you need some time, because the plot (as expected) is thin. And unfortunately, there is little next to the girls, which contributes to the action breaks. Normally one addresses two main topics. Nudity. Check. And then special effects. Hmm ... Well, there are some things that could be called effects. But they are not special. To be honest, they are very bad. The film seems to be suffering from a lack of funds. They could not afford clothes for some girls;) and the effects are cheap. Some of the conversions between werewolf and human form obviously carried out by the computer are really bad. You could overlook such things. But the Darkwolf itself is also very rude and you can never see killings. Only a few mutilated corpses afterwards. And in a movie that should be honestly soaked in blood, amazingly little blood is. <br /> <br /> I do not know what to say about actors and characters. Mostly they do it well, but unfortunately there are gaps when the characters (or actors) just lose it. Some of these gaps may be related to the above issues. Like the bad effects or the bad budget (?). That might explain why little is shot, even though the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in sight (and does not move). But hey, if you're in real danger, there's nothing that could save your life like a good one-liners ... Unfortunately, that can not explain moments when the cop, Steve, is the only one who knows how he might Cope with the problem, the werewolf who runs away, if he can only be sure, is that the werewolf is coming for the girl who is right next to him, and that he can not let her have it But sure, it lets the doers stretch the end a bit more ... <br /> <br /> But I would not mind seeing none of the lead actors / actresses get another try in another movie. <br /> <br /> Well. To draw a small conclusion: No film that I recommend. <br /> <br /> 3/10
