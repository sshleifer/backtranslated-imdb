First, Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two great comics that became saps for a brave child. They have both sold in this, worse than the character of Pryor. Second, the awful, overly sentimental script that could have been used in a film by Harold Lloyd is so clich√©d. Three: Choosing a black actor as a toy; The racial subtext is unbearable because it has never been addressed. There's no news here, Pryor's role could have been played by a weird actor. Four: That kid ... I wish I could go back in time and prevent him from ever playing. That would mean that films like this and Kid Co. would not have been made ... and my childhood would have been free of their mind-distorting power. So, if you want to see some great comics littering in a morbidly cute kiddie movie, just keep going. If you want to see them in something good, look at Pryor's old standup act and Gleason in something better, like the honeymooners.
