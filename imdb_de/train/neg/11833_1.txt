So do not think about renting it in the shops, because that's a damn bad movie. You might think that JJ Abrahams wrote this movie. Basically, a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get out again. Fans of the terrible "Shrek" may enjoy it, but "Wallace & Gromit" fans are likely to turn in disgust. Why did not they do it with plasticine or clay? I mean, CGI animation? For an AARDMAN movie? !! Obviously, Aardman lolled around while they let Dreamworks do the whole thing. Wrong, Wrong, WRONG !!! Almost every character is terrible, except for that crazy frog guy who's just right for a movie villain. But everything else about this movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep from boredom when I saw this movie. No, wait, actually I fell asleep with boredom falling asleep this movie. It's just awful. But luckily it's not as bad as "Shrek".
