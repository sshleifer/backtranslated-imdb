The Leap Years is a star of the local and regional film and television scene. And yet they can not save this movie. There are so many things going against it - about acting, overly melodramatic, bad writing, uneven direction; and too few things that speak for it - good music, good cinematography. This comment is meant for anyone who puts all local films in a basket after watching this movie and says that all local movies are bad. Please do not judge the rest by this one movie. This is a TV soap opera disguised as a romantic feature film. I had high hopes when I bought my ticket, and my hope was thrown into the movie for five minutes.
