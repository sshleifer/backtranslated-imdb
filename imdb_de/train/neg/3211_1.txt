And it falls straight into the category "awesomely bad" - ie a drunk film student would rent for a kick. I was at the sci-fi film festival and all that I remember is a wave of hysterical laughter after the premiere of this movie. Other reviews describe the fecal nature of the film better, and I felt so bad that the poor guy from the production company appeared, apparently to gauge the audience's reaction. What he got was the sci-fi equivalent of a drunken student audience, and after a "serious" anime movie it was "sky blue," the audience was in a bleak mood, and then this movie opened and within seconds, everyone was The room rolled on the islands. I will point out the worst parts. <br /> <br /> Script: The funniest and worst part of this movie winds its way on a linear and predictable street along with occasionally thoughtless thoughts. Nonsense, but extremely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Animation: Poorly made and put together, if you can accept murky backgrounds and gradually scantier costumes for the heroine (I know, I can!), then watch out for the montage, in which she's from a Swedish Peasant girl in LADY DEATH is "transformed". <br /> <br /> Characters: So one dimensional it's painful, there's a short backstory (with side dividing lines) and the real motivation behind some of the main characters is little lighted up. <br /> <br /> So if you have a captive audience and some drinks lying around (try to make sure they're alcoholic to relieve the pain), put this movie on the DVD and let it go engage in a mindset of "Mystery Science Theater 3000". There's no other motivation to watch this movie than to laugh about it, and it's not a comedy. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE ALONE. It can be even more boring to watch solo with Colin Farrell as "New World," since you can not laugh at one or the other friend over ridiculousness.
