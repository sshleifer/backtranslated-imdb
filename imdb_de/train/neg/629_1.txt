I really want to give this movie a 10 ... I really do. Some movies, especially horror movies, are so cheap that they are good. A wise-cracking ninja scarecrow that can use corn on the cob as lethal weapons ... definitely fits this "budget to brilliance" system. The depth of the film is definitely its strength, and the twists and turns it implements keep the audience on the edge of the seats, driving the eerie ... Ninja ... puberty ... in front of the thirty-year-old student ... Cowboy Drawing ... Clever Cracking ... Scarecrow as the scariest horror icon of the year. All I can really say is "Can you dig it out?" And recommend watching movies like Frankenfish if you enjoy this kind of hilarious horror.
