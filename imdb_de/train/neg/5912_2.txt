After enjoying Mike Myer's previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live), my expectations of parodying the 60s bonds were quite high. After the first minute, it became clear that this was an exercise that was supposed to be as puerile and inglorious as possible. After ten minutes, I was gone. I saw it a second time the other day to see if I had been unfair for the first time. I turned it off after ten minutes. I can hardly believe that even a twelve-year-old boy could find it funny. The dialogue is an irritation, Myers is painful to watch (like Heather Graham), and the succession of characters, including Fat Bastard, makes things even worse. In addition to the mild amusing title and the psychedelic stage design, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Personally, I recommend avoiding it like the plague, although some of my friends enjoyed it (maybe they were blindfolded at the time)
