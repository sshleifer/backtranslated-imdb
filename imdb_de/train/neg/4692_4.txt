When I saw this movie for the first time, it was called TERROR ON A TRAIN and was the back half of a double feature. Glenn Ford, an armor expert, is said to defuse a hidden bomb in an explosive-laden train. The tension is slow and steady; and this black-and-white movie only runs for about an hour and twelve minutes. All those years later on TV; The tension and the drama have lost most of their effects. This is still a good movie as the standards of the early 50s are not neglected. <br /> <br /> Together with Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The villain / saboteur is played by Victor Maddern.
