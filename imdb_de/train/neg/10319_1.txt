Unlike many, I do not find the premise or theme of this show the least offensive. Their execution, however, is a completely different matter. As with many B-minus movies all decent gags seem to have been integrated into the trailer. For most of the 22 minutes we sit in diminishing expectation for every bite of genuine humor. Or at least something to prevent it around moves with the remote control or carpet fibers counts. With a few exceptions, the spectacle is terrible; the comic over-emoting and gesturing some actors may be suitable for a late-night infomercial, but not for a primetime sitcom (even for a Canadian). Despite the admittedly original cultural aspect, I can not help but think that this is mainly a misfire by the CBC in order to repeat the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they have completely misunderstood the sound - and the script - for the prairie. The final insult is that they apparently could not afford to let do the site work in a real small town (Why? Are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?). As a proud Canadian, I hope that this matter will soon be gone and the rest of the world, strengthened by the publicists of the CBC, quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.
