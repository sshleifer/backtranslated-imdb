For film fans who have never heard of the book (Shirley Jackson's "The Haunting of Hill House") and have never seen the 1963 Robert Wise production with Julie Harris, this remake will be damned bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us who have done this, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> Bad Spectacle (what was Neeson thinking of?), Dumb Computer Extensions, and another departure from Jackson's story that brought this remake to a halt. > <br /> Do yourself a favor and borrow the original movie. It is still effectively scary without hokey special effects. Acting is professional and credible. For the readers of the book that follows from the year 1963 it comes much closer.
