Strangely enough, the sixth season of the Columbo series included only three episodes, and in at least two of the screenplays, there is very little evidence of quality based on this excursion for "man-in-the-mac" and also "Fade in Murder" , <br/> <br /> Moreover, it is no coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman wrote both of these writings (by the way, he plays the role of the murdered watchman here). <br /> <br /> This adventure is rarely compelling and many of the performers simply look uninterested in the material. The story is rather poorly developed with some tedious, boring conversations. Columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here (similar to "Last Salute to the Commodore"), but the entertainment value is minimal. In addition, Celestes Holm characterization, which should provide comedy, triggers embarrassment rather than laughter. <br /> <br /> The script wavers to deal with the family history, and the killer does Columbo enough to give the case, though there is never any credible discussion about the motives of her crime. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Columbo's worst adventure creates the funniest moment in the series. He asks a male hairdresser and has a haircut / manicure at the same time. The next 5 minutes are hilarious - Columbo's hair is just perfectly groomed, so he can not afford to pay the bill, and when inquired of a jeweler he keeps looking in the mirror to admire his hairstyle! /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only decent moment of a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Only for Columbo completeists.
