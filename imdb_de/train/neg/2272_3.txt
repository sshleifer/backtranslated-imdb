I'm not a regular viewer of Springer, but I watch his show at a glance and I think the show is a guilty pleasure and a great way to kill some time. Of course I will see this movie with the expectation of seeing "Jerry Springer Uncensored". Above all, Jerry appears in about twenty minutes of filming time. The other hour and twenty minutes are spent building this pseudo-farce about trailer trash, jealousy, incest, and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a trailer trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather (a very unusual-looking, smoking and drunk Michael Dudikoff, who eventually deviates from his action heroic personality). The mother learns of the affair, they get into a fight, they want to bring him to the "Jerry" show (right, no jumper). And then we have a parallel story with an African American couple. They bring it to the "Jerry" show. The characters collide. Blah, blah, damn blah! Trash cans were rarely so BORRRINGG !!!! I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans, but none of them watched his movie. Well, now it is completely obvious !! Whether you love or hate him, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total confusion of a movie (if you call it that). It's so poorly edited, with scenes that simply can not connect, and after a while, the plot virtually disappears and it's just everywhere on the map! Imagine a predictable soap opera that has been turned into a comic farce. With rarely laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive message is a hot girl-girl scene. This is as risky as it gets. Do not get me wrong, the scene is pretty risky, but if you compare the full movie to Springer's material, then this catastrophic farce seems to be extremely sanitized. <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)
