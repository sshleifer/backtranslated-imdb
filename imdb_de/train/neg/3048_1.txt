This is perhaps the scariest portrayal of Santa Claus ever attached to a medium, be it a book, a picture or a movie. Santa looks like a pervert looking down on the children, and the twisted story of bringing Merlin in to help him defeat one of Satan's servants pitch does not make things any better. At least it's ridiculous, with bad effects, even for the standards of 1959. If a child saw this movie, he would have nightmares and would never want Santa to visit him. They would be scarred for life. Imagine the child in "A Christmas Story" when they scream after being placed on Santa's lap. That's how it would turn out when kids see this movie.
