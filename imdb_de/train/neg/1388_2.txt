I wanted to see this movie hoping to see some flashlights of the Jet Li that we loved in Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately, too many of his fighting stunts are so clearly forged that it even brought this fun with it. The flying kicks would be much more impressive if you could not see the wires stopping him as he flies 4 seconds and 9 kicks through the air. <br /> <br /> Too cartoonish and very disappointing.
