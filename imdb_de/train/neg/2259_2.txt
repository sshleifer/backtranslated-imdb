For my life I can not understand why they want to make a movie about the "Jerry Springer Show". It is so unbelievably trashy. Somehow it is a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I have recently seen this in the USA. It is pretty bad. I admit that. Jerry is doing a terrible job of what I think was acting in my opinion. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is there. She basically plays herself. All she needed was her beloved kid Kid Rock. It would have been perfect then. So I would recommend skipping "Ringmaster". Just look at the "Jerry Springer Show". It is more pleasant than this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
