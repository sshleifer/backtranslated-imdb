Paul Naschy has made many horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from fairly good to unbeatable garbage; and unfortunately, horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter. The plot is just your average story of a witch, a sorcerer or (like here) a sorcerer sentenced to death - but not before you retaliate those who did it One thing leads to another, and pretty much soon the executed sorcerer is no good anymore. The plot is slow, painfully boring and the movie always feels senseless. The characters tear up tons of Diatribe and never serve the movie in any way. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me, he should stick to acting, because the dialogue is extremely banal and serves only to make the movie even more boring than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Nashy with the broken-doll's blue eyes and the devil's curse, gives a boring direction here that should not help dialogue with the film. Sometimes crap films like this one have a certain charm; but horror Rises from the Tomb does not even have that. This is a painfully boring movie that has little or nothing to interest.
