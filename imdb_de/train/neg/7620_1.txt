I rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting, but to my horror, this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen! I read the comment from Gumby-8 and it has to be part of the cast or the crew. If Gumby-8 is not a 4-year-old child or a denied cult member, no one could think that this movie has any potential. <br /> <br /> I could not believe the comments from Gumby-8. <br /> <br /> Quote: "From the Dune-inspired opening animation to the fast pace ... this movie keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeated viewing is not unexpected." <br /> <br /> The animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact that the movie keeps the eye moving, well, because you're looking for any kind of suspense. I mean, give me a break Halloween was shot with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a painted mask and became a cult classic by the way. As for "repeated viewing not unexpected", I think he made a typo. <br /> <br /> Another quote from Gumby-8 is the only fan: "Acting is also a strong aspect of the movie." /> <br /> With all respect for the actors, their performance is nothing but the talent of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> The catchy tagline: "Beware of the hour between dusk and darkness" /> <br /> That's because there's no dusk or darkness in this movie. <br /> <br /> MPAA rating "Rated R for some violence / Gore" <br /> <br /> The only horror you see is a red color on a leaf over a corpse you never see , As far as I know, it may be a tuft of grass. <br /> <br /> In summary I have seen horror movies from the 50s, 60s and 70s. I saw what I thought was the worst and some that were very good. The director of this movie either made no attempt, fell asleep or got a punch of acid. Whatever the case, in my opinion the actors deserve applause when trying to save a very bad direction order. I would give this movie a rating of 0.5 for a "B" movie.
