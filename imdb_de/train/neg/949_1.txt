I never understood the appeal of this show. Acting is bad (Debra Jo Rupp is a notable exception), the actions of most episodes are banal and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes are insatiable and it is painful to even stick to half an episode. Moreover, the connection between this show and the '70s' beyond the clothing style and scenery and background used for the show is extremely meager - it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old nonsensical cliche scripts use modern sitcoms I disguised myself to present a show from twenty years ago, in the hope that it will win some nostalgic viewers or something. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" use the same technique much more effectively and, in contrast to this horrible, pathetic apology, are actually a pleasure for a show
