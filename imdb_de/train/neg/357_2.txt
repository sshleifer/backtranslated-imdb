JUST CAUSE shows Sean Connery as a legal professional at Harvard, Kate Capshaw (is she still getting work?) As his wife (minor age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist South Policeman (!) And Ed Harris in a towering display of a fundamentalist serial killer from the South. <br /> <br /> Crazy casting, but the movie plays seriously with the audience. (Do not read if you ever really want to watch this movie seriously or seriously watch this movie because of the spoilers.) First and foremost, I've been rolling my eyes at the liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and frame this a black one Proofs. The accused's coroner, witnesses and even the attorney's attorney work against him (he is accused of rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black. Connery is a Harvard lawyer who is passionate about talking about the injustices against blacks and against the barbaric death penalty. He is approached by the convicted man's grandmother to defend him and re-open the trial. Connery is stonewalled by the town officials and the good club of the IL 'boys (yawning ...), but finds that The case against Blair, the alleged murderer who is now on death row, was all invented. The main proof was his confession, which was struck out of him. <br /> <br /> The beating was carried out by a black policeman (!) who even played Russian roulette to get the confession out of him. Connery finds out that another inmate on death row has actually committed the murder, and after a few acts with the seriously over-zealous Hannibal Lecter-like Ed Harris, he finds out where Harris hid the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> He gets a rehearsal and Blair is released. <br /> <br /> I think ... movie about .... <br /> <br /> Then suddenly! It turns out that Blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used "white guilt" to win Connery. He developed the story with Ed Harris in return for Blair, who did a few murders for Harris. Now Blair is free thanks to Connery's deceived PC principle! The last 30 min. are a strange action movie based on a legal drama. Connery and Fishburne fight against the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts (yes, that's right) in the Everglades. That was a funny movie. <br /> <br /> The whole system is so corrupt and inefficient, the cops are all just bullies and torturers of the type Abu Graib, but the criminals are really psychotic and deserve to roast. <br /> <br /> Depressing on every level! The system is completely rotten and the PC white guilt types that challenge it are also seriously deceived. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Connery obviously had to pay a mortgage or something.
