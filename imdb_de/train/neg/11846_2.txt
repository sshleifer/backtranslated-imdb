After seeing this movie, I complained at my local cinema about the quality of the soundtrack or whether the cinema sound system is flawed. At least for the first half of the film, it's extremely difficult to understand what someone is saying because of the background music of the 1920's and the scratchiness of the soundtrack. I was ready to accuse the cinema equipment, but not so - it was the director. <br /> <br /> I was told that the topic of my complaint was an integral part of the film. The music and the sound should be distorted to create a very disturbing effect in the film. These days, the directors will do their utmost to make their film unique. Regardless of where and how you watch the movie, the tone will be the same. <br /> <br /> So aside from the historical inaccuracies of this movie (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere) the soundtrack distortion is in itself a good reason to miss this movie. You only hear the distorted scratchiness of the soundtrack and certainly not the meowing of a cat.
