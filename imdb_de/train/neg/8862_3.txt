From the moment Christopher Lee puts on punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you have a stinker in your hands! This movie had potential. Underneath the mud are the remnants of what could have been made into a decent movie, if not an interesting one. The end product, however, is a real mess. Aside from superfluous nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II is a ridiculous excuse for a horror movie. Christopher Lee gives him a nugget of credibility, but even he can not take him over the trash. <br /> <br /> Having not seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will be forced to accept the face value that this is a true continuation of the events in the first part. We start with a funeral for one of the characters from the original, and within the first ten minutes we're in Transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to fight a werewolves alliance. The movie is pretty good and there are not too many dead spots. The action is there; it just was not filmed well. A bright spot is the music of a punk band called Babel. Although her song is played quite often, it's pretty catchy. <br /> <br /> The problems with this film are numerous. First of all, the spectacle is worse than pathetic. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that's the end of it. The two main roles Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe are missing from almost everything you want for such characters. The writing is miserable, the cut superfluous and the direction amateurish. There are a few nice special effects, but the cheeses weigh them down. Sybil Danning is nice to look at, but her acting is not satisfactory. Judd Omen looks like the role he plays, but his voice and acting are unconvincing. Much of the dialogue is in an incomprehensible language that may or may not be Latin. <br /> <br /> I liked the general idea for the story. I always enjoy stories of true believers who fight seemingly invincible forces of evil. A scene in which a small group of good people wander through dark forests and shoot down a number of werewolves is even exciting. Something like that. Maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the movie more convincing. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound. <br /> <br /> Side note: At the moment, youtube.com's censors have not finished yet Sybil Danning tore off her top several times while the Babel song is playing! Catch it while you can!
