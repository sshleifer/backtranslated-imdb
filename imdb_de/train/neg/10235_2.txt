The only reason I give him a 2 is that the filmography is so stylized these days that it has at least something to comment on. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazing. It's like so many other 21st century milled house food. The blood is unfounded and simply refuses. I did not care about the characters, but it was important to me that a cretin complains about this crap: I would complain about the money I spent, but my date and I left wisely after 40 minutes and went in An adjoining theater Seeing the adventurous and entertaining "Live Free or Die Hard," which probably received a much higher rating from me simply because I had to endure the total shuddering of "captivity" for 40 minutes.
