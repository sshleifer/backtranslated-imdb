This movie was one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It's a combination of police drama and comedy about two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett investigating a shootout in a hip-hop club. <br /> <br /> The plot is fictional and there are far too many side effects. Ford is pushing alongside real estate (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett runs a yoga school in which he pushes chicks in his spare time, the two are investigated by Internal Affairs, Ford unscrews the ex-girlfriend (Lena) Olin) of IA And she's a clairvoyant who's got a radio show, the man who murdered the club is a filthy ex-cop who years ago shot Hartnett's father compulsory chases and some lame attempts at humor, and that is the core of this turkey.
