Imagine the elusive annoying Goth kids from college in a movie, throw a pinch of history and a lot of horrible acting, and you're still not even close to how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> Inclusion bad, bad effects, worse action. Deliberate attempt to shock the horror. Everyone I've shown it gets kind of depressed. The sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily in content, but rather because they just want to end as soon as possible. The last sex scene is just bad, even before she reaches the guy. <br /> <br /> I'm one of the people who love watching movies that people hate, that's why I found this one. But save yourself the time and avoid this loathing. It is so bad. I literally threw it in the trash.
