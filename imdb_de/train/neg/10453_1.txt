This movie deserves more than a 1. But I give it a one, because so many crazy fan boys have given it a 10, which means it gets a rating that puts it in the top 100 list. Seriously, it's not that great, it's not that bad. It's a stupid cult classic with so many crazy fan boys that it's ridiculous. These are the guys who are still probably laughing at Chuck Norris jokes and still say, "I'm James b! Tch". No matter how old or annoying it gets. I'm afraid I have to hear "I'm tired of MFn snakes on this MFn plane" months later by idiots trying to be funny. His shitty action, crap, acting, etc. It's okay to love a bad movie, but you have to admit that it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait for the Navy with John Cena, if you want to see a real movie
