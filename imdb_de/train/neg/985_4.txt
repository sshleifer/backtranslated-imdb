'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget movie about a few Australian Post employees who are struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is bad and the connections between the misfortunes of the past and the current ways of thinking of the characters are awkward and too schematic. Most disappointing, however, is the portrayal of life in the movie title: There is no mechanization and it is impossible to determine what the workforce actually does for a living. Granted, part of the conspiracy is that the office is threatened with closure, but this type of office was surely shut down in the 1930s, if it ever really existed. It's a shame because the overall sound of the film is poignant and dry and the scenario promises something: but few details convince. Overall, it feels like the work of a person who has not experienced much in real life; a student film with a concept and an outline, but unfortunately little else.
