OK, so I'm like most people, give me free tickets and I'll see most things now that multiplex cinemas are so good (I remember the old "Flea Pit" cinema with a screen and I'm the healthy one Page of 40). In England this film was released as "Liar", a dog. It's a total waste of good celluloid. 4/10 for photography and set only.
