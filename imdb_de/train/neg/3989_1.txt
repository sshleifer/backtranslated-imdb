Who plays a lyrical song with a clear mind and at the same time portrays an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his battered wife in the dressing room, the song sung with lyrical content is as loud as the dialogue, so that both can not hear what, minimizing the emotional impact of the scene. The scenes in which Annabella was hit by her father with his fists, a lamp and then a belt were so caricature that they were absurd. The entire movie is a cartoon, the rampant prejudices against whites are literally amazing. The discussion of black women after flipper's wife finds out he cheated on her with a white woman - as if it were a discussion by an Oxford debating team - is ridiculous. The rampant racism could be endured, but the soundtrack and sound mix during this "movie" are too much. It was a technically bad movie. There is no understanding of the basic craft of filmmaking, the soundtrack, the editing, and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep this movie afloat. I really felt sorry for Anthony Quinn. I wondered why he had assumed a role in this movie - his appearance in this movie is painful. This is the first movie I have seen of this director, and it will be my last.
