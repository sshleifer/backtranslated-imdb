Robert Taylor definitely proved to be a dramatic actor in his role as buffalo hunter in this 1956 Western. It was one of the few times that Taylor played hard in a movie. Nonetheless, the picture was anything but great, as Taylor fled to television soon after with the hit series The Detectives. Stuart Granger hid his British accent and showed an impressive performance as a partner of Taylor. <br /> <br /> Taylor is a fanatic here and his hatred for the Indians really shows. <br /> <br /> Another very good performance here was the experienced actor Lloyd Nolan as an old, drinking vintage car also participated in the hunt for buffalo. In his early scenes, Nolan made an outstanding start in 1948 by Walter Huston in his Oscar-winning role in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre. Notice the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the movie. The following year, Tamblyn and Nolan joined the phenomenal Peyton Place. <br /> <br /> Writing in the movie is stiff at best. At the end of the film, it was the elements of nature Taylor had invaded. What about the elements of Scripture here?
