I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon. Why did I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and thought it would be nice to see places that I know in a movie. I really knew that I would not get the inner jokes, so I was not surprised when I sat with the deer in the glow of the headlights. What surprised me was the actions against non-Mormons shown in this film. I know it's a Mormon movie caring for the members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive. The typical stereotype of people who do not live up to their beliefs. Any non-Mormon who did not have many drank, smoked, and had an amazing selfishness, why? <br /> <br /> That really made me think about this movie, they made the Mormons so pure and yet the rest The state of Utah is, I think, filled with punk psychos just because they do not follow the scriptures of the LDS Church follow. I understand that the actions are about all Latter-day Saint members, but you think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which is not nearly true. And as I said, the non-Mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunken idiots, please! I guess I just do not get it because I'm not part of their faith and I think I'll never do it.
