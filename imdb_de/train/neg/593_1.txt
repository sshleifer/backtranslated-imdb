This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Worse than the most disgusting American slag; Worse than glitter - Mariah Carey in American slag par excellence. I can only imagine that the author and the producer took huge amounts of recreational medicines, and when he discussed the plot, he thought that this was a good idea. it is not. It's a bitter waste from the bowels of Satan himself (who would probably have written a better script if he wanted to). Robert Jones, the Exce producer, who spends money on this nonsense to our taxpayers, should be accountable. Who would have thought it would be a good idea to rebuild Deathline? I ask you - Camp as a Christmas tree, Deathline ... "Mind the door" is the classic of a really bad British movie, we really need no memory. And we definitely do not need bad, second-rate, badly scripted, badly developed and bad garbage. All this from the UK finance agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men ... I hang up my case. <br /> <br /> Do not pay for it. It is absolute and total crap - the only salvation for the producers is that they have received a huge amount of money ... our money for making it. They should hang their heads in disgrace. <br /> <br /> I'm dumbfounded by the low, low standard of this movie. It makes me Mgr that our national support committee was actually worth supporting. There is no hope for the British film industry, while idiots lead the show. Harvey Wienstein where are you? Come back, we forgive you !!!
