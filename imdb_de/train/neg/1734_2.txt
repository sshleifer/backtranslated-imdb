I'm a big fan of the old westerns and I do not think Hollywood can conquer its old splendor. But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 film, which shows almost all the banal features of the western of the reformed revolver, which has become good. Fallen but virtuous woman, bigoted city people who need to turn to a gunslinger for rescue, etc. I can not help but notice the surname of the writer and the young "actor" playing Granger's son. Any nepotism there? I have seen better spectacles in high school plays. Chill Wills plays a cartoon character by Chill Wills. Have I already reached the 1000 words?
