After all, too stupid and pointless. Yes, there is the gilded cage metaphor, but most kids would probably miss that. Forgetable. Immediately. <br /> <br /> The animation is, as we expected, very real. The plot line could best be described as thin but tough. Although the end seemed arbitrary to me. <br /> <br /> The underwater world of the sewers is an appropriately obnoxious reflection of the world above and somehow wealth and money seem to count for a lot. Oh yes, and there is a romantic interest in the fact that the female is smarter, smarter, and braver - that in itself quickly becomes an annoying (anti) stereotype. Your children will probably love it anyway.
