One wonders how the script was written. <br /> <br /> Wayne and the other artists are doing a good job, but since it's neither comedy nor romantic thriller or anything else, it's all pretty disappointing. br /> It feels like one of the threads is haunting been, it would have been worth it. Still, it's interesting to see a real turkey in a story that came just before US direct contact with the war. I wonder if the surrounding politics had anything to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes, but in the end, having something that nobody likes. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it has historical value.
