I saw that with my wife and 3 year old son. He seemed to like it much more than my wife and I. The writing is surprisingly bad for a Pixar / Disney tour. In fact, I found it very difficult to even pay attention to myself. The movie looks great, but the story becomes so strange and lengthy that I hoped my son would fall asleep so I could lift him up and out. <br /> <br /> Not to say that the movie is not It's an interesting concept, it's just so weirdly told (bad script?), especially when we first meet "the family". I know that we should have the impression that the family is crazy, but good sir, they could have shortened this sequence by a good 15 minutes (apparently I did not really do it). At this point, I was scratching my head and looking for an exit.
