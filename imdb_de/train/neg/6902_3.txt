Despite the enthusiastic reviews that this strip has collected in New Zealand, any hype surrounding the production is unfortunately undeserved. Apart from an action that only contains clichés, the film is disappointed by some faint spectacles, accents and general tension. <br /> <br /> While the overall picture of a big budget (for NZ) conveys the feeling is decidedly small town kiwi ... <br /> <br /> Has anyone not seen the brothers ?? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who have will immediately find out the similarities ... I've heard comments that scenes like the boys who play basketball were filmed to enjoy the stereotypes "Having guys who talk crap," but it feels forced ... <br /> <br /> I think Oscar Keightley thinks he's deeply ironic, but again, his delivery seems vaguely self-assured To be. <br /> <br /> Who has doubts that the Samoans living in New Zealand have been deeply, hopefully not permanently influenced by American language, culture, and everything in between will surely end <br /> <br /> Robbie magasiva always looks good on screen but is let down by the script. <br /> <br /> It always rubs me in the wrong direction when a " Comedy "scenes that are set up in such an obvious way, you have the feeling i n the clichéd punchline to have a good moan - see the white will ... <br /> <br /> I know someone who found this movie e weird - but this person has the brain of a tadpole and would be heavy Doing to spell her name if she offered a million dollars ... <br /> <br /> That sums up the mentality of this strip, OK, but not great, funny, but not funny ..... Wake up NZ - this is not a 5-star movie despite the annealing (white guilt of the middle class? :-)) Reviews .... <br /> <br /> My advice? If you see it, get drunk first !!!
