The potential was there. I saw Creep and thought several times: Oooh, that will be interesting. But somehow the interesting storylines were inexplicable or ignored as if they had never happened. The main character was irritating throughout the movie, and at some point my lad and I shouted that we wanted her to die. There are some really scary / scary moments, but these are overshadowed by the moments that just annoy me. It's another of those horror movies that pops up for a while and makes you curious, but in the end you get frustrated and a little confused about what the filmmakers wanted to achieve. Film is evil, but if the villain is more sympathetic than the main character, you know that you have a loser.
