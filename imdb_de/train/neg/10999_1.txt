Imagine the worst skits of Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in a 90-minute movie. Now imagine that all the humor in these bad sketches is removed and replaced by stupidity. Now imagine something worse 50 times. <br /> <br /> Did you do that? <br /> <br /> Ok, now go to The Underground Comedy Movie. That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever. UCM is the worst movie I have ever seen. There were a few cheap laughs ... very few. But it was lame. Although the movie's intent was lame, it was too lame to be funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not angry because I wasted my time seeing this was someone else I knew he bought. He wasted his money. Vince Offer has not written or directed anything else, and it's not surprising why.
