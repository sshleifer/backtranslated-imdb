Shazbot, that's embarrassing. In fact, here's a list of 100 that make up the embarrassment: 1.) A failed comeback for Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels basically played the same role he played in the live remake of 101 Dalmatians, which initially was not too juicy. He certainly has a fun way to promote his Purple Rose Theater ... 3.) Disnefluff. 4.) Another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn discovers Disney's Jet Li for Bob Hoskins in Unleashed. 5.) Ray Walston, the original Martian from the TV series, played a minor role in this film (las "cameo") and died two years later of Lupus. Coincidence? 6.) terrible special effects. Seriously - terrible. 7th-100th.) That damned talking, fancy suit voiced by Wayne Knight ("Newman!") To an annoying degree. My favorite scene? HA! Hahaha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... Phew! ... good. You are a joker. Okay, let's summarize this review with a moment of silence for the agonizing death of this franchise, and if you like, you can say a quick prayer that Disney will not forget that travesty and something stupid like a movie adaptation of "Mork and."
