I clearly had the urge to see this movie at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I've been to this festival for over 5 years and occasionally saw some bad movies. However, 'First Bite' has reached a brand new low. Despite filming in beautiful locations and occasionally exquisite close-ups of fabulous food, the film distorts an excessive number of plot exchanges and stilted characters until I've practically begged that the end is over. Lead actor David La Haye was unable to show any character development throughout the movie and presented a pompous cook from start to finish. Additional bargains such as eating disorders were so poorly developed and did not fit into any context the film had previously shown. <br /> <br /> A theme of mysticism was used as a bad attempt to hide a movie that does not bring anything, goes nowhere and is completely disappointed.
