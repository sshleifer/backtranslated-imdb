I was really disappointed in this movie. The first Waters movie I saw was Serial Mom and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I saw polyester and hated it somehow. The only thing I liked about this movie was DIVINE. She / he had a lot of talent. I was really surprised. Overall, I would not recommend this movie ...
