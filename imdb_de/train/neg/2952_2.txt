If you just watch the trailer for Theodore Rex, you think this is a bad buddy comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume. That's true, but this is mostly a futuristic story that is very similar to Batman Forever's directional style and peculiar characters. It was misinterpreted and should have been marketed as a futuristic story rather than just a lame police comedy. Regardless of whether this movie is wrong or not, it's still a horrible movie. In the future, dinosaurs were revived through amazing technology, and they talk and walk like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after a dinosaur was murdered, he has given the case to work, but he must partner with the toughest cop of all, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). It is up to this mismatched duo to solve the murder, and it's up to the audience to stay awake long enough to make it through this piece of quark. Teddy starts the picture as a normal actor, but in the end he is unbearable to hear. For some reason he is not only a detective, but also a bad comedian and a bad imitator. He makes imitations of famous people and accents and has some really awful lines. Whoopi charges him with fart and he says, "It's not my trumpet!" Impressive! What a puerile, immature line, even for a children's film of this caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I was hoping Teddy would bite the whole movie over his head. <br /> <br /> This movie never knew what he wanted. When the futuristic scenes and actions occur, there is no comedy or humor. In any action-less scene, the characters try to be as funny as possible, resulting in uninterrupted boredom. The action scenes do not work because they are too strange and not violent enough. As already mentioned, the comedy is just a bunch of massacre jokes. Nothing works here ever. <br /> <br /> Having a dinosaur / human detective duo seems like a pretty original movie, if nothing else. Nope! This movie is a huge rip-off of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Simply replace the dinosaurs with cartoons and put them into the future, and it's exactly the same story. A man is killed, a dinosaur is killed. A dinosaur and a detective solve the murder, a toon and a detective the murder. The bad guys of Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and Weasel. The bad guys are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and people who behave like weasels. The club scene in Roger Rabbit, in which Jessica Rabbit goes down the stage, is imitated with dinosaurs. This is a huge rip off of a much better movie! <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a bad movie that is not even worthy of getting straight to the VHS stature. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 90 min. PG for mild violence, language and gross humor.
