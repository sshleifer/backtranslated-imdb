This guy has no idea about the cinema. Okay, it seems that in his youth he did some interesting theater shows and two acceptable films whose success had more political reasons because they betrayed communist censorship. That's all very well, but look carefully: HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS ORDER! The scenes are unbalanced, without proper start and and with disordered content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say on the subject, so he exaggerates violence, nudity and gutter language. How is it possible to keep alive a lazy corpse that has never understood film art and art? Why do not you let him succumb bit by bit?
