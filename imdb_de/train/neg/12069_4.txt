The horror movie filmmaker Carl Monson was one of the prolific directors working in the area of ​​bloody chaos with low budgets. His films are full of indescribable blood, ridiculous drama, boring subplots and sad dialogue The character is a cruel murder of guests who live in the family villa. Unfortunately, this movie is almost bloodless. You can only see the murders with shadows and a few blood spatters. The tempo is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting competent, but the lack of gore and mutilation has disappointed me. A generous 4 out of 10. Attention: Do not confuse Monson's movie with Andy Milligan's equally weak "Legacy of Blood".
