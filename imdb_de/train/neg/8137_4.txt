Stewart Moss plays a starring role as a scientist traveling with his wife on a business trip, and one has the feeling that he has been selected for this role because he can roll his eyes in the head. can you ... no, that's not it, thanks, next! "Anyway, he was bitten by a bat, and then he either turns into some kind of bat and kills people or ... he is not, because no one else sees his strange transformations, but he himself seems to think that it changes because his wedding ring pops off when his hands are turned into claws he actually turns into something almost to the end.This has some good locations and a kind decent atmosphere, but unfortunately, nothing of that lame story and wonderful a little bit of fun on "so bad that it is good", but rather in the direction of bad 4 out of 10.
