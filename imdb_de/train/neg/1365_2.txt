The concept of the legal gray area in Love Crimes contributes to about 10% of the film's appeal; The other 90% are due to the blatant malice. To say that Sean Young's performance as a so-called prosecutor is made of wood is a gross understatement. With her bland suits and superfluous hair gel, Young does a decent job of convincing the audience of her pious hatred of men. Why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just to arrest policemen trying to pick them up? That hate is the only reason she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a mutually agreeable thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie. Watching Young change from a cold to full frontal nudity does not arouse much interest, but the tantrum she casts next to a fire beside a lake does so. Watching her rant and rave about her self-loathing and sexual disappointment makes Love Crimes worth the rent, but every now and then it goes downhill. Despite her urge to bring Patrick Bergin's character to justice, she escapes her abilities in the field of her own tired lust and passion. Patrick Bergin does a decent job as a slimy sociopath; If it worked sleeping with the enemy, it sure can work like hell. But I wonder if the tangible lack of energy that Young brings into the film is causing conflicts with his slimming. I guess that's what it does and the result is a thriller with thrills that is thoroughly bad and yet weird.
