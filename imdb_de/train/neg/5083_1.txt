I find it quite pointless to comment on this "film" for the simplest reason, to which he has nothing to comment on. It is like a rotten egg, which has nothing good to show to the world statement because it is lazy as another number of eggs had been before. But with a commentary essential for such grandiose insignificance, Filth is definitely the right word to describe this film, which is done in the same way as any other Romanian "movie" by Lucian Pintilie who insists on doing so "Romanian reality" after the communist era (1990 to today). <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances recommended for people outside of Romania as for the others (who lately find an amateurish camera, lack of conspiracy) lack of quality of director / actors etc., sounds etc as trendy and even arty): Watch this "movie" (as I know you want), but do a favor to the other well-meaning IMDb members writing an online review as this is misleading, confusing and ultimately wasting their time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film (among others) has some value, an educational one for the example: "How do I NOT make a movie?"
