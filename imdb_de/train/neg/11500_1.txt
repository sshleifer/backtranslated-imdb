This movement is slow, idle, cold, dark and without action or hope. It follows the well-established European formula that they like to subsidize, which is never seen, but critics think that it is an "important point". <br /> <br /> The film is valuable if it no longer shows great difference in thinking between Americans and Europeans in terms of employment. In this film, men still nurse their wounds years ago and feel committed to the government's mission of providing them with work. While we in the US know that we have to go out there to create value for someone. <br /> <br /> Spain has never looked so backward!
