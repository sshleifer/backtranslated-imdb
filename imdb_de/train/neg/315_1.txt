If you look at this stinker, this is a cruel and unusual punishment by Sandler. Really a slow and painful death. <br /> 'The DVD was purchased in the $ 5.88 garbage bin at Wal Mart. But the thought that resonates again and again in my mind is, "How can I get my money back?" <br /> <br /> The unfortunate thing about the movie is that the boat ONLY does NOT sink! br /> Best constructive proposal: Mystery Comedy Theater. They know this show on the SciFi channel, where a guy and his Muppet machines are playing the most incredible horror movies (Mystery Science Theater). IMMEDIATELY play a comedy program and show this movie. Without a good humorous parody of this train wreck, I'm afraid that Sandler's viewers can actually follow with ice picks and chainsaws. <br /> <br />
