I chose the film at the Dubai Film Festival because it was selected for the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious competition area. I was surprised that Cannes could go so wrong in assessing quality. <br /> <br /> The film, some critics say, does not have too many shots - but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy / competitor in front of your little son ... or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove their loyalty. There are a few references to the contrasting Corleone sons in Copolla's "Godfather" who reappear here in this Chinese / Hong Kong film, but the quality of the two is just as different as chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> This movie is only recommended for violence junkies. There is no great cinema here. At best, it can be expected to be better for production values ​​than the usual Run Run Shaw production.
