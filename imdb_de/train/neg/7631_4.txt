I will not defeat TLPS 'obvious peterbogdanovichian deficiencies. Instead, I will look at the positive aspects of this overvalued celluloid pygmy film. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich has managed to make a film that can endure in its entirety. Alone by this fact, the film is at the top and at the top of his lame filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some happy friends can be by sharing fabulous bodies and breasts with his male audience - not just one, but Cybill Shepherd's (then sex) on two occasions. Brava! The undisputed highlights of this cinematic Festa del Siesta. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS barely has a scene without stereotyped country music scribbling in the background. (Peter tried to mention the obvious point that the movie is playing in America's deep south (as if it does not blatantly bleed), pounding that point on and on and on ...) How's that an advantage? Ask? Well, when the movie is finally over and the monotonous country music finally stops massaging your tired drums, you experience a strange amusement: "The movie is finally over!" It is pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The film gives hope to all women who look like Cloris Leachman. I hope that one day you too will be able to catch a much younger and maybe even good looking friend. <br /> <br /> 5. Cloris Leachman's biography (of which I know that she is actually not part of TLPS) gives all women who look like this hope that one day they could win a beauty contest in Miss Chicago , (Assuming they have enough money to bribe the jury.) <br /> <br /> (You think I joke about Cloris after winning a beauty contest, who's laughing last ...) < br /> <br /> 6. The film was shot in black and white, saving us the sight of Cloris Leachman's face in its original, natural splendor.
