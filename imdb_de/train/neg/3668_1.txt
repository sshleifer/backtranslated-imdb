This movie is so bad that you almost feel it infested. In fact, there is a strong sense of relief when it's over. Relief that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder, and RUSH it back into the video store before it littered the rest of your video collection. I jokingly suggested, when we rented it, that it looked like some kind of movie in which William Hurt would "call" his performance. I meant that he would not try very hard. But lo and behold, in a lot of scenes in this movie Bill Hurt is actually on the phone! Our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we got from this confusing mess. The cinematography and editing are bleak and confused, the story is chaotic and the soundtrack is barely audible. There is a very similarity to "Falling Down," but this movie had a boldly disturbing story, great writing and acting, and a gripping soundtrack. "Contaminated Man" is just a sort of broken old European tourist trap, and it's like driving through an unknown side street in an unknown country where you do not speak the language after dark, while the windscreen keeps fogging. You get the picture? Do not understand that
