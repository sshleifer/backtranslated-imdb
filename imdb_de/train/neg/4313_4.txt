Like last year, I did not manage to get through it all. Okay, Chris Rock as host was a good choice because he wanted to get involved vaguely. Or rather, he was not in the top 10 most boring of all the holes in the theater. Many of the moderators were in this coveted top 10. I did not know that the whole thing was done by Autocue (though I knew it was a script), but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors are unable to insert a phrase, look away and stumble upon simple words (Natalie Portman - if there is no director, she is gone). The night of costumes and boring speeches was long and boring, Beyonce Knowles slaughtered some good songs and there were few decent acceptances and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Worst Presenter Award. <br /> <br /> In order to help me to write this review, I would like to thank my mother, my father, my lawyers and my chiropodist for my belief in me to point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I have not been starving for a month. I will not cry ... thanks.
