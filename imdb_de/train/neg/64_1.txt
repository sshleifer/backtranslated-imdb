This movie was awful. The end was absolutely terrible. There was no conspiracy of the movie. The only thing decent about the film was the acting of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Your services were excellent! The only problem was that the film did not live up to their acting performances. If the script approached a reasonably decent story, it's worth taking a look. Instead, the performances of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones are utterly wasteful of a terrible act of God or lack thereof. Not only did I wait throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie ... Well, it's a real movie ... not just an impotent dialogue between the characters, which was absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than an ordinary dialogue that would have taken place during this time. None of the characters was special. The only special was how Robert DuVall portrayed an old, senile, drunken old man. Nothing happens during the entire movie, not even the end. When the movie was over, I was amazed ... I was surprised that I sat through the whole movie and waited for something interesting to happen that made the movie worth seeing. It never happened! The cast of the characters began to roll suddenly and it became obvious that the movie was really over, and I realized that I had just spent two hours of my life watching a movie without any conspiracy and meaning. It was not even a story. The entire movie will expire in the course of a day. That's it. It was a day in the life (and death) of some southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (except for the training day of the movie)? The acting performances of the entire cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie ... even if it can be described as a movie.
