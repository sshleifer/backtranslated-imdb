I went to this movie and was shocked at how cheesy it was. It was a combination of every horror / thriller clich√© that tried to comment on many things, including pedophilia, Satan worship, covert police, affairs, religion ... and it was a mess. the spectacle was a nice washboard; The boy and the Jesus guy were fine, but apart from them ... Anyway. I admire the effort (albeit somewhat failed) in trying to show the Christian people in a different way ... Although they did, the way the gospel was presented was a bit stern and kiddish. On the other hand, it must be that he has talked to a small child ... no. Actually, I decided it was just bad. Music ... oh my god ... awful ... way too dramatic. OK. I felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premiere; It seemed like a poor student project. I'll stop complaining and saying the bottom line. Watch this movie if you want to waste one hour and fifty minutes of your life with manure. Here we go
