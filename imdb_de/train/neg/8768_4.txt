Please do not call me by names like "unpatriotic", "crazy" and more. <br /> <br /> The length of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) is the biggest mistake. No editing at all - apparently J. P. Dutta fell in love with his project too much. Even Lagaan was 4 hours long - but it was entertaining and also gave a message. <br /> <br /> It is based on real incidents and real people. Kudos, but were the repetitive war scenes really necessary? In addition, the focus shifted constantly from one battalion / squadron to another, and it was impossible to keep track of them all. <br /> <br /> Between the battles there were songs about loneliness, lovesickness and related things. There were nice talks. In the beginning, there was some relief from the violence, but later became so monotonous that you could even predict the nature of the upcoming conversation correctly. <br /> <br /> Why did the soldiers walk around as if they were lions in the jungle, completely you do not know that the enemy lurked nearby? And when they were shot, it aroused sympathy, but it seemed to them unobtrusive to ensure their safety. <br /> <br /> The music was melodic and the lyrics were soulful but did not fit the movie. Better to hear them on the soundtrack than in the movie. <br /> <br /> Actors was the salvation: from experienced veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan to relative newcomers like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, everyone acted like a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special mention for lightening the mood whenever needed. The dialogues ranged from brilliant ("From Madhuri .. with Love !!") to illogical / monotone ("Pakistan se zyada") musalman Hindusthan my grove "). And the explosive fun that comes from all MCs, BCs, Cs and F-words was not really needed. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil tries to give the brave Indian soldier a decent tribute, but he tries too hard and ultimately fails, Indian soldiers certainly deserve a better tribute.
