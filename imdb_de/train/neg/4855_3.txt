I really wanted to have this movie, but I was bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera driven by a robot in the direction of a bomb and of course wobbly. Then the rest of the film remains in ridiculousness in Shakycam mode, even in quiet moments of conversation. Do not the rental houses have tripods and steadicams anymore? The fact that it was shot to 16mm does not help, as the whole movie is both grainy and shaky. <br /> <br /> Despite all the effort Bigelow has in exact vehicles and equipment, there are plenty of glaring mistakes and inconsistencies that affect the credibility of the movie. <br /> <br /> - A car would not go up in flames after a single shot, and once swallowed it would not be extinguished by a small hand extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - A single Humvee would not drive around Baghdad in 2004, but would be assisted in case of mishaps or attacks from other vehicles. - It is exceptionally unlikely that it will be able to hit a running insurgent from a long distance, where the bullet will clearly take a second to reach the target. <br /> <br /> - I think bombs were brought into or near a base in designated landfills, not a random place in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - The oil tanker attack is said to have taken place in the Green Zone, a highly secure area with very few inside attacks. The zone consists mainly of offices and palaces with few residences, but is presented as a dangerous maze of dark streets and lurking insurgents. Strangely enough, James never gets into trouble with the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to go down an alleyway, thereby initiating the attempt to kidnap. <br /> <br /> - Speaking of which, the 3-man team is always clearing buildings, chasing insurgents, etc., even if there are dozens of soldiers. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging out of a window to find he's not pretending? <br /> <br /> There were no hiring shots that would show the viewer the size and layout of the base or where Baghdad was related. I had no idea who the EOD team was reporting to, and no other characters were worked out. Those are the things the characters would know, so we should too. Many of the "surprises" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the psychiatrist colonel is getting into trouble with the Iraqis he is trying to persuade, that the choice of grain at home will be overwhelming and that a driver you abducted will not expect you when you leave the vehicle br /> <br /> In the end, there was almost no character development. Renner's character has a difficult relationship at home from the start, is ruthless and addicted to adrenaline. He is the same at the end of the film. What is the point? <br /> <br /> If this is indeed the best film of Iraqi war films so far, this is a sad group. Just for the half hour that I saw, I would recommend Generation Kill for HBO.
