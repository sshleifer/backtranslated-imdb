Honestly, I do not know what's weirder, this horrible remake or the comments on this forum. The review of Masterpiece brought tears to me, it's so funny. Anyway, this movie is one of the worst movies of all time and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels. The name "Omen" on the title made me look at HBO this morning, but it's a slap in the face for the other three, especially the original. There are so many classically bad moments, but my favorite is the guy who catches fire from the juggler at the psychic mess !! good times ! This movie is part of the Omen series, which is "Scary Movie" for the entire genre. Avoid, unless you are looking for a good laugh.
