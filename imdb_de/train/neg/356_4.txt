The shape of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists, turns and excitement. Sometimes this is really an "edge of the seat" movie. But it is disappointing and disappointing. <br /> <br /> The villain of the play is not believable; His character does not hold together. I refuse to "spoil" the movie, but I just want to say that the character we meet in the beginning could not be the one we end up seeing. <br /> <br /> The film's second biggest disappointment is - it will be a little more than a bloody Slasher movie after all. There is only a small difference in quality between this and one of the "Friday the 13th" films. Not that every movie has to be absolutely tasteful, but this movie is dripping from time to time. <br /> <br /> Although the film has to do with the great Sean Connery, he does not conform to his usual standard and often just seems to be walking through the steps.
