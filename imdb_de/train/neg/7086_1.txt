This movie was so amateurish that I could hardly believe what I saw. It's turned on VIDEO! NOT film! I have not seen such things since the early '70s, when late-night networks featured movies of the week in which' horror-flicks' were recorded in ...... video. It looks like a bad soap opera, and that's a compliment. Some of the actors do their best. Michael Des Barres agrees with what he's given, like a sex addict who gets out of control. I can not say that it's nice to see Nastassja Kinski. <br /> <br /> The therapist sits in a chair virtually throughout the movie, with little variation in camera angles. I can not blame her for the bad blocking of another person, but she is absolutely incredible in her role. Her little girl voice works against her here. And I consider myself a Nastassja Kinski fan. She's certainly timeless and exotic, but she's out of her reach. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul is pathetically overwhelmed. Every line she delivers has three exclamation points. Someone must have instructed them to scream at any cost. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a raging spy? <br /> <br /> Finally, Rosanna Arquette comes in as a sweet, vicious woman and probably the most believable group. But that does not say much. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I have seen in years.
