Waste of my life, .... the director should be embarrassing. Why people feel they have to make worthless films will never make sense to me. When she died in the end it made me laugh. I had to change channels several times throughout the movie because I was embarrassed to see such bad acting. hopefully the guy who played Heath will never get work again. Also, I hope the director can never make another movie, and he'll get his paycheck back for that crap. {.02 out of 10}
