My girlfriend has a habit of going to blockbusters and making films that nobody has ever heard of. Admittedly, it has led to some funny discoveries. The best thing to say is that they definitely run for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> She brought "advice from a caterpillar" home. She was excited because the box said it was funny. Lucky for us, the propaganda on the boxes never lies. <br /> <br /> This movie was an exercise in patience. This is one of those movies in which you'll hate every character in the movie unless you're an overbearing and superficial person who likes to watch movies about himself. Until the introduction of a nice character. With which the angry-looking main character falls in love and behaves so that he would be driven out in the real world everyone. <br /> <br /> MELLOW SPOILERS FROM HERE <br /> <br /> So a few emotionally weak, cocky, overbearing artists rave about love and find success in their careers. Then they meet a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (a nearly perfect guy). We then watch as the woman, the annoying overweening artist (in her thirties) freaks out while she falls in love. So she tries to escape the nice, intelligent, emotionally mature man and stay with the married man she had great but empty sex with. She is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him out. In the real world, she would have been pretty successful. I definitely wanted to escape from her and had no relation to her! <br /> <br /> Although it's nice that the man "fought for his love," I never wanted her to have him. (Not my girlfriend either) She did not deserve it. And why am I wondering, the director thought, that the "almost perfect guy" should be punished by having to relate to her? When the artist asked the "almost perfect man" to leave, we also shouted for him. There is a problem with a movie when the heroine of the movie is so annoying, childish and stupid that you want her to fail. <br /> <br /> In addition, let me say that Andy Dick has even made me laugh a few times, even though his character was presumptuous even to the point of harassment. In terms of the other characters they were well-played, morally bankrupt and annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy and I can say that I laughed a few times in the movie. Unfortunately, not much has been laughing in the last 10 minutes. But when I had these laughs, I had prayed too late for the end of the movie. I had to get these vapid characters out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to observe people who hate you, love people they do not deserve, then this is the movie for you.
