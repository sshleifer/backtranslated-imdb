This is not a completely bad movie. The plot (new house built next door seems to be riddled) is not bad, the mood is scary enough and the acting is fine. The big problem I had is that, since I was familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I could not get over how different she looks with her apparently new, big lips. I always stared at her. You look so out of place on her face! They make them look completely different (and not better). <br /> <br /> Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the actor who plays the architect Kim, who designs and fills his heart and soul into the house, does a good job. And Lara (as Col) is also quite good (but those lips!) As the owner of the neighboring house. Her husband Walker (Colin Ferguson) is accordingly made of wood. The different characters living in the house were also good. I particularly liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first to move into the house. The attempt to involve us in the whole neighborhood unfortunately fails, because the other neighbors are not very sympathetic. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the director could not make the "haunted house" ominous. Other movies (like Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) make that scary feeling, but it just does not happen here. The closest is when Col paints a picture of the house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that did not work for me is the conspiracy that occurs with Kim, the architect. At first he seems to be a victim of the house like the others (it sucked his inspiration), but later he seems to have joined together in evil. All in all, not a bad movie for horror fans, if you can take your eyes off those big lips!
