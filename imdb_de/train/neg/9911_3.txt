If you loved actors like Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal, and Bill Cobbs, you do not need Billy Burke, Coolio, or other distractions. In "Three Days to Vegas" is a huge talent completely wasted, with the blame falls directly on the script. The vacation movies of my neighbor are about as interesting as this misguided road movie. If you want to see how a veteran cast with a good script is used, check out The Crew. There are really no redeeming factors, and it is a crime when these wonderful actors struggle with such weak materials. I wanted to like it, but the flat screenplay cheats on the audience by giving the actors essentially nothing to work with. - MERK
