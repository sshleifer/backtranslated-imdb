It is a pity that almost nobody under the age of 30 knows the "over the top" writing of the articles by Michael O'Donoghugh and the SNL skits that were awesome for the time ... and so it is a true one Shame that anyone who likes this will take the opportunity to research his work, you will take the easy way to watch videos and lead them to MR MIKES MONDO VIDEO. <br /> <br /> This movie contains clever elements that never quite connect to the funny bone. The viewer experiences such things as cat diving / swimming with the man who believes he has found feline bliss by hurling these kittens into a pool followed by the camera in slow motion and montage. Then we are taken to an island where all past fads are retired (hula hops, pet rocks, rainbow dread wigs, etc.). Then we enter the music world (Punk was a new musical variety at the time of this film), on the "D" Rate Bar Performer "Rootboy Slim performs" boogie till you puke "in his own lazy style of filthy and eclectic sleaze of all this is now the background music, in many different styles with many different instruments playing the sound of TELSTAR and repetitions - for those who do not understand Telstar, was the first American satellite, which was brought into space, and the theme was created To commemorate the genius and triumph of the man, MR MIKES seems to be the signal for ridiculous waste in society, and the theater now offered that the video was not released, a live performance of Sid Vicious (ex sex gun , not the wrestler) who sang MY WAY, his version is very different from Sinatras, as you might imagine, but to be honest, I find it worth listening to ... it's good! That's the sad part - in the VHS release Paul Anka denies the rights of his song and the viewer has to experience 3 1/2 minutes of silence, with an explanation rolling over the image of the singing, dead sex pistol. <br /> <br /> I would give the theatrical release a 5 or 6, the video is closer to a 4 and now that so much is pass√©, I can see where many people would give it a 3 or 2.5 , If you want to see a good O'Donoghugh SCROOGED script watch, this is a better tribute to the man's insight and talent.
