Relentlessly stupid "wartime image" with no budget, mainly intended to show the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer - not a bad idea in itself - but that should be embarrassing to anyone connected with it. Laughable "script", performances that would not pass in a primary school Christmas pageant, inappropriate "action" scenes, confused instructions from the normally competent documentary filmmaker Louis Clyde Stoumen - who is apparently not sure whether he's making a comedy, a philosophical treatise about the futility of a war or a dazzling T & A (at least in the early 1960s) travelogue of Eve Meyer's magnificent body - and a general expression of dullness and incompetence. Interesting to see Eve Meyer stretching her things, but that's about it.
