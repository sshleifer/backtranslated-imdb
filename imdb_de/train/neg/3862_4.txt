I just saw it. A few laughs, but nothing to write home about. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. The (long) DVD gag role consists almost entirely of uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to beat a clock, but then her character should be a bat in the mud, so "well done," I guess? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs can not be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip and versatile. Larry Miller, who played the father of Julia Stiles (weird), is also funny in 10 things I hate about you. He is great, but the best thing about this movie was the casting of Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours folding her clothes, and I feel like I just did it.
