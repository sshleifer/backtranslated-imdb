One of those classics that was kept next to "Deep Throat" and "Behind the Green Door". <br /> <br /> Sure, it was smart, but the female lead is not so attractive and sex is not that hot. But if this movie were not, porn would not have become what it is today. Harry Reems was the Ron Jeremy of his time. Worth a look if you are a fan.
