I do not think this is a bad show under the right conditions. I have tolerated the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who are not real lawyers. God forbids anyone who attends a law school on the basis of these shows. This was the case when I saw some interviews of the show. It just made me gag. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, Spader and Shatner, who are supposed to be the stars of the show, are the most annoying. While this may be a compliment in some situations, it is certainly not here. Their constant harassment of the women in the show is funny at first. But since this is literally all the time, I have realized that this is as deep as the show will come. Trying to get some serious, dramatic and even riveting moments in the midst of this mockery of a real show can not compensate for the progressive loss of interest I experienced to enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> Alan Shore's extravagant and unsubstantiated "public service announcements" spewing out his opinions is not impressive. Denny Crane is just annoying. I was ashamed of him and the show's authors for Crane's speech, which sported a colonial outfit. I give two stars because there were moments when I thought the show was trying to deal with topical issues being done with care. <br /> <br /> I think the authors of the series realized that the sexual harassment of Denny and Alan was even overblown by those who were inviting from the beginning. The thing is, I do not care if the treatment of sexual harassment on the show is done well, but I just had the feeling that the author insulted me by implanting artificial sexual jokes throughout the show, hoping that my libido keeps me coming back for more. I'm not a teenager anymore and I think this show is promising if the goal was not to reach the lowest common denominator to get ratings. Of course I write this after realizing that it really will not get much better. It's a shame because it's one of the shows I would love.
