This movie is awful. AWFUL. One of the worst movies ever. I can not imagine that gigli is worse. Due to previews we said "NO", but then looking for something in the middle of the dirt outside we decided to give it a try. <br /> <br /> STUPID US. <br/> <br/> Affleck is NOT an actor. He is an image and can look good with explosions, but not even the kind that Bruce Willis found in Die Hard. If he had taken off his shirt and driven around, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> The best was Catherine O'Hara - she's always good. Gandolfini flopped again (if the sopranos had not been, he would be washed away), as he had done in "The Mexican". Affleck eats every scene and as others said - no character has any motivation for their actions. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS.
