The story seemed interesting enough in any case. How can a real brutal murder become a really boring movie? Well, you can see and experience "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> I had heard of the Wonderland murders before this movie was released and found out that this is an interesting, true story of some truly sadistic people. Unfortunately, there is no character development, so we never have a chance to understand why something of it was made, or to get a good grasp of the interrelationships between the characters. The pace of the direction was very lengthy. All this leads to an extraordinarily boring movie. Given that Dawn Schiller - a central role as a friend of Holmes - was an associate producer and Mrs. von Holmes was a consultant for the film, we would have had the opportunity to get a real insight into the characters.
