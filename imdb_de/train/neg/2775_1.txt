This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Not really. I'm not joking. There is no excuse for such bad behavior except for all "true history / historical references" clues. It's a shame because the sets and costumes were, as others have written, great. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was typical of "Asian" music, although I could not figure out where "modern" was. Love song came in when Fernando lay in his bed and thought of Mary. I do not know who wrote and sang this beautiful song, but it was as if Norah Jones was suddenly transported to the 1500s. <br /> <br /> The Hershey syrup blood in Phycho was more realistic than the ketchup sprinkled during the game Kwik-n-EZ fight scenes. <br /> <br /> But the acting. Oh, so sad. The lines were like a bad junior high. If Gary Stretch wore a potato costume for the County 4H Fair, he might have been more credible. In the end he sounded more like a bat in Little Italy. Sometimes I half expected that he "Adrian!" or even "You want a piece of me?!". <br /> <br /> Favorite line: When the queen says to her lover (after barfing on the floor): "I'll have a baby." He answers "A child?" I expected her to say, "No, donkey, a chair leg, Duh."
