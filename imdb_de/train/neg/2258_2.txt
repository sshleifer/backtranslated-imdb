You do not have to write a script for this wasted indignation! They simply sit back and watch a pair of Moonlight women and diners endure each other, before coming to a sensational audience on the Jerry Show. Powerful and outrageous, this cash-in from the Jerry Springer Real-World program shows everything that the overrated hyperspace talk show does not show on air - unless you have a collection of uncensored videos made by the producers of "Cops." Even the outside world of Springerland reveals the most amateurish spectacle of the decade! This shows that THE GONG SHOW MOVIE had a central character in a movie turkey. Change the channel!
