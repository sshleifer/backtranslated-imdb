The great ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is a bad movie in every way. The script, the dreary tempo, the lack of depth in each character, the pointless negotiations, the horrible drama, the unnecessary climax make this possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I found nothing sympathetic, entertaining or intellectually stimulating in any way. <br /> <br /> I imagine the filmmakers, with their mood lighting, their long, lingering pauses and their vaguely spiteful classic soundtrack, thought they were doing something clever and dark. If so, they have failed completely. It just bored me and I wish I had never seen it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
