Normally, I tend to like gonzo films on a low budget, but Darkman III is so horribly disconnected that I have nothing but contempt for it. <br /> <br /> It looks and feels like a TV show and a particularly grubby one of them. The sets are sparse, the lighting flat, the score and effects are disjointed, and the camera work is film school 101. There is no plot to talk about, the characters are one-dimensional, and the actors are sleepwalking. Most performers look like they're doing softcore porn. In fact, the only reward I got from this mess was the recognition of the surprising strabismus that faced Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna of Star Trek: Voyager) without her Klingon clumsy headdress. Her skin tone is about two shades lighter than in Voyager; Either she was faded for this role or blackened for Voyager. Very strange.
