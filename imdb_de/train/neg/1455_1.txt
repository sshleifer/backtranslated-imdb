In a movie that relied on a historical figure, I was rarely exposed to such nonsense. A terrible joke of a movie I jumped through. Terrible, banal, distorted and full of open lies and half truths. <br /> <br /> The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was originally supposed to be a consultant for this film. However, he found the script so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he rejected it and demanded that they stop using his name as a source (he was ashamed to believe that people would think he was involved). <br /> <br /> A scene shows Hitler beating his dog. There is not a single source for that. Hitler loved animals over people. He introduced the strictest animal protection laws in Europe, banning vivisection and animal testing. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film turns its extraction of the Iron Cross into a farce involving bribery. Outer lies. It was awarded to him for repeated bravery over a long period of time. There are no historical documents proving that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece. Not one. <br /> <br /> Apart from these, Hitler is portrayed in this garbage strip as a rabid blockhead. <br /> <br /> If he was only half as ignorant, den and fat as he is this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he ever existed. Do not worry about becoming the leader of Germany. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie was extremely horrible. <br /> <br /> Take a look at Downfall and give this movie a big berth.
