I saw this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and I do not know what kept me in my place. I suppose I had just expected a movie with Gere would eventually have a value, but nothing valuable came to the screen. The story is a stupid excuse to stack shot by shot of bondage and torture. There is no character in the movie that does something like real life. The "style" of the cut is based on snapshots, mini-flashbacks and overprinting to add weight to this bleak set-up of a group of sadists who seem to have roamed free for years. The leader SURPRISE is the "victim" of an executed murderer. I do not see Gere, a Buddhist, being involved in this violent, sexist garbage.
