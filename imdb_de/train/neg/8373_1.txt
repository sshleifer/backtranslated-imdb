I was not particularly impressed with the film, especially because I went to the movies in good faith with my family to watch a movie rated here in the UK 12A. To my horror, this movie was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but not good for watching with children). This film was sometimes very crude, with fart jokes, a punch in the groin area, etc ... and not very funny for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is Calvin Sims, who is a 2-inch dwarf, comes out of jail and steals a huge diamond, but has to put it in a women's handbag. So the rest of the movie says he pretends to be an abandoned baby and goes to this women's shelter so he can get that diamond back. <br /> <br /> So far, I've got most of the output from the Wayans Brothers - but this movie certainly takes the biscuit. <br /> <br /> A good advice - wait until it comes on TV or via cable
