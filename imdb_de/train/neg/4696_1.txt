I know the people and I've done some animation and graphic design and the show is awful! They are rich little children who have no talent, and probably only asked Nick to accept them! Alex played drums for a year, I played 4 1/2! The movie is awful and the show too! This is the craziest, most mixed comedy that's even weird that I've ever seen. It is so stupid that it makes me sick !!! It's just so crazy that Nickelodeon would ever accept such a thing and so stupid! You are so stupid and funny! I hate her and her show and think if Nick only realizes how stupid it is, they will hopefully lose weight!
