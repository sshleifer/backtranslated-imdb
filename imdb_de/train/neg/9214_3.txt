When watching this movie, many things become clear: 1) Acting is awful. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the conflict between parents and children borders on the soap opera. The other two boys: an overly pouting prodigy and your stereotypical I-a-babe-but-I-really-sensitive-inside the blond dreamboat; 2) the movie as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (by Tom Hanks); 4) the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) the strange lines and subplots are not bettered by the terrible spectacle; and 5) that's a really bad movie. Expect to be disappointed - and probably disturbed.
