Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I have not seen it since. I only saw the trailer. Does that look like a first-class movie for you? I do not think so. I was so horrified by this movie that I could barely see it. It was mainly the scene where Shirley McClain had cut the little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was freaked out of this movie. Today, at 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that little kids might not see this movie, even if it's PG. Be aware of the potential results when you show this to children. I do not even remember what it was about, once was enough!
