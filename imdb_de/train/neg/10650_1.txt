This movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie I have ever seen. And that says a lot, considering that I've seen stinkers such as Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane and Bloody Murder (which is almost a second). However, I love bad horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, it really stands out. Sometimes there is nothing more entertaining than a badly made slasher movie. For this film, the opening scene, where a woman is fried in a sunbed, seems to have no effect on the film, especially since the movie does not tell you that the event took place 2 years before the rest of the movie. Acting does not exist, and most camera images have shrunk from women's areas wrapped in spandex. The cop was the stiffest monotonous actor I've ever seen. The best / worst part of this movie, however, must be the murder weapon. A huge safety pin ?! What did they think? Who is the murderer? An angry "Huggies" employee? I would have to give this movie a total zero score, but damn if I did not feel like watching it
