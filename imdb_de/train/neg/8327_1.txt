OK. So it's a low budget movie (I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi-8 video). Acting is generally awful, the make-up is ridiculous (the blood looks like it came from Sherwin-Williams and I've seen more convincing bruises from Halloween ghoul kits), and the lighting generally looks like they would Use a borrowed Toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors. <br /> <br /> I could forgive these low budget properties when there is actual content when a movie has been trying to tell a story. However, this collection of video material can boast of no action, real characters, and no momentum. It's a self-indulgent mess. <br /> <br /> And do not worry - here are no spoilers, because there is absolutely nothing to spoil.
