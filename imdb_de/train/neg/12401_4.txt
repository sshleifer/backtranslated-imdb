I am clearly disadvantaged here. I have not seen the first two films of this series, although I have seen many films by Larry Cohen. Fans of the series seem to think that this is a good movie. It was pretty boring to judge. <br /> <br /> You never get a really good look at the maniac's face (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was pretty bleak. The death scenes seem to be staged to consume most of the movie, not to create thrills. If I saw the NC-17 Director's Cut, I might be more impressed. <br /> <br /> The end to the chase with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was pretty intense. best part of the movie.
