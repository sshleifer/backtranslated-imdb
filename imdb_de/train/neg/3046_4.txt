I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. My mother bought it in our local Kmart because it was sold for $ 5 on VHS. She thought it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers. But this movie scared the hell out of me. You may be wondering how a movie about Santa Claus could scare anyone? The plot of the film revolves around Satan, who sends one of his minions, Pitch, to earth to kill Santa Claus and ruin Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon out of hell to kill Santa. Throughout the Christmas party, Santa Claus steals to catch him on earth when the sun rises on Christmas day. If Santa does not manage to be in space again, he will turn into powder. Do not get me wrong, the movie is funny and quite entertaining, but the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is just scary.
