Will they ever make films without nudity and sex? This was launched on Sunday afternoon at 3:00 am and I could not believe what they were showing. Thank god my son was out or I would have been freaked out if he had seen the soft / middle porn! Are people who make films not interested in who they insult or corrupt? Children could have looked after the church, and they show that ??? !!! Acting was good and I enjoyed the suspense but GEE! There was violence and bad guys, but that's to be expected in a western movie. Randy Travis was really good at his role. If the writers, directors, and producers would stop making so many sex scenes. What has to happen to stop them from going in that direction? Where can I complain?
