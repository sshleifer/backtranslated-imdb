After seeing men behind the sun, I hoped for an evolution in style and technology that would fit the larger scale of the movie. I was also quite interested in seeing someone fact-based on a fictional account of what happened during that infamous Japanese atrocity, but that's not it. This is like a European Nazi exploitation film of the lower to middle class from the 70s - z. SS experimental camp, etc. (maybe more like deported women of the Special Department). Granted, it has more scope and more people walking around, but it draws on the same cheap and dismal device of many unfortunate non-actors who easily fall for the sound of ridiculously counterfeit shots, enhanced with occasionally badly shot "shock" become. Sequence. The admittedly awful documentary film is so grossly assembled between scenes that even these real images are largely deprived of their power. Watch Channel 4 'The Holocaust' (recently aired (still running?), Booth 1: 2006) to find a truly disquieting documentary about the evils of war (with an excellent use of actual materials in context). This is the kind of treatment that the horror of Nanjing deserves, not this botched exploitation trash (a better-made commercial film without the irreverent use of stock footage would have been fine, but even this is not even a very good exploitation film). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as treatment of the subject).
