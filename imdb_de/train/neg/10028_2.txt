I had a lot of expectations for this film and more, as it was a Yashraj movie. Jimmy operates a call center and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach her boss, Lakhan Singh, English. The two fall in love and decide to run away, but Pooja tells Jimmy that she can not do this because she owes Lakhan Singh, also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and only then does Jimmy learn that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don. In the meantime, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to track down Jimmy and Pooja. The stars are Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar. Director is the first director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Yes! The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her much publicized weight loss) looks good. However, the plot is extremely thin in the story and sometimes makes no sense from one scene to the other - so I initially said I expected more from this film because it was a Yashraj production. Regarding the songs, unfortunately, there is no song that I can remember now. <br /> <br /> There are moments when you can laugh, and that's mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif, while Kareena could definitely do better. Kapoor played her role well. But you can not say that to Anil Kapoor - it does not suit him as a villain. Not to mention Aditya Chopra, who has produced and directed good films like "Mohabbatein" in the past. What did Yash Chopra do by making such a trash movie? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Bad movie, it's not worth spending time and that's my first and last impression.
