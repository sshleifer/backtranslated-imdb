Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (as Carl Kolchak) is back; This time he is behind "The Night Strangler". Once again, police officers and other journalists do not believe or want to obscure the supernatural point of view. Producer-director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as his previous "Night", with understandably less success. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis is a funny addition to the cast, including Dark Shadows alumni George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (as Louise Harper) leads a sexy collection of belly dancers. And though I have not seen any of it anywhere, Roger Davis must be Mr. McGavin's dining companion in an early scene that fakes the existence of vampires in disbelief! <br /> <br /> **** The Nightwatcher (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
