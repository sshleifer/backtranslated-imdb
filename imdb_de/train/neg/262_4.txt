Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I have the feeling that he was sold out to take on his first big budget role. Foxx is following in the footsteps of people like Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents squandered by stereotyping producers, who think black men who commit crimes are funny (see: Money Talks , Blue Streak). <br /> <br /> Okay, I've laughed a few times and admitted that all these comedians are still playing funny roles, but I'd like to see these guys portray Al Marlon Wayan's Requiem as a dream. Or in Living Colors Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayan's moving performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled.
