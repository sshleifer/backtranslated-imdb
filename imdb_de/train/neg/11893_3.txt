** May contain spoiler ** <br /> <br /> A guy in a double-faced Kong suit (the same in KING KONG VS. GODZILLA from 1962) offers many of the laffs in this much-ridiculed monster trick. Kong has risen on Mondo Island, this time helping the Lunkhead hero and other good guys. The vampire-like villain is called Dr. Who? - weird, he does not look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally elicits it with Who's Pride and Joy, a giant robotic monkey that looks like a nasty metal sculpture by Magilla Gorilla. As with many of Honda's flicks, this might have been a merit before the American public messed with it and added new material. The animation company Rankin / Bass had a hand in this mess. They should stick to superior children's programs like The Little Drummer Boy.
