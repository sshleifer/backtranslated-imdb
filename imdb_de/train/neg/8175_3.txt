The mood of this movie is pretty good and captures the feeling of the 80s with good performances. <br /> <br /> However ..... <br /> <br /> The script runs mill except for some comedic moments and seems weird if I assume it should be nervous. The characters are totally over-dramatized and unbelievable and full of right-wing stereotypes that the scriptwriter probably saw when he saw a panoramic documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is that this movie has no real story. It hits all the right "arty" boxes, but actually nothing happens and in the end you'll wonder what the point was. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
