You have a strong belly. Holden was actually 55 years old when filming, but looked close to 70 and lived only eight years. At one point, Holden said, "I'm twice your age." Okay, try the triple grandpa! The theme "old enough to be your dad" for which you filmed did not work. Assigned seniors sometimes have legal teenagers. More power for her, but that does not mean that I want to see it. It is not a question of judgment, but of digestion. I like my food where it belongs. Lenz is fun, and the cars of the 70s, clothes, furniture, etc. are worth it, if it comes late in the evening over cables and you want to see something that can be faded out for your bed. It would have been nice if the blonde girlfriend of Lenz, who owned her guitar, got more scenes. Pleasing spacey ... Who was the chick? I will try and find out.
