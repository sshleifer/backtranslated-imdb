It's like other Dracula movies, Dracula's subordinates are always on Dracula's side, which has disappointed me in the end. Regardless of whether the person wants to remain a vampire or not, I would like to see something like the first movie the servant fights against his master. It's much more interesting (since you can almost predict how the story will go) when either the priest or D. win the game (we need some surprising plans!).
