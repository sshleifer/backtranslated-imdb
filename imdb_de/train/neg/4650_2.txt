With a cast of robust British character actors and a pleasing photograph of the UK, I had hoped and hoped that this movie would be more fun. Unfortunately, I got tied up for wrong reasons - I could not believe how terrible it was. I have seen thousands of old films and am always ready to consider them as products of their time, but that was really hard. <br /> <br /> As others have already stated, the main problem is that this is not the case I do not know what it wants to be: a gentle romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or a musical. I was a little stunned when Jeannie Carson suddenly broke into a song after 15 minutes! It is not credible at any level, either in the story itself or in the fact that Daisy never seems to have a threat in it. Other aspects that defied credibility were the casting of the favored Donald Sinden as a songwriter (for God's sake!), The fact that he seems to have Diana Dors for a fianc√© and does not seem to have the slightest interest in her (I mean, Diana Dors! Come on!) And a ridiculous scene in the office of a songwriter. The whole thing is stupid in the worst way. <br /> <br /> If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would be the very beginning with the wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - then everything went downhill way.
