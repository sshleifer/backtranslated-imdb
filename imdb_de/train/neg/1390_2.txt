I'm a big fan of B5 and did not assert myself until the end of season three. I have faithfully watched all previous seasons when it was syndicated, and concluded that this is one of the most thought-out story arcs ever to appear on television. Even the filler episodes were interesting. The films were also well produced and as entertaining as anything found in cinemas. <br /> <br /> What brings us to the 'River of Souls'. Of course, after seeing everything else, I had high expectations. Martin Sheen seems to play in an Ed Wood movie and not in a serious science fiction story. The story itself might have looked good in outline form or even reached the storyboard. However, it obviously suffers when it was time to realize this idea in a two-hour movie. There are no special effects that entertain us when there is no exciting story. There are places where time was obviously tight and the dialogue was only improvised to fill in the story. If this was the regular season, she would have been among the worst episodes.
