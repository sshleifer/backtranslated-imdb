I was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and the press he received, but after seeing him, I was very disappointed. Slums is a totally listless film, linked to Todd Solondz's disturbing kind of family reality without Todd's humor. The story continues and every scene is worse than the last one. Maybe I missed the point, but if this movie is an example of every girl's experience, I'm glad to be a man.
