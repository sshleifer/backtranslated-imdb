Another weak start to the third season: "Is there really no beauty?" Still, it has at least one key element that is very different, and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who has to be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so abhorrent that it drives people insane. It's too bad the episode can not fulfill this incredible premise. I think it was obviously a mistake to ever "show" extraterrestrials, as his real face is in no way close to such a mighty structure; All we get is Star Trek's standard psychedelic light display, which is used for a number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship passes a magnetic storm or something similar. In any case, the look of Kollos can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and only if Spock wears a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the name of the alien was "Carlos," which I found funny, but I digress.) Spock must meet with Collos once, so that the alien can bring the Enterprise back to safety. This is achieved, but when Spock / Kollos go back to finish the meltdown, Spock forgets his visor. Oh oh. He goes crazy and finally recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with mental powers. This may have been a really bizarre, excellent episode, but it's poorly directed and looks like an even worse show of the last season of the series.
