The first look at the cover of this picture looks like a good rock'n'roll movie. But do not be fooled by the cover or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are there. The plot is just awful and the acting too. Simple and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a movie about a roadie, it's just a small love story that's so horrible that you can see through it. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs, and that's why I give 2 out of 10 points. If the music were not, she would have been 0 out of 10. Meat Loaf is a terrible actor (at least he was 1980), and the girl who plays the groupie does not look good! This movie was a big disappointment to me because it makes many good promises.
