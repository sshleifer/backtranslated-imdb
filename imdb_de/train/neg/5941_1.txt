As a fan of Notorious B.I.G. I was looking forward to this movie. I find it regrettable that it is a horrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to portray Notorious B.I.G. Much of the story follows the true son of Notorious B.I.G., Christopher Jordan Wallace, as Notorious B.I.G. as a child. Unfortunately, he is not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father. Derek Luke is not as convincing as Sean "Puffy" Combs. In short, no one is convincing enough to play his role here. The big problem with that is that these people are actually playing. It was boring and gave no information about Notorious B.I.G. Fans and non-fans alike do not know that. I was particularly disappointed by Angela Bassett, a very good actress who was wasted as Voletta Wallace here. The film beats and believes that Notorious B.I.G. The fans spend a lot of money on it. Unfortunately, I can not say that that happened. It's far from a good movie. I had expected so much, but unfortunately I did not get anything I wanted. I think you should definitely leave that out.
