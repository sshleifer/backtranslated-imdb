The Thumb idea is not such a winner the second time around. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for a variety of reasons. In the first place, Mr Oedekerk had far less to do with the Titanic program. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic has not become a cultural myth, and there are far fewer references that will resonate with the audience. The holes are filled in ThumbTanic Unique jokes that are not really related to anything. For example, the suggestion of the hero that the heroine in the scene "jumping off the end of the ship" is not clean - it is not funny. They only think to themselves: "Did I miss something in the original film?". There were too many of these baseless jokes (see Arachnid). <br/> <br /> By contrast, sending the smarmy ship designer had meaning and was funny. Also very funny was sending the guy in the movie who wanted to run as a maniac "faster" and demanded that * everything * be "faster", including sinking the ship and dying first. This type of joke meant something in the context of the Titanic and gave Thumbtanic meaningful humor. <br /> <br /> The thumbs "media", the faces and the voices are still amusing. The props and sets as well as the CG animation are worthy. All in all, although ThumbTanic proves that scurrility alone does not work, this movieette still keeps you amused and laughs to the end.
