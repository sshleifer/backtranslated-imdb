I missed something that I could not intervene at first: charisma of the leading actress. This inevitably led to a lack of chemistry as she shared the screen with her leading man. Even the romantic scenes worked only as actors. It could well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors. I just do not know. <br /> <br /> But could it have been the script? Exactly in whom was the cook in love? He seemed to know more about his culinary skills and his restaurant, and ultimately about himself and his youthful deeds than anyone or anything else. He never convinced me that he was in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in this movie. But do not forget that it was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.
