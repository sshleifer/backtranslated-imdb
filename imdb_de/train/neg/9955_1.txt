The whole thing is very nice to look at. Filming in Europe was a good idea. The main actors are attractive. The score is usable. <br /> <br /> BUT THEN YOU SPEAK! And the non-action has developed! And from there everything went downhill. Pacino is sleepwalking and Keller keeps talking about how boring she is ... Hello, honey, you're not alone. If he makes a Mae-West imitation, you may have to hide your face, it's so painful to look at it. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how either the actor or the director Sydney Pollack was involved in this or better question why it was so stinking in the end? <br /> <br /> Since death is represented in almost every scene, in one way or another, it may be that you have little fun here. Maybe it should feel as empty and cold as death. But I still can not recommend it.
