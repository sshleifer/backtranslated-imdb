Although many well-known "television names" are associated with "A Man Called Sledge", the film itself or the performances is nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, it differs only from a television series from the 60s and 70s like "The Rat Patrol" by a larger cast and much more violence. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to get rid of all the light comedy he had done ("Maverick", "Support Your Local Sheriff"). "Gunfighter" etc.). ). Unfortunately, his earthy sympathy works against him, as Sledge is a humorless character that accounts for the popularity of Clint Eastwood's western spaghetti figure. But Eastwood's things were not so flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I suspect "A Man Called Sledge" might be considered spaghetti western, though the tempo is too slow to really fit into this subgenre. Fans of the slow comedy series "Combat" will feel an instant connection when Vic Morrow filmed the film and co-wrote the script with Frank Kowalski. Then add some trendy slow-mo recordings and cross-dissolves that attract attention rather than narrative. <br /> <br /> The plot is the default theme "Big Heist" (add "The War Wagon" here) with Sledge Plot as you commit a $ 300,000 gold delivery. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that the shipment is guarded by 40 outsiders during the journey, and while detained, it is locked up in a vault room in the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same plot. <br /> <br /> The story would make a decent hour of television, but it quickly becomes a very cushioned feature film. Garner does not let any of his charm intrude into his character, and the film does not generate enough excitement to arouse a viewer's interest. <br /> <br /> The thing crashes and burns shortly after the robbery, when the gang intervenes a fictitious and illogical card game. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
