The omega code was a model of cinematic inconsistency. There was a little (but little valuable) good acting, mainly from the two prophets and Rostenberg, who appeared only once and had no lines. Otherwise, the spectacle was decidedly bad. The plot was rather weak and based only partially on the questionable biblical interpretation. Certainly not one of the best of the year.
