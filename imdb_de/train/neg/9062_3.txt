This film was different in that it did not show the typical gay stereotypes I'm used to. But that does not change the fact that it is completely missing from a story. I'm sure there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves screened because black gay characters are rarely seen and if they are the characters, they are usually not fully developed. But how hard would it have been for the author to write a story with beginning, middle and end. Or how about a focused story? There really seems to be no point in this movie, and although it's a low budget movie, it's still no excuse for the lack of story or plot.
