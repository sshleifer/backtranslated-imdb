This is by far the absolute worst movie I have seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it, I thought it could not be a bad movie because he was in pretty good movies and he was a pretty good actor. NOT CORRECT! Nobody should waste his time with this movie. I'm about 80 percent of that fast-forwarded and I do not feel like I've missed anything.
