THE RINGMASTER plays Jerry Springer as a TV talk show host named Jerry, but it's not THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, his guests are trailer garbage, but not the trailer garb they get on THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW on .... What's the point of making a movie about the JERRY SPRINGER show and pretending it's not the JERRY SPRINGER SHOW? And besides, this is a very boring movie
