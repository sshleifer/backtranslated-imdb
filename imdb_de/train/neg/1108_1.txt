A sad and meaningless piece of fluff (bloody lint, but fluff). Badly scripted, with inhuman and wooden dialogues. You do not care if the characters live or die (even if the actors themselves). Small grace or charm, little action, little sense of the whole. Maybe something is interesting in the scenery and at the scenes - these gaps between the boards of all buildings may correspond to the way of life. The encounter with the frame is unnecessary and distracting, and the character of Hoppalong Cassidy himself is boring and incompetent.
