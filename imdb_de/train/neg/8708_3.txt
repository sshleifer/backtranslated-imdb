Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. The way the dinosaurs move reminds me when my sister plays with her dolls because they can not look stiffer or fake than they were. I mean, first they're in a bus, then in a warehouse and suddenly on a boat. And let's face it, does it make sense that a few dinosaurs can stay together in a van or on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals and now they could fit on a van. It sounds stupid, even if you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this 3 is that it's still entertaining. I thought it was better than the first (I have not seen the second one yet). Just do not rent it. I saw it on TV, and it's good that I did not want to, if I did not want to rent the money.
