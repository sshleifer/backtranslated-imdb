Why do people who do not know how a certain time has been in the past feel the need to define that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the Apollo Moon Landing with the sinking of the Titanic, and you have as realistic a movie as this formal soap opera populated with low-grade trash. Is that what children do who are too young to go to Woodstock and who have failed to fill the school? "I show these old crooks, I bring out my own movie and prove that you do not have to know anything about your topic to still make money!" Yes, we already know that. The only thing I looked at this movie was to give me a little insight into subcategory thinking. The next time I see a slut in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I run in the other direction. It is child abuse when parents have children brought up worthless. It's an audience abuse to put Woodstock and Moonlanding in a movie as if the film was ipso facto in 1969.
