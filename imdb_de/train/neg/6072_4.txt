DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I love good sports movies (not so much in baseball, but hey, their sports movies, right?). I expected a lot more for this movie. It seems to start well: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes {whom I do not really like} is very good as a pampered star. Barkin's role was fine for me. She is a good actress, but seemed out of place in this role. For me, they always seemed to rush the scenes, and then, in some places, it gets a little bit more. It just seemed so uneven to me! Considering the cast and plot, it could have been so much better. I rated it '4' and I was generous ~ I'm tough with numbers!
