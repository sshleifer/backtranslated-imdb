This could be the worst show I have ever seen. Apart from the tastelessness of a sitcom about Hitler, it's just not funny or entertaining. It's very similar to a 1950s sitcom in their Cornball humor and fictional situations, but though it can be done well, like I Love Lucy, it's not funny. I think the show was based on the novelty "Look, it's Hitler as a humming sitcom character," but it fell flat in every way. The guy who plays Hitler is so malicious that it's hard to go through it alone. I wonder what the network might have thought possible. I thought America had a tasteless show, but the British beat us this time. America would never broadcast a sitcom about Hitler, even though we had the show about Lincoln's slave The Secret Diary by Desmond Pfeiffer. You'll probably never see this show because it only aired one episode and probably will never be released on DVD.
