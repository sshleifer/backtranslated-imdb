This is a worn-out story about a man who marries to escape the hangman's noose and then "tames" his reluctant bride. He manages to be sexist and racist at the same time. For example, we never know why a woman who has earned the respect of an Indian warrior is unable to defend herself against her former husband. Or why the members of her team are so anxious to get a "real man" in the saddle, if she has obviously done everything alone. That only made sense in Hollywood in the fifties. <br /> <br /> There is a really stupid scene in which she whips him and he actually gets the whip - the second time - and then rips her off the horse. Anyway, the first time he would probably have lost an eye, which would make it very hard to grab that whip! Then he defeats an Indian bodyguard, burning the first two-thirds of it to be beaten to pulp. That's a second wind. Later, he negotiates successfully with some bloodthirsty Indians (since they are all in this streak) after they have rejected her, now she is his "squaw." No matter that he has no diplomatic skills and has been negotiating with them for years. And the way he keeps refusing her attempts to seduce him, just to keep her awake and keep her from holding him - yes, right. As if the women were simply throwing at him all the way. <br /> <br /> After all, neither of the two roles is convincing in their roles. Madison is just an idiot who has unrealistic luck. Fleming throws her hair on her forehead and frowns, but as a fiery tomboy she is absolutely unconvincing. The only reason you came for them is because you want to tie Madison to a runaway horse and pull him over a cliff before the end of the movie. The way Madison Fleming tames is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will completely irritate you to see women as anything but inflatable dolls. Even if you see them as dolls, you are bored with the total lack of tension. <br /> <br /> Total waste of time. Even the scenery is a bit boring. Give this a big miss.
