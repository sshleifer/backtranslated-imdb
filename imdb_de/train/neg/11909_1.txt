I think I found the most misogynistic movie of all time: Darklight. The heart of the film - Lilith was Adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the Garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam and refused to submit to him. I took these words directly from the script. Then the movie goes on and even though she is the heroine of the movie, it only becomes acceptable if she does what the men tell her! She finishes the movie under the control of The Faith - a purely male group! <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the script was predictable and the effects were terrible. Apart from the obvious hatred of women, which is usually much more subtle in modern film, Darklight was not original.
