There's laughter in this movie, that's for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and he used to be funny (before he came to the conclusion that he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me so much about this movie is how unlikely virtually all the characters are. Apart from the two main lines, everyone is an idiot. I mean, these losers in the small town are about as unobtrusive as you can. You just have to look and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. In addition, the American factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob. I wondered if this movie was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh yes, in the end they all come together, but I did not enjoy the trip to get there.
