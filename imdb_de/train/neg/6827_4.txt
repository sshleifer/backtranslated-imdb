Stupid is so stupid in this thoroughly uninteresting, supposedly black comedy. What essentially begins with Chris Klein's attempt to remain inconspicuous eventually turns into an uninspired version of "The Three Amigos," but without laughter. For black comedy to work, it must be outrageous that "play dead" is not. For black comedy to work, it can not be mean what "play dead" is. What "Play Dead" really is is a city full of nut jobs. Fred Dunst, however, makes a fairly fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from "A Simple Plan," while Jake Busey is a pretty fair imitation of, yes, Jake Busey. - MERK
