A teenager gets a bad day, goes out to a hill and falls into where he can not escape. Then he meets MR. ATLAS, a "mythological" buddy of 2000 years ago as his best friend, and an Arnold Schwarzenegger look-and-sound-like. His Herculean power helps the boy out of danger and later adapts to modern life. So what's the big deal? This is the lousiest idea for a family outing! Either way, you should not have tried this attempt! Our fictional character of power and strength is nothing more than a typical stranger who usually appears to the rest of the universe. Blasphemy is compounded by the lack of novelty or attraction, and before you know it, there is an attempt by force that does not qualify this as "family entertainment." The scene in which Atlas complains about his underpants, however, is confusing. For a change, just spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park.
