The script was VERY weak with enough arcs to help you take care of the characters or what happens to them. The script is way too talkative and not enough gore or action to even call it slow. The story comes to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as fast as possible so you do not have to hear them talking that very muted, stiff dialogue. Technically speaking, the music mix is ​​too high and makes it difficult to understand what is usually said. On the other hand, that could be called a blessing. Overall, the same story could have been better told in a short movie with a running time of less than 30 minutes. The obvious homage to Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" would have been good if they had been more subtle, but here they look more like a bald-headed rip-off. Come on, that kind of 35mm budget and THIS is the best thing you could do. Nevertheless, film, lighting design and recordings were very well done.
