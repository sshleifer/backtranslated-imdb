This film, originally released at Christmas 1940, was long thought lost. A very bad copy has reappeared and has been turned into a CD for sale now. Do not buy it! The movie is incredibly awful. The casting is bad, the script is terrible and the director is terrible. Picture Roland Young sings and dances. And that was the highlight. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie was deliberately lost.
