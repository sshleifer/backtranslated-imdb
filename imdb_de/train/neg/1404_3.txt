Arthur Askey's great artistry as a comic was the way he communicated with his audience. His youthful jokes, stupid songs, and stupid dances were well received as he engaged folk and pulled him off the wall. The lack of a live audience was a clear disadvantage for him, and he never felt completely comfortable in movies. He has his moments in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, was tailor-made to make the most of his talents, but Askey, the performer, had to be seen to be appreciated. The film is not strong, it contains the regular co-star Richard Murdoch. Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as stupid honeymooners; Linden Travers excelled as a "madwoman". Also on board are Peter Murray-Hill, who married Phyllis Calvert as the nominal lead actor, who read the game completely bland, and lead actress Carol Lynne, who delivered an equally blunt performance. It's up to the actress Kathleen Harrison to effortlessly steal the movie as a parrot-loving single woman, dr. Morland Graham's brandy is smashed.
