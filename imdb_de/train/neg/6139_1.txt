I'm grateful to G_d for being bombarded, or we could be pampered with such delicacies as "Skate Fu", where we see Brian Boitano playing a triple Lutz and banging villains with his razor-sharp skates, but I digress. One thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little T & A from Ms. Agbayani. It's not as if the world has seen something new (at least the part of the world in which its Playboy spread). I strongly believe that pornography would have suited their talents much better, though Aubrey Hepburn would not have stayed afloat that sewer. One explanation for Kurt Thomas' presence could be a traumatic brain injury that may occur too often on a drop-off. It is a good thing that the IOC was not as diligent in doping as it is now, or Kurt would have been deprived of his medals. To avoid at all costs.
