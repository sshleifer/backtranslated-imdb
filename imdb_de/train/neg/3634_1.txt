A boring childrens fantasy that allows Joan Plowright to settle the stars but has little to do. Cute kids pursue their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player (yuk) while best friend Hazel is running for mayor - she's 13! All in all, a pedestrian, plus the disadvantage that both the girls and the baseball guys perform syrupy services. Certainly less effort for showtime - no limits?
