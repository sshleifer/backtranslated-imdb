To the small minority that is seen here, this movie praises GET SERIOUS. I know it's up to people's personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a few brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish. It does not deserve to be part of this franchise so bad. I can only assume that those who say that this is great are friends with someone in the film and try to give their careers a boost. Poor in every way, do not frustrate people by saying something else. Storyline is a weak reissue of the previous entries, script as well. Attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead (WOW!) Do not hide the filmmaker's lack of ideas, and there is a complete lack of fear. Absolutely no redeeming qualities, total shit. I once gave that pair of chancers a right to get someone to finance that piece of crap. You must have worked harder than actually making the movie. Shame.
