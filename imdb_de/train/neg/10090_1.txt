This movie is a joke. I mean a "ha ha" funny joke. Why? Because the only redeeming thing was the good laugh I got over the sheer ridiculousness of a nonsensical, inhuman conspiracy and terrible acting. Wow! <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions in this film ... for example; Why are these women becoming zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are zombies "janitors", and what are they for? Since when do 6 people make a "nation" of zombies? And is black black mascara "scary" for everyone? Even a 2-year-old? <br /> <br /> And last but not least; Why was this movie ever made? Why? Why? Why? No Answer? I thought that. <br /> <br /> At the demand station, they made this comment after the film summary: We apologize in advance for this movie "LOL".
