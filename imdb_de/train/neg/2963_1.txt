Since I visited this website and voted for movies, I have never rated a movie with 1. Even the disquieting "Dance! Workout with Barbie" received a 2nd. That has a reason. <br /> <Every time I see what I think is a really bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: "Is this movie really as bad as the terrible, soul-sucking beast" Theodore Rex "?" And I have never been able to answer yes. <br /> <br /> I would do anything within the reason to know what the ridicule said: "Hey! Let's make 'Blade Runner' new with Barney in the Harrison Ford Role!" and decided that it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to fix it for the movie. Also, I'd like to know what hell market they would sell if the video did not go straight. This is the rare monster: a movie that's far too violent for children and too stupid for adults. I would ask, "What did you think?" But in that case, it might actually be superfluous. <br /> <br /> All you need to know is that you should only face this monstrosity if you are one of the five or six rabid fans of Howard the Duck, or if you are curious, the worst Insane movie of all time to see or REALLY want to punish yourself.
