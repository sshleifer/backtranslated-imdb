This strip was a hit for me. I think little girls should not be more than swimsuit models, homeless or mistresses, because that seems to be everything that they are going to portray anyway. It is really sad to see that an artist's work and life are so unfairly interpreted. Unbelievable (or perhaps one might expect), Artemisia's entire figure and everything she stands for had been reduced to a normal Hollywood female figure; a wretched, physically flawless, helpless little creature that has none of the characteristics that they actually found in that place in history that was mutilated here. However, it was sadder to see that a large part of the audience in the area was too poorly trained to understand the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and the reality. To love the artist as someone in love with her real rapist, whom she actually accuses of raping her under torture, it just pisses me off. If the director could not have said anything more substantial, she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person.
