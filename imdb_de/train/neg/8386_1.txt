Tearing apart this movie is like fishing fish. It's too easy. I urge you to acknowledge the positive aspects of Little Man. First of all, I am impressed by the special effects. It really looked like Marlon Wayan's head was stuck to the body of a small human. I never doubted for a minute. Second, I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer and his interpretations of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who happened to play Grier's father in the boomerang in 1992 (if you remember, "coordinated" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket), now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. That was fun. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie is as believable as White Chicks. How stupid is it, when not even the doctor can see that it is a 40-year-old man and not a baby? He has full teeth !!! How is it possible that nobody seems to realize that it is not a baby? Little Man is so bad that there is a cameo by Rob Schneider. And please, if you are stupid to waste $ 8 on this movie, at least do me a favor and bring NO children. This movie is far too sexual for young children (lots of jokes and allusions to sex, going out, eating, etc.) and I felt embarrassed for the parents bringing their children to the shows I had to endure. If you insist on seeing an idiotic film, you must at least spare your children the pain and suffering.
