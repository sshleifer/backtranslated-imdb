I wish I could say that this show was unusual in its banality, but it is common in every way. She has the stupid husband, his wiser, but boring and conventional wife, along with the idiotic buddy for the "weird" relief he desperately needs. Stale predictable jokes, with even more predictable responses from the nightmare, underline the disgustingly unimaginative imagination of this harmful mental narcotic, either to make me physically ill or, in a deep sleep, more like an induced coma. But it may take a while for the average American to have a personality that he can truly identify with. A "normal" guy, just like you and me. I live in the southern USA, so for me this show is just the opposite of escapism. This disgusting character is everywhere here, in some form. If you see him on TV, he's brutal overkill.
