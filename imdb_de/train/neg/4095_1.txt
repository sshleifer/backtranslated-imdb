Today Bea Arthur died, so I drove around the IMDb website and somehow got into a show called "Gloria". "All in the Family" was a brilliant show for the first four or five years and I bet I've watched every episode more than once. I swear, however, that I did NOT know that a show called "Gloria" existed. That may be a good thing. Maybe it means that I had a life as a young adult, rather than watching TV. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is pathetic that the "All In The Family" franchise has deteriorated so much that it has produced a child-like show that I've never heard of - and one that has never been heard of was rated very badly by previous reviewers. <br /> <br /> I rated the show at 1 for two reasons - the system did not allow me registration and voting writers and TV executives should be convicted for having started a broadcast that has no business in the air and smeared the memory of one of the greatest programs in television history. Shalom, ZWrite
