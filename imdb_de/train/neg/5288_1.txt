My God, was that the "seduction, Lola, seduction" -making the persuasion? It was terrible. Bad enough that the "scriptwriter" (and I use the term very loosely) cut and pasted dialogues from one figure to another, often out of context and tearing the story: Anne Elliott ran from place to place to Wentworth to pursue towards the end of the piece was an abomination! Austen has to turn in her grave. No handsome young woman would have acted so cruelly. And the actress who played Mary? Horror Needless to say, if the rest of the Austen remakes are so bad, they'll shut down a new generation of guards. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a flawless version of this (otherwise) wonderful novel, get the 1995 staged by Roger Michell version with Amanda Root (whose expression can only speak volumes) and Ciaran Hinds. It is great.
