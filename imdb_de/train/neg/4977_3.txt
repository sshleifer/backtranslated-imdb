This is a television set and a rather unnecessary successor to the Beowulf story science-fiction channel, especially after the recently released 2005 Beowulf and Grendel movie. This film does not really intervene in Beowulf's story, it just guides us through his fight against the wild beast known as Grendel, as he leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil, while the mighty Viking warrior Beowulf is called upon to liberate her from this monster killing spree If successful, the king must have the children no longer sacrifice to keep him at bay. After a few unsuccessful attempts, the creature is killed, but the angry and vengeful mother soon attacks, leaving Beowulf to restore her powerful bravery and strength. "Grendel" looks like he was shot on a small budget and the CG effects are terrible. As I said, this movie is absolutely unnecessary.
