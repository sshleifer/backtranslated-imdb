This is not really a post, as I have not seen most of the movie. I stopped looking at it. The movie is very violent, with nasty drug dealers and street punks, but that's why I did not stop. <br /> <br /> Here was the problem: I've just seen enough to meet several characters were not interesting Everyone was a boring, despicable psychopath who had no dedicated personalities and gave me nothing to look forward to. I was not in the least curious about what they would do next or what could happen to them. If there had ever been only one person of interest, and I do not mean good or nice person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with it. Take a look at "State of Grace" to see what I mean. In this movie, the Gary Oldman character is totally crazy, but he is very interesting. Al Pacino might have done a good job in Scarface, but his character just did not bother me.
