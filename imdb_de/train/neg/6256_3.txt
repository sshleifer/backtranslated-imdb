Hmm ?? I agree with the reviewer, who said that "strange people with generous tastes have reviewed this film". I found the movie intriguing enough to watch. I think that was mainly due to Marsden and Speedman - not the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> On the bottom line, this film is slightly psychologically tempting and deeply homophobic. Thumbs up at first and threefold thumbs down on the latter. I am not sure if the film should promote dialogue or spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was mediocre. A lot of conversations that deviated from reality by about 90 degrees. I always wanted to make sense of the plot, but in the end it's just a chat with a madman (Speedman). I am sorry for him (Speedman) for his loss, but not really. His loss is no greater and certainly less than the loss suffered by more important causes around the world every day. <br /> <br /> Will the film be naive about HIV / AIDS? Yes: that of the intended target group. Is HIV a dark, mysterious, evil killer? What about the victims? The answer to both questions is NO. Neither HIV nor its victims have more or less malignant intentions than lupus, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, cancer, or their victims, FOR GOD'S SAKE. Just because a disease is transferable, it is neither intentional nor negligent - or evil - it is just like that. <br /> <br /> Does this excuse ignorance or folly? - NO. Should all people be safe sex? - YES. Will safe sex save the world? - NO. Is safe sex realistic in all cases of love and lust between passionate and emotional people? ?? OF COURSE NOT. In what kind of world would we live if everyone followed the rules, nobody ever took any risks and sex was never spontaneous and passionate? Do I ignore that the film is specifically about gay sex? ?? YES. HIV is spread by sharing blood or body fluids between infected and uninfected individuals. Sex is not necessary for transmission, gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am always disturbed by willful violence of one person to another person. I actually thought that the film was a good illustration of the absurdity of Tom's violent kidnapping, captivity, and intentions toward Dan, and this kind of crazy violence occurs every day. Stream of Consciousness The Movie: Tom is crazy. <br /> <br /> Why does not Dan ask "why" do you feel that way and not "what are you doing"? Conclusion: Men who have sex with men get "AIDS". Conclusion: HIV = AIDS Where was Tom's responsibility in the Sex Act? Why was Dan responsible for using the condom? "Maybe you took it off before you put it in?" What are we talking about here? Was one of the parties unconscious? "Maybe she did not want to hear the truth." Are you kidding me? "She is in heaven and so incredibly injured, what she now knows about me"? Is Dan's life over when he has HIV? Certainly not! Is that why the whole world is so homophobic? You believe that gay men are the cause of HIV, that they will give it to the rest of the world, and we will all die? are you kidding me??? Are people really stupid enough to believe that homosexuality is the cause ... is that the problem ??? Do we feel that way among the victims of tuberculosis? of malaria? I can see that Tom is hurt because of his wife's death and he blames AIDS but seriously? Who is to blame? The victim or the virus? Are diseases really the responsibility of the sick? (Assuming they did not search and did not try to spread the disease). Safe sex is essential for a safe life, but not driving, not flying, not leaving home, not living Do we really want to accuse the disease of the victims? Would safe sex between Tom and Dan have prevented Tom's ultimate demise? Maybe, but not the sole responsibility of Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom is crazy. Did I mention that? <br /> <br /> Tom to Dan: "Maybe you get what you deserve"? COME ON! 24 days: Violent, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> Am I overreacting? Perhaps. However, I think this film points the way to gay men for their reckless and malicious intent toward a "straight world" by practicing unsafe sex, when the rate at which homosexuals practice safer sex is proportionate to that of heterosexuals equivalent. We all need to wake up and take HIV / AIDS seriously. HIV kills hundreds of thousands of STRAIGHT Africans every year.
