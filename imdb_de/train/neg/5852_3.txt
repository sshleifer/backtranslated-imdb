Bradford Dillman plays a scientist who awakes one morning in the midst of a bloody crime scene. With partial amnesia (or "global amnesia" that a person calls optional memory loss), the scientist finds a private detective in the phone book, hoping to reassemble his life. Abominable brew is loosely based on Walter Ericson's book "Fallen Angel" (filmed in 1965 as "Mirage" with Gregory Peck). It was probably too racy for television - which was added to drugs and hippies - that NBC initially refused to air, and so it came about that this low-budget hit came to the cinemas. Director James Goldstone goes crazy with the hyperkinetic visuals and camera tricks as the editor pervades Edward A. Biery with the zig-zag cuts. Unfortunately, their admittedly colorful gimmicks can not mask the weaknesses of this updated storyline, and acting is extremely mature. Under pressure to recall the events of the night, Dillman undergoes an Actors seminar with tics, tramps, wipes and crazy half-poodles as he spits out dialogues like "Dream ... a dream ... drug". yes, drugs ... this SOUND ... bells ... help! "As a malignant scientist with a smile from the Cheshire Cat, Pat Hingle nearly storms Dillman in the Grand Thespian department, constantly talking to everyone in baby talk, stumbling around like a middle-aged peacock and turning his mouth agony." Hope Long's Scientist / Love Interest gets the pull, but not before she screams at Dillman, the indifferent lover, "What do I have to do, Ape Man? I want you! "This is a wild" puzzle "! * 1/2 of ****
