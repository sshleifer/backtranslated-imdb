Never before has a movie forced me to write a review, but that was just the goal. I did not want to find out what this movie was about, which made Snoop choose it as his first serious role, but honestly, it was a bad choice to make a good book, but it certainly did not work for me as a movie. I thought it was unbelievable, lacking in atmosphere and I found many scenes staggeringly stilted. As a musical maestro, he may just be a serious actor who does not act By Dylan Mcdermott, and Rose Byrne was passable, but not enough to carry a faint plan with weak dialogues. Maybe I just missed the point completely, but for me he did not fit into any genre, he did not create empathy with the characters or cause tension. I actually prayed for the end and deeply disturbed my desire to beat all three main characters!
