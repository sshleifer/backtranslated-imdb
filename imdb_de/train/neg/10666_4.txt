I'm a big movie fan of the thirties and will be watching most of what I see on Turner Classic Movies for me. So I tried, after all, it's the great Harold Lloyd who competes with Chaplin as a great silent comedian. I've seen much less of Lloyd's silent films than Chaplin's, but I have to say that I'm a much bigger Chaplin fanatic. Anyway, this film was so flat for me that I did not finish it. I can understand why his solid career was so limited that he did not get very good material to work with. After seeing Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Siblings, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy boxing parodies (or violence in general), this one is very memorable. I was also interested in seeing Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory, but his role here has not really helped me either. Maybe they should have come into boxing earlier, because at least half of the movie (at least it seemed to be that way) before coming in the ring. I can say that there are many Lloyd fans here, and this will not be a popular review, but I have to rate this in comparison to what else was there at the time (4 out of 10). Do not watch this with someone you like old movies, because they may not look at you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really likes this or is looking for lesser-known comedies, I recommend "Kelly The Second," made a few years earlier; another nobody will be a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and a sidecar Charles Chase. Both were shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
