I give this movie a ONE, because it's really a horrible movie. The soundtrack of the DVD is so bad that it actually hurts my ear. But the vision, as disjointed as it is, shows something very fancy in Italian society. I'm not going to go into details, which was really so shocking, but the various incidents are absolutely unusual. I give him one for the kink value. Otherwise, the adult actor's video, photography, and acting are simply inferior, a practical step for people who love foreign films but exaggerated to the point where it's unbelievable. The kids in the movie are mostly 3/4 years old and they are real and the movie gives an insight into Italian life.
