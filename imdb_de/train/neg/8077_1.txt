I saw this movie a long time ago ... luckily it was free. I have to be one of maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. I can not remember a lot, but I remember that I was incredibly bored. The plot made no sense, and when I came out of the theater, all I could say was that I've ever seen the worst movie ever. I was just disturbed by one thing: if they can reach the temperature, if they are approaching the sun to survive, why can not they shut down to a comfortable temperature instead of being very hot and sweaty? How stupid do you think we are?
