Oh dear God. I bought this movie and ... I ... saw ... the ... whole ... , , Okay, it'll be fine ... I know I'll be fine in a month or two. Some time later, I hope to get rid of the flashbacks. I wanted to eat something after the movie, but I just do not seem to have the guts to try something to eat. Bad? Yes bad. Very bad. BATH BATH BATH BATH BATH. Wait, it seems bad that the message is not conveyed in the right way. Hmm ... There is no word to describe how awful ... not horrible ... Hmm disgustingly terrible / played / filmed / directed / written. Now I do not know what to do, but throw it out. You may burn it. I do not want it to end in a thousand years at the end of an architectural excavation. The worst movie since "Hey Happy"
