This is a weak sequel: There is no interest and light touch of the great "Man Called Horse" in almost all aspects, and by comparison, they hardly seem to be the same genre. <br /> <br /> The Return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke various Indian ceremonies, but seems too much to try to overcome the magic of the first. In this film, the tribe is lost and abandoned, it has lost its home, modern life has invaded Paradise and they live in bitter misery and poverty. Maybe this is the point: the first film brought us to a place we wanted to be, an easier time. This leads us to broken Indians in a miserable world and the White Man is the hero and savior who rather negates the whole idea of ​​the movie. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first lay in the fact that the White Man learned and discovered that real civilization is more in value than in Western materialism. In the second movie, all this is missing and we get a weak movie. <br /> <br /> A huge disappointment.
