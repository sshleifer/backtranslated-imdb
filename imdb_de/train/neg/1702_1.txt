Let's face it, the only reason someone bought this, the only reason someone checked it, and the only reason anyone could claim to enjoy it is because David Lynch did it and because You want to have children of David Lynch. But guess what? Even David Lynch can produce a piece of manure. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lynch wanted you to overcome normality and perceive absurdity as a pure subject of knowledge. Perhaps the cruel, cacophonistic sounds and chicken-scratch visualizations should imply something about the place of humanity in the world, about our relationship to the real, about the absurdity of the whole. Instead, just one thing says to me: I just lost $ 20. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to be offensive for offensive reasons, I could get Hansen into full swing and bleed my ears. If I wanted to be absurd for absurd reasons, I could just dump on a plate and watch for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is one single quality that Dumbland can redeem - it's meta, meta funny. That means it's so bad it's not even funny because it's so bad. This fact is a bit strange. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, then buy Dumbland. If not, save yourself the agony.
