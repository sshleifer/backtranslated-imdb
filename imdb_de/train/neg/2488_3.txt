What an incomprehensible mess of a movie. Something about a policeman who pulls off bullets after being shot and holds them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and the size of the jar has shot him about fifty times) and a top-secret tank of five or so Six are guarded unable soldiers who drive it for some reason to Mexico. Whether they were sent there on purpose or really lost is never made clear. You'll never hear another script with the word "butthorn". Gary Busey tries out the Mel Gibson role of "Lethal Weapon," and while Busey is a viable actor, the script condemns the entire movie to mediocrity. William Smith makes another round as a Russian soldier, the same figure he played in "Red Dawn" a few years ago. After playing most of the 70s biker-heaven, it was somehow nice to see him increasing his reach with the communist heavies. Sadly, he'll probably always be best remembered when the guy whom Clint Eastwood introduced in "Every Which Way You Can".
