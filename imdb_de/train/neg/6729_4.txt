Obviously, a lot of people really like that, but I found it infantilizing and somewhat offensive code swap, which was saved from oblivion before Jane Jane and some memorable musical numbers, especially the opener (but later a significant slump in the invention). I do not get along with Monroe - she's supposed to play a stupid blonde who's not that stupid, but she just seems stupid. Russell is not convincing when she says she's never been to a gym, but otherwise she's rather wonderful. The men are surprisingly uninteresting, as well as the conspiracy. Not cruel in any way, but so inconsistent that God helps us all if this is a classic.
