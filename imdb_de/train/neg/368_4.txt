This movie is really stupid! I saw it as an 11-year-old, and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous! I would recommend this movie only to children under 12 years old. I was really not interested in it, but I think he answered some very good questions that kids should pay attention to, such as: 1) Buying money Lucky? 2) Should I (about my parents) lie about things that I think they would not approve of? 3) Does the money buy friendships? 4) Is money everything? 5) Should not I tell my parents if someone tries to hurt me? Granted, these are very unrealistic situations, but I think if parents discuss these issues with their children, they may want to watch this video to show their children that lying can be a risk of injury.
