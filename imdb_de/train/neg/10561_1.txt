I saw this movie in its own time, when an illegitimate baby not only ruined your life, but stamped your child as a bastard. These days of "single moms" may be very far-fetched, but it was very true. And I'm not crazy about laughing at someone who stutters. Between these two problems, I had difficulty finding this movie funny. At that time, I did not know who had run it or what his reputation was. I knew who Betty Hutton was and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic. I loved "Bringing Up Baby", but I find this movie embarrassing. I'm sure the strike was probably a sting at some church events, but I was the one who needed a drink after watching it again. The idea that the girl would have to be drunk to "marry" and get pregnant also added to the misery. Under these circumstances, an entire city might be against you, so the result of this movie is really the fun part. Of course, shoot me, I do not like "It's a wonderful life".
