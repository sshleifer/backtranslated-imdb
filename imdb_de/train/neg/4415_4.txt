I have always said that some pieces simply can not be translated into a movie by nature, and this is a prime example. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny farce satire of the Catholic Church, with a razor joke and a central figure that is so shockingly unreal we must root for it, even if it starts to worship its parishioners too (one of them made the deadly mistake of admitting that he had not sinned since his last confession, so she feels she sends him straight to heaven.) <br /> <br /> That's just one example of how It works well outside of reality, and it works in the world the theater believes in. However, this type of augmented reality rarely works in the film, and certainly this is not the case here. <br /> <br / > The director Marshall Brickman has put together a good cast that does a great job, but presents this absurdity in a realistic fashion. The comedy becomes a tragedy and you have a hollow feeling in the pit of your stomach. <br /> <b If instead you are looking for a staging of the play, you will not be disappointed.
