Let's be honest; a lame boy who dies and puts his soul into a scarecrow. That will not happen, Neva! OMFG This stupid loser child, who can not stand up for himself, is handed over to him by a drunken bastard who has a crush on his mother. Right, when he dies, he looks up at the scarecrow and lets his ghost go into the scarecrow. The drunk hushed up his death by making him suicidal and thought he had gotten away with it. Later we see that he is thrown out of the caravan and later deserves another encounter with the scarecrow. They had a brief encounter in which the drunk called him a loser and the scarecrow with "take a loser!" The scarecrow jumps away from the building, calls him "Papa-o" and beheads the poor man. We can see how this great movie evolves. After that he kills many people. He mainly kills the people who have given him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random assholes, just for a few laughs. No, laugh here. He also adds a punch line to every kill. Every time he killed someone, he made a few karate flips and finished with one of his signature punch lines. In the case of someone who was hard of hearing, he would say, "Here, have an ear of corn!" then push it in her ass. OR we can actually take an example from the movie! He has just killed a cop and is about to kill the only person who has ever stood up for him. Her father, the sheriff, called to the madman to stop, and he said, "Hey, stay awhile!" and threw a dagger, threw his chest and stuck it to a tree. At the end of the movie, he killed two guys and threw the punch line "Gotta split!" and killed two guys by putting a scythe in their heads. Wowzors, this movie got me to cream my pants so badly. Maybe the guy will not be gay the next time he makes a movie.
