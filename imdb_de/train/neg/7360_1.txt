This is one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. This is mainly because of the implausible facts (such as an obvious agent pretending to be a bank credit officer, making it clear that he is talking to someone through a cable or the scene in which scientists assume that it is safe is to enter a room in which a doctor) virus was released, although "it has not found a viable host" does not mean that it will never find one), the cheap sets (the bank looks as if it was poorly built to resemble a dungeon), and the bad acting. It is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the deadly virus. The chief honcho, who decides to remove her from a safe deposit box, does so at the same time a bank robbery breaks in. At the same time, FBI agents were informed, and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts. It is needless to say that the consequences of the earthquake are messy in several ways. The results, however, are not for a tempting action movie, but for a movie that was obviously Z grade garbage right from the start. (So ​​maybe some of the screenshots on the packaging may seem to be made with computer graphics rather than actual screenshots from different sequences of the movie). What the hell Ron Perlman was doing, I have no idea. I wonder if he was so embarrassed about being in what I saw.
