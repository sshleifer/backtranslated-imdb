I am sorry to report that I have seen this movie several times. When it bombed the box office, it was repeated at HBO every night for about a month. And I've seen it over and over because television is generally so bad - or was it back then. I'm not watching anymore, so it may be wonderful now - as Samuel L. Jackson says about pigs: "It may taste like sweet potato pie, but I'll never know because I would not eat the dirty meat." Just take a look. Dudley plays Arthur in the desert, always a few steps behind Moses. It came right out to Life of Bryan so you can guess where the inspiration came from. The few slightly funny parts take way too long until you just close your eyes and clench your teeth. There is a scene in which Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert, both pulled out and dried and thirsty. Then they meet like old acquaintances who did not know each other well and promise to have lunch. It could have been funny. <br /> <br /> But the scene that I remember best is a meeting with the pharaoh, in which the pharaoh is a black street kid, finished in full king tut staging. He must have just read the lines, because sometime before the release, they had flooded his scene with the Hollywood equivalent of a black street noun spoken by a Jimmy Walker wannabe (Kid Dyno Wannabe). Or it could have been Jimmy Walker - who knows? Who cares. They have managed to turn a basically boring scene into a very racist, very listless, very long excrement. This is one of the legendary things that does not blush, no matter how many times you try, so treat it to someone else. <br /> <br /> Well, that's my rating. If you rent this movie (DO NOT BUY WHAT YOU DO!), Prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six-pack of corona. Now they have redone the Poseidean adventure, with remakes you're probably on top of the list. Maybe this time they will hire a comedy writer.
