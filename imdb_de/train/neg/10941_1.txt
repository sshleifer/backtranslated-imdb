WOW, what should I say. I like Shity movies and I watch an awesome action movie, but Snake Eater would rather drive a nail into my piss hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance. This guy has as much acting skills as Bill Clinton self-control. It has all the goods to make a really bad movie worse. Crazy Hillbilles YEP! unnecessary tits shot (with a real weird scar) YEP! shitty soundtrack YEP! I wish I could give the movie -10 stars, but one is as low as he goes. Seriously, I think someone played a joke on me when I saw that it can not be real. The worst part is that there are more than just SNAKE EATER MOVIES.
