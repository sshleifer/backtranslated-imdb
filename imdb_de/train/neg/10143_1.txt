FLIGHT OF FURY takes the coat to be the VERY SWORDiest Steven Seagal movie I've ever seen ... So far. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible bore with no action-scenes of interest, Seagal does not. I'm really trying - he's fat and his voice is being re-dubbed. <br /> <br /> The co-stars do not make it any better because they are a rather unfortunate burden from a third party. <br /> <br /> The Direction of Keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he is also responsible for a few other Seagal stinkers (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE). The script co-written by Seagal himself is ridiculously inappropriate. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb $ 12M was spent on boring burden of the old Tosh - If these numbers are correct, I feel a large tax violin, since not nearly this amount was spent. <br /> <br /> FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot for a remake of the Michael Dudikoff band BLACK THUNDER - which must be better than this threesome. <br /> <br /> This has NO redeeming qualities. Give yourself a MISS! 1/2 * from *****
