Never pour models and playboy bunnies in your movies! Bob Fosse's "Star 80" about Dorothy Stratten, who was so obsessed with Bogdanovich that he married her SISTER after her husband's murder, is a million times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is not an actress either. I expected to see a lost masterpiece like Orson Welles, but instead Audrey Hepburn worked in jeans and a godly "Poodlesque" hairstyle. I was always able to watch "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show". I could barely get through this clunker. This film was allegedly not released because Bratten were surrounded by the severe death of Mrs. Stratten; I think the real reason was that it was so bad!
