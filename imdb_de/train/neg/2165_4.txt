This movie was a pretty strange experience. The film is obviously based on a play. Now I'm sure everything in this movie works well in one piece, but in a movie, it does not feel terribly interesting to watch it. The movie is too "stagey" and they did not even bother to change some of the dialogues to make it suitable for a movie. Instead, the stage play is almost literally re-shot, with towering characters and staged dialogue. For this reason, the plot really does not work and the film becomes an almost completely boring and outdated viewer experience. <br /> <br /> It takes a while to figure out that watching this is a comedy. At first you think it's a drama you're watching, with bizarre characters in it, but as you go through the movie, you'll find that the movie is more of a tragicomedy that focuses on the comedy genre rather than the drama genre refers. <br /> <br /> The characters and dialogue are really the things that make this movie a quirky and exaggerated one that sometimes gets truly unsurpassable. Sure, the actors are great. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but they do not really raise the film to a level that can be considered "sufficient". <br /> <br /> The story feels totally disoriented. Basically, the story is nothing and focuses mainly on the siblings of Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what is history about? The film feels like a senseless and outdated film that has very little to offer. As I said; I'm sure the story is good and interesting to see on stage, but as a movie that really does not fit and just does not work. <br /> <br /> Editing is just horrible and it gets ridiculously bad in certain sequences. <br /> <br /> More was to be expected from director J. Lee Thompson, who obviously made far better films than this rather failed, staged play on projection screen. <br /> <br /> Really not worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
