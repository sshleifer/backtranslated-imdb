"Sleeping With the Enemy" is a predictable thriller that "was there before" that never seems to find inspiration, no matter how desperate the cast and crew try. I can not believe that some friends persuaded me to watch this in the movies about sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> The complete lack of originality from the Ronald Bass screenplay (based on the novel by Nancy Price) does not help, not even the obsolete direction of Joseph Ruben or the very average performance of Julia Roberts. The supporting actors like Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson help little. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say. Just do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
