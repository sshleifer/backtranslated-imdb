This movie had a pretty good-sounding storyline, but the insertion was very slow ... very slow. Even though someone thinks that this is a cult classic, I think there are much better movies from that time that you can watch. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is not excellent, but not the worst. The sounds are ok. lighting OK. <br /> <br /> I would still not recommend it to anyone, maybe a movie student. <br /> <br /> The movie does not contain music and the horses have sex. It does not do it well either. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was just stupid. <br /> <br /> No profits here, let this total boredom out. I've seen worse, believe me, but that's just a waste of time and I do not get the good reviews here. especially the high ratings ...
