I expected a bad movie and got a bad movie. But in my worst imagination, I could not imagine how bad this movie was. I do not even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is all about. It's not about bloodsurfing, but about a big crocodile. They complain about the wrong shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and showed the shark only at the end. Here the crocodile is often shown, and it is the worst false crocodile I have ever seen, and they do not try to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile, look at Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a decent surf / shark movie, but he had to make a bad B-Monster movie. He had the chance to make an original Surffilm, but wanted to make a monster movie. You understood how bad this movie is, does it have good parts? Not really, it has some nudity and a sex scene taken directly from a Playboy movie. Acting is not bad either and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad she does not take off her top. The main actors are not bad either. They had some potential. The location was beautiful and the movie started well with some surfing scenes. The guilt is the untalented writer and director. The dialogue is one of the worst I've ever seen, and the script is really poorly written, and the director has no talent at all and no imagination. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it. Even if you want to see the beautiful Kate Fischer. It is not worth. Look at Sirens to see Kate naked, and look at Lake Placid for good crocodile action. <br/> 3/10 because I'm in a good mood and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked and Kate looks good (but she's a bad actress) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi have the piece they had to work with good job.
