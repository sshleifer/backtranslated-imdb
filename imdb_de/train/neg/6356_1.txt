If I accidentally tripped over this script in text form, I would read it and maybe laugh. However, I would not laugh at the places where the director wants to make me laugh. Although I'm still not sure where they are. I do not care if this is Woody Allen, this writer can not write dialogues, or at least he can not knowingly write dialogues and then draw performances by actors who are capable of laughter even the most ticklish clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrase) "I'm an art historian, I'm looking for a job in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> OK, so the fact, but honestly, do you know of art historians who would say that? How would you answer? <br /> <br /> "Really, an art gallery, who would have thought that?" <br /> <br /> The whole script is littered with a kind of shabby quasi-intellectualism that I did not expect from such a respected drawing writer. I admit that I have no knowledge of Allen's other work, and judging that, I do not want to start learning. The characters are invariably despicable, an attempt to show that we all suffer from the human condition? Or really bad character writing? You decide.
