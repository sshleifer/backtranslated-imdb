I had a video of the matter. And I think it was my fourth attempt to watch the movie without falling asleep. It's moving slowly, and the idea of ​​a Mid-Atlantic platform, which may have been revolutionary at the time, is now just a big ripoff. Apart from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast is pretty much forgotten, and only in the end do things get really interesting. It even woke me once when the water started to run big. <br /> <br /> But blame the man. No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He does not wed it between forefinger and middle finger like the mortals. He holds it in his fingers and shows us the old pearly brown. There are some scenes in this film where the smoke drifts into the sky against a dark background and looks very artistic. However, it does not say much about this movie if you only impress tobacco smoke.
