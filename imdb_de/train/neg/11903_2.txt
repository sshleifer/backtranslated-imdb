Wenders was great with a million dollar hotel. I do not know how he came to this movie! The idea of ​​communicating the situation after Sept. 11 and the perspective of the American Society is hopeful, making it 2 out of 10. But that's not a movie. Is the best that anyone can do with a great idea (West-East conflict)? There are important things in the Middle East and it's just being spent on the screen of a MAC * with the fingers of an American girl who is actually at the level of stupidity (because she just does not know the facts). The characters are not well formed. And most importantly, the idea that is given with religion is kind of funny to me. In the final scene, Lana says, let's just be quiet and try to listen. And the background music says "... I'll pray". It's not really about religion. But it ends with it. As you will see the truth, just close your eyes and pray. The lights are already on the truth. It's just that nobody wants to see it. ps: "My home is not a place, it's people". The only thing that gives 10 out of 10 points is this sentence. But it is wasted behind this movie. (Incidentally, as "someone" mentioned below, America's finest young men are not the best, they are just the "poor" and "hopeless") who sign up for the army, which needs a good paycheck, not from the US Government is provided! )
