Now and then comes a movie so horrible that I feel compelled to warn people. If I work all my days and save only one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy. <br /> <br /> Where do I start my pain discussion? For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Every character was a clich√©. We had a fugitive guy, a fat guy eating donuts, a dumb stranger, etc. The script felt like it was being written when the movie was shot. The production value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was watching a junior high video presentation. Have the directors, producers, etc. ever seen a movie before? Halestorm gets worse and worse with every new entry. The concept for this movie sounded so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of legitimate actors? But believe me, when I say that, things went wrong, VERY WRONG.
