I do not have the longest attention span, but this is the second movie I did not see until the end, and I even bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that the director made a big joke, so I was always waiting for a solution, something to laugh about, something to protect my interest, but that decision never came. Rather, the writing was ridiculously amateurish, the film dragged itself away and felt incoherent, as if someone cut a television series to the length of a feature film. The academy must have been drugged when they nominated this film for no fewer than eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> Again, I repeat myself. This is the second movie I have not seen so far. The first was "Exterminator". I hope that gives you an indication of how bad it really is. 1.10
