Just not the quality I expected from Morris (Love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). This is very similar to a not so bad student movie. What worries me, why is it ever a BAFTA WIN ??? Morris makes fun of 'anchored mediocrity' (Ayn Rand) in many of his works (Nathan Barley), and yet with this piece he urinates the backs of the talents and tells us it's raining! <br /> <br /> I hope only when he has decided on a topic (The Humanity of Terrorism - Four Lions) that he will not impose this and waste the opportunity to make a statement about the mainstream farce -Ignorance and opinion on this emotional and difficult-woven phenomenon.
