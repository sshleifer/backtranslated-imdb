Chris Rock, who seems to be desperately looking for a comfy star vehicle that transmits his thrill to the white and black mainstream audience, is updating the hit comedy "Heaven Can Wait" (1978) with an urban program. He plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident and whose soul is removed from his body too soon - hence his angels need to find another body to place him, and can only find that of a white businessman. Rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as "Heaven Can Wait" shows only that Rock's eye was on the box office (this was just a corporate move organized by most of the Hollywood players' mercenaries). Why not strive for something higher or more memorable than a stupid reincarnation comedy that culminates with an evening at Apollo? Great side cast members (including the usually reliable Regina King, the wonderful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and the great Frankie Faison) do what they can, but Rock seems to feel uncomfortable through and through. * 1/2 of ****
