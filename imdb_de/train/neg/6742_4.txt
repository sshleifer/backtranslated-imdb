In romantic comedies, I often rate the quality of the film based on the foggy nature of my eyes at the end of the experience. Unfortunately for "The Wedding Date" I can only rate the movie with 4 out of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> I apologize to fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but between them I did not see much chemistry two characters. The premise of the film is a reverse "Pretty Woman", in which Dermot plays the role of Nick, a high-priced male escort who is hired by Debras figure Kat to accompany her to her sister's wedding to England. It probably creates a love relationship between client and client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And in the relationship between Nick and Kat, there were not enough romantic sparks. In a supporting role Amy Adams was outstanding as a sister of Kat. Whenever Amy came to the screen, she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the energy of the movie. If Amy Adams had been cast in the role of Kat, the film might have had more momentum. But it turned out that instead of reaching for Kleenex I was looking for the visor to at least pretend that the film had a real feeling and a romantic relationship.
