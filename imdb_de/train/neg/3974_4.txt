I agree with everything Calamine said! And I do not always agree with people, but what Calamine said is very true, it's time for the girls to move on to better roles. I want them to be successful because they were a very inspiring couple and I would like to make them grow as people, actresses and in their careers as well as in their personal lives. So please give the girls the chance to develop something that goes some way from the tangent, and move them in a new direction that recognizes them individually and in many facets of their talents. This movie being commented on is not that bad, but as I've seen later in their films, their films remain the same as typical plot and typography. When In Rome is good for a younger generation audience, but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes. That's why we want adults to want them to make films of various kinds, maybe some are like the sixth sense, the hour, the chocolat, that kind of movie - they do not say they only have serious movies for them, humor too but rather see her in different roles than in her more recent films and New York Minute. (Note: I'm from Australia, sorry for our strange spelling like renaming with the s instead of z)
