This miserable movie is a remake of a movie from 1927. It should have stayed that way. <br /> <br /> What a gigantic bomb! Douglas Fairbanks shows absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero plays a role as a real jerk, and Bette Grable sings with a chorus: What I'm going to do with this Hungarian! The ridiculous plot is about a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome, who saved the day by killing a conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now, let's move forward 300 years later, when Grable, just married to Count Romero, finds himself in a similar situation when an invasion by Hungarian soldiers takes place on the wedding night. <br /> <br /> Romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives. He disguises himself as a gypsy and has to stay in the castle if his violin playing likes Fairbanks. The end is worse than the whole wretched film when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news - a furious Romero has annulled the marriage. <br /> <br /> This bad imitation of a movie was made in 1948. Like Harry Davenport, a veteran supporting the player in 1949; That must have been his last movie. What a bomb you can do after such a remarkable career. Walter Abel is a co-star, but he can do little with such bad writing. The costumes look more like those that date back to the Stone Age. I can not figure out what Fairbanks wore.
