My girlfriend's mother used to work in a video library and was able to preview the movies before they came out. When she brought the horror movie The Convent home, I could not wait to look at it. Given that it should be scary, but actually totally funny, I can say that I like this movie in a strange way. <br /> <br /> Yeah, the drama is bad and yeah, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! "WHAT, SMOKE CA-RACK?!" I did not know that this movie was ever released ... I thought it was too bad ... <br /> <br /> Yeah, well ... overall the movie is pretty bad (you have to admit that's least) but I promise you, you'll get a good laugh from it. <br /> <br /> * This movie is a bit crap, but it's good for a laugh ... especially the guy who holds the 'Dagger of Despair'. .. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAIR!
