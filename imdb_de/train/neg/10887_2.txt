...... this movie is pretty awful, the only thing that kept me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that unfortunately I have seen worse. The jungle music, moaning demons and UV / blood / teeth / UV-style eyes make this "horrible" look and the script is bleak ..... This movie is more of a test to see how long it takes can, before he gives up. It is also predictable, but not in a good way. Nothing that this movie does is in a good way. I saw it ten minutes ago and thought I was scolding a little, so you're here. (oh and acting does not let the movie down, it's terrible too)
