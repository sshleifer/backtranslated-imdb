I was just bored in the theater and wanted to leave the film halfway. The plot consists of simple 4 Samoan weddings. So you have to bring an appointment to come to the wedding. Yawning. <br /> <br /> The thing that annoyed me the most were the so-called gross jokes ... They were extremely disgusting, cliched and thrown in your face to get you into the already boring movie. The acting was below average and I had the feeling that the film was only about a few funny jokes and a predictable act continued. <br /> <br /> All in all, a worse movie I've ever seen in 2006, unsteady, bad acting, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Well, thank god, a friend called me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
