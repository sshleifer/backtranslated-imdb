Such a shame! I tried that and hoped it was an undiscovered James Garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be! The production quality was okay, but the plot was undoubtedly lame and I can honestly say that I am only a few hours older and now much more stupid. The movie really did not have any redeeming qualities, and if that kind of stuff keeps coming out, Hallmark will get a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it's about, it's not about anything, and in that case, it's not a good thing. We're going to watch an old ornier, who is one of the dumbest creatures that ever roamed the earth, who happened to be married to a real treasure that is probably the only living person she could endure. She carries him through one mess after another, putting him in an awkward situation after another and being proud of himself all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief that was! It's not worth the time to look at it, so do yourself a favor and skip it, you'll be glad if you knew how bad it really is.
