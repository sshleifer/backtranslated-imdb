A dog found in a local kennel is mated to Satan and has a litter of puppies, one of which goes to a family that has just lost their previous dog by a hit. The puppy does not want to spend time like Donald Trump and fire the Mexican housekeeper as festive. Only the father suspects that this dog is more than he appears, the rest of the family loves the demonic puppy dog. So it's up to the father to say the day. <br /> <br /> These late 70's, made for TV horror movies, have little to offer, except for a failed sense of nostalgia. When I saw this as a child, I felt it as a tense nail biter, but as an adult I picked it up again. Now I realize that it is only lame, boring and in the least not really good-natured br /> My Note: D
