Allegedly, this is a Z-grade DTV horror movie. <br /> <br /> But with lines like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, I've often been" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "Why are you reading this book?" "Because it makes the story more interesting" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "They found their way here, now you can get out!" (after guiding a man down to the basement) <br /> <br /> (and sounds like what they are singing) <br /> <br /> - it's not so clear what this epoch movie is about Post-structuralism is about it, or whether it's just bad filmmaking. Acting is cruel, but some actors I know bang them? <br /> <br /> In an old house that was apparently cut into a contemporary apartment, there are murders. A (bad) movie is filmed on the site and the story repeats itself.
