I recently bought the DVD and forgot how much I hated the movie version of "A Chorus Line". Any change made by director Attenborough to the story failed. <br /> <br /> Highlighting the relationship between the director and Cassie shifts the entire ensemble premise of the musical out of the window. <br /> <br /> Some of the music numbers are speeding up and speeding up. The show's hit song gets all the meaning when it's given to Cassie's character. <br /> <br /> The production is very confident. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give her a 2 This is because some of the big numbers can still be enjoyed, though the movie tries to bring out a lot of joy and spontaneity from it.
