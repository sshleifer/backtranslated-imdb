The veteran director and producer Allan Dwan, whose vast series of films features both the absolutely memorable and the repeatedly shown (for example, John Wayne in "Sands of Iwo Jima"), tried "I Dream of Jeanie" on a big musical. He used a lead cast of singers with little past experience and, as it turned out, virtually no future, he made a fictitious and not least offensive story about the great American songwriter Stephen Foster Bill Shirley is the young, in love Foster, its friendliness to slaves is to give the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital costs for an injured little black boy. His goal is Inez McDowell (Muriel Lawrence), whose annoying younger sister Jeanie (Eileen Christy) slowly realizes that she falls in love with the almost modest songwriter. Foster is in love with Inez, who is outraged by the # 1 Levee hit parade tune "O Susannah". Enter minnesinger Edwin P.Christy (Ray Middleton) to begin the winning phase of Foster's career. <br /> <br /> This, according to the musical film standards of the early fifties, is a big production. The sets are lavish in the special Hollywood way that is fake with all the ornaments. The singers are not half bad and the Foster songs are almost impossible to ruin. <br /> <br /> However, this is also a literal whitewash of Antebellum South. The largest number includes black-face for everyone on stage, a historical anomaly and a contemporary piece of ruthless racism. If these depictions of blacks were anywhere near reality, the abolitionists would have been rightly condemned for intervening in such a charitable institution. <br /> <br /> "I Dream of Jeanie" apparently sank into the vault of the studio with a death whisper. Now revived by Alpha Video for only $ 4.99, it's a piece of enchanting songs and repulsive sentimentalization about the victims of America's big crime, slavery. <br /> <br /> This was what Hollywood v. Brown v. Board of Education. Must have warmed the hearts of some moviegoers who have been taking their bedding to the theater.
