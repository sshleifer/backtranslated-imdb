I've just watched this movie on TV and I have to admit, I was a bit surprised he was even running. There were so many fools, confusions and bad arrangements that it would have been better to see an old episode of Sesame Street. The acting was fine, but please, you can really feel the "straight to video" feeling. The cast / crew made this movie a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but wait ten minutes before the end to hear it. Trust me, you would not even know the difference.
