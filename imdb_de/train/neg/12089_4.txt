I rented the video from "The Piano Teacher" and did not know anything except what was on the video box. I was a bit worried because films that win prizes in Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this falls into the latter category. About a quarter of the way inside, I said aloud, "This movie is boring." Halfway, I said to myself, "Where have I seen this?" At the three-quarter mark I had found out. <br /> <br /> Despite its literary heritage, this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altman's much earlier (1969) and better: "That Cold Day in the Park." Although the details are obviously different and Altman's work was characterized more by actions and less character research, the two films are thematically identical. There is nothing "new" in this production. Every aspect of it has been done before: a character who gets out of control with increasingly self-destructive behavior (Abel Ferrara's "Bad Lieutenant" 1992); a perverse and doomed "love" that ends in a (near) (almost) surefire scene (David Cronenberg's "M. Butterfly" 1993); unusually brutal sex scenes (David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" 1986); and so on. So I am amused by the fact that so many felt the film was "shocking", "shocking", and so on. This highly derivative film seems to have been created just for the purpose of making viewers uncomfortable and with some clearly succeeding. However, I attribute such a reaction largely to the lack of film experience. Watch enough movies and you will really have seen everything. And while it's true that I've seen the translated "R-Rated" version, I doubt the additional scenes would change my opinion of The Piano Teacher. Technically, the film is not without earning. There are very good camera works and the lighting is excellent. The performance of Isabelle Huppert also helps to avoid wasting time. This is the first of Hanekes films I have seen, and if I saw more I would have the same opinion of him as Ferrara: an interesting director, but not nearly the genius others do. Rating: 4/10.
