Unnecessary remake, and it can not nearly capture the charm of the original. The extreme length causes more than a few yawning parts. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style, and most of the time he lacks talent, not just in the acting, but the direction, sets, costumes, etc. are all below average. It has a gross disregard for the details of the period. Vanessa Williams is the only actor to show any flair, Tyne Daly is not that bad. They would have left alone enough. The vocals range from good (Vanessa Williams) to bad (everyone else). Look at the original version of 1963 and skip it. There is not much to recommend here.
