I could not believe my eyes as soon as I saw this movie. It also makes no sense, then blood and violence. Unlike other creepy movies that made a lot of sense and sense, this movie is bloody, bloody and kills one after the other. This movie is not interesting at all, has no meaningful plot or story, nor does it have an intelligence. The blood looks very phony and this movie is totally meaningless. Do not even waste your time with it. It's only an hour or two of mindless violence. It has many bloody scenes that are not scary, but just repulsive. This is probably the worst horror movie I've ever seen from all the horror movies I've ever seen.
