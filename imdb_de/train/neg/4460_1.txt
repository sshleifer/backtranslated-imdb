HORRENDOUS! Avoid like the plague. I would rate this among the top 10 worst movies ever. Special effects, drama, mood, sound, etc. seem to be done by daycare caretakers ... wait, I've seen better programs. Opens like a gentle porn show with a hazy, naked woman playing a shower scene, and then goes bad. Good nude scenes, but that's it. Sound and light problems existed throughout the movie. Sometimes I swear I could hear the roar of the camera motors. YIKES! I would like to see another movie about this story, but made by different people. This group of actors and crew needs more acting and film lessons. Has chosen 1 out of 10 points.
