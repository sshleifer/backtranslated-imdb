This was not a Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie movie. It was a big wannabe. It wanted to be a nervous, nervous, laughing, city-dweller movie, but it's rather a jerky camera, a mess. It's much easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning, I did not care less about the characters or what they were involved in. They have always beaten, pissed or cried. Only there was no substance to what they did. The dialogue between the characters should be hip, enlightening, instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable. I know that there are viewers who really liked this movie, so I could be wrong.
