The appearances by Fishbourne (which seems hilarious) and Ed Harris (briefly introduced) are remarkable, in contrast to Connery, who seems to find no meaning in his role and ends up in the motor behavior of an 80-year-old man. In fact, the script does not make sense. Imagine a 60 min. happy-end plot plus a sudden turnaround without any argumentation on the characters. It's more of a coincidence than a screenplay and can be good for exam purposes in schools for paperless recorders. The more you remember the details, the stronger this impression becomes. The death penalty is not an issue here, although it is an issue from the beginning; it disappears somehow without further comment. The theme and the environment could have been good.
