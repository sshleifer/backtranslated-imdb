That's how it happened. Fast, expensive cars that only the top 1% will ever drive. The girls posing next to them in gear magazines. Second-tier and no-name actors. Cheap advertising appearances by people from the niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is the trash that Hollywood has to offer. Do not get me wrong; I love the thoughtless action movie with hot girls as well as the next one. But please, the Collective Braintrust, that this stuff is lit green, please stop, count to ten, breathe, have a hearty "Woooooosaaaaaah", then rewind for twenty-five years and remember what made movies enjoyable once? MAKE then really movies again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but the entire pop culture explosion she has experienced over the last five years is ridiculous. Everyone and his mother think now their outsider (not half of them this reference will get). Some managers said, "Hey, from which ethnic group you want to take out $ 9.50?" "I know, sir, the market for 18-35." "Ok, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "Great idea, sir." The result? A movie I saw a hundred times on Spike TV late at night, and mostly with Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm not Filmsnob. Over-the-top arts like The English Patient do not swim my boat, but generic movies that should not even be made directly on DVD also bother me. Only the gearboxes for youthful transmissions will rev up their engines, and I imagine those at the top of their IQ range will see this for what it is: a junkyard.
