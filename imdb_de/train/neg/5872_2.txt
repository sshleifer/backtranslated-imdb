I saw that for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson, who they considered buddy policemen. They are but Busey is in the opening scene and reappears only after 40 minutes. Although every scene he's in is great. Especially when he disguises himself as a blind hobo. <br /> <br /> The unbelievable thing about this movie is the storyline. In the film, Fred Williamson tries to find out who tracked and killed telephone sex operators. At one point, I think it's busy. But it turns out that I'm only partially right. Busey is not the killer, but he calls the women on the phone and harasses her. Why? I dont know. He's not affiliated with the killer in any way, he just does it for kicks, I think.
