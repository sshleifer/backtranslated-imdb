Stupid, thoughtless hustle and bustle about a jet that was put together within a few hours by mechanics who had never worked on aircraft (piloted by Burgess Meredith) chasing a Porsche race car on which decades-old gasoline sludge was driven by Lee Majors, with Chris Makepeace as a runaway techno-wiz, who can substitute McGyver into a radio receiver that can record all frequencies at the same time, and who has somehow learned to acquire and use chemicals to make explosives in an absolutely peaceful society. As stupid as it sounds. Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace can be forgiven at least on the grounds that this was just his second movie.
