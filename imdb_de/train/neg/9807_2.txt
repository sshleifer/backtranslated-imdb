Very rarely do I give less rave reviews in a show or movie I do not like on IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just so terribly awful that it's awful. <br /> <br /> I would not have minded if that had been an animated series - that would have been better that way, I think, but as a live action show, the terms "cheesy" and "campy" are used , Which Power Rangers is. Five colorful, elastic spandex fighters battle evil with their martial arts skills. The costumes are awful - they look like something reminiscent of what athletes and gymnasts would wear. Acting is sad and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to see that Jean-Claude Van Damme looks just as good as Bruce Lee, which in itself is an understatement. In fact, they look like they're jumping around and dancing; As if it were a version of the nutcracker, or rather ballet than fighting. There are also some cartoons that deal heavily with martial arts, and yet it's done in a fun way that makes it look stupid. <br /> <br /> Show or not children is just so lame on the verge of absurdity. And although this version plays in America, one can imagine that one was turned when watching some combat sequences not in the US, but in Japan. The somewhat "wrong" fighting and footage was borrowed from the Japanese version - just to face the American version. <br /> <br /> If you like these kinds of things, stay with Sentai, the Japanese counterpart.
