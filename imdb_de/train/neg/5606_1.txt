I think Shakespeare explained what I've just read. I think he (the lady) protests too much. The whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! He makes up a number of secular literature (writings from the same period, but not associated with the Bible), but at least three references that give historical accuracy to the events in the Bible are at my head. Anyone can distort data and prove what he wants, but that's not true. Habits change, word definitions change over time (see English and German, where it is obviously a common root). Nothing stays the same, it keeps growing and changing. There are many different translations in the Bible, but the King James Version is the one I found for the best kind of research. In the King James Version, you will notice that certain words are in italics. These words were added by the translators and can be omitted. The mean of the entire verse changes. Scriptures from the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs and without numerical verses. These writings look like a long word and the translators added all the above. For example, how would you read the following: GODISNOWHERE do you read it because God is nowhere, or read it as it is now? Same letter sequence two completely different meanings. Because of this, many biblical researchers use a "lexicon" to help them translate, as they provide word for word translation from Arabic, Greek, or Hebrew, depending on the language in which the script was originally written. It is also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic, one can prove that God exists but not that he does not exist! In the end, I just love to listen to people who think they are so smart that they can judge the Almighty. Talk about ego! Put down soap box, God bless Maegi
