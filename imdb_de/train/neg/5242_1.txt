Well, I hated being crushed, I despised the 40-year-old maiden and this little gem is a worthless piece of trash movie. Do yourself a favor and skip it. I admit, I do not like the actors in this movie, and after my 18 year old son showed me the cover of the DVD, I thought, "I would not like the movie," but on his insistence, I unfortunately decided to , <br /> <br /> After about two minutes I turned off the movie, I was so offended. it is just disgusting. Any decent person would be offended by the filth in this movie. Call me old-fashioned, but pushing your pussy juice-covered hand into your friend's face so he knows you "get some of it" is, in my opinion, exaggerated. Yes, that's how this rotten little movie starts, and I can only imagine that it will get much worse from there. another real winner for Mr. Rudd. I bet he's proud of the punch. Imagine, if you could only get worthless roles that he gets, would you stay in movies? Despite the payment, I would not. <br /> <br /> I should have known better; Next time I will.
