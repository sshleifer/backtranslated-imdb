I did not expect much from this movie, after the terrible "life is a miracle". It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "Life ...". I have the impression that the director / writer jokes only with the audience: "Let me see how much emptiness you (public) can hold". Dialogues are empty, ... Scenario is minimalistic. In a few moments the photography is really nice. Some sarcastic lines are half funny, but it's hard to really laugh during this "comedy." I laughed because I could see the movie to the end. If you can rise above the fiasco of this director, you will find some good legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek) and a very good performance by Emir Stribor Kusturica. pity for such a great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should shoot first-class films. Instead, he chooses this low-budget film, which is intended only for my private plays, with an arrogant attitude to world trends and carelessness towards his old fans.
