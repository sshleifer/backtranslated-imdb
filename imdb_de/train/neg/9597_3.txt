As much as I like Japanese movies, this movie did not just cut it off ... A movie about rebels and the survival of a royal bloodline turned out to be a very slow film with a dubious plot Photography is fine, although I have seen much better sword fighting scenes in other Japanese films, the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters did not convince me. The soundtrack is so weak you do not even notice its presence. But the worst thing was the development of the plot. I have to admit that sometimes I had a hard time understanding who was who and what was going on. The platonic love between the main character and another was completely unnecessary and seemed to stem from an influence of Hollywood. All in all, if you are looking for a Japanese action movie, this is not the case. It is very slow, with very few sword fighting scenes and very sentimental ... in a bad way ...
