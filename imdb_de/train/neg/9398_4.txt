... at least in the first half. If it had started with the three comrades in the Navy and had focused on the action scenes of the Navy, it would have been a much better and firmer film. The second half of the movie is worth it, especially for the action sequences and close-up shots of early 20th-century ships, but it's like a dull toothache getting there. Do not just watch this movie because Ginger Rogers is there. It has an important role, but it is a small one. <br /> <br /> The film features three New York miners working in the tourism industry, as well as good-natured competition for the hand of Sally (Ginger Rogers). , a singing sweets saleswoman along the avenue. The First World War breaks out, the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the fight, but nevertheless to enter the navy. One of the three least civilian industries (Bill Boyd as Baltimore) brings the commander to the other two (Robert Armstrong as Dutchman and James Gleason as Skeets). To make it more complex, Sally has fallen in love with one of the three, but has no chance to tell him until the three go to war. <br /> <br /> The film is more interesting aboard the ship, mainly because of the close-up of the ship itself, and also because the chemistry among the three friends is credible. At the age of 49, however, James Gleason seems a bit boring, especially when the sign at the conscription office said you needed to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible. <br /> <br /> A real one obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside of the sea scenes was beaten with minimal care is the costume design or, I should say, the absence. In the scenes in New York just before the First World War we all dressed in the fashion of 1931 and all who drive the cars of 1931 - no effort was made to bring this movie into the period you see the few scenes Ginger Rogers and the last 45 minutes of the Navy's suicide mission. You have seen everything worth seeing here. The rest is upholstery.
