I have just emailed a friend about this movie to the film school. Something to avoid filmmaking - characters who blabber on the screen, pointless, overworked and confused monologues that are ultimately banal and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barriers are so exaggerated that they actually draw attention to the film-built film and effectively neutralize that intention. Is it the drama or the script that is bad or both? <br /> <br /> The protagonist is also extremely implausible for social realism - he consumes canonical English literature and the Bible while he is high or hungry and can produce such profoundly sophomoric monologues in the intoxication? And how can such an inconspicuous, unwashed and verbally harmful character meet most of the women he encounters in minutes? (I had to applaud when a chick finally threw him onto the street despite his moaning and self-pitying banter.) The onlooker encounters presumptuous references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus, and the Book of Revelations. The menacing fate of humanity, in the form of bar codes imprinted in uncanny biblical fashion on our foreheads or in our right hands, is presented to a character so cleverly exposed in his role as guardian of empty space. <br /> <br /> This film is exaggerated and exaggerated - a melodrama infused with the "philosophy" of the pedestrian about the importance of humanity, life, etc. awkward. It is banal, overwhelmed and boring. <br /> <br /> There are some very good English movies with similar content. "Nile by Mouth" is an outstanding, far more interesting excursion into the lives of people in a similar social environment. The same applies to "In the Warzone". And although the comparison is not even justified, read about Peter Greenaway, who skilfully deals with dialogue, wit and absurd characters and situations.
