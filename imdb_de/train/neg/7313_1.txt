I wasted 5.75 to see this crappy movie, so I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> For what the dog split in half at the beginning of the movie, the disease had nothing to do with it After being split in half. <br /> <br /> What was the point Karen was dragged into the shed? She had already totally infected her room. They could have simply locked her up where she was safer. <br /> <br /> Why would the hermit walk around in the woods and ask strangers to help him if he had just asked his relative, the pig lady, to take him to the hospital? <br /> <br /> Why not? If one of the characters bothers to go to the city to get help when things get bad, are they all so lazy? <br /> <br /> Even if Paul was threatened by the guy with the gun because he looked at him, wife, Paul could have just sent Jeff or Bert into the house to ask for help. The girl he loves worsens. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the box? <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff go back to the cabin after his departure when everyone else had gotten infected? He was such an idiot he could even leave, would not he just go home? <br /> <br /> If the police had taken the trouble to collect the kids and burn them in the fire pit, why did they throw Paul halfway into the river, it was not even necessary for the property because the water was already contaminated. Who makes lemonade from the river water, this crap has dirt sheets and mistakes in it. Why could not the two children just use the tap water, it was also contaminated, so the stupid end would still work.
