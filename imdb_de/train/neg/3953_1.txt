I can not believe that this movie was allowed to be made. These people should take drugs and beat with blunt objects. They should be tortured. This movie is an abomination. It is nothing but material from the first movie. What is original is crazy and makes no sense at all. It's like a kind of drug hallucination. How about the Spiegelnacktherapie? No matter which idiot was patched up, that bastard did not watch the first movie because he called Suzanna Love's character Natalie when it came to Lacey. I felt like screaming on the screen: "IT'S LACEY, IT'S LACEY !!!!". I give -50 out of 10. MY GOD !!!!
