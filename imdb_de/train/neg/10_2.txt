This film was promising and the plot was relatively interesting, but the actors, directors and editors seriously abandoned this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the authors, it could have been good. The acting is made of wood, only very few characters are credible. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has edited this has just learned a few new editing techniques and wanted to spatter them throughout the movie. In almost every scene, there are many quick "flashy" edits that are clearly symbolic but end up as annoying. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie and expected decent resolution To break down the balance, but unfortunately no, I felt like I was wasting my time and the filmmakers had wasted their money.
