Pathetic is the word. Bad drama, pitiful script, funny dialogues and hip-hop music and fashion ... what the hell was that? The director of this movie is just as bad as the movie he made. If someone had put some time and effort into reworking it, it might have a chance. I bet the studios are still trying to figure out how to mess it up. <br /> <br /> The absolute best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... the Asian chick was not that bad either. These girls also wore the whole movie. Without her, I would have destroyed my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> If one of those who have not seen it yet and had a hunch should not waste time ... you will regret it later.
