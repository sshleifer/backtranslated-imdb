Where do you get the money to make such films? I mean, there is nothing redeeming about this movie. None of the actors is known, the writing is terrible, the photography is blurry, the story moves between a bad version of Repo Man and a Nicklodeon Western, and acting is incredible. For someone watching all kinds of movies, good and bad, I have to admit that this movie is about the worst I've seen since Attack of the Eye People in the 50's. I do not really like suppressing the effort of people trying to create entertainment or art in heaven, but this movie does not seem to appeal to anyone. The story revolves around a mystical pollution of a person who is a bad version of the Celtic soul-eater, though he functions more like a male succubus with no sexual overtones. The bad guys have to band together with the good guys in a city they can not escape from. Take it from there, because that's the best part. My advice is that if you are not concerned with bad mythology, amateur writing, unconvincing drama, and boring attitudes, you will be best served if you leave them on the shelf when renting videos.
