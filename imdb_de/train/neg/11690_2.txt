It's a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie. Apart from the unanswered questions published in the other comments, it is so difficult to capture the robbers. Just get rid of the bank clerks, see who was at the bank - from all the cameras' camera angles - and you have these 4 additional robbers among the hostages. Where is the tension that every body talks about? The moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform, it was so obvious that they would all go through the front door ... they have often seen it. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have spiced the movie with good music and artistic shoot. The movie is not worth it. Pronto!
