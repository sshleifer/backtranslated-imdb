Robert Wagner is the evil boss of Digicron, a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people. <br /> <br /> 'So you say that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - it could be medically possible, but not possible from my system' <br /> <br /> 'I have to write my own new virus software to fix the problem - it can take some time. '<br /> <br />' But it's not software, it's the people. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the moment of love "I am into virology" and maybe the first film that depicts death via Braille keyboard
