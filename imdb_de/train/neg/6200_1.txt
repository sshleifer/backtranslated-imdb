This is the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. "Requiem for a Dream" looks like a Disney movie. Although technically well done, acting, cinematography, music, directing etc. are good. The final gang-rape scene is the worst and most violent thing I've ever seen and I really wish I had not seen it. I am afraid that it will haunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think everyone would find the film extremely disturbing, my wife and some of her friends were similarly victimized, and I really did not need an explicit memory of the horror they experienced. I saw the movie at the SXSW film festival in Austin, TX, and none of the cast or crew was present. I would have wished that they had the opportunity to defend the violence in their film, which I considered excessive, unnecessary and unnecessary. An earlier scene successfully conveyed the mood they apparently aspired to, without, however, rubbing their faces against extreme and explicit sexual violence. This film should carry a large WARNING label. For these reasons, I would not recommend anyone to see it. You were warned.
