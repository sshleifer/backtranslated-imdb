This movie reminded me of The Sopranos and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> David Chase's seminal mob opera was only twice mistaken, with the most unpleasant and inexplicable case in its fourth season when junior soprano put his life on trial. Instead of following this intriguing (and decisive) act, the authors have chosen to ignore it completely, instead focusing on the constant whimpering of Bobby Baccalieri over the frozen pasta dish of his recently deceased wife. <br /> <br /> When something of real interest happens at Notorious - for example, the first mysterious assassination attempt on Tupac Shakur that unleashed the entire East Coast / West Coast feud and eventually led to the deaths of both Tupac and Christopher Wallace - The movie treats it as another conspiracy. Why was Tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people? Did he alone promote his later affiliation with Suge Knight? And was Lil 'Kim's transformation from a primary office drone to a sex-obsessed vampire diva really as banal as it seems? <br /> <br /> None of these questions are even briefly addressed by the film's screenwriters, who are far more interested in portraying Wallace's tumultuous love life without compelling dramatic success. These sequences (including a mind-boggling, clich√©d groupie indescretion in a hotel room) are so toothless and hurtfully manipulative that the only real comparison can be made with a network TV movie. In both cases, storytelling is the case structure and content is simple and banal. But more fundamental than a biopic; as something designed to celebrate its theme and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their lives and work; The movie is almost completely worthless. Confidence in the genre-plotting of meat and potatoes, coupled with the lifeless musical performances (an area in which a movie like this should certainly rise), leads to a film that apparently only meets the wishes and requirements of that genre participated and left the questionable status of Wallace as a giant in his field as the reserve of easily convincing and previously converted. <br /> <br /> And the last twenty minutes, in which Wallace's posthumous cultural identity is generally painted as that of a Latter-day Saint, frankly made me feel like I was vomiting. <br /> <br /> In this regard, Notorious, like any other thing, is crass, calculating and compromised.
