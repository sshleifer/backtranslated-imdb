I do not know who Sue Kramer, the director of this film, is, but I have a strong suspicion that A) she is a lesbian and B) she somehow shamed all those involved in this project to take part in it to prove that they are not homophobic. <I imagine everyone thinks, "My God, that's terrible, not funny, pedestrian, very lame." But if you shut up, because you fear that they will be classified as anti-gay or "not get" the gay lifestyle. (That's probably why Kramer did NOT play gays as gays.) Anyway, it's not even worth checking them out. The actors are all dependent on completely surpassing any scene, so there is no sincerity or credibility in everything they do. It's full of stereotypes and there's nothing about this movie that is the least entertaining - certainly not funny. <br /> <br /> I hated it and I'm not afraid to say it. Too bad that the discouraged people who had given Kramer the money for this bomb were not so unbiased.
