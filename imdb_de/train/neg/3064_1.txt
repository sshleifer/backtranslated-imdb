The original "Vanishing Point" was a great filmstrip. Subtle motifs, characters that seemed real and spontaneous. The remake was terrible. Preacher, obviously obvious; the point was not understood why the original was a classic. The black Charger was cool, but even that could not save that streak. Why stay with a white Challenger? I do not think that was the best choice, as '71. Some parts of the movie were unintentionally funny. Like when Vigo stood on a cliff overlooking the gorge after his "Dream Quest". His Indian buddy was standing next to him. Vigo wore only his white panties. I'm sorry - it just looked stupid - he overlooked the view in his Fruit of the Looms. Another scene was over - after the explosive collision with the bulldozers - said the spokesman, the impact is clocked at 180 mph. Then he mentions that the cops said his remains were not found because they evaporated, but some people believe he was thrown out and hid from friends in the crowd. Then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph! At first you could not open the car door at 180 kilometers per hour. Second, the car would not go straight for 100 meters. with nobody to control it. It would turn around 30 times. Third, if you hit the pavement at a speed of 180 miles per hour, you end up in various muddy tracks. Anyway, we see him standing with his daughter in the end. All in all, a movie that would insult everyone's intelligence.
