This is almost like two films - one is literary and captivating, the other stupid and clich√©d. It is a pity that all writing problems have not been solved, but considering how fast most B films were written and produced, this is not unusual. It's really a shame, because this could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First the good. The movie is original and includes WWII code breaker. That's pretty intriguing, and I liked watching the lead man (Lee Bowman) master the code breaker. In fact, the first two-thirds of the movie was very good. But now for the worse, the movie just ran too long and lost after about 50 minutes of steam. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as a "crazy girlfriend" must be one of the worst written and distracting roles in film history !! For every smart move Bowman made, Roger's idiots intervened to screw things up as a misleading "comedy relief." If her role had been written intelligently, the overall film would have improved enormously! Instead, it's hard to understand how we won World War II !!
