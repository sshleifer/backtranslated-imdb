Franco Rossi's six-hour Italian miniseries by Quo Vadis in 1985 are a very curious beast that creates an absolutely convincing ancient Roman world that is indeed fashion (very few long shots, no big city views), but so much the drama lay down in favor of allusions to classical literature and history that history is constantly losing itself in the background. <br /> <br /> The changing structure (much of the episode is played out through voice over letters) and lack of narrative urgency makes the full six-hour version both demanding and undemanding, and certainly too often unpretentious, but it has something to offer , The two main strengths are the characterization of Petronius (a grateful named Frederic Forrest, whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue) as a man who has been looking for a sharp angle for so long to survive the court life, leaving him is no longer able to experience emotions. and Klaus Maria Brandauer's unique approach to Nero as a would-be actor, where every move and action is focused on how his "audience" receives them. Elsewhere, Max von Sydow appears briefly in a few episodes. He is rewarded with the show's most impressive and sincere scene, where he encounters a child as he tries to leave Rome. It's something that the series could do more with, but all too often it seems to plating every potentially emotional, inspirational or exciting moment in its unyielding, unobtrusive direction. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Francesco Quinn makes an amazing anonymous hero who fits into the walls and comes less than a Roman officer than the quiet, somewhat garish, but harmless guy who works in the same office as you, the on office parties never says much - you know, the one you think is called Dave or something like that. The budgetary constraints are very clear as soon as the Meet the Lions' time for the Christians and Ursus is battled with the bull, so determinedly reserved that it passes over before the show abruptly loses interest and ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> No trip that I can recommend, I'm afraid, but if you get involved, it's not without its small rewards.
