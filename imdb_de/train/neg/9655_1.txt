In the end, I watched this movie before I even read all the reviews at the request of a woman. Out of curiosity, I thought, let me find out if there are people who recommend watching this movie. I am quite shocked to find so long and positive reviews on this site that I can assume that this is a scam. <br /> <br /> As far as I think, I have to ask, "Are these filmmakers lagging behind or doing that, assuming that the audience is left behind?" The movie is cruel on so many levels and me Do not even talk about the story or the presentation. <br /> <br /> So these guys and a girl (the lead actress) make a music band; Presumably due to the constant presence of guitars, it should be a ROCK band. Hell, when did the dancers start to be part of a rock band ??? Anyway, I'd like to accept it as a Bollywood version of a rock band, but strangely enough, all the notes where these two guitarists actually did all sorts of cool "rock gurgles", and I assume they were playing instruments, the sound of the guitar was missing completely !!! I just can not understand the extent of the stupidity here ... <br /> <br /> I'm just coming to the conclusion that it's totally not worth pointing out further mistakes in the film. Bollywood directors seem to have no shame left !!!!!!!!
