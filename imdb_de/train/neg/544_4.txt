PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or can this guy always outnumber AB in their films?). Some touching scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> CONS: The whole first hour (the jokes were flat, to say the least). Every scene with Rajpal Yadav. Great stupidity in the decision making of AB. Let me make that clear, he believes that his son's soul is brutally insulted in every possible way (which is likely to ruin their relationship). This is a better way for him to finally get Akshay to take some responsibility and actually tell him the truth. WTF? He considers Akshaye to be too soft to bear the fact that his old father is about to die of cancer, but believes that insulting him will make him stronger? Am I the only one who does not see the logic here? The biggest mistake of the movie. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becomes a stuntman. LMAO !! We are told that every year he has the first place at the university and has an MBA. But when it's time to feed himself and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stuntman. LOL !! How do I actually apply for a regular job in your field? Or Heck, where else your life is not in danger? This is something incredibly stupid writing. <br /> <br /> - The end. I hate this melodramatic crap. Everything is pressed down our throat to regret the character of AB, which I could not. It reminded me a bit of Srk in KHNH (which I hate). This "I'm sorry for the guy with the disease," the crap has expired. I felt more like a puke than sympathy for the OLD man. Could not see the last 20 minutes because of this and therefore had to quickly fwd. the whole. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Waqt is just too stupid to call a good movie. His obvious director, Vipul Shah, aimed at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who might be less interested in a story that actually makes sense. Give them some decent song pics, fancy outfits, lots of glycerine-filled scenes and a bit of star power.
