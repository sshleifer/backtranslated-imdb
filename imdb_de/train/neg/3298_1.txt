When I heard that the dukes of Hazzard would be reworking with current actors and a solid script, I said, "Okay, I'll give it a try, it will not be better than the first, but we will." See what happens. "Well, I saw what happened, I saw a great show from the late '70s /' 80s, a classic that was mainly humiliated by Hollywood, it's so sad to see Hollywood scriptwriters They do not seem to come up with something original these days, they seem to make a great show with a large audience and try to make the classic show "REMAKE." HEADS UP Hollywood ... IT'S NOT WORKING !!!! Anyway, more about the show, I think they could have played a better actor than Sean William Scott (Stiffler of American Pie) to play Bo, I'm sure John Schneider is definitely disappointed in how his character was portrayed and exploited Johnny Knoxville as Luke Duke, how deep can you go ?? A crappy Jackass actor playing the lovable hatch that makes me sick, I give Jessica Simpson is a beautiful too Woman, but her acting is shit. Catherine Bach, who played the original Daisy, was smart, sexy, strong, opinionated and a good southern girl. She was every role model for every little girl! (I owned the doll and the Jeep - thank you !!!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, Daisy Duke, a 2-bit slut. Daisy has never been blonde. Why did they have to occupy her? Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke. She can speak with a great southern accent, and she's great and would have done a wonderful job. In any case, I would like to say that this film has blown something wild. I feel like I was torn off paying $ 8.50 for tickets and they should refund my money. If you like the Dukes of Hazzard (the original series), you will not see this movie. It will only upset you. CMT (Country Music Television) plays the repeats of the Dukes later in the night. So set up your TIVO's and go with the real thing, not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
