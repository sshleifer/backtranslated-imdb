0.5 / 10. This movie has absolutely nothing good. Acting is one of the worst I have ever seen. What's really amazing is that ALL are terrible, not just a few here and there, all. The direction is a joke, the low budget is hopelessly obvious, the score is awful, I would not say the movie was edited, brutally hacked would be a fitting sentence. It combines serial murders, voodoo and tarot cards. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. It's not scary at all, the special effects are hopelessly lame. ridiculously bad. The writing was horribly bad. The cinematography looks very cheap and sometimes very grainy, and the camera work is terrible. What really makes the film so special is how bad all actors are. Cheesy.
