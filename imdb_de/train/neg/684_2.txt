Could not believe it! Cut off sentences? Good grief! You know what? Everything is true! Real people ever talk like that? Do not think so good girl! Stout guy! Stiffen upper lip! Only reason given Film 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such a court. Film as a whole ridiculous if you do not like to see endless biplane dogfights. Anyway, they seemed endless. Remember that all dialogues are synchronized by Franchot Tone. When Crawford and Young make a special effort to be British, they are Irish. Practical tip - we Brits cut words, not sentences. And somehow we make it to draaaaaaaaawl at the same time. But that is only the case if we were in a really good public school (which is private for you).
