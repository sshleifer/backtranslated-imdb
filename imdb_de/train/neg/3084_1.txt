that's the result. A trash movie that is not even classified as a movie, but just a bunch of stuff on a roll of film, that makes no sense at all. Now to the actors, who seem to be just a few friends from the beginning, who thought they would get some money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror movie. Well, it's a big horror anyway, as a movie not to think at all. In "Hobgoblins" there are a lot of terrible actors, but the worst is the main guy named Richard, who's just too much of a weakling to even find a root. Well, if you occupy a group of friends and try to make the movie scary with less than a small budget, so will it. Well, at least the MST3K version was weird. But this is still a horrible movie that deserves all the fiddling it gets. 9 for the MST version.
