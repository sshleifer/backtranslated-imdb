Without the "oh so gourgous," Natassia Malthe, this B-movie would not have been worth any sector of my Tivo storage! In which warehouse with low rent was the supposed spaceport turned? "Continuity people!" It is a basic principle when filming! At night a supposed spaceport and by day (day and night on a space station?) A warehouse! ??!? People please! The only thing I will recommend for this film is the wardrobe department. for uninterrupted keeping Natassia in this tight shape and revealing outfits! Even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the outfits she obviously spent every day filming! The sci-fi channel could have shown better SpaceBalls! At least there would have been a sense of humor in seeing something so incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S. Michael Ironside, please shoot your agent as soon as possible! You are so much better than actors that you are even connected to this level of filmmaking.
