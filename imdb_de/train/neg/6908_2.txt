This series had potential, but I suppose the budget does not allow that potential. An interesting setup that does not differ from "lost" falls flat after the first episode. The entire series of 6 episodes could have made a compelling 90-minute film, but the creators decided to keep pulling it. Many scenes were unbearably slow and long, without pushing the action forward. The music was very annoying and did not work. There were few characters that mattered to us because their characters were not up to the timescale. Well, one has grown a bit. The end was just as terrible as the rest of the series. The only kudo here is for the art department and the stage designers, they created an interesting look, too bad, the author and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with this element
