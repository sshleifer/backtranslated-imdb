This is the second movie I saw for horror festival last weekend, The Gravedancers is the first. Gravediggers were better. I can only assume that the production must have been quite limited. I admit that the story started interesting, but in the end it was completely confused to me. We did not really have the time to understand or understand the characters, which only made their unpredictable characteristics even more annoying. I have to mention that it was a bit wrong when a twelve-year-old boy acted as sheriff. The only reason I went through the movie was to find out what the big secret was, which turned out to be less interesting. A little more background on the family would have helped, but they did not really seem like a family at first. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is so amateurish that I could not even see it on DVD. The four reviews relate to the initial potential of the story. This was one that should be missed for a horror test.
