Oh my. I decided to go to the cinemas with some friends, watch one of those mild, good-natured Christmas movies, and I go out in disgust. The movie failed. Point. Paul Giamatti, whom I consider a good actor, has played his character and just played a terrible role, along with Vince Vaughn, who has always been my personal favorite. They try to turn a Christmas movie into a new style. Somehow bad, mixed with good, but everything turned out to be wrong. The first ten minutes were not that bad, but when we saw Santa, it was over. It did not get any better, the rate stayed the same, there was NO character development and is certainly one of the worst Christmas movies ever invented. Do not look at it, whatever you do.
