Oh my dear, this movie was bad for different reasons. I was expecting to see a very low score for this movie, and was a bit surprised by the overall rating. Sad, but as high as many, is a joke! Once you've gone through the one-shot black-and-white movie gimmick, which was a good idea, the movie continues with a running time of just 66 minutes. The guy at the beginning was so annoying: In the van, the guys are suffering from a tire and changing their bike, wow, that was necessary in the story! How slowly did the boys chase and actually manage to hurt Campbell? They did not seem to bother pursuing him ... sigh ... I'm just too glad I got that for free with a special edition of Evil Dead !!
