I could not stand to go through the whole movie. Are there really such families anywhere? There have been many comments in which this family was related to LLBean models and the like, and I think that this is a great description of their behavior. In high school called "pigface", which naturally turns into a dazzling 20- and Harvey-trained plastic surgeon (but only to do good in the world - not for the money), and she embeds Steve Carrel on the first day. Then I stopped watching ... <br /> <br /> If you can completely put your disbelief out for two hours, then you might enjoy that sentimental, selfish waste of time.
