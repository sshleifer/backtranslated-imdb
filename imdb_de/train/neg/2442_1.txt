I do not know why I keep doing this for myself !! I continue to defend the Dutch and Belgian cinema, claiming that there should be more credit and opportunities ... and then they are killing you with such a mess! Intensive Care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing ever produced in Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our own horror franchise, which is clearly based on American Slasher classics like Friday, the 13th and Halloween. The producers and authors aimed very high, but fell very low. Intensive Care became an embarrassing product for everyone involved and therefore a cult movie. It is almost impossible to find an original copy of it, and it is shown only on special occasions, such as "The Night of Despair." For exactly five minutes Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even create a plot line ... then it turns into a lame and mind-boggling Slash 'n Stalk movie with cruel - but very funny and cheap - effects. The acting of the entire cast is disgusting, even if there are some respected names. The lead role for men is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy could be the best known and most beloved artist in Belgium. He is a popular singer, presenter of TV shows and idol of many young girls. He never mentions this thing in which he played. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, he tries to convince himself that Intensive Care has never happened.
