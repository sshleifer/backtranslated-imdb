1st viewed 16.02.2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery / Thriller with too many ridiculous plot-turns. Despite the very talented cast, this film is way too predictable and the audience is simply underestimated. The public of the film is not stupid, and I hope certain star bags are not replenished over and over again, even though they are busy. We think that this film is initially about Connery's belief in the punishment of the Capitol, but it turns out that it is nothing more than a standard created for the public. We are drawn into every stupid change of character as they are presented to us when needed in the story, and we are ready for that thing to end a long time ago. Yes, there is a good spectacle here, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in a psycho-supporting role, but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the long-awaited end.
