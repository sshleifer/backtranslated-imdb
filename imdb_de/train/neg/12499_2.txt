I saw the movie as a sneak preview in Austria. I had no idea what I would see. The story is very normal. The movie is very long, I think it could have reduced to 1/2 without affecting the story. It's the kind of movie you can see on a boring night that you want to bore more! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is fine. The film talks about the US Coast Guards, their education, their lifestyle and the problems they face. There are not many effects in the movie. So if you want to see it, you do not have to waste any money or time on going to the movies. It would be more effective if you watch it at home if it contains DVDs.
