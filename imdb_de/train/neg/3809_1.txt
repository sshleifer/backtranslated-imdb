This show is just annoying !!! I'm so sorry for the actors that they tried to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the laugh track tries to cover up the sad jokes, and the track "Awwww" comes at the most unnecessary times. The overdramatic children are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. This show is also a cliche city. If you looked up the word cliche it would be "Full House". Every story has a "hour of life" that must be learned in the end. A juicy speech makes everything better and even has the ability to bring the bravest child to a sudden realization of the quality of CFSP, which is not possible in real life. I do not know how anyone can see this show without abusing the characters' behavior or the laughter track. I yell at the TV and say, "THIS IS NOT FUNNY / SAD / LOW". If life really were like this, the world collapsed.
