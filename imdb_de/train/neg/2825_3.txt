This week I just thought it would be fun to meet Corey Haim after seeing the two "Lost Boys" movies last week and all. Not that I'm a fan boy - not nearly - but I liked the two Coreys in earlier movies in my early teens. <br /> <br /> So I prepared for three movies with him. Unfortunately I chose "Dream Machine" first (never seen before), and it was so god fearing that I decided to lock Corey back in my closet and let him sober up before I dive into something else his. However, I managed to fight through this movie first. I had the impression that he wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986), but was involved in his own delusions. Virtually the whole movie wants to be a comedy and in the end he desperately tries to be a thriller. The only good thing about "Dream Machine" is the premise: a corpse in the trunk of a Porsche. The rest is so bad, it's embarrassing. Even the best for Haim. I can unearth him as his young, enthusiastic self, but at least when he is provided with a kind of directorial statement. This was clearly not the case with "Dream Machine". So we have a perfect car, yes, this black Porsche. Haim's perfect girlfriend? Only a blond chick who has hardly any lines in the movie. The perfect murder ... almost? One guy who falls on his ass as the film's villain, tries the whole movie to steal the body out of the trunk is never really successful, and at the end of the movie he thinks he's Michael Myers (minus the white William) Shatner Mask) and mistaken Corey Haim for Jamie Lee Curtis. I do not think she could have made that punch if they tried. A silly, funny movie with a story that is nowhere led by a director who does not know how to control his cast. Good job! <br /> <br /> One last question for Mr. Haim: who had the idea to make you smile directly into the camera in this last movie? Your or the director? Not done
