This "movie" is the culmination of everything that is bad for modern film. unnecessary slow motion, unnecessary turning around / jumping / somersaults, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogues ... basically unnecessary. (Is that a word? Well, it was just invented by I, Robot.) <br /> <br /> What happened to practicability? (That is, the auto repair shop, the skin spray) The only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the ticket in the cafÃ©. (ie the character of the blacksmith does the doctor only most of the film, and yet she still "wants" it.) WHERE IS THE TENSION? I tell you where it looks good and not admiration or togetherness) /> <br /> What happened to a detective who discovered? Smith just sat down and felt sorry for himself, complaining to others, and when they said something that triggered a thought, he was gone. This is a lame way to get the story from point b-c-d-etc ... once it was OK but not several times in a row. (Speaking of several episodes, what was that "I'm snoring and not listening to your joke?" Twice In One Scene?) <br /> <br /> What happened when the small parts in a movie are meaningful? Shia LaBeouf (the kid) is featured in the TWO SCENE movie, we know that A-he demotes women, and B-he knows Smith ... so of course we should take care of him and if he gets hurt or not. " br /> <br /> What happened to Heros? Let's not forget that there are people, women and children everywhere who are attacked by robots and who selfishly save the only ones. In my opinion I have a friend and why did he have to Bicycling through the air and showing off while the doctor was able to reach the same distance within a few seconds Do not get me wrong, I'm all for the spectacle, but I'm just for a wealth of realism and meaning I have to say I have never really laughed so hard in a movie I n long time. thanks Alex. <br /> <br /> I'm praying for the kickback of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques, simpler stories and just about everything else in movies ... but mostly simpler techniques. <br /> <br /> Big budget action movies: "You have to die"
