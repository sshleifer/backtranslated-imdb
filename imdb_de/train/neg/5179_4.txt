Without effective enjoyment of mankind's supernatural or poetic motivational scheme, this creative team must only hope for the effective use of its mediocre, unoriginal elements. "Party of Five" has gone crazy, then genetically inevitable, there is little interest, as the only non-murderous element is a second-rate, terrible, terrible-looking "Wes Bentley" -mester. In fact, everything is effectively up close. Although the dark-haired women appeal, the excitement is reduced to a minimum. No nudity here. There are also missing enough buckets of blood. All sensations are kept in an exciting, safe distance ... an unfortunate fact, if one calls the name of the directors a "butcher". Only the soundtrack, the booming fearful Altland and the tense fluctuating Score provide a noticeable tension. Sometimes some static storyboard compositions add appealing low-angles that add to the discomfort ... But for a movie that calls itself horror, I did not even come close to wincing. Perhaps a greater emphasis on social rejuvenation through blood-gathering, scenes focused on various geometric shapes outside the square, and a sustained focus on playfulness through the malignancy of the family or the traps that sympathetic characters must escape to avoid their dilemma, had my opinion improved This was not a good start for my trip through Horrorfest.
