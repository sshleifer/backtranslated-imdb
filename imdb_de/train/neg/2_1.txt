I saw the comment of the capsule "great spectacle". In my opinion, these are two great actors who give awesome performances and zero chemistry to a great director. Robert De Niro must be the most ingenious and enlightening illiterate of all time. The performance of Jane Fonda moves uncomfortably on the whole map, as she obviously has no influence on this character, mainly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses-like would be too quickly an adjective for the tormenting pace of this film. Although the film wants to be an uplifting story of the cure of illiteracy, watching is a real "crap". I give him 1 in 10, really one of the worst 20 movies I've ever seen.
