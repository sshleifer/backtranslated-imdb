I'm a big fan of Martin Amis, whose book is based on this film. Unfortunately, the director could not transfer the book to the screen. The novel is through and through postmodern and highly artificial in its wildly exaggerated characters and the disintegration of traditional plot and character development. It's a funny exploration of the human greed, overabundance, and emptiness of one of the most moral British writers of the day. The director of the film has completely missed the sense of the novel. In his hands the film screams at breakneck speed to enjoy every known trick recording and the "odd" camera angle. It's acid like Ken Russel, and suffers from the senior director's indulgence increasing to a hundred. Not even the (short) view of the penis of the great actor Christian Solimeno was enough to save this miserable movie for me. Miserable!
