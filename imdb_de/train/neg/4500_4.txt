This movie is really not terrible. Someone commented that Mo was the kind of American European who snuggled up. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon, Yahoo who do not care about French; and the Xavier character will not influence her. <br /> <br /> Let's look at his stereotypical French attributes: <br /> <br /> 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check. <br /> <br /> 2). Piebald, lined look, despite: <br /> <br /> 3). A great appreciation of the kitchen. Check. <br /> <br /> 4). Lukewarm work ethic. Check. (Forget about the fact that he's supposedly a prolific stockbroker, he seems to look at him in the movie as if he's been working ten hours a week.) <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful woman, check. Nevertheless: <br /> <br /> 6). Loose interpretation of the marriage promise. Check. <br /> <br /> 7). Great sexual ego that says an American girl owes you sex when you buy her dinner. Check. <br /> <br /> Whether Mo is a hiccup or not, there is no reason for them to be interested in this complacent European unless the script dictates. <br /> <br /> On the other side Like other male reviewers, I enjoyed seeing Karen Allen's sweet, petite body. I will give the movie four stars; two of them are for it.
