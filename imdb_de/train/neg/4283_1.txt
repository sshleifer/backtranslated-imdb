Unfortunately it is true. "Legiunea sträinä" discloses the parameters of irreversible failure of Daneliuc with absolute clarity. As I said earlier, the author lost the ability to merge his content-related factors and artistic intentions into a coherent form. Maniac deals with the mechanical trick of selecting random news topics and joining them together without legitimacy. He only collects a messy pile of events and can not pursue the slightest action. The level of the screenplay resembles a lay play "Cântarea României" on the glorious achievements of socialist realism - turned upside down: while the communist line deals only with positivism and sugar-like festivism, Daneliuc is now obsessed obsessed with negativism and disgusting obsession Scatology. The content of the ideas is zero and the "message", infantile and didactic, at kindergarten level. Unfortunately, he has forgotten even the most elementary professional principles. He is no longer in a position to organize a dramatic situation, to arrange it into a real film scene, frame it properly and work it according to the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. His level of narration in movie images resembles expressing something like, "Holy Tin Man, it's not crazy, and all people are asses!" What a great distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984, who created unique works such as "Cursa", "Proba de microfon", "Vânätoarea de vulpi" and even "Croaziera" and "Glissando" ... Sic transit gloria mundi ...
