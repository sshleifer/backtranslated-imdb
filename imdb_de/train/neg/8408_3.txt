Wow, that's very unusual in a sense: Usually, the first movie in a long series of sequels is the best. People are surprised when a sequel is actually better. With Tarzan, I thought that movie was the worst of all, or at least the first six that included my Tarzan Collection DVD package. I'll take a look at the sequels several times, but thanks to several characters, I've gone through the turkey. <br /> <br /> Well, let's start with the good news first: <br /> <br /> THE GOOD - Lots of action with lots of wildlife, even if it's archive material. You see lion attacks, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you name it, and you see various tribes of all kinds, including pygmies (called "dwarfs" in the movie). Since this movie was made nearly 75 years ago, I have nothing to do with realism because they were not in the movies long ago. They do the best they can to endure actors who talk about the wrong backgrounds. However, Weissmuller has made many action scenes and was in great shape. He and O'Sullivan make a well-built, pretty couple, if there ever was a couple in those golden years of cinema. <br /> <br /> The film has a historical value (with so many sequels) that it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and his beginnings to learn the English language. <br /> <br /> The BAD - From the moment Tarzan takes "Jane Parker," almost every scene with her, Maureen O'Sullivan, is in hysterical, screeching, screaming scene after the scene. It's enough to give you a headache and ruin the movie. Luckily, she calmed down in the sequels, but not in this movie. The film also does not like the image of "The Great White Hunter" when C. Aubrey Smith, who plays Jane, and Neil Hamilton, as "Harry Holt," the safari guide, shoot at each animal in sight, whether the Animals threaten or not. These people are very happy, especially Smith. On the other hand, it is too bad that here is nothing Tarzan has ever seen in the jungle. There is no story of him here or pictures of his growing up. He's just there when Jane and the group reach a certain point in Africa.
