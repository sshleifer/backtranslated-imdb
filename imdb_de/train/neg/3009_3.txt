This song continues to buzz in my head. Not the best song, but it's the 80s. This movie is about a singer who is "allegedly" killed while being charged with murder while chasing down his girlfriend, who sings backup vocals in his band. The singer, whose name is Billy "Eye" (yes, right), is dead after two years and his band comes back for a concert, only the backup singer is this time the singer. Billy chases her and eventually goes around killing all these people and scares the girl, making people around her think something is wrong with her and that she's imagining things. She finally decides to go to a cemetery and dig up his grave to see if he is still there. She sees that he is dead, but still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the movie, we learn the reason for all this, Billy has a brother named John (right again) and John admits he was jealous of his brother and has killed all these people to put him back to blame take his brother and then his girlfriend and terrorize her for calling him crazy. The end is very naughty and the acting is very lame and wooden. But .... I like it anyway. I look at the song. I wish I had it.
