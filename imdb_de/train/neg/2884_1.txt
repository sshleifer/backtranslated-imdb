While working in a video library, I felt it was my duty to talk about the worst movies I have ever seen and to warn my friends and colleagues about them. During one day of the most heated debate about the worst movie, my friend B.T.K. Killer, even if he could see the whole movie and still claim that my previous choice was the worst movie ever, he would see him. I lost. I think I made better videos even in high school, and these were hardly great accomplishments by a young genius. Not only did it have an apparent production value (it seems to have been filmed on a bad camcorder, though it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (wooden, hollow and pathetic surface will not scratch). as well as only generally bad movie feeling. I remember a scene where I heard Glassplash. Suddenly I was reminded of a few bad high school songs (I know that I often go to high school here, but this movie seemed to be very youthful) It seemed a bit too fake, but also as if people were lining up their lines read the script and do not know exactly what is really going on. My film does not do justice to this film because I can not describe how awful the time was when I saw it. It's almost ironic that I'm doing a miserable job describing a pathetic apology for a movie.
