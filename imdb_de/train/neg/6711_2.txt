1993 was the year. This was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas won an Oscar. Who would have thought that I would be extra with him in a movie? I was actually a paid extra in "My Boyfriend's Back," filmed in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thank God the producers had a change of heart!). I was in the theater scene. I rushed out to watch the movie the day it appeared in theaters. It's more of a comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh you should maybe give it a try. Nothing is near "Dawn of the Dead" or even "Shaun of the Dead", but the cheese factor is good enough. Ciao
