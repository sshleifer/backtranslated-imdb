An old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies. You get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and other stuff before the 80s. To disguise that he has no idea what's going on in these movie theaters these days, he throws The Matrix along. <br /> <br /> But it's not just the same lame movie-as-art speech. This speech is reduced to obsolete psychological platitudes: it-ego-super-ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /> <br /> It is garnished with the cheesy effect of having Zizte incorporated into the films he has recorded. For someone who needs to know a lot about movies, his own film is: yeiks. <br /> <br /> To put it in Zizek's own words: I had 5 \ - \! 7 Seen on the screen Or in the words of a great filmmaker: <br /> <br /> Mr. (Zizek), what you've just said is one of the craziest idiots I've ever heard. At no point in your desperate, incoherent response, have you even been near anything that could be thought of as rational. Everyone in this room is stupid now because he heard it. I give you (only two) points and may God have mercy on your soul.
