Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) celebrated with her friends at the lake when her brother fell out of a boat and drowned. Rachel's friends believe it's time she stopped beating herself and blaming herself for something she had no control over. Grab the brew and something to chew and return to the same lake that has been in Rachel's constant nightmares. As expected, a bloodbath has already started when two friends are splattered before going to the party. This strip has the feel of a high school game in which all of its lines have forgotten and "winged" ... very bad! The writer Marcos Gabriel took over the fleshier role as Rachel's friend Leo. Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel, there are some pretty lame acts and a few characters that you want to stifle the crap before they get "off". Attention to a few more players who had the courage to show up: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is a memorable day that you would like to forget.
