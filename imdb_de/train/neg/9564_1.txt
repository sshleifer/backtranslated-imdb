Some people seem to think that this was the worst movie they've ever seen, and I understand where they're from, but I've really seen worse. <br /> <br /> That is, the movies I can remember The worse ones (ie those I did not block) were so bad that they physically hurt every feeling that had to do with the movie , Worse than War Games 2, those movies are the ones that make you want to stick your eyes out or put sharp objects in your ears to prevent yourself from losing another piece of your soul to fearlessness. > <br /> War Games: The Dead Code is not that bad, but comes pretty close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but no, I did not expect any miracles from this. Let's face it, the original was not that great of a movie, it was basically just a teenage romance movie from the 80s with a bit of geek appeal. <br /> <br /> That's all I was hoping for a bad thing, but that could have tugged at my geek strings. Was that too much to ask? Is not it really possible to achieve better results than the original War Games, even for direct publication of the video? Well, apparently that was too much to ask. Stay away from this movie. In the beginning it's just bad, like "Oh yeah, that's bad, but I like it somehow, maybe the end will be as good as the original one." And then it gets worse and worse, and in the end trust me, you wish you had not seen this movie.
