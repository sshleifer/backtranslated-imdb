When I rented this movie, I had very low expectations ... but when I saw it, I realized that the movie was less (much less) than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... it might work for a Disney movie (except for the murders), but this is not a comedy, it's a ridiculous masterpiece of Stupidity The title is well chosen except for one thing: you could add silly movies to Dead Husbands! I give it 0 and a half out of 5.
