I recently caught up with Marilyn Miller's films because they are not shown on TCM in the UK. I was very fascinated over the years because this was one of the superstars of the 20's. What she really likes For some stars of this era like Jolson, some of the magic still seems to get through, but unfortunately not for Miller. Her dance seems awkward and badly choreographed, her vocals are somewhat limited and as an actress she makes Ruby Keeler like Hepburn. This film was canceled as the audience of musicals got tired, virtually all musical numbers. So we have a comedy left over from that time, with little real attraction. She was paid $ 500,000! Either she was badly served by the cinema or she had no talent at all. I think the truth is closer than the former.
