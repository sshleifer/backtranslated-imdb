That was so lame that I turned off the DVD ... maybe halfway. It was so weak that I could not even pay enough attention to tell you how far I've got it. Although I really wanted to believe that the portrayal of the young Carlito would be a bit different, I just could not buy it. I do not really blame the actors because I think it was the script that may have gone flat. I had to laugh a few times, but I do not think these lines should be funny. <br /> <br /> It's just saving that I bought it in a 2-DVD set and paid for it the price I made for the original alone. This is one of the cases where the classic should be left alone.
