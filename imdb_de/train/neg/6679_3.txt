Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998) returned with this film. <br /> <br /> The film has Govinda in 8-9 rolls when his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later he's disguised. <br /> <br /> He's a useless detective by one Friend is sent on a case to get evidence against his wife, whose photos he loses at the airport while flirting with Rani. He disguises himself as Sardarji in the plane and again as a girl The funny part is how easily and in a short time he does that? Then he disguises himself as a French singer and enters a TV to get proof and then as Maharashtrian (yes on TV itself). <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has the same false identities and ends with a predictable note. There are some funny scenes of how Govinda is beaten by an African and many others Portions <br /> <br /> Director: Manoj Agrawal is okay Music is okay <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Govinda proves again, that he is one of the most observable actors. He is a fan as always. Although he has done such roles before he fits in with all the constructions and roles, the much-hyped 6-7-reels do not really fit into the movie where Rani looks fat. She works well with Govinda thatz together nothing great and did such roles. Under Calm, Nirmal Pandey is as usual Johny Lever is sometimes too loud and funny in places in a role and gets annoyed when the older Tinnu Anand is okay. Satish Kaushik is funny, Paresh is fine
