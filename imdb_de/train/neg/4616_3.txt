This movie did not age well. Maybe it's just the impact and artful characterization, acting and direction we saw with The Sopranos, but I first watched Prizzi's Honor on DVD for the first time. The experience of watching it was quite different 24 years ago with an audience, but I have to say I was just appalled by the end. Not just the violence, but the very idea that this would somehow be a satisfying ending. <br /> <br /> I like a good shocker, but that seemed so uncharacteristic ... Even when was this movement supposed to be stopped? The cars all seemed to date from the 1960s, yet the towers of the World Trade Center (completed in 1973) were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes. <br /> <br /> Another way in which the film has aged badly is The mere idea that a passenger could travel with a knife from coast to coast was somehow fascinating and funny. In the mid-eighties, you meet the late ears: only you can live.
