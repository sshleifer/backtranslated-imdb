I only gave this movie a single star because it was impossible to give it less. Scientists have developed a formula to replicate every organism. In their lab (a dilapidated warehouse in L.A.) they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies breaks in to steal the formula, and the rest of the movie is an endless chase. <br /> <br /> Of course, the T-Rex (a rubber doll) dissolves and begins to wipe out the film's cast. It has the amazing ability to be within 2 or 3 feet of someone without noticing that he notices it, and then bites his head off. <br /> <br /> An actor escapes in a police car and spends the rest of the movie driving around the city aimlessly. She is so mentally superior that she can not even serve the radio. She never makes an effort to drive to a substation or a donut store, and seems hopelessly lost. <br /> <br /> The T-Rex has caused havoc throughout the city, there are firefights and buildings (cardboard models). Blowing up, but a single police car or the army or anyone else. Such activity must be commonplace in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that a sequel is not planned.
