Heavy moralism. Writers who use characters as mouthpieces to speak for themselves. Predictable plotter points (say that five times fast). Imitation of a child by Britney Spears. This movie has all the features of a lifelong special. <br /> <br /> I really believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo have set out to make a thoughtful, emotional film about a difficult subject to explore the idea of ​​these things. It's not always black and knows that the person who is criminal by definition is not necessarily a bad person and that there can be extenuating circumstances, especially when a child's wellbeing comes first. Their seriousness, however, is channeled into a sermon dialogue and banal situations in which the plot proceeds. The decent production values ​​and the interesting use of documentary camera material are not enough to reach their goal if the script and acting diminish. <br /> <br /> The logic is often compromised to create tension: Soid first tries to blackmail Pablo to help with their documentation, in return helping to help them escape, and in the same breath he basically tells him he should not trust her because she does not help them out of altruism. Well, you are. And for a man on the run, Pablo is far too angry. Cristina's well-being is so important to him that he is imprisoned and imprisoned or deported for her, but he is willing to risk all this to appease her if she does not want to go to Mexico. Law. Talk about exaggerated parenting. Third, when Pablo's employer Charlie Detective Bright gives the phone, she's remarkably unprofessional, especially considering her seniority. Did she really think she was convincing? Oh, yes, I would have gone crazy. CCH Pounder's Detective Wims could wipe the floor with her. <br /> <br /> To be fair, I would like to list the things that I liked. Um, I liked the dwarf. And I liked the fact that the dwarf was called Sexy. There is cross-dressing, always a plus; juvenile cross-dressing, not less! Harry is infinitely cuter than Cristina. But my favorite moment in the movie must be when Cristina Detective enters Not-So-Bright. I also find it interesting that in a heavily populated minority (which, by the way, I really appreciate) the black character is the racist one. Too bad it just gets thrown out there and will not be explored further. <br /> <br /> There is an unmistakable, unconventional score, but it is generally context-unspecific and does not enhance mood or tension in any scene, except the miserable, painful lamentation Every time the main character is in fear than would they think his acting does not show it enough: "Just in case you were not sure, he is upset and we have the musical clues to prove it." <br /> <br /> Stilted, cliched dialogue leads to depressing lack of subtext; Everything has to be determined in dialogue, even though the body language was good until it was mediated. For example, any passionate speech Pablo makes, and Mrs. Knight's complaint that her child can not crawl into bed with them in the morning. <br /> <br /> Papi, tell me again about Mama - what a shameless, stark show that introduces the generic dead woman! (She's always the most beautiful woman the widower ever saw, the friendliest he'd ever met, why can not we see a man cry over a woman like Shakespeare's? She may be fat, ugly, abominable, but his love it's deep like the oceans, well, there's a story that would move me.) The police, who are literally always a step behind them, give many scenes the feel of a French farce. Most boring chases - Bright and Lightning are so inappropriate and easy to fool (he's by no means lightning fast, and they, well, I do not feel the need to say things). A guy carrying a kid with him overhauling a bicycle cop, complete with a macho biker picking a fight but then being hit by a kid? It's so sad to quote Margaret Cho. Would we ever see this on "Cops"? <br /> <br /> Crazy and Exaggerated Deus ex machina: As an employer, would you really refuse to check your green card just because he's the author of an inspirational proverb on a poster behind your desk? <br /> <br /> Plus several scenes, including those mentioned above, are in danger of turning into pornography: 'Well, I'll do that favor for you, as long as you do something about it. I ...' I can almost see the Bowm Listen to Chicka-Bowm-Bowm. <br /> <br /> When the parents see the footage shot of Pablo's remorse, the mother's crazy mom feels the most real, but this is diminished by the fact that she is From an emotional language to a ballistic mindset, an ambivalent gaze would be more convincing. <br /> <br /> I'm in constant reverence for the stupidity of the main character doing conspiracy: a convenience store Without a mask holding up a dead girl's grave And why does not the mother recognize his face when she saw him before he left? "They seem to be very familiar ..." <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this completely unnecessary, somewhat unfounded scene with Soid and the artificially improved bartender? Character development? Tch. Too little too late. <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary features that have never gone anywhere, Detective Lightning says skeptically. Detective Bright has to be a scorpion who shows how little he really knows about the occult. And I do not believe that faith in fate is quite a voodoo mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> If Bright Pablo ends up dying - wait, why are you interested now? Her character is as contradictory as that of Soid. What, she has to shoot him just because she said, 'Stop, or I'll shoot'? (She's cared so much for her integrity so far.) He was unarmed. There was no need for deadly force. What's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him? Finally, Cristina's filial assumption of the death of her mother, Dr. Ing. Knight brought peace over the death of his daughter - so forced. And the helpfulness of the family whose child was killed to become Cristina's new family ... It annoys me that she could be a "substitute" for her little girl. It is also unrealistic for a white couple to absorb the Latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter. I'm not saying that there are no generous, loving people who would do that. I'm just saying that the characters here are never far enough developed to believe that they would do that. <br /> <br /> I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer, of course, as a woman, said she was moved by the sappy scenes. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that are not emotionally sentimental. Co-author, co-director and co-star Nebot said he himself had too many hats worn this production. Too many cooks may spoil the broth, but a cook alone could end up making a special for the school. <br /> <br /> Finally, the title of this film has less to do with the story, than with the feeling of remorse, helplessness and loss, the revelation accompanies you that you will never see your money again.
