I saw this movie in a sneak preview show and am glad I did not pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. It is full of tails and fart and does not take pride in the action sequences (like shooting in "Little Germany"). I have made a small list of things that I have enjoyed in the movie ... and of which I disagree. <br /> <br /> 1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. The fart jokes. 3. The poop jokes. 4. The guy was a pussy. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Again you make fun of Bush. WE GET THAT HE IS AN IDIOT. 8. The guy has blond hair. 9. The plot. 10. Killing Minors 11. Uwe Boll was there. 12. Most of the actors were just outrage and out there. <br /> <br /> Well the (few) good <br /> <br /> 1. The dude uses a cat as a muffler like in the game. 2. Lots of action. 3. Crotchy made a return (and a cameo from the manufacturer of Postal) 4. Uhm .. I did not have to pay for it. 5. There are a few "what the ef" moments <br /> <br /> Boll has done again. He made another crappy game in the movie adaptation. Kudos to you, Mr. Boll. 2.10
