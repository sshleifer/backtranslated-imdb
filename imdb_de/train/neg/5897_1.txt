Renowned Japanese director Takashi Miike seems to be getting the wheels moving with this Torpedo thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book about a nasty old woman (and a child molester!) That's part of a new legend in the city Mobile rings with a strange tone - and you see the message "One Missed Call" - you will only play the message to hear your last words before you die. The most successful part of the film is the straightforward satire of reality TV cameras that affect future victims, but the not-so-complicated deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) Are disappointing and daunting. Frequent shots of devastated corpses tend to be inconspicuous, and this general courtesy may explain why the movie is ultimately so quiet. Hollywood jumped predictably in 2008 on the far-fetched plot, but the US version did not fare better. NO STARS of ****
