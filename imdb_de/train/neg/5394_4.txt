I am irritated by the modern adaptations of Shakespeare when the director can not decide whether to use or update the original. If the original words are used in an updated setting, this is particularly difficult if it is set to the 20th or 21st century, although it may work well in period styles, e.g. For example, the late Victorian Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night. It could work with the attitude of the 1930s, if only song and dance were much less than the text of Shakespeare. Unfortunately it is a pretty banal but very pleasant show. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is too old to play any of the students, but more importantly, he is such an experienced Shakespearean actor despite all his efforts to be just another student, his acting strength is constantly showing. Of course he should have played the king - no problem if a mature student king is surrounded by younger students. Instead, we had a pleasant, but inconspicuous actor for the king, so a nondescript so-called King without Kingly properties. <br /> <br /> The amount of songs and dances that I found boring despite the beautiful songs and pleasant dancing unfortunately meant that the great Shakespeare dialogue had to be drastically reduced. The whole thing ends with a trivial and mild dressmaking, and I was bored, even in the comic phrases, and I was glad when it ended. Branagh did not do justice to Shakespeare in this production. <br /> <br /> But deserves Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, who are absolutely brilliant as the older couple.
