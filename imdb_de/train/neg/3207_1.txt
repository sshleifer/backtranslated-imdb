Oh my god, that was so bad! The story was weak at best and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This movie takes itself too seriously ... unless, of course, they wanted to be funny. I saw it last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the entire audience laughed at every scene. I think my favorite was, "Should not you study medicine at Oopsalof?" And I also think that they were trying to see how often in the single line of the character Nicalo "we will be together ... it is our destiny". I'm sorry, but after the first time the words have lost all meaning. <br /> <br /> And what about the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend this to the Americans as a lesson: they can not animate, so do not try. They are only ashamed.
