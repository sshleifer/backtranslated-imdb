Abstract: Seed is not worthless. It's just derivative and inferior. And soulless. <br /> <br /> Long Version: If you have never seen any of the movies that contain the vaguely-defined "psychological horror", this movie will probably melt your face. Maybe not, but it will burn you well. The opening session of the Real Animal Abuse will be enough to open your eyes to the possibilities of brutality in the video, and the (only) memorable Gore scene in the remainder of the movie may be more than you can handle. The climax will play with your emotions like no other movie might have. <br /> <br /> But that's when you do not have much experience with the genre. If you've seen the right ... "August Underground's Penance", for example, you'll find it hard to stay awake until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have compared this to the video drizzle of yesteryear. I understand this comparison. Like the video nasties, Seed is more violent than a mainstream horror movie and less subtle. But the reason we still know the video git is not just for the reasons mentioned above - those who are still popular have had something special. Allow me to be ambiguous, I think you will understand: those who stayed here had "soul". <br /> <br /> Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, director of "Burial Ground", for an interview with the New -ish DVD: "... we'll never have more movies like this because the technology is today And the technology is cold, so many things are going to go away because little movies like this one are out of production, today we have great, extraordinary tricks that are very expensive, but they are cold, today it costs horror , a terror movie of this kind more than a million dollars. These films were not so expensive ... they are real effects that are made with our hands. ". <br /> <br /> Maybe it's wrong to take the comparison with old-school horror so seriously. But Crisanti hit the nail on the head. Even in their seemingly exploitive exploits, the best videotapers followed a primitive "truth." And here is Boll missing. It's like he saw the films and did not understand them. Everything on the checklist is there ... BS about "a statement about humanity," an obscene torture scene, etc. But, as Crisanti says, it's "cold." The Gore is all CGI. The whole thing feels like scenes from other films of different genres. And the pace is sooooo slow. Man, so slowly. <br /> <br /> Another interesting note: The One Gore scene really reminded me of a video game. <br /> <br /> Anyway enough BS. Weak movie
