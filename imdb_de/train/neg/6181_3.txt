If you're a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of the Giant Leeches or Pinata Survival Island, this movie might be for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and did not even know what it is. This film exists until the day before its release when the advertising company Music Row panicked with dozens of flyers and billboards. In the cinemas, it took hardly two weeks anyway. <br /> <br /> Poor drama, bad writing and poor production are only beginning to describe this film's embarrassment. For a start, the names are a bit much: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> Toby's clumsy slow delivery of lines leaves one wondering which production assistant stuck the cue cards in front of the camera. Angel's character quickly switches from her city to a cowgirl who gets into southern slang after two days at the ranch. Her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of Toby's. In the final scene, her outfits are identical, and one wonders if the wardrobe assistant was called ill. <br /> <br /> The audio is inconsistent - perhaps the most striking example is when Toby decides to go swimming, and his voice suddenly sounds like he's screaming in a gym. <br /> <br /> There is never enough explanation or character development to satisfy what is happening on the screen. Exaggeration, annoyance, grimaces, and whimsy best describe the interpretation and direction of the awful script of the actors. <br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed after drinking a few alcoholic drinks and in the company of its most witty friends. But that does not say much.
