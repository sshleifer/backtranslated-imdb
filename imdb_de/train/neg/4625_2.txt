How can 4 out of 16 former voters give this movie a 10? How could more than half of the previous voters give a 7 or higher? Who chooses here? I can only assume that they are primarily children - very young children. The fact is that this is a bad movie in every way. The story is stupid. you can not imagine acting as acting; the characters are signless; and the dialogue is terrible. I've seen this one rainy afternoon on the sci-fi channel. In the sad case of being sent again and again, I suggest you read a book instead.
