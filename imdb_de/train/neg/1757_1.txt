Do not get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great figure skater. If there was someone who had earned his gold medal at the Olympics, then Dan. <br /> <br /> But how is it possible that Bill Corcoran made such a bad movie about the incredible Dan Jansen story, because that's really the case? The story of Dan Jansen is truly incredible! Above all, if you look at this film through the eyes of an athlete, everything is wrong, the way Matt Keeslar and the other actors are skating, their technique, the dimensions of the speedskating oval, everything is wrong! <br /> <br /> Pity about you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points
