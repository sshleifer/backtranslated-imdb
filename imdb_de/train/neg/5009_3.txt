This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot did not make much sense and the drama was terrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she's usually a wonderful actress. I can not imagine why she chose this movie. Her character Piper is drunk almost the whole movie except for the opening scene. On the positive side, there were several points in the movie where acting was so bad that I actually laughed out loud. Still, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's only 80 minutes long, but that's 80 minutes of your life that you have wasted completely.
