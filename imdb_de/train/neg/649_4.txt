OK, this movie was made for one reason and only for one reason to make money! The producers obviously did not care to kill a classic horror movie. I knew that this movie would be shit as soon as it became a pg-13. How many pg-13 Slashers films have turned out to be good? That's like the question of how many women were on the moon? The answer is NOT !! Of course, Prom Night 1980 was not a masterpiece, but it certainly deserves to be recognized as a film that stays true to its genre and tries to be more than that. <br /> <br /> My problem with Prom Night 2008 is the way he treats the killer and I have 3 big problems with him ..................... <br /> <br /> 1) The way he escapes, he was imprisoned in a psychiatric hospital and escaped by air conditioning !! WHAT THE HELL? Why should they have air conditioning in the patient room? Do you want him to feel comfortable during his stay or something? 2) His intentions are somewhat uncertain, the killer wants all the main victims and friends dead so he can have them all to himself. He says he loves her, but the next minute he tries to kill her, love her or just rape her? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all his skills? He used to be a teacher, and in that one scene where he kills the friend of the main victims while he's basically asleep and does not notice them, all this is stupid 2 out of 10 horrible, stupid, stupid attempt at a horror movie
