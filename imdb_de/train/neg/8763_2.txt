I thought I read somewhere that this was the last Monogram production, but whether that's true or not does not matter, because if not, it should have been. It's a deadly boring affair where John Carradine starred in gray hair to appear like an older scientist experimenting with the help of his young apprentice (Robert Shayne) to bring the dead back to life. Each time their subjects are revived, they seem to have a whitish face like marble while lying on the lab bench (big deal). Carradine manages to bring his faithful dog back to life after his death, and the mutt gets the unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostly way (wooooooooohhh). That's all she wrote. <br /> <br /> For a super cheap monogram quickie, this thing will at least use a fancier lab than is usual. The funniest joke in the movie is that the "older" doctor Carradine constantly refers to his "young" assistant Shayne as "m'boy", even though Carradine was actually 40 and Shayne was 45 when they did that!
