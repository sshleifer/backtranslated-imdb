The writing on screen is so stupid that it hurts me to waste 2 hours of my life. I will never come back (where have I heard that before). Acting is so-so. Things often change enough to watch and wait for something cruel to happen. Nevertheless, there is not a single original in this film. While the first cube was a nerd-like horror movie that did not make much sense in the end, the Cube-Zero understood that and tried to recount exactly the same story, unless this time it makes an awkward attempt to explain every detail that the first movie did not answer. The funny thing is, the director recycles the exact scenes of the first movie, which were a bit strange, and tries to explain them. The scenes are only copied, there is no connection. This script is sooo pointless. I imagine it was written by a half-witted man who is 15 years old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project. The best part is at the end, they paralyze the "good" prodigy guy, and he becomes a backward guy in the first movie, and you see him when they find him in Cube in 1997 ("this room is green ...") , Goodie gooodie, clap, what a twist. First of all, what if you did not see the first one? Oh, another great idea: Instead of the numbers identifying the x, y, z coordinates of space (Cube 1997), this time there are 3 letters, each of which gives one of 26 possible coordinate values. Moron. Except for now, permutations do not make much sense anymore. So he lets the letters disappear before anyone can use them. I want my money back. <br /> <br /> I think I had to write that down as there are just so many bad, inconsistent or stupid ideas in this movie. Directors / authors should have talent.
