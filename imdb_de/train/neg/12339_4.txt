This comedy has some fun stuff, surrounded by a lot of fun stuff. Almost every scene in which the servants of the castle and their stupid antics are involved is a waste of time. And the conspiracy is so sloppy you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming, or they just did it all together. (* 1/2)
