Guy Ritchie's noble effort is crushed, crushed, raped, trampled, shot, stabbed, spit, beaten, sodomized, abused, and left dead by Madonna's dreadful performance. Her acting reminded a graduate of the Al Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie has made a somewhat noble attempt to repeat that, and if you exclude ALL scenes his wife was in, this is a fair film at best. I think the best acting job ever was that Guy consoled his wife, that her performance was good enough not to shoot again. If you have the opportunity to see Swept Away or cut your toenails for 89 minutes, go to the Advanced Pedicure.
