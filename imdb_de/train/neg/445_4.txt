One thing that astonished me about this film (and not in a good way) was that Nathan Stoltzfus, who is proud to be the greatest historian on Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians working on this film Many of the actual events have been changed or ignored. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said that Trotta said it was never intended for Lena to put Goebbels to bed, but why did she give the impression that this was the case? Why not point out other possible reasons for the release of the men, such as the catastrophe of Stalingrad or the fear of the Nazis that the international press based in Berlin would learn of the protest. <br /> <br /> Also, why did the entire plot play a secondary role over a weak family plot that was made over and over again? Certainly something as grand as his own story could carry! In some places it seemed that the film had two storylines that seemed to have very little in common. Overall, this film missed its goal of drawing attention to a little known act of resistance, which is a shame, because better done, it could have had a big impact.
