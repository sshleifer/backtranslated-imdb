GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands 2005). <br /> <br /> The mouse Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties who finds out that her husband (Fedja van Huet) is cheating on her, but she does not. I dare to confront him. She painfully avoids any confrontation with people, her parents and her sister. So we have a main character in a feature film that does not do much. We hardly know anything about their background or their motivations. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a dead end, not just during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why do we have to suffer in the audience too? <br /> <br /> I almost gave up the cinema after seeing this insurmountable chaos. These were very boring and painful 90 minutes. I usually try to avoid wasting energy for bad movie production. I take the beating and roll with the punches, but in this case there is a proper warning. How on earth did Nanouk Leopold (mostly publicly funded) receive funding for this turkey? Obviously there was no script to speak out. It could be compensated by a brilliant filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with something more appealing. Not at all, only a vaguely defined concept: "I want to do something from the point of view of a woman". The result is more of an insult than a tribute to a female life perspective. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, there is no interesting setting throughout the movie. I can not think of a cast that could spice up that spice, but Johanna ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible, with that horrible lack of material. I try to imagine how Leopold had tried to direct Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look on the horizon, we film you for three minutes, express only sadness." A perfect remedy for insomnia. Get a copy and watch late into the night to make you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
