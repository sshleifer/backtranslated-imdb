I had high hopes in this movie, even though it was badly rated in the newspaper. I was extremely tolerant and sat through the whole movie. In the end I felt pretty ill. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not in the least awestruck or particularly sensitive to tasteless movies, I've both enjoyed Woody Allen's "Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sex." , "And Michael Hannekes" Funny Games "- I found the directors' obsession with drinking this ten-year-old women's milk really sick. And when the movie reached its climax in an "orgy" in which the boy was drinking both breast milk and the woman he had been craving for the movie, I almost vomited in revulsion for total perversion and the sentimental pope is. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema and independently produced films, so I would have loved this movie enormously. Avoid this movie at all costs, it should go down as a lesson in bad cinema in the annals of history.
