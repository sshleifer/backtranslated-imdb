I never wanted to see this movie, and one day I saw it as a joke to see how bad it was; My prejudices have been confirmed. <br /> <br /> At the beginning I would like to question the politics of the film. It hides behind a mask of women who make it big in the city, but women can only achieve it through their sexuality and not their intelligence or abilities. These women are not the whores anymore. Can not a little less attractive girls be successful? This is not the only right-wing message of the film, there are hundreds of pictures of American flags and huge amounts of money. A fine example of how the only powerful in America is capitalism, and something of intellectual, moral, or artistic value is not even looked into in this film. For the young people, money is the only important thing. <br /> <br /> The Bar Attorney states that she does not allow drug users in her bar, and then she goes on to the poor gallons of schnapps own neck and then the neck of her co-workers and customers. Anyone who knows anything about intoxicants will know that alcohol can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. <br /> <br /> And finally, why are there scenes in which the main character is sexually interested in the public (when she's undressed or with her boyfriend) is her dad always involved? We see her undressing, with the camera brushing her legs while she's calling her dad's phone. She "auctions" her father while she "auctions" her friend. I think that's very strange. <br /> <br /> In summary, this film is immoral, fascist, humiliating for women and, frankly, disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
