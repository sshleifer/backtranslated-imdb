I give this movie a 3, as it is worse than the cult movies that deserve a neat 2. Is that not useful for you? Well, that does not have to be. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rewrite, unbelievably idiotic storyline in which space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) fight a space race of idiots vamping as that? The only good thing about this film was Natassia Malthe with her stunning Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers would stop accepting stupid roles in stupid movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was nice! I know Mr. Ironside from many movies, he played in 164 movies at that time !! It is true that he rarely played in a lead role, but still!
