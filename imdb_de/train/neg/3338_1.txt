It took 9 years to complete this movie. I would think someone had said within those 9 years, hey, this movie is awful. I have seen better acting in porn movies. The story is tired and played. Abused child becomes a serial killer. How about something new for a change. How about a molested child who turns into a florist? At least that would have been a new twist. Why does anyone who has a camera and a film idea (especially unoriginal film ideas) believe that he can be a director? I admire the fact that they have been holding this film for 9 years to complete it. This shows perseverance and spirit. With this kind of drive, hopefully they can focus on a better script next time. If you want to see a failed indie filmmaking experiment by a Michigan author / director, read hate speech A minute If you want a good movie from a Michigan writer / director, stay with Evil Dead.
