It was a painful experience, the whole story is actually there, so I will not go into it, but the acting was terrible. There's this part at the very beginning, when the scientist's brother goes to work and actually wears a white coat at home before he leaves to work, I thought, working with biological material meant having sterilized clothing in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab. There is a filing cabinet on this monitor that has nothing to do with the whole scene. To make the place look technical, and a scientist actually has breakfast in the lab. Next to him is a biohazardous vessel, and his boss walks up to him and does not even tell him anything very badly it can not get worse than what my advice does not look at me, and I thought nothing could be worse than the house of the dead. Uwi Boll's films seem like classic Shakespeare in comparison!
