Thanks to a notorious home video distributor who introduced the so-called German Independent Series, Four For Venice is not only terrible, but really awful. So terrible that I dumped it in the second-hand department store for extra cash. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte are a couple who, due to his hectic scheduling, came to an agreement on sex only on Tuesday. Eva and Luis are a couple who lives from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and the artist Luis. Nick indirectly gets Eva to lose her job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte had an affair on the back of Eva and Nick. Luis betrayed Eva by luring her that he was going to London to do something related to his artwork. The fact is that he and Charlotte fly to adultery in Venice. Eva abducted Nick and dragged her two children to confront Venice. The trip to Venice causes both Nick and Eve to fall in love. <br /> <br /> The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy. Not only does it look pointless, it also wears out. In the film Nick tries to look for help in various ways, but it ends without success. It's either the strangers who act like idiots, or they're just stupid. The comedy also tended to add unnecessary scenes to prolong the story. While some of the problems that can be solved with common sense, nobody in the movie uses common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through a big round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It fails so much that even the beautiful landscapes in Venice do not scour the reputation of the film.
