Yes, I "get" Pasolini and his milieu, but at the same time I feel that his "decameron" is largely overrated and more than a little disconcerting. Overrated because the supposed "realism" he introduces (grueling masses, crumbling architecture, etc.) is challenged by the absurd and downright silly way the characters behave. In pursuit of realism, Pasolini employed many non-actors, but the deer with the headlights stares and the embarrassingly awkward lines lend the whole thing a terribly devious and unsteady feel. And frankly - many of the toothless people with dissimilar features are painful to look at. <br /> <br /> And Pasolini's "Decameron" is troubling (at least for me) because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content. Not because I'm prude or homophobic (I'm not one either), but because Pasolini places homoerotic images and situations in the foreground, which contradicts the neo-realism that he otherwise represents. You almost hear him say "Ooh - I have to put a cute, naked boy in this scene!" Sometimes it seems as if Pasolini is trying to criticize the gay angle, and sometimes because he enjoys this aspect himself, regardless of what his audience prefers. <br /> <br /> The Disorders Of the 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolini's "Decameron", Pasolini seemed to me to be a storyteller rather than an aspect of neo-realism. He seems to be bored with every story, so he sums it up a little convincingly and with little conviction. Even Pasolini's last line of dialogue in the film, which some people seem to find seemingly sparkling ("Why create a work of art when you dream it is so much sweeter?") Bother making a movie when it feels like that? In my opinion, Fellini's "Satyricon" is a much better movie (and with MORE homosexual content). It's also full of bizarre-looking people and absurd situations, but it does succeed through tempo, direction, and strong storytelling, while "Decameron" fails through the same elements.
