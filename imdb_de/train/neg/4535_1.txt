slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words that describe the film of the book. This is certainly a case in which the film should never have been made at the expense of the book. The best part of the film was the landscape, excellent. The worst part was the slow interactions of the actors, which combined with endless meaningful glances. The processing is abrupt and inconsistent. Nevertheless, the actors worked very hard, at least they tried to be a little credible with a horrible script. It was amazing that there were hardly any people of Peruvian descent in Peru - even in the flashback scenes showing Peru in the 17th century. If you have a sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
