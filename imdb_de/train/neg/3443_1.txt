I saw this movie last night and hoped for the best after seeing all the cool trailers. Even the cover of the DVD looked good. When I started to look at it, I thought like others, "Oh my god, what is that?". There were a few moments that were a bit scary, but then the mood was ruined by stupid music. Rock and opera were during what should be tense scenes. That's exactly where it ruined for me and I shook my head and thought damn that I was wasting money again A rental and was deceived by the cover art. Nothing against the music itself was only in the wrong parts of the movie. Whoever edited the movie has no idea what he is doing. The cover showed a lightning bolt, suggesting that they were caught in a movie storm at sea. That would have been more interesting, but it did not happen. Acting was not the worst thing I've ever seen, considering that they're all unknown and this is obviously the first movie. Another reason I was disappointed was the conspiracy that made no sense. In the beginning, two men saw that all the teens were interfering with the boat, then there was supposedly only one girl and the others were either their imaginary friends or ghosts, I'm not sure because it was portrayed very poorly. WhyteFox, who wrote a comment here, claims this is a true story. He or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says that the area where this movie was filmed is a spooky boat. There was no mention in this film that this is a true story. I've never experienced anything like it before, but I'm not saying it's impossible. I think if anyone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you like amateur movies for amateur students, you may like it.
