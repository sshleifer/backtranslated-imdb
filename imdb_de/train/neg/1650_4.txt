Four best friends, young male chauvinist pigs (with a focus on pigs) meet weekly in a New York diner to tell their dating sex ploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is the common denominator that names the three bachelors in the group, which leads to conflict and the inevitable flogging. Although the premise of the film has potential and there are some fun moments, the movie does not work at all, especially at the end, where the girls are not supposed to look any better than the boys, which is in contrast to the main points of the story. One of those one-man band flix with a dozen producers, "Whipped" is probably only appreciated by young men who think that "The Man Show" is Emmy material.
