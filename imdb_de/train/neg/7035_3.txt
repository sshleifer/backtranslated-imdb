An extremely thin "conspiracy" of satanic rituals or hocus-pocus provides the hokey excuse to sum up plenty of sex scenes. Hetero-vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S & M, bestiality, incest and some other sexual spread are in the limelight here. The problem is that the story is so boring that rampant sexuality gets pretty boring after a while. Who would have thought that a movie with an intimate encounter with goats and girls could be so damn boring? Well, I do that. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows everything; Helga Line offers T & A (both quite common); Women spectators occasionally get penis. <br /> <br /> My Rating: D + Region <br /> <br /> Region 1 DVD Extras: Trailer for "Pick Up", "Legend of Eight Samurai", "Do not Answer the Phone", "Prime Evil" and "Sister Street Fighter" (on the same DVD is also a second movie "Evil Eye")
