I do not know where to start, so I'll start with a snippet from the back of the cover of this movie. "Alive combines the tension of Vincenzo Natali's cube with Kitamura's own Versus." I did not see Versus, so I can not comment on that, but I think Cube was a great movie that I can recommend to anyone. In this case, someone has confused the "tension" but clearly with "boredom". <br /> <br /> I'll just spoil the whole plot, because it's not just a sacred Swiss cheese of an action, but also blue cheese, and the movie is worth no time, even if you do not know the plot beforehand, so play it does not matter. If I misunderstood the plot, you will not beat me - probably because I had to try to keep my eyelids open. So the US military in Nevada once lost a UFO in the Nambi desert. This makes sense, because both deserts are so safe that they are practically in the same place. Different continents or not. A monkey broke into the UFO and acquired an alien, which was passed on to a Japanese explorer who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert. What ever. The alien is now being passed on to anyone who is "bloodthirsty enough" to kill the current host. The Japanese military wants to use it for military material, so they decide to transfer it from the current host (the researcher's daughter) to another type. But instead of just picking someone from the military, who is full of people who are bloodthirsty AND already on the military side, they decide that getting a criminal off death row is probably a good idea. Oh, and the reason they choose this death row criminal is that he was the first person in history who did not die from the non-lethal electric shock that is the standard way of doing things because everyone is working on the placebo effect dies when he gets an electric shock. I do not know if they do that so they can giggle in the staff room about how all people are dying, even though it's not fatal, or if they just want to cut the utility bill. <br /> <br /> Then the movie turns into what The Matrix would have been if it had really been lame, and superfluous fighting bores us to tears for an hour that feels like. And wait, now they remember that they already had a guy who got infected with the alien, so the whole movie was a waste of time and also a human life up to that point. Then everyone dies. The end. <br /> <br /> The only moment in the movie where I did not want to go to sleep or eat a sandwich was when a guy was pinched against a wall by his chest and he hangs around there and another guy comes over. The guy hanging on the wall says, "I'm in pain, shoot myself." And the living guy looks at him, and it's not like he's a mean guy or anything, so he looks really sad and does not want the guy on the wall. So he shoots him. <br /> <br /> (rhetorical break.) <br /> <br /> In the stomach. "Gee THANK YOU a FREAKIN 'HEAP."
