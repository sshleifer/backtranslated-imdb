When Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a hard-core, high-performing Hollywood couple, they filmed this (almost) scene-by-scene remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw action thriller about a fugitive couple. It almost worked the first time, because McQueen had such an important presence on the screen - even when the stone was quiet and tired, you could feel its clock ticking, its cage-like magnetism. Baldwin is not in the league of Steve McQueen, but he has his charm and is probably a versatile actor. If so, this is not a showcase for its attributes. Basinger is good and definitely looks good, but James Woods is artificially hammy in a stupid mob magnet role. A deal that took another couple of Baldwin's ex-partners hostage was unbearable in the '72 movie, and is even worse here. As far as the action scenes are concerned, they are quite old, which is why one wonders: why even make the original new? ** from ****
