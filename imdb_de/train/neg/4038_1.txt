To see how horrible The Shield is, you'd have to write pages and pages, so suffice it to say that it's a monument to bad governance, title of this production. In fact, directors should put their work to the fore with a sense of visual style and storytelling that drives history forward. How is the constant shaking of the camera and playing with the zoom lens a "style"? How does it drive the story? Of course, there is also the "editing random numbers" nonsense. Apparently, it's time to cut just by chance. <br /> <br /> I think it's too much work to make a good editing shield, which languished as one of the most hyped and unsurpassed shows ever.
