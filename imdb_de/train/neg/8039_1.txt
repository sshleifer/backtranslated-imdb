This thoughtless movie is a bit crap and boring like the repetitions throughout the house. For all the people who want to see a great, exciting and cool horror movie, they should not even think about looking at this bunch of mindless work. an F- in my opinion. I have a question, what did you think? Let's make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad action 5) bad governance and last but not least a bad script. I mean, I do not care about any movie, but I was disappointed when I saw it. This film should be locked in a box, locked up and sunk into the sea. So please do not do that again, please, please, please !!!!
