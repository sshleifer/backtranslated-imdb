In the standard view, this is a terrible movie. However, it is a near-perfect result on the scale of unintentional comedy. I can imagine some real comedies that make me laugh as hard as the movie. Andy Griffith's garb, dressed in Indian garb, always puts me in a hysterical mood. I would not waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it, but if you lie on the couch at 3 in the morning and watch it on TV, have a look.
