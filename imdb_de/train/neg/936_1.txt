I do not understand the people. Why does this movie get an 8.3 !!!!!! ???? I had high hopes in this movie, but when I was only half an hour inside, I just wanted to leave the theater. In the vast majority of the reviews on this site, people say that this is one of the best action movies they've seen (or the summer, year, etc.). They say it's an excellent conclusion. WTF !!!!!!!!! ?????? What has been completed (apart from the fact that Bourne can drive, shoot and fight better than anyone he encounters)? What do you learn about Bourne's character in this movie ????????? Absolutely f ****** nothing !!!!!!! Okay, there's a lot of action, but what's so great about the action in this movie? I do not like cinematography and film editing. The shaky camera effect and fast-changing settings were used too often and they are getting old quickly (I did not bother them in Supremacy because it was still easy to track and was not used in excess) and made me pretty dizzy. I quickly wished I had saved my $$$ for something else. <br /> <br /> This movie has no plot. The entire movie is a 115-minute chase. Bourne, of whom you will experience absolutely nothing in the 115 minutes of the film, is a perfectionist in everything he tries. There is absolutely no character development in this movie, you do not know anything about anyone and there are a large number of new characters that are featured in this section. Some people said that this movie has incredible writing and excitement. ??????????? !!!!!!!! To write something ???? What tension? There is no tension. Bourne is so good at doing everything he does, I do not think he has to worry. If this is the best movie of the year 2007, I can just stop watching movies. <br /> <br /> Many people have also said that Matt Damon's performance in this film is one of the best (if not the best) of his career. Which performance? How many lines did he have in this movie? I have some respect for Damon because he has starred in movies I liked and played different characters, but a good actor is someone you can barely recognize from film to film, someone who chooses different roles. Not someone who plays the same roles over and over again (which Damon does not do, but an example from Vin Diesel). <br /> <br /> This movie was a big disappointment for me anyway. I do not recommend this movie, but I recommend the first two (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy) and I definitely recommend reading the three books (which are very different from the movies).
