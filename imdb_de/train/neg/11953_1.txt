You know the movies that you caught in the cinema? You're stuck in the best spot in the house, in the middle of the line in your special sweet spot, which you changed three times before you got exactly the right fit - and after about 13 hours you're still uncomfortable trapped there and itchy, thinking "If the F *** brings this movie to the end ???" (You know the feeling - think of A.I. and The Village). <br /> <br /> Well, visitor Q delivers a strange twist on this feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes and wondered when that thing would start! It is endless! So "Arty" hurts. This is the first Miike Takashi movie I've seen. Apparently he makes films in the dozen, and if they're all so angry, I suppose, it'll be the last. <br /> <br /> I'm not against Pretentious w @ nk. David Lynch is among the top 10 directors for me for me, but Visitor Q is cheap, cheap and evil presumptuous w @ nk. <br /> <br /> As you may have already found out, I hated it.
