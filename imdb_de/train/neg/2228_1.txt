This movie is weak. The cover of the box says that the hardest gear of East LA and it really is Santa Ana. James Cahill looks like a cabinet queen defeating all the tough guys of the tough Chlo gang. It's wrong, boring, meaningless and crazy. I tried to get my money back from the video store. This movie was so bad. It was also on the homo-erotic tip far from what the video box announces. James Cahill should act in Gay Porn. James is in every scene, he can not act to save his life. The movie shows Eva Longoria, who is hot, but James can not even score with her !!!!!!!!! I felt like I sometimes saw gay porn and was turned off by the whole movie. James clearly wants to be with men but prefers to submit to his gay desires, which he beats over and over again by gang members. His martial arts skills are minimal at best. Some real gang members would take him and his weak abilities and tear him down a new one.
