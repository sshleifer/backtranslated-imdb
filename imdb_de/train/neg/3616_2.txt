If you just look at the cover of this movie, it's cool. NOT The movie itself drove me to sleep. It was a slow pace, with minimal violence and a weak use of tension. The drama was a bottom feeder material and the plot, although cool for another movie, was poorly shown here. They even kill the only sympathetic character in the entire movie! I give a 2 out of 10 points because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end. Besides, you should save yourself from this movie waste.
