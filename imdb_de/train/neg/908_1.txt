After buying the DVD in a bargain basket due to the impressive number of features on the cover, I put it in the DVD player and everything looked good. Nice animated menus and lots of extra features ... but when I played the movie myself, what a flop. It's the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies in my time. The commentary that praises the film here at IMDB comes from the people who made the film. So do not believe it, if you do not want to waste your money!
