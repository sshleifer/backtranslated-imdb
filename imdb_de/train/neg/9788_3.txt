Not that I do not like children's movies, but this was a tear-dropper with few redeeming qualities. M.J. Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be amazingly funny, but has no chance in this movie. It's sugar with sugar coating and would hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek instead. 3.10
