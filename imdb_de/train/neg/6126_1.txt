In this regard, one of the worst movies ever made. Plot goes like this. Trample through the jungle areas for about 10 minutes. I went to Bo somewhere and undressed. Slog a bit through the jungle. Give Bo another excuse to get undressed. Back to the jungle. Oh look! There is a Tarzan looking guy! Stripes, bo stripes. Kill the safari people. Tarzan looking for guy has a fight scene. Saves Bo. Bo strips. Execute credits. Execute credits.
