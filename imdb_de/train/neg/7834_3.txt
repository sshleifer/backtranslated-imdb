I do not usually write reviews, but I can not understand why this is so highly rated and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers, as I can only assume that all these high ratings were given by average TV viewers. I have only seen the first two episodes but the two were so cliché that it was not funny anymore. The same old stories that you've probably seen / read a couple of times - live toys, evil things from other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories are not innovative, they're also pretty bad versions of those clichés. I would rather z. "chucky" and "silent hill" over these two episodes. and do not even ask about the visual effects ... those in the first episode are fine, but those in the second ... terrible. It looks like a movie student project that went awry. Blood or blood ... um ... nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> It might be interesting for a ten-year-old child who probably has not seen / read so many scary stories yet (though I would rather recommend "beyond belief" - now I call a decent Mystery TV show. but for a grown-up horror fan, this is worthless, I just gave the 3 dots, because there are actually some nice cinematography (especially in the second episode) and some nice spectacles.
