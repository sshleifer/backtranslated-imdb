This movie was awful. I have seen it three times and not even the whole thing. It's just impossible to watch, the story is shitty, it's depressing and absolutely disgusting. I do not write spoilers for anything. So if you want to know why it's so disgusting, then see for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning and some funny parts of the movie. The little kid in this movie is annoying and the whole situation is nonsense. I saw this movie in stores across America, so I figured it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! The spectacle is all terrible and the nudity itself is lame and evil. Another thing is, Starr Andreef, the other main character, had not been in such bad films in the past, in fact she was pretty good in some. The same applies to John Savage. This movie SUCKS!
