This movie is being promoted as a clever romantic comedy. It is neither smart nor romantic and definitely not an effective comedy. The fortune of well-meaning but pathetic character "Tom" varies from one extremely distressing catastrophe to another. The only salvation is the competent performance of Toni Collete and the frequency with which we see Paltrow's pleasant face. Overall to avoid!
