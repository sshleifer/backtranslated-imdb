This movie is bizarre. Or rather, it is "weirdly funny". I could give you a summary of the plot or an analysis of the good company, but I would consider it a waste of your time. All you need to know about this film are two young sisters, an incestuous relationship, murder, aftermath, and a disturbing confusion. At the end of the movie, you feel like you need to take a shower to wash the dirt off of yourself, but not in a good way, like "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It's like being a teenager (or a high schooler because I'm still a teenager myself) and just doing something that you want A: you would not have done, and B: Hope your parents are the good Lord of the To give hope to heaven and earth never experience anything of it. And that does not like anyone. My advice is that you do not pollute your mind and waste your time with something less horrible by watching an arbitrary cinematic filth and "Kazaam" (yes, I would rather see "Kazaam" than "Murderous Maids" read what you do want).
