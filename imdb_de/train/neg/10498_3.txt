I caught that in a test screening. All I can say is: what ... hell? This movie is about as smooth as Mickey Mouse reads the "Scarface" script. It's bizarre to make the least sense. and even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is still so bizarre that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> The plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin trying to "rescue" a crocodile that contains a CIA probe. The CIA comes to Irwin to retrieve her investigation, Irwin confuses her with poaching and sets to "stop" her. <br /> <br /> That's about the whole story there is; The rest is exaggerated renunciation of the Australian culture ("Didja see dat?" And "Crikey!") And strangely choreographed action sequences. Irwin eventually brings a raging motorhome and knife fights with a CIA agent about it. Yes that's true. The Steve Irwin Knife fights with a man on a motorhome. Let this ridiculously bad movie guide you.
