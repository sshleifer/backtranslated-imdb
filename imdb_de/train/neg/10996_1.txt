The underground comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known it would be bad to have the phrase "guaranteed offended" in the box ... meaning that the filmmakers would focus more on failing than making you laugh. <br /> <This film is an amateurish jumble of childish skits, bad characters and worse jokes ... from the wretched Bat-Man sketch to the painlessly unpleasant Arnold Shvollenpecker sketch, they're just not funny. The few skits that are a bit funny are few that are far apart - eg. Micheal Clark Duncan is playing a gay maiden - but even they go too long and are ruined by Vince Offers inability to comedy. > Keep the underground comedy movie under the ground ... bury it!
