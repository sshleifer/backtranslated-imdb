Impressive. I read about this movie and it sounded so horrible that I had to see it, and my husband, I can smell him in St. Louis. Where should I start? National Lampoons attempted to track the success of Animal House five years later, but they missed the mark entirely. I go chronologically with these short films. <br /> <br /> Short film # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Boon from Animal House). Apparently he did not work then, so the boys from National Lampoons probably called and said, "Hey, we're doing a movie, do we want to be there?" Peter said, "Well, I do not do much these days, why not?" He was a great minor character in Animal House, but he could not carry that sad short flop for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS The premise is weird enough that Jason Cooper (Riegert) asks his wife to let him, she has to find herself. It's too funny that they are actually in a happy marriage. So he chases her off, there she goes, and Cooper takes care of the kids. This, of course, causes him to burn down the house, lose several children and sleep with a selection of New York bimbos (including a very young Diane Lane). Then the woman comes back, wants the children, and the movie ends with a coin toss that will determine the fate of the children. The idea was actually a little smart, but the director stunk. The characters all seem to have fallen asleep, they had to be doped. Sorry Boon, your heritage was tarnished with this flop. <br /> <br /> Short film # 2 <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Enter Dominique Corsaire. Pretty girl, recently graduated college, not sure what to do with her life. So she becomes a slut, sleeps with some mega rich guys, takes her money when she dies, and does not stop until she's the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (Ooops, I mean the President of the United States). Once again, it could have been funny, and although I was glad that Corsaire (in real life Ann Dusenberry) was not afraid to show it all, her acting was terrible. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short film # 3 <br /> <br /> I can not believe I made it this far. Here's the rookie cop Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, naive and believes that he can really help people, even though he becomes cynical after several thousand shots. Really, Nagurski has given up the care. He watches muggings, attacks, you name it and never intervene. He believes that the world is lawless and he will probably be sued if he does something. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of Taxi's Run) takes part in the action, has the police call, commit a crime, but have his lawyer there to protect him. God bless America !! <br /> <br /> Once more could have been fun, the performances were intentionally camping, but goodness, no energy. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed to have their name on this beat. I think the writing was not bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was pulled off as well as the rescue attempt in the Iranian hostage crisis. If I had been part of this movie, I would want to remove my name, it's awful. On the other hand, that's why I looked at it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this garbage is that Dr. John did the film music (repeats "Going to the Movies") and the movie is not much longer than an hour and a half. Show this in film classes titled "What you should NEVER do while filming". This script should have stayed on the shelf, because yes, it's so bad.
