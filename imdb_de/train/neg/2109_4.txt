Patricia Hunter: Oh Professor, are you also getting used to collecting coffins? Dr. Lorenz: Yes, so to speak. I find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed. <br /> <br /> Interesting vehicle of Bela Lugosi (Glen or Glenda, Dracula) in which he plays the mad scientist. I was particularly scared when he appeared in the bedrooms of his guests as they slept. Luana Walters (Girl in Prison) was a sensual reporter, Patricia Hunter, who was supposed to be a magnet, very appealing victims, but woman power trumps the evil scientist every time. <br /> <br /> 2'11 "Angelo Rossitto and the creepy Frank Moran, who liked to spur the women's hair in the movie. <br /> <br /> Interesting look at a 40's horror movie.
