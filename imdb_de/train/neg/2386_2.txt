I missed this movie in the cinema, but had a hunch in the back of my mind that it was worth a look. When I saw him on the shelves of DVD, I thought "time to look at him". Big mistake! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars can not save this turkey, certainly one of the worst films ever. An incomprehensible act is poorly delivered and misrepresented. Perhaps it would have been more useful if I had read Robbins's novel, but if the film is not completely different from the novel, and since Robbins supports the script, I doubt that the novel must also be torturous reading. <I hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in that waste of celluloid and lately DVD blanks, like Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace to be uncomfortable at times. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your life for something more valuable, such as: Even if you see it in your local shop in a "$ 5" basket, resist the urge!
