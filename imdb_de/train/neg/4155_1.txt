OK, I knew this would be a back F-movie (well below the B-movie standards), so I thought, "Man, I could use a good laugh, so we see some Nether beings kill each other." Well, what I got could have been found in your local "Love Toy" store. Random lesbian scenes, very few fights and no conspiracy. <br /> <br /> For example, I remember a certain scene (just because of its stupidity, I saw better movies on ABC) where the two most important are characters (I can not remember their names directly .. big movie, right?), as usual, and the driver was tired of driving and stopped: <br /> <br /> Driver: "Let's run over, I'm tired, will you take care of that?" Passenger: "Sure, I can drive a while." (Once dressed, the driver reaches for the passenger's breasts.) Passenger: "What are you doing? I'm not like that!" Driver: "It's OK, everybody does it sometime." Passenger: "OK then." (Continue to take off shirts, pet, kiss, and perform fellatio) Now, the last time I checked, horror movies were not in the porn section of Hollywood Video (unless you're at S & M's somewhere else) and it definitely should not be in the mainstream blockbuster videos. Do not get me wrong; I'm definitely not one of those people who hate pornography, but I only look at them when it's convenient, and I definitely do not want to watch them looking for a movie in the mainstream stores because they rented one out of the two retailers that I mentioned (and probably the other, when I looked). <br /> <br /> Worst movie of all time, nobody should hire it, and it should only be bought for a public ceremony. If I could give a 0, I would do that, but I can only specify a * of 10.
