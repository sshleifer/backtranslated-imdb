First of all, this is a low budget movie, so my expectations were incredibly low. I'm assuming that most of the people watching the information for this movie just wanted a blood festival, and that's basically what it is. <br /> <br /> act? There is really no. It's basically Saw but in China and a whole hell a lot worse. Occupation? There is no, period. Special effects? Absolutely terrible, in my opinion ... There were excerpts and the blood was often totally unbelievable because of amounts, splashes, color, texture etc. I think the purpose of this movie should be a brutal, shock film. Now it had a lot of potential for a bigger budget, but bad scripts, bad dialogues, horrible drama, what seemed like camcorder video footage, and just incredible "gore" made this movie really terrible. It's movies that are worth it. Taking a chance against some reviews, even "B-rate" movies deserve some opportunities (blood stains, for example, were the last I've seen against reviews that were worth it), but that was just terrible. I hope the people considering this movie read my comment and decided against it. <br /> <br /> I'm all for brutality and shock, but the general unrealism and really terrible acting make a terrible experience. Save time, money and opportunity, you will not be disappointed.
