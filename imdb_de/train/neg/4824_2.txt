I wanted to like this movie, but many elements ruined it for me. The use of a fisheye lens and choppy editing gave me no feeling of being in the world of the meth head, but it gave me the impression that I was watching MTV for a few moments. The movie never seemed to go anywhere and acting was really a great example of exaggerated acting. I love movies that give us an insight into the seedy underworld, but this film could not decide whether it was a bad horror movie or an even worse serious commentary on the nightmare.
