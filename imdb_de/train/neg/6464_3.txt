Seeing Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's drama is the ONLY thing that makes this movie worth seeing. The plot is crazy and ridiculous (not funny). The other great actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give a piece of humanity to the characters they represent ... these characters have humankind of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this movie is either mediocre or just terrible. The director throws freeze-frames and slow-motion shots around with impunity. The casual music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effects. It's not something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was gone. The venerable Brando could not distract himself from the terrible rags he had put him into. I've heard that this movie is called "David Lynch-esquire" and "disrespectfully funny." David Lynch films are rife with creativity - this film was by no means creative. And do not confuse disrespect with stupidity.
