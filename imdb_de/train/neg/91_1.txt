I rented this movie about three years ago, and it's still the worst movie ever made. I do not think I ever did it. It is worse than a home video of a student. I remember making a flashback in 1970, and in the flashback was a man wearing a polo shirt, Oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV like a Toyota Rav-4 or so (I do not remember). I do not understand how they might have said that in the 1970s. He might also have had a cell phone, I can not remember, it was just awful. I took it back to the video store and asked them why they were even wearing the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. It's still the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some pretty bad ones.
