Saving Grace is certainly one of the main contenders for the award "How To Ruin A Reasonable Movie For The Past few Minutes". Of course, when you mix a picturesque village in Cornwall - populated mostly by retired ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, there is, of course, some stupidity. The last seven minutes of the film, however, are completely ridiculous and are not even replaced by the fact that they are especially funny. It's a pity, because this comedy can be just as good as 1998's Waking Ned Devine, which also featured a quaint little village and its strange inhabitants struggling to get out of a difficult situation /> The protagonist of Saving Grace is a middle-aged, recently widowed Grace Trevethyn, who was forced by her legacy of bad debts to an unconventional way of earning money. Supported by her gardener, Matthew, she transforms her horticultural knowledge into the lucrative cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads her into confrontation with the local police, her husband's creditors and a French drug lord. , , , , , , , , , They all appear in their greenhouse at the same time. The relationship and relationship between Grace and Matthew is well illustrated, and Brenda Blethyn emotionally engages the viewer in her sympathetic character - you can really feel what she is going through. <br /> <br /> The cast of the supporting roles is excellent, although some of them are rather eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques, the drug lord in Grace's romantic interest, is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the film at all. And certainly hydroponics is not a revolution in the world of cannabis growth. Unfortunately, the film exchanges gentle humor against slapstick and becomes as fake as the marijuana plants.
