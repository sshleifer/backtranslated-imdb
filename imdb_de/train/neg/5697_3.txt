This is the most basic kind of traditional ghost story, not even animated by the use of Irish locations. If the great Mr. R. James had ever invented such a thin story, does not James have a story called "A Thin Ghost"? - He would not have bothered to have her published. Orson Welles appears in slender tails as a favor for a pair of old friends, the producers of this film. His presence and the only joke of the film industry would have brought this madness his Oscar nomination. This is even more proof if more were needed, that the Oscar award was never a guarantee of merit.
