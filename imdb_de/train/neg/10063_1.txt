Now, in all my years, I've never seen a bad movie, but what about the songs in the movie, what is its physiological meaning? WOW pop up some denied Pokémon and they multiply that I can get a fit from it. Animie is meaningless, the makers are meaningless. It's a great marketing concept that is reduced to songs and they will get a good rating. I think this movie would have been alright if they were going to spend a message that you have to see all the Pokémon episodes understand what's going on and it's not a movie. It's just an animation that should be shown on video. <br /> <br /> Ps: I give a 1 because I just got $ 5. I could not give it a half because there are no halves.
