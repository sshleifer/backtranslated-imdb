This is obviously a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's Mysterious Island. The sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on the set and at the same time you hear the recording of the voices in a recording booth! This is an amateur movie with actors from Boston, filmed in New Hampshire. For those who live in New Engalnd and who reads this comment, he will be thrilled with a capital W. This movie is full of flaws. They hear the voice of the director giving directions and giving instructions to the actress. "OK, get up now." As for the other characters. There's this guy talking to his mind instead of his voice and that blue alien. The alien speaks in a deep voice. When he yawns or grunts, when he fights, one hears the voice of the actor. As for the special effects, man! That was Brett Piper's early work because he had screamed loudly! The creatures are good, but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. Similar to the animation by Karl Zeman in JOURNEY TO THE BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. This music is good. Conclusion: This film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know that MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home theater and had a budget for shoes? A must for aspiring filmmakers.
