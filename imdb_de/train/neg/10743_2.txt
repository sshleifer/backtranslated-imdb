This movie is really bad, with a script full of "memorable" lines and unbelievably bad performances. The special effects are also bad (not the worst I have ever seen) and the music is so bad that you have to hear it to believe it. Only two short topics (about 30 seconds) are repeated throughout the movie. All in all one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
