Extremely disappointing film based on the James Michener novel. <br /> <br /> Even worse was the performance of Marlon Brando. His southern flair was ridiculous. I laughed as he spoke as he sounded like an elderly South lady coming home to rest. Brando, so great in earlier films, was reduced to a laughing figure here. Tyrone Power was nominated for best actor in Witness for the Prosecution instead of Brando. The film, which deals with racism, dealt with the US government's attempt to avoid marriages between US soldiers and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando had a stiff head throughout the movie. His change from these relationships to a professional relationship happens when he loves an Asian woman. His emotions and conversation made it hard to see how he could champion such new views. <br /> <br /> Only the Lord knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received Oscars for their performances. Nothing about both was equally impressive. Umeki's appearance on the screen was brief and without much of it. A better performance in this film was done by Miiko Taka, who made a good figure as Brando's love interest. She showed great emotions as an anti-American, who found love for the Brando character. Her face was marked by the dissatisfaction she had had in World War II when she lost her father and brother. She realized that her dancing was not her way out of the existence she lived on. Martha Scott first went from the Hebrew mother Yochobel in "The Ten Commandments" to the bigoted mother of Brando's love interest. Her performance together with Ricardo Montalban was wasted. Patricia Owens showed as Brando's first love depth and conviction in her performance.
