Band Camp was awful, The Naked Mile was a bit better and this third DVD right in the American Pie series seems to have the same quality as its predecessor. Basically, Erik Stifler (John White) separated from his girlfriend after losing his virginity, and now he and Mike Cooze Coozeman (Jake Siegel) go to Erik's cousin Dwight (Steve Talley) at college. With the promise of many parties, plenty of alcohol and enough hot girls in the Beta House, they have only fifty listed tasks to become official privileged members. But a threat is emerging as the rival GEK ("Geek") House, led by the power-hungry nerd (and sheep-shed) Edgar (Tyrone Savage), is bigger and better than what Beta offers. To fix it once and for all, Beta and Gek go to battle with the Greek games, which have been banned for forty years, in which they beat each other. The final winner of the games, Noah Levenstein aka Jim's Dad (the only regular Eugene Levy), directs the show, where people unhook the brassieres, float a gladiator duel on the water, catch a greasy pig, take out Russian roulette with cartridges aged horse sperm, woman carrying and drinking a full barrel of alcohol (do not disqualify with puke). It all comes to the sudden death, with a guy who lets strippers dance, and they have to resist the cumming. Beta House wins when Edgar arrives with a girl dressed like a sheep in his lap. With Flubber's Christopher McDonald as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffer as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italia Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as a rock. The amount of nudity is slightly increased, as well as the rudeness of the jokes, and I would imagine that she is rated one in five stars, but I like it. Appropriate!
