This low-priced Italian action / sci-fi hybrid is David Warbeck, a reporter from Miami who was selected by the spirits of the Atlantis (!) To prevent a bad businessman (Oscar John John nominee) from Use a telepathic fetus Use spores of an asteroid to dominate the world. You have all this? Despite such a slimy conspiracy, this is actually a boring affair, and the RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS mock it with contempt. Honestly, the (most deliberately) most creative thing about this film is the slight revision of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the opening credits. The unintentionally creative part is a scene in a lab that inexplicably is shown twice in a row. Maybe director Alberto De Martino wanted to attract all the avant-garde in the twilight of his career? I wanted to explain Ireland's worst movie in his resume, but then I saw that Satan's cheerleaders were being performed there. I'd also like to say that I'm probably the only person in the history of the world to do a double feature of this and Hitchcock's VERTIGO.
