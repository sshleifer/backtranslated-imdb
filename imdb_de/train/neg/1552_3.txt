This movie was very well advertised. I'm an avid movie viewer and have seen previews for this movie for months. Although I was skeptical of how funny this movie would be, my friends thought it would be great and picked me up. Then I went and saw it, I was almost asleep in my seat, until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I laughed at most things in the movie, just so I do not feel bad and break the good mood. Besides, I wanted my money to be worth the movie! I always go into a movie with an open mind and do not try to go into it with too many expectations, but this movie was not so funny. It was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but definitely worth it to wait for HBO. If you have not seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and stupid comedies, you may enjoy it, but for real comedy fans, I would say, pass. Maybe even the kings of the comedy again. Something has told me I should rather meet the parents !!!
