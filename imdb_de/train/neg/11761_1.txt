Complete drive. An unfortunate manifestation of hypocritical, toxic culture a decade ago. In this film, the regret of pedestrians for slavery goes hand in hand with colonialist subtexts (the annoying redhead feeding rice shaka?). Forget the historical reality. Did not most western slaves come from West Africa? An American slave who can easily conquer Shaka with a handful of men? After all, David Hasslehoff could not have been more disgusting. One can only think about how he would have done in the miniseries. (Most likely immediately impaled). The mini-series was great, and it's unfortunate that DH should have gotten something unique and made it banal. (I tend to think he had a hand in this fiasco).
