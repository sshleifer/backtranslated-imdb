Omen IV (1991) was a bad TV offer. Movie. I believe that since the 1980s were over, executives experimented with meth (the drug of choice in the 1990s) because there is no other reason to explain this travesty. Why did you even bother to do that? A TV. Movie? What did you think about when this appeared on the Idea Board? Did they even think for a second that this movie would prevail? Maybe they thought it might be a series? We will never know. But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason why I never bought the Omen trilogy. They should have dropped a few dollars instead of throwing out that "extra" disc. Omen IV is basically an average American family remake of the first movie. Instead of a snot-nosed punk kid, we get the creepy girl who is a total brat for everyone around her. If the family had stronger parental abilities, none of the demonic events that took place in recent movies would never have occurred. These parents need to set foot and practice real discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, best to avoid at all costs!
