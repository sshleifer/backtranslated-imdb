The story goes, Netflix sent me my DVDs late, so I moved on to the analogue rental location, which was called a "blockbuster video." Really bad. You have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your viewing pleasure, but I never want to see one of them. So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf, all about his lonely self. I like movies based on serial killers. It's just a part of humanity that I'll never understand, so I want to see something like that. Anyway, I inserted this DVD and suddenly it is annoying from the first second. I'm sitting there with my friend. and we're like, "what's that kind of crap?" Unstable camera operation, terrible acting - The first scene in which a woman is killed wonders if she would rather stay calm instead. Then a rat is stuffed in the throat. I really wonder if the director has a hard thing for this crap. There is nothing decent about this "movie". All I have to tell the director is, "Do you own a crazy tripod?" Every shot was brutally unstable. The music was terrible. It was like one day they decided to make a movie. They probably brought people together from WalMart to appear and "act" for them. Just terrible. If you make a movie like this, directing is your hobby - NOT what you should do for a living. You should not make it for DVD kidney stores, for movie fans like me. Better left at home for your friends when you have a party and no longer have interesting things to talk to.
