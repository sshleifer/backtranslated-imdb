"Whipped" is one of the most terrible films of all time. It's a mean, hateful garb that forces me to stay in the theater more than any other movie of the year, except maybe "The Grinch." It's not, as people called it, a revealing portrait of modern relationships. That would be a small movie called "High Fidelity". While this film was honest and sympathetic, "Whipped" is a hostile, cynical and misanthropic cinematic poison. Avoid this as many epidemics, unless you want to see how bad a "comedy" can become.
