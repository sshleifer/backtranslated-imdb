There are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the trailer of the movie. I try to be balanced in my contribution because I strongly support local films, but I can only support the setback against this film. It is slow, boring and meaningless. Even the "almost beautiful and credible moments" were immediately undercut by painful clich√©s and bad behavior. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were passable in this movie. It felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic TV soap, then got carried away and decided to take her to the big screen. The leap years should be RA rated (Rated Awful), but it has not changed my belief in local movies. More good movies will come, as long as more films like this are not produced.
