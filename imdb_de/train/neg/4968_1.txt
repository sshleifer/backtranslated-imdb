I was expecting the movie based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It is based on the Beowulf epic, but was told from the monster's perspective. <br /> <br /> Whatever you think of Gardner's book, a movie based on the Beowulf epic, should not be called "Grendel," except for the few pitiful scenes in which the CG monster plays Saying nothing more about the monster is displayed as nothing more than a modified Predator. <br /> <br /> In addition, the authors should be punished because they messed up the original story so much and have contributed to the ever-increasing ignorance of mass TV audiences in the US Typically Hollywood, to put it so wrongly understand. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and a complete waste of time.
