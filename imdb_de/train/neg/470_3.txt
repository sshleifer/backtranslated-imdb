I loved this movie as a kid, but when I saw it again 20 years later, it's really shit. Up Although the Academy was ahead of its time in 1980, today it has almost nothing to offer! Films like Caddyshack and Stripes are much better today than this steamy Dogpile. No. No great jokes, except the one-liners that we've heard all over the place in the meantime. <br /> <br /> I recently bought the DVD, hoping it would be the gem I remembered. Well, I was far away! The soundtrack only had 2-3 widely recognizable hits (not the smash compilation others mentioned) and the frequent voice overs were horrible. The only interesting thing for me was predicting what the characters were before they said it. Yes, I've seen this movie so many times back then! <br /> <br /> The only reason I write this review is to give my two cents why this movie should be forgotten. :(
