This movie is about a policeman (Ching Wan Lau) trying to grab a super-smart thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmails an insurance company under the leadership of a Kelly Lin. Basically, the plans that the policeman tries to somehow know the thief before. This movie, which is covered by handsome lead actors, a beautiful leading actress and good camera shots of Hong Kong scenes, really has no substance. It's all lightning and the lightning gets boring fast. I have lost all interests a third of the film, and then there is no more revenue quality, except the cinematography, which looks good. Consider this movie only if you can do it for free. Also remember to stop watching the movie after 20 minutes because it's all over until the end: boring. 6.10
