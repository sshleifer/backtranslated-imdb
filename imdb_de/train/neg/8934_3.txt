I bought this DVD without any reference, but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on the cover. I found the Brazilian title very strange, but decided to watch a funny comedy like "Switch". The nonsensical story, however, is terrible and hard to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is undergoing surgery in Copenhagen to change his gender. He returns to Hollywood and says that she should be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claims half of the property of his uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). Over the days, Myra and her alter ego Myron have spoiled a young couple in her uncle's academy with dirty sex. At a certain moment, the chaotic script is so confused that I believe the whole story was just a Myron's thought-provoked journey of thought. Unfortunately, the beauties of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to hold this strip. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man and Woman to a point")
