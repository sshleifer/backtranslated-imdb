Why am I constantly doing this for myself? I mean, it's right there in the title - "The Incredible Melting Man". What else would I expect? I have to admit, I'm an idiot for everything I encounter on the Monster HD channel, but the only redeeming thing in this picture would be the truly grotesque make-up job of the legendary Rick Baker. What's scary, I'll say to the horny old Geezer couple sucking on lemons just before the lights go out. Now they were really scary. <br /> <br /> Something I never found out about horror film was why a monster's victims would not just run away from virtual destruction. Like the chick in the cabin. You know, there was a door in the kitchen that she could have run anytime. Unbelievable that Steve-O could not do much more than take a brisk walk, so why not blow him right now? I do not know, maybe I miss something. <br /> <br /> This movie had something of a "Tales From The Crypt" episode, but "Tales" usually had a cool or grotesque twist that was often not seen. This was a picture where you could not quite control the coming OR going. For example, in an early scene you can clearly see that the Melting Man's eyeball has fallen out of his head. How did he manage to move on for the rest of the story? I think we should not ask. <br /> <br /> At eighty-four minutes, this image was about one and a half hours too long. When it was all over, I was ready to accept General Perry on his earlier suggestion - "I could really have a drink now."
