This movie proves that not every movie made in Hollywood's glory days is worth watching. Just because you have an outstanding ensemble can not result in overcoming a script that was probably written by a chimpanzee. Think about it - the movie featured Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Charles Boyer, Gloria Graham, Lillian Gish, and Paul Stewart, and yet it was a bad movie! The basic requirement of the film is not bad - a private psychiatric clinic in which the employees are more than the patients messed up! Also the subplot with the revised husband and wife (Widmark and Graham) was promising. The script, however, was handled with all the finesse and skill of a drunken buffalo - with warlike arguments and again and again over the best scenes of the film. In fact, it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of General Hospital. This film is not subtle !! Realistically, this movie is not !! <br /> <br /> The reason for the movie was above all the terrible script, but I also blame the producers for abusing and abusing experienced actors. For example, Paul Stewart may not be a household name, but this character actor had an extraordinary talent - especially when he was a gangster in film noir films. Here, however, Stewart is a very nondescript psychiatrist with a bizarre European accent - it simply did not work, as it was far beyond his reach and his character was completely undeveloped and one-dimensional. Even Charles Boyer just seemed hopelessly misplaced and out of place. Seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heart of America just seemed bizarre. Overall, this is a pretty horrible movie. It is very observable in a train crash, but it is certainly not very pretty. My wife and I did not like the movie, but he also felt that if the writing was competent, it would have worked well. In real life, the brilliant Levant spent much of his life in and outside psychiatric institutions.
