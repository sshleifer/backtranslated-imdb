Jared Diamond pointed out in the first episode that other peoples in the world did not have domesticated animals, but the Europeans did, which explains why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines. <br /> <br /> But then in the third episode he says, when the Europeans in South Africa came too far north, they came across Zulu people and other tribes that drove cattle and planted crops. So what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievement when they have the key elements the author needs for success? Diamond also claims that germs in the form of smallpox (brought to North America) come black slaves) were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus * in any case without a single accident *, you have to think that germs are irrelevant. With or without germs, we would succeed. He says malaria has prevented Europeans from colonizing further north, killing "thousands" of Europeans without harming Africans. (I'd like to know real numbers, but he does not say so.) In the end, Malaria says that thousands of Africans are killed, so they can not catch up with us. So, what is it, Jared? Has malaria helped the Africans by arresting or injuring the Europeans? And how did it happen that Europe was okay despite massive epidemics in our history? <br /> <br /> He also seems too eager to say that the reasons for the Europeans' success were dumb luck. At a time when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his shaky theories, he is reluctant to admit that the Europeans may have been successful because they worked for it. It is sad to observe this obvious neo-Marxist distortion of reality in an attempt to prove its point.
