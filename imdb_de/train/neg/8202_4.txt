If it's a remake of the thing (1982/1951), I believe there are so many factors that deny previous films. <br /> <br /> So the drama is bad, James Spader is doing a Superlow Stargate reenactment of himself, with his coffee mug and his somewhat weird thoughts / movements, but that's about it, the other actors I do not even heard. You do not feel like meeting someone of the main characters. And the plot development is slow, boring and I know what will happen in 30 minutes. The result / music is very extensive, and there are many over the top who would score for a coke and a credit, but that's a big crap. Some of the special effects are nice if they were made in the early 90s. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and thrills, do not look at this movie. It's a boring combination of thing, alien 3, outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay products that have gone really bad. Well, that combination would be cool if anyone knew what they would do, and the only ones in the production who knew it was not. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen far worse, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are awake on a cold night and just want to look at something, time will slowly pass.
