"The Domino Principle" is without doubt one of the worst thrillers ever made. You can barely get a sense of the intricate plot, and halfway up, you should lift your arms up in frustration and "I give up !!!" scream. <br /> <br /> Like Gene Hackman and director Stanley Kramer, who has ever been involved in this mess, it's just a matter of collecting paychecks. I hope they spent their money well.
