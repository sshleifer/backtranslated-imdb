The film shows France's unsolved problems with its colonial legacy in western (francophone) Africa through the confused and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman, France (symbolically symbolizing her nation). It is an often appealing and challenging portrait of the desire of a young woman to focus in particular on a traumatic moment in her past and the desire of a nation to reach the "other" that she once "possessed" and formed. This is reflected in the way in which it is all about the idea of ​​traveling from the present to the past (or being in transit); recalled realities of undeniable contemporary political and economic news. The characters all play a symbolic, if limited and unconvincing role. France, which was supposed to be both a visual and a totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves one indifferent to its indifference, since it is still marked by the same naivety it enjoyed as a child, in fact as a child in which to do more its seems to be possession of its reality. The rest of the rag-tag ensemble is easy to forget. The Black Africans are, to say the least, the most offensive Impressionist portraits of former colonized peoples, now colonized by the filmmaker's poor handling of their material. They are nothing more than a dark and moribund background, before which blythe-like France wonders to seek a world she has never known, and to hope for one that is never to be found in Cameroon.
