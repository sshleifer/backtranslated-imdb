I almost called HBO and reclaimed my money for the month just because they aired that movie. I can only see how the film managers walk around. "Okay, we have to come up with something that is like Home Alone, we make it a lot less fun!" <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe not the last part, but basically you have this , Not even worth seeing if someone else rents it. And as a movie for children? Forget it. I would not allow my children to see this, not necessarily because of bad jokes, but because I do not want them to say, "What did you think about showing us this lame garbage?
