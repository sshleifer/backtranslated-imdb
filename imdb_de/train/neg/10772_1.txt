The saddest part of it is the fact that these are 87 minutes that I never get back. I knew this was awful from the start, and the guy who was dressed like a crazy Indian chief on the roof. (See if they could get away with it in 2008). My 10-year-old boy is totally into baseball right now, so we decided to rent him on a rainy day. Although he apparently enjoyed sharing, I had to contract when I heard all the unnecessary bad language. Bad, bad movie. This was a terrible rip-off of Bad News Bears. Completely shameless and completely predictable. A predictable movie does not bother me if it was done well, but this movie was absolutely not the case.
