I do not know why this behavior in the movie business was ever tolerated! This movie (short) is crude (to say the least)! It's a group of 5-7 year old kids who wear diapers with big hairpins and behave like adults (and too much!). It is interesting, however, because it is a good example of how "the good old days" might not have been so good! (Thank you, GOD, we now have laws against this type of material!) <br /> <br /> {This is an abbreviation of the "Shirley Temple Festival"}
