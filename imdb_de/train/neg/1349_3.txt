I got this DVD about 2 years ago and decided to buy the DVD yesterday. I do not know why it took me so long to like the Inspector gadget show and even the new gadget and gadgets. While there's a bright color palette and the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie, there are a few old things that clog this gadget right on the toilet. <br /> <br /> First the classic Inspector gadget theme song and music are completely missing. The composer tries to make compromises by making a score that sounds similar but is still not good enough. The gadget phone is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. It also looks a lot neater and rounder, rather than just being cool. Penny no longer has a computer book and she and Brain barely perform. <br /> <br /> The plot does not exist. There is something about a transformation formula and the use of Doctor Claw for some who have never revealed evil, but that's all I have. I will never know what the deal with the short / huge Italian was. It had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> And if the title is anything, his last case is in no way wrapped up. And he remains in power, which is why it is also called "last case", is a mystery. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed at all. This is an affront to a great animated show strangely absent on DVD. However, do not be tempted to buy Inspector Gadget DVDs that you can buy. I only sold these seconds after I finally saw it. No kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show will tolerate it.
