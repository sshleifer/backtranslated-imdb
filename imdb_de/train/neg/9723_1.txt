Jeux d'enfants or how the film was wrongly translated into English. Love me if You Dare is a movie made by stupid people and stupid people. I just do not know how I could expect a glimpse of a movie with such a conspiracy: Two stupid, ignorant children insist that each one of them will do something (certainly extremely idiotic) to prove to each other (wtf?) are "cool guys". I know that I've exaggerated some aspects, but that's what the movie is all about. They are getting older ... and instead of realizing that they are just a few alienated spinners, they continue their crazy stuff and think that they are great people. <br /> <br /> One could expect such a movie from Hollywood. but France? Even more offensive is to watch the film from the country from which Amelie emerged a few years ago. The film tries to look good, but it is far, extremely far away from. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
