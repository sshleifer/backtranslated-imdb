I do not really understand all these positive reviews. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this movie. But I do not think it's their own fault, but the directors. He somehow managed to make everything look artificial; Her acting, the idea, the make-up, everything. <br /> <br /> The star I give is just for the idea behind the film, which was executed very poorly Do not look at this bullshit, look at a Fellini, Woody Allen or David Lynch.
