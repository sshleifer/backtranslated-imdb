Hello, maybe because I'm not a theatrical focus or a sophisticated movie guard ... I think this movie is "boring" and "stupid". <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because of Charles Bronson and him ... but what a waste of time ... I just got 2 guys sitting in a vault and talking ... <br / > <br /> The movie on this DVD was so "DARK" ... I had a hard time watching the damn movie ... I know it's a 1968 movie ... but they hang it up a DVD, then they should do some digital remastering. <br /> <br /> I too was totally surprised These high marks on IMDb you see for this movie ... As I said, I'm not as sophisticated as the other people who commented on this movie earlier.
