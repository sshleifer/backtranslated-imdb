Strange ... I like all this movie crew and dark humor films. but I did not like that at all! It's terrible, terrible and certainly not funny at all. Too bad can not make a full movie presentation, even disgust. And it was really boring. Long empty moments fill the film; it could have been removed. It certainly should have been in a different shorter format. Maybe I expected too much from the crew - like saving the movie lol -. It is also full of overloaded stereotypes of characters and situations ... I do not understand why people liked it ... "poetry", "hope"; No, mum, I did not see anything like that! All in all, it is empty and crude, pathetic and hopeless. Oh damn it ........
