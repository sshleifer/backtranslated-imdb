I am a stupid person for renting the DVD REDLINE. Chicago Pictures, who made this stupid movie, never paid the Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various automobile sites, including mine, which has an ALEXA rating of 16K. They tore me down for the deal, and now I'm traveling with $ 16,000 and they've wasted a lot of my personal time (Peter Rapport of Palisades Media), you know who you are! Please do not rent or buy movie !!! It's shit and the people behind are rip-off artists. <br /> <br /> REDLINE has a bunch of losers and poor actors! <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke
