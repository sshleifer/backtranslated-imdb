In an otherwise good review, loleralacartelort7890 says, "The truth is, Americans are using a secret aluminum anti-radiation alloy, it's not so well known, and the exact specifications are a mystery, and why is it a secret? Why should If they were in a space competition with the Russians, it would be very stupid to say that they had new technology that could protect the crew from radiation. "That's completely wrong. There is no "secret" for radiation protection in Apollo. The design and structure of the Apollo Command Module has been publicly available for a long time. It uses a lightweight "honeycomb" made of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except for the windows, of course) is covered with a heat shield of phenolic resin, which is thicker at the bottom and facing forward on re-entry. These materials are * better * able to stop the type of radiation that we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited to stop ionizing photons like X-rays and gamma rays. Space radiation is a definite problem for * long term * space flights due to the danger of large solar flares. But it just was not a serious threat to the Apollo astronauts. The command module offered them good protection during their brief passage through the Van Allen belts. All wore dosimeters, so we know exactly how much radiation they each received: not more than 1.5 m and usually less. Of the 24 men who flew to the moon (12 of whom landed), 18 are still alive. Only two died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died of heart attack, pancreatitis (Roosa) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually pretty good stats for a group of men who are in their late 70s (Shepard would be 86).
