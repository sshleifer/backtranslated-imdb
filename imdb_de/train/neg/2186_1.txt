... but it will ask you if we even had any! This movie is as bad as today's terrible horror. A man walks around with half-dressed ladies and tries to decide which woman to kill so that he can give his girlfriend a new body. In one scene, a man staggers and spills over the entire set for three minutes, covering everything that needs to be over ten gallons of "blood." The film also tries to convey the feeling that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but the film is so poorly made that it is impossible for the audience to create a sense of shock or indignation. Insufficiently dark and unobtrusively scary, this film can not even get its own title - the initial credits say "the brain that would not die," but the final credits call it "the head that would not die."
