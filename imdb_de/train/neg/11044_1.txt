This film, shown as "hydrosphere" in Australia, is so bad that you need to be hypnotized and look to the end, just to see if it could get any worse ... and it does! The plot is so predictable that it is written by a high school drama class, the sets are pathetic, but slightly better than the miniatures, and the play is made of wood. <br /> <br /> The child 'Muppet' seems to have been stolen from the props department of 'Total Recall'. There did not seem to be a single, original idea in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> I found this movie so bad that I laughed the most. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should hang his head in shame. He obviously needed the money!
