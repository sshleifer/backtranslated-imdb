I grew up with Scooby Doo Where Are You and I still love it. It's one of my favorite cartoons, along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and the Pirates, as well as Tom and Jerry. While this show is good for kids, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the theme is bearable and there are some nice animations. It is rather disappointing. Normally Scrappy does not mind me, but if he looks like the main character, it quickly gets annoying. Scrappy is a little more annoying than usual and is completed with the slogan Puppy Power. Also, half of the gangs are missing after the first year, somehow it did not feel like Scooby Doo. The jokes and storylines were generally lame and unoriginal, very little to hunt monsters or unmask the bad guys. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: get a hint, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, voices, theme and the fact that it is nice for children. Bethany Cox
