As others have said, "No, Luciano" is a fitting title or answer to this movie title. For entertainment, the great opera singer should keep singing ... not that he's a terrible actor. It's just that this movie stinks. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were fine - sort of a nice family movie - but after that it's nothing but a boring soap opera Pavarotti, who appropriately plays a singer, as "Giorgio Fini", loses a few Sometimes his voice and the doctor Pamela Taylor (Kathryn Harrold) comes to the rescue. The singer then falls in love with the doctor, the doctor slowly falls in love with the singer, the two argue on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on, and so on. It's Harrold that spoils things, and after watching her here, I'm not surprised she did not become a star. <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful backdrop in the film, good shots of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the movie. I got bored and I do not remember much about the second half.
