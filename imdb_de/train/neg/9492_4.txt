A star for the "plot". A star for acting. A star for the synchronization with a squeaky American. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow with their tendency to take off their clothes. And ten out of ten for the divine Emmanuelle Béart, two years before she made "Manon des Sources". Béart also takes off her clothes a few times, but even her clothes are enough to make this movie look great. Pay attention to the scene in which she tells her friend about the three "first time" girls. It is hackneyed, but even more erotic than the rather ridiculously choreographed love scenes by Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. By the way, cinematography is not great; The credits for the credits are a better indication of what David Hamilton is capable of.
