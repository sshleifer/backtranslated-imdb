Virgin is chosen to marry a rich man. Rich guy urinated. Woman on the boat likes sailor. Sailor urinated. Virgin attends a large communal dinner. Man urinates at the dining table. Boatwoman makes curious for little boys. Man pretending to be baby urinated. There is an underlying topic here. Makavejev tries to say that he is born. To say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement. To justify the title, there is a scene in which Laure, who barely speaks ten lines throughout the film, bathes in chocolate syrup. It's a sweet scene indeed, but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in your mouth unless you share the director's fetishes.
