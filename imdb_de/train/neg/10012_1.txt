This movie has to be in line for the most boring movie in years. Not even Woody Harrison can save this movie from destruction. <br /> <br /> The murder in this movie is supposed to be the attraction in this movie, but it's not, nothing is of interest. The cast is not so bad, but the script is just awful, I was completely amazed during this movie and thought about how in the world this movie can be entertaining. The producers of this film were very smart. They made a boring movie, but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. People will go to the blockbuster and probably see and think about this movie, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe, that must be good and borrow this movie. (Boy, you have a terrible time) <br /> <br /> If you enjoy renting this movie, some people have really enjoyed this movie, but I like watching a movie with meaning
