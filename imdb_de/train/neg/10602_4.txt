This movie is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth to be seen is because Jean-Claud Vam Damme plays the lead role in this movie. There are some good action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie. > <br /> The acting in this movie is so bad and it's the worst I've ever seen. The two actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can not trade in ALL. And this movie is by far one of Jean-Claud Vam Dammes worst movies he's made, and if you see him in one of his great movies, check out Blood Sport, KickBoxer or Sudden Death. <br /> <br /> This movie is crap / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.
