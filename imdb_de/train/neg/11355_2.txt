"Nat" (voiced by Trevor Gagnon), together with his friendly friend "IQ" (voiced by Philip Bolden) and the always-hungry "Scooter" (David Gore) are children with big dreams. They want to be the first flies in space. And what inspires their dreams is the first spaceship to land on the Moon, the Apollo 11, waiting for its historic journey on the launch pad near the three. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is the animation of the movie. I thought it was very well done. The landscape was deep because the things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the scenes. I did not watch the movie in 3D because it aired on HBO. However, I could see that there were really no scenes that exploited the 3D effects, except for a fight between the characters at the end. I was not really impressed by the design of the figures. For me, they did not look like a fly, especially in color. The flies were an unusual blue-gray that somehow distracted me. <br /> <br /> The performances of the cast were not bad, but not good either. There have been many times that I've been more focused on my computer than history. The writing was certainly written for a younger audience, with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh. I have not seen anything for adults, like jokes, that they get the point for the adults to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> The story was not followed in this movie. I think it was completely ignored because the focus was on the flies. I also hated it when a well-known astronaut appeared on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the movie were fiction and that there were no flies on Apollo 11. I liked how he thanked the women and men who sacrificed their lives for space exploration. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not done for the whole family. This is certainly only for children. But keep them for a rainy day.
