I really have to watch a good movie soon, because it seems that every second entry is something I despise. Despite my story, I can not tell a lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels. I never thought I would see a movie as thundering as this one. Al Pacino does not play in this movie: he poses. There are many, many scenes of his character who is a racing driver and just stares at the camera. He is absolutely terrible. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two should be in a love affair, and there simply is not chemistry. Sydney Pollack directed this movie? There is no trace of the genius behind Tootsie. Is this the same man I cheered for in Eyes Wide Shut? I can hardly believe it save a terrible movie experience. Run, do not leave Bobby Deerfield.
