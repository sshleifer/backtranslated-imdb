A group of us who saw this movie were really disgusted. We were ready to forgive that our favorite character Jo was not there (it's not that the writers / producers could do anything about it). The writing was bad, the script was below average. What really annoyed us: 1. When the two boys realized that they were both with Natalie, they did not just let themselves go through this stupid (and eventually humiliating) competition - but only because they were macho competitors, not because they were Natalie really wanted to be. 2. Although Natalie could not decide between the two men before the reunification, does she suddenly decide that she really loves one of them and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no foreshadowing that he really was a better guy, it's as if the authors were tossing a coin and she just spit it out at a convenient point in the movie). 3. Blair talks about how she does not want to have children, and when her husband suddenly says he wants children, she happily agrees.
