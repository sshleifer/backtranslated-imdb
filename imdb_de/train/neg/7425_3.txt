This boring, hard-nosed Las Vegas casino raid movie is almost impossible to watch and engage. It's something you look at when you have absolutely nothing better to do. The only two decent things in this film are both related to the beautiful Stella Stevens and you spend the entire program hoping that she falls out of one of those tight tops she wears. Many great shots of Las Vegas from the 70s (when it was still a cool place to visit) and the fashion of the day are good for a giggle as well. Otherwise a big yawn. The Rhino DVD has a very good widescreen transfer, but even at under $ 10, this is not worth it in my humble opinion.
