There are those films that are bad, they are funny, then there are those in which you scream, "I want the one and a half hours of my life back" ... that's pretty much what that is. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain tries to be an actor, but fails. the sfx are really bad (repeated scenes and rocks look like falling paper) and the fake plastic rifles on which torches are mounted ... the split screen effect with which multiple events are shown at once is awful <br /> This movie Can not even be used as one of those simple night entertainers, it's just so bad. <br /> <br /> If I could give negative reviews, I would do that
