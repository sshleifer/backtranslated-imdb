I had no background knowledge of this movie before I bought it, but it sounded cool and I've wanted to watch a really cool Viking movie for some time ... unfortunately, this movie was not what I was looking for. I had hoped for the best, but instead got a boring Nordic soap opera that stretched too long despite its 84-minute runtime. The premise of the film is intriguing enough: it's about a Viking warlord defying his god, and Odin is so angry that he curses the son of the warlord, Barek, as a berserker to death and rebirth. This Barek guy then has to be angry, crazy and violent for life. The film is filmed competitively enough, with rich cinematography and pretty good performances by the actors, but again I got bored and wondering when this dribbling would end. The filmmakers had the chance to do something entertaining and semi-unique, but they dropped the ball. Maybe it could have been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics like unintentional nudity and a lot of gore ... I mean, we're talking about "berserkers" right? Vikings should be bad enough, which should not be even more extreme with all the rape and looting Berserker? All in all, if you're not a fan of The Young and Restless (etc ...) or you're an insane berserker trying to torment yourself, I'd probably stay away from that dreary piece of celluloid.
