I have never seen the older, highly rated version of 1973. I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage (well, by the way, as usual). This movie has probably taken every five minutes to work out the whole plot (I can see it's being made on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party). If you can not find the end of this drool in the first thirty minutes, you'll make it. You'll probably find this movie entertaining. This is the horrible rut Hollywood has apparently created with the horror / mystery / thriller genre, not giving the audience enough credit, writing a fresh, smart and tantalizing script that spreads eerie music and adding a few things so you jump a bit and then send the final imprint to your local theater. At least it had no jerky handheld camera syndrome.
