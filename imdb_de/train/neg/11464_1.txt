While I do not pretend to be an expert on life in the water, I have to say that anyone with a certain level of intelligence can not believe this idea of ​​a whale (and not even the mother!) Who has any idea of ​​revenge it was witnessed how his dead comrade experienced a forced abortion of humans! I'm serious! This is basically the whole plot. Richard Harris must have been very heavy on roles that accepted this garbage. This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents for it you would feel like you want to reclaim your money.
