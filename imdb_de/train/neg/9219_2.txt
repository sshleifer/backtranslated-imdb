I did not know that this was originally a TV movie when I saw it, but I got it through the runtime. It has the same faded colors, threadbare characters and terrible synthetic music that I remember back in the '80s, and a "social platform" that screams "afterschool special". Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Rona Jaffe (Thanks) Mazes and Monsters was made in the heyday of Dungeons & Dragons, a pen and paper role-playing game that captured the hearts of millions of geeks across America. I'm one of those geeks, though I've never played D & D before. I tried one of his brothers. M & M was also in the heyday of D & D's great controversy - that it was so captivating that people could lose touch with reality and worship Satan without knowing it, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at some point, albeit extremely rare - but it dates this movie horribly. <br /> <br /> We meet 4 young college students who play the appropriately named Mazes and Monsters to socialize and have a little time away from the mundane. Only that M & M in the form presented is more boring than her earthly life. Nothing of the fascination of gambling is presented here - and Jay Jay's desire to bring M & M to the "real world" comes from nowhere. It's just an excuse to make one of the characters crazy out of nowhere - though we do not really care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposed to be different - but they are all rich WASPy prigs who have problems that nobody really has. <br /> <br /> But it just keeps going and gets worse in several ways. The low budget is terribly clear (Roberts / Pardu show why he is not a warrior on the craziest knife scene, and the payoff on the "Two Towers" is unintentional) Hilarious Tom Hanks bubbling "Jay Jay, what am I doing here?" let me laugh for minutes. Definitely the low point in his career. <br /> <br /> Do not think of it as daring satire, but as a ridiculous piece of TV trash from the 80s, and you still have a good time. That is, if you can stay awake. The majority is mostly boring, but for Pardus Panne in the end everything is worth it. At least Tom Hanks has gotten better. Not that he could run much worse from here.
