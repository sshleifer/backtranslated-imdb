That's fine. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned up their trash and found the worst comic horror sc-fi musical. If there is something, it is terrible or exaggerated. Special effects; Choose your choice ... very small budget or kindergarten. Every cheap clich√© that is thought of is used. Undoubtedly a funny movie to watch. A cold six-pack or two worth. Point your finger at radiation if you need an apology. Mutant tomatoes become almost as big as a tow truck and attack humanity. San Diego is a good place to start. Scientists and an absent military must find the way to stop this red-rolling threat. Favorite cult features: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
