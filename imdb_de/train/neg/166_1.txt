Okay, at first I did not sit down to watch the premiere of a Star Trek series and see a cowboy flying in space. This is how a normal Enterprise episode works. <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds a fog or something similar and wants to take a closer look, but he could destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 he sends a shuttle into the fog and the shuttle gets damaged ... <br /> <br /> In all the episodes I've seen, all problems are due to Archer's stupid mistakes. Oh, and did you see a preview of an episode where Archer and T'pol are kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? I planned to watch this episode, but after that I gave up Enterprise completely and immediately turned to the television. Come on!!!! This is Star Trek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Also what about the banana slug ?? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug, but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason. Okay, okay, a little stupid to bring you into space with a pet, but anyway. Okay, that's what I thought until you left it on a desert planet !!!!! A BANANA SLUG CAN NOT LEAVE IN A DESERT !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid are these authors? <br /> <br /> Anyway, only if Enterprise is on DO NOT WATCH IT !!!!
