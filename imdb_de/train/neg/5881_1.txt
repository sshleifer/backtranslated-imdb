Absolutely the most boring movie I've ever spent my money on. This was a wrong decision for all these great stars to waste their reputation. Boring! boring! boring! Each character has been presented in a less than inspirational way. No acting talent shown - only a part read. Alec can usually play realistic characters, Gwynyth looks rude, and Annette needed some advice on how to choose the films she plays in, as well as all those big stars who have disappointed me, as they all allow talents, the be suffocated in a function that leaves something to be desired in the conversation. "Running with scissors" leads the public to expect great acting in a movie that suggests tension and deep emotions. There was no moment in which the cast could be an interpretation on screen. Maybe it was the director's fault - whatever.
