If I could say that it was better than Gymkata, at least I felt that my money was not wasted. Then I saw Steven Segal's On Deadly Ground. This movie should see a resurrection though on MST 3K. When Santa conquers the Martians, Tom Servo's head could explode, one wonders what a mess this movie might cause. The creators of this muck should be forced to wear posters every day of their lives saying, "Slut, do it I finished! I was a writer at Gymkata. "
