Spike Lee has to be one of the top rated directors I've ever seen. He's the darling of the critics because he supposedly makes films with a "message" or he's just so unconventional in his approach that critics soaked in Hollywood formula movies eat his stuff just because they're different. <br /> <br Summer Of Sam does not do that well. The film and editing style is Oliver Stone, as is the narrative. The story is similar to "Do The Right thing". The presentation of "Guidos" or for the PC set Italians (of which I happen to be one) comes directly from Eddie Murphy's Raw. Only Eddie Murphy's impression of an Italian macho seeking a fight with a much larger African American is far more credible than the cartoonish, broad Italian cartoons shown here (the John Leguizamo character is a possible exception). <br /> <Is there anyone who has seen this movie who could not figure out how it would end? As soon as Richie got into the movie, I could already see the fist on his face and the foot in his stomach. I could already see that he was being charged as a murderer. This character had the most integrity throughout the movie, so Lee will of course show what happens to people who stand out in a crowd (what a white, bearded clique!). <br /> <br /> Someone please, please give Spike Lee a lifetime pass for all the basketball games he wants. Maybe he enjoys taking a movie camera too long, and we do not have to submit to his self-important affinity, and I do not have to see any critics (some of whom I respect) ohhhh and ahhhh to an emperor without clothes.
