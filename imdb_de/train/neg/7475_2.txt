To be honest, I knew what to expect before watching this movie, and I have to say that he has the worst drama I've ever seen. It has its moments and on a comedy level it's very entertaining, but I'm afraid it's not scary, and stupidity is taken to a new level. There is a lot of unnecessary nerves, and the action is everywhere. I have no idea why the aliens were evil and why they even came to this remote part of Wales (I mean, who would go there anyway?) And the bad CGI. As far as B-movies are concerned, this deserves the title of being so bad, it's good, and kudos to the filmmakers, because they probably knew what they were doing. Long may these films go on .....
