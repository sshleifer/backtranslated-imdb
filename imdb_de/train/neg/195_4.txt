Slow and full of inaccuracies. Outriding the shortcomings, this is still an interesting account of the famous and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas struggle for independence from Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Colonel Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This TV project also includes David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
