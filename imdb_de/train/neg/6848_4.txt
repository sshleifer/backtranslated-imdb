I have to say that I am quite disappointed with this "horror" movie. I did not even get scared when I saw it. It's also not very exciting ... I guessed the end halfway through the movie ... So ... what's left? <br /> <br /> "The Ring" is a really scary movie. I wish other films would stop copying (eg the trademark: long hair). Please give me some originality. <br /> <br /> Can not recommend this movie.
