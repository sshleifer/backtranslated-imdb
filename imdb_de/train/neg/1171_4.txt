I can hardly believe that this sluggish, clumsy and poorly staged film comes from a filmmaker whose other works I really liked. The experience of enduring the Lady and the Duke (and no other words than "enduring") has put me in a vile mood, a condition that is only alleviated by reading ali-112's IMDb user commentary. Because Rohmer has not only (successfully) tried to see the world through the genre art of 18th century France, but, as ali has pointed out (at the expense of the estrangement of his audience), has the effects of both class consciousness and class consciousness The revolution inspired her through the eyes of a wretched woman of her time. The director has done something unquestionably difficult, but I wonder if it was worth the effort he did for that - or whether we are watching the boring results of his work.
