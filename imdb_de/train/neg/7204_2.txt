This is one of those films that you think the makers would refuse to release because it's so awful. Obviously, they thought that kids are stupid and great at putting up endless ads and would think they're entertainment because it's slapstick fun. What about the talking car with buttons featuring Wendy's, McDonald's, M & M's and bowling? There was no talking car in the cartoon. (Dr.) Claw should be angry, not beautiful and charming. Why is Rupert Everet even 'claw'? Were the authors who wrote drugs when they wrote these scenes? It looks as if they are going to fire up Robo Cop (bad) and turn a man into a crime-fighting object. I tried to get my money back, but there is a policy that will not give me any refund if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie. I'm sorry I saw this bastard for more than 30 minutes. After being notified of the Refund Policy, I decided to look at the rest of the vile garb called Inspector Gadget.
