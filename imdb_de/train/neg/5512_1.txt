Put a DVD of this strip in a time capsule and it will definitely be a perfect example for future generations, guaranteeing the minimum rating on a 1 to 10 star scale. Bill Cosby. Bill Cosby and Ray Romano were at the top of their television series - ratings and tens of millions of dollars a year. However, there was no success with the large screens. This is also true for other TV personalities - perhaps because many of the stories presented for two hours are either for a 10-minute sketch or at most for the 22 or 23 minutes of a drama during a half-hour program. <br /> <br /> However, this movie does not contain a single element that requires two or three minutes of time on MAD TV, SNL, or anywhere else on a screen or stage. <br /> <br /> The founding date was listed as 2002, but the release date - only on DVD - will be displayed as 2004. It was also filmed not long before Rodney Dangerfield's death, so his only redeeming value is likely to be leasing, a few hundred thousand dollars more for his heirs. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of it, but found it when switching on my set and was obviously fascinated by it. Some movies are really so awful that they rate some sort of top rating in reverse order - so bad that you can move the knob backwards to a 9 or 10. "Plan 9 from Outer Space" is the best example - and the Bruce Jenner / Village People opus, "Can not Stop the Music," is another. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this strip even falls off there. Although Rodney's earlier work (as well as some of his colleagues) did not produce "Citizen Kane" or "Casablanca," there were many moments of humor and a story that showed at least some interest. <BR /> Unfortunately, this presentation does not seem to have a minute or two of such material.
