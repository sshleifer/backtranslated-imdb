The plot is not so original. If someone has seen "L'ultimo Bacio", there is nothing new. A wealthy family in Rome lives in everyday life, which is boring and wrong, and everyone asks others what they think of them. Really boring after half an hour, because it's easy to understand where the story ends. This is because it is easy to see Muccino's moralistic view in this film, so even the most difficult parts seem normal. To sum it up in the first 2 minutes of the movie, it would be enough and the goal of the movie has already been said. The family looked from a 30 year old, I do not like to see a movie that wants to show the reality, but in order to be consistent with his thoughts, the situation must push more than the normal ones. Really good, as Muccino put the camera in the right place and was moving with the Carathers, and that's the only reason why I do not sleep in the cinema, but always scream in the movie from the start. Maybe it would be good to see the family as it really is and not blame it. Morante was intense and great as always, but unfortunately in a bad movie!
