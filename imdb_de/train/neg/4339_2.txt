This movie was not at all what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this movie was called something else, nobody would notice the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> It's really strange because I can not see the point. The prequel and the sequel simply let us say there is no point in not even matching. maybe I'm naive, but no vol 1 & vol 2 should fit. <br /> <br /> carlito was imprisoned in the first prison and dies in the original, and in prequel he lives and does not go to jail. <br /> <br /> The plot was alright but it should have changed with some actors and a few storylines and the name of the movie and it would have been a good movie I really expected it to end when the other one started. <br /> <br /> If anyone has an opinion on this post, please.
