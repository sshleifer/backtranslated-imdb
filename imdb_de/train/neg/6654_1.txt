I do not usually think that Hollywood productions can be called films, so I call them "movies." But this piece of elephant fertilizer is not even suitable for a movie, hence the quotes in the title. Where should I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of geriatric casting, it is certainly the epitome. Stefanie Powers should play someone who is even less than half her age, she should be 18 years old and she is MANY TWO !!!! <br /> <br /> 2. A horrible and stupid, pointless portrayal of Paris and France, in which we clich√©s like the likable, grumpy shopkeeper, the bitchy queen of the models, the fairy godmother, the ex-queen of the models, etc. Respect by the Da Vinci Code (which critics rightly classified as comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It is highly ridiculous to have no nudity in a movie about a time and a place where nudity was so common, especially when the whole focus is on it. <br /> <br /> 4. The terrible accents !!! <br /> <br /> 5. The Nana Mouskouri elevator music !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think that's enough. And I could make those observations after watching this crap for only half an hour while surfing the internet and talking to my friends about mathematical equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add my list. :): P: D
