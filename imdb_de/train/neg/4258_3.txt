I would give this film 5 instead of 3 if it were at least on time ... When I saw it for the first time, it was exactly what you could expect from the work and not based on the artistic ability of the directors but on the idealistic or I would rather say idiotic habits of our (Kazakh) government ... It's a shame because 'Qazaqfil'm' made beautiful films when Shaken Aimanov was not honored, but it was actually over him. The films like "Konec Atamana", "Kyz Zhibek" or even "Aldar Kose". After the death of Mr. Aimanov, the production of quality films dropped almost dramatically in 10 years, with very few films being produced. In the late 1980s, "Assa" was filmed, a film about the first organized crime groups in the country. A year later, Mr. Rashid Nugmanov made another film with the co-star of the same actor / singer V. Tsoy. At that time he was already a Soviet-Russian rock legend. The movie called "Igla" (The Needle or something) was completely new. Someone called this period Resurrection or a new Kazakh film wave. Unfortunately, we do not have any quality films today. Our directors make films about the financial support of France and Japan. Therefore, films are not intended for the public, but for the authors of the authors, some of them are represented at international authoring film festivals Some of them become business asset products ... And back to our "nomads". Such films are usually unpopular because of the big issues. Nikita Mikhalkov's "Sibirski Cyrilnik" had the same effect on Russian tsars, who were also shot down on equal terms with foreign partners, I believe that they were French or perhaps British. Nobdy liked it, even in the Russian public it became a major theme of comedians and comedy shows like "KVN". IMHO
