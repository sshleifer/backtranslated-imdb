The movie is just bad. Just terrible The series of bad movies from Bollywood has no end! They must (or do not) lack excuses for such terrible films. <br /> <br /> The problem seems to be mainly with the directors. This movie has 2 good actors who have proven in the past that they have the opportunity to perform great ... but they have been judged so badly. The bad script did not help either. <br /> <br /> This film has many ridiculous moments and very poor editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first big concert, Ajay Devgan meets Om Puri (from whom he ran away 30 years ago and talked to him). All that Om Puri has to say is be careful of his friendship with Salman !!! What a crap. Serious. Not to mention the Baaad soundtrack. Whatever happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun is an absolute miscast for the portrayal of a rock star. <br /> <br /> Only mercy is the good performance of the second half. Ajay shines as his character shows his dark side. Salman also as a drug addict. <br /> <br /> You might just watch it for the last half hour.
