The acting was terrible and they got both sports wrong ....... Not only did you misunderstand the figure skating rules but also the rules of GIRLS Ice Hockey. You can not look in the GIRLS ice hockey. They also do not block for someone. Not all girls are disgustingly rude and tall. I play hockey and am only 4'11 and was asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. Not all hockey players hate skaters. Many of today's girls' hockey players were themselves ice skaters. We walk much faster than the ones in the movie. I was embarrassed by the movie, which gave people the idea that we suck ....... although I have to mention that it is difficult to switch between the sports because the toe shoes are on the skates of these KAtelin played twenty movements on the ice, which could not be done in a regular hockey game. She basically stumbled upon the person who is illigal. It is also unrealistic that she would receive a HOCKEY scholarship when she skates. That really got me angry that scholarship is usually getting used to someone who could be useful to the team.
