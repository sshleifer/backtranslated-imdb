As a child, all my friends and I believed that Gymkata is the most violent and bloodiest movie ever made. I'm not sure who started this rumor. It was probably born out of the frustration of 10-year-olds who, for one reason or another, were not allowed to see it. Years after the release of Gymkata it became a multi-year late-night cable movie, and I was able to make up for the lost time. I've seen scenes from this horrible excuse for a movie over a dozen times, and I can always tell from 1-2 seconds of screen time. Apart from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts, the bad synchronization, the rigid dialogue and the incredibly difficult plot, the film has a lot to offer. In everything that makes the movie visually bad, the sound is actually quite entertaining. Never has a blow or kick landed with so little power and volume! The canned kung-fu sounds are rude, but the slow and muted music and the almost five-minute slow motion scene are really weird. The chase through the city of crazy, bloodthirsty villagers is not as tense as irritating, and there are enough bad wigs and extras that almost look in the camera and wave to make this train crash a little bit fun. Could it stand for the cult classic? Where is MST3K when we need it?
