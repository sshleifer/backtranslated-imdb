I rented this movie for a reason, Tom Savini, I respect his work, but that was a real downer. I had terrible clich√©s. Half of the film consisted of naked women, called "fallen angels," who roamed and tried to look scary. There was occasionally "Blair Witch," a black and white, moving camera scene. Tom's character was really terrible, Horrible Script. And you have to love those lines that use them. "Is there anyone out there that's not funny?" No, but your acting was. I wish I could give this movie a 0! Oh the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they omitted Anthony. The breakfast club meets in the forest of unforgivable spectacle.
