* Can someone tell me where the comedy is ?? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian, (Thomas Haden Church) looks so weak (with him!) and the whole thing is so stubborn! <br /> <br /> * You tried to create a live comic book that turned out to be an extremely bloody comic nightmare and it was not even funny? Like the scene of the plan in the bathroom; It was so good with his cinematic imagination, but there is nothing left ... except PAIN! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ??! His relationship with his daughter ?! <br /> <br /> * This is actually some kind of work they only did to earn something and earn some money, but it became such a crime when THIS money would be robbed by all those who Those cheated of such low art and entertainment had NO entertainment at all! <br /> <br /> * Well, it would have been uglier if it had been a big production and Brando in his lead role would be Golden Years with a REAL star. <br /> <br /> * The Sheen family here. Be aware of that! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who admires this movie or - God forbids - loves it! Then you have to go straight to therapy before you become more dangerous and injure others! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius, but the movie is not! And he did not mean to be here after reading this for sure !! But the main problem is that no one else has worked on it or tried to be smart or even good for a little while !!! (Sorry, I'm crying now! The torture of the movie is incredible!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) (Mira Sorvino) beats her shoes! That was so realistic !? Maybe he saw himself in her and punished himself for being in such a crap! <br /> <br /> * For the billions of years: this could have been better (or less!). The script was nice until the train raided, and I just imagined that they would flee to do a chase like another (Smokey and the bandit), but with (Brando) as the sheriff. In fact, one of these chimeras was much more merciful than what I looked at! <br /> <br /> * Why did not this masterpiece receive a Razzie prize ?! You want to make me believe that there were fewer films than THIS? I do not believe that ! It is a situation in which the razzie's supervisor himself has to win one for his negligence. Martin Sheen is also here as a guest star, perhaps for the support of his failed son, but ironically, the father had failed just as his son! and why is that ?! Well ! I hate Martin Sheen maybe more than I hate comic movies were not as good as his ambition! <br /> <br /> * It's not a comedy movie, NO. It's a horror movie, and I hate horror movies, especially those that have been touted as comic movies! <br /> <br /> * How good is that? Hmmm ! Compared to another monster movie by Marlon Brando (The Island of Dr. Moreau - 1996) this would be close to (Casablanca) !! <br /> <br /> PS: If you still want to know what the bad, the ugly and the very ugly are or are in this film. Just pray your last prayers and have a look. May God help you!
