This movie is so bad - dialogues, stories, actors and actresses - everything! - that it is hard to imagine that we will see a worse movie in this or the following years. "Love's Brother" (playing in Australia among Italian immigrants) has only superficial clich√©s about Italian culture, and it's understandable that even the Italians from and in Italy speak in the film ENGLISH. The message of the film - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - is really uncomfortable. Giovanni Ribisi is pretty good in films like "Suburbia" or "Lost in Translation," but his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. Watch this movie at your own risk. Dustbin as trash can!
