This is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but I really can not remember when I saw a worse one. I thought it was an aircraft accident investigation. What it really was is a soap opera, plus a bad one. They exceeded the "conflict" card extremely. The first hour seems to be a screaming game with implausible scenes. <br /> <br /> * Possible Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The 40-minute commemoration scene (with the required black umbrellas and rain) of fictitious casualties was lame, and I thought it would never end. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs, unless you indulge in "conflict". <br /> <br />
