This movie is simply one of the worst movies ever made and is a damned accusation not only for the British film industry, but also for the talentless hacks in action today. The film was not only widely circulated, but also contains a good cast of British actors. So what went wrong? I do not know and I'm just not interested in the debate because the movie was so awful that it does not deserve any thought at all. Be warned and stay away from this garbage. but apparently i have to write ten lines of text in this report, so i could describe the plot exactly. A man of one man is set up by his evil friend and associate from his father's company, thus leading to an encounter with the Russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid, very stupid acts. I should have asked for my money, but maybe I was still shocked by the experience. If you want to see a good crime movie, look at the usual suspects or godparents. What about the castle, the camp? This is the culmination of contemporary British crime film.
