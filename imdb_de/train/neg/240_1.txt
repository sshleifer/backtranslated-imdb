I never like to comment on a good movie, but if it's a bad movie, I have to take care of it. When talking about Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have lost it completely. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could make money with kitschy wedding videos. Vivah is so cheesy that Badjatyas left Johars and Chopras behind. <br /> <br /> There was not a single moment during the movie where I could say, "Oh, at least this thing is good, Aloknath makes a clich√© in a role as a girl's dad, Shahid kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed Amrita rao is another disaster alongside ugly-looking sets, bad costumes, deceptive storyline, monstrous stepmother, die-hard actors and cacophonic background music, cheap soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Well, the spoiler, I'm warning you that how in all his other films, after a catastrophic incident the film ends with a happy note.
