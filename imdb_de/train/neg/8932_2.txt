I must say, I was very curious about this film, and when it was released in 1970 by 20th Century Fox, it was considered a notorious disaster. He has also appeared on several critics' lists of bad movies and this has only compounded the interest I just had to see what made this movie so bad. When I see him, I have my answers. Although I'm going to say that it makes for curious viewing, acting, directing and script are so laughingly bad that the alleged satire is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to be trying to wear the movie, but after the opening sequence of the sex change, the movie goes downhill so far that he can not do it alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help as he licks and laughs on the screen, sometimes he looks like he's wondering what he's doing. Rex Reed hops around as Myron, Myra's alter ego, and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene. Bravo for debut performances! Farrah Fawcett plays a dumb blonde; In this role she certainly seemed to convince. But the most notorious role, of course, went to Mae West. The sight of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face making sexual allusions seemed more appropriate for a horror movie. I do not intend to lay down this litter personally; but nobody gets along well in this movie. The director seems so immobile and nonexistent that the movie is not only bad, but also boring. Throw old footage of old stars and the movie gets even more incoherent. Anyone who enjoyed that, and I was glad I saw it, at least, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the catastrophe that is claimed to be so from the beginning.
