Watching the movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to go in the middle of the movie, but I resisted. I do not know what Ridley Scott was up to, but I've learned that women in the army are as stupid as men. They learn to spit, insult and fight in the fight, and that's also a waste of time (in my opinion). And what was this last scene in Lybia? Are you still fighting against Gadafi or is it easy for anyone to believe that Islamic people are always a danger?
