Yes, I know that "talkies" were invented for cinema only two years ago when it was produced in 1929, but this film showed that much had to be learned about the art of film production. It appears as a filmed "Hammy" stage act The performers melodramatically embody their lines, twisting their eyes, using too many pregnant pauses, and using gestures more appropriate for silent film cinema. This was probably normal during the process to encourage them to look more naturalistic on the screen. While editing, the film was significantly streamlined as it significantly slows down the film. It is now only interesting for Titanic fans who would like to see an early example of this sea-wreck in the movie. In the next chronological order they could see "Titanic" (1953) A Night to Remember (1958) "Titanic (1997)" to see how the depiction of the tragedy of cinema has evolved over the years. There have been many documentaries and television films, including the cruel "SOS Titanic" (1979). On my versi David McCallum gives an introduction to this DVD. He was the one who played Harold Bride Marconi's younger wireless operator in "A Night to Remember" (still the best feature film) - please read my "Tribute to Walter" comments on IMDb at Howard Morley.demon.co.uk ) and gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos titled "End of a Dream" so that he was well qualified to give the narrative. When I found more interest, I found a recording that was accompanied by recent photos of the year 1912 hearing in the US Senate, which is also on the DVD. The doctors speak the very words of Lightoller's 2nd Officer, J Bruce Ismay, Managing Director of White Star, Harold Bride and others, including Gloria Stewart (The "Old Rose" in Titanic 1997), whose voice is considered one of the first survivors used by women.
