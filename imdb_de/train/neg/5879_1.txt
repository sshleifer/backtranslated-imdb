I wonder how the actors behaved in this movie. Annette Bening was really herself, half in and half out, faking her or was she natural? It did not matter, considering that even if she had walked on the ceiling, the pattern of the movie would not have changed. Brian Cox has behaved really well. I almost thought that he had always acted so complicated and dishonest in a filthy environment where nobody really cared about hygiene. As far as Gwyneth Paltrow is concerned, the question arises as to what she did in this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty sick and disgusting. Who would pay to see such a crap?
