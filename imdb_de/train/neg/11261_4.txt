First, I must point out that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you do not know why or for what. When you finally find out, you find it's just a twisted Soad opera dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons. The characters are rather poor and the actors (especially the boys) do not help much to make them credible. Only Marisa Paredes is striking, but she is an outstanding actress, no matter if the movie is pure rubbish. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing about "Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno" is that the debutant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions, and he shot a few scenes that are pretty intense ... well, maybe at next time ... <br /> <br /> * My rating: 4/10
