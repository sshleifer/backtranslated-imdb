Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man, with no moral qualities. He only wanted to succeed in a society in which all people, politicians, business people, journalists and women are corrupt. The only king is money. The Maupassant hero, Charles Forestier, rises ever higher in company size thanks to his seduction poses. He is in love with all the women who could help him in his action to climb the club statues. At the end of the novel, he married the biggest daughter of the daily newspaper in the largest church in Paris: "La Madeleine". "Le Tout Paris" is here. He has a fortune and more, he becomes a Member of Parliament and later Minister. The "useless" women are not in his sight, but he always keeps in touch with the pretty and useful women. The image "The Private Affairs of Bel Ami" is a story of MORALITY. It's all, but not a story in the Maupassant idea. Why did you record "BEL AMI" in the title?
