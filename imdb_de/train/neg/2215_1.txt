This is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex she loved so much was probably dead, but really his scientist father had simply mesmerized him to make him a really sweet shark guy do. A bit like the beauty and the beast. It could probably be a dance scene in the ballroom and maybe a few singing candlesticks, but instead there are some pretty plants. They make this one girl really itchy, so she lets the shark-type eat her instead of scratching through the movie. The scientist is a good father who tries to reunite his fishy shark son with the woman he was betrothed to. He even arranges that they have a private time for sex. The guy is an ugly, sick monster and he wants nothing to do with him. She gave up the love! Just because he was a shark! I found it rather sad that she only had to kiss him and he would return to normal and they would happily live on it, but it is not a movie.
