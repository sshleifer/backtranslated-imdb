Only in a very rare case can an episode of the x files cause no excitement, or the episode contains everything that is just boring. A detective and his former partner both die under unexplained circumstances. The deaths are related to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took place. Mulder has come up with a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues was reborn as a little girl and demanded revenge. Now for the bizarre dentition. The little girl has no connection whatsoever and seems to be just a random person chosen as a reincarnation. I think that was some lazy writing from the authors and this episode is one of the worst in X-Files history!
