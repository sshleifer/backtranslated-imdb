As an expert on the naval history of World War II, and as someone who is not proud of the country's history of race relations, I was looking forward to this film. What a disappointing blow. I made it about 3/4 of the way, but I should have turned it off in the scene before the attack. The idea that a submarine would fire a torpedo at a DDE, as if there is hope that it will be hit, and then be able to "run away" during the underwater in front of the DDE, is absurd. And that's just a small detail. The whole movie was badly written, misdirected and badly traded. I agree with others on this board that this could have been a good movie. It's like they decided that since all those shitty WWII propaganda films were filmed with pure white casts, they had to do one with black people. And as bad as these old movies were, that's how bad it is. And it almost smells like false advertising to override Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turned out that they had very minor roles. I have to believe that these two good actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film. I'm done. I have given this crap movie too much of my life.
