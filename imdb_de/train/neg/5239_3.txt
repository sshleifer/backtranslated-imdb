I saw this movie because of the very favorable reviews that I have read here from others. <br /> <br /> You've definitely seen something in this movie that I did not see, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The movie starts at a good pace and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting, then it starts to get scrapped, not to mention an incredible one. <br /> <br /> You may find them you say yourself: "What?!? He will do that too? How far will he go with this thing?" <br /> <br /> The storyline begins with Jeff Goldblum's character John, who goes to a deli to buy a bottle of wine. There's a robbery and a new store clerk, Auggie Rose, is killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John gets into the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. This seems a bit much, but wait, there is more. <br /> <br /> John is totally obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that never make sense, John, who has a very good life, a beautiful, loving girlfriend, a safe, well-paid job, a nice house, a nice car, and expensive suits - Decides that he should be a loser, as Auggie Rose was, and that he lives his life in a low-paid job, living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and potential connections to dangerous people. <br /> <br /> Why did this dim-witted, half-baked movie receive favorable reviews that I'll never know? Sure, Goldblum does a good drama job - he always does - and his looks have improved with age - but if you do not have a big crush on Jeff Goldblum and need to see every movie he's in, I would do not recommend this turkey. It's about two hours of your life that you will not come back - and trust me - you have nothing to be thankful for when those two hours are over. Apart from being grateful, you are not sitting there watching this movie! <br /> <br />
