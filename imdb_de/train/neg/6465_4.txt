This trip to Charles is decent, but this is a pretty modest performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There is a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland, who forgets the development and a little hurt the movie. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie wants to change his name. Every movie with "Charles" was pretty bad.
