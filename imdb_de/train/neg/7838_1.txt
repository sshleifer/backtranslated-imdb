This film was essentially Velvet Goldmine, when the authors of the party of five got it under control and turned it into a TV. Movie. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had, which was good at acting, writing, and basically anything else. The movie had the worst writing I've seen since Wild Wild West. It had to be interesting in any case. I know that vh 1 has become known for their music behind the shows. That's a lot better than anything that could have worked if it was behind the music episode, but it was not and feels flat.
