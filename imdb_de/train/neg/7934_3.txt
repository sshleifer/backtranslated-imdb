A family traveling for their daughter's softball league chooses the "scenic route" and lands in the middle of nowhere. The father is an avid photographer, and when he hears about an old, abandoned side show in town, he decides to take another detour to take some pictures. <br /> <br /> Of course, the side show is full of inbred freaks who promptly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to their own devices. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing about this movie is how the family actually fights against their inbred captives. Apart from that, the movie is worth nothing.
