I bought it (it was only $ 3, ok?) Under the title "Gray Matter". The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a role without Duke-Sophazzard intrigued me. As the other reviewers have warned, it's a pretty boring story about a top secret government experiment that went awry. <br /> <br /> And yes, there are a lot of settings, especially a house with a pool in front of it. Some of the characters and interiors are so inconspicuous that the filmmakers were worried that we might forget who is who, and they always keep us off by first showing the outside of the buildings. It's kind of funny. After a while, the pool feels like a TV station's station identification logo reminding us that we're seeing "Gray Matter". <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed two seizures of name knitters. At one point, an angry test subject mocks a responsible person by calling them "Scientific b * tch!" Designated. It's just a very inadequate insult. Some scenes later, another theme unleashes itself, mumbling about this "scientific background". It just sounded very awkward to me. <br /> <br /> At some point, this movie will disappear forever. In another decade, it will probably be impossible to find copies of it. Almost as if it never happened. <br /> <br />
