Anyone who likes 1920s jazz, 1920s dresses, the Charleston, and the ultra-sophisticated yachts (like me in all respects) will love this movie. But the sad fact is that that's all. The plot is banal and obvious, the acting is usually terrible or plays on the absurd side of the action, and when the whole thing is over, not much remains, but the impression of mirrors and smoke. This is a beautifully made bad movie.
