Just awful! Why should not you use real actors? Look, that has to stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want to get credibility or a message about these low-budget movies, please use real actors! Most will work for free ... use that! Well back to my comment ... at least the humor was lower than the bathroom variety and was not funny at any level. In terms of quality ... in a scene shot on a public transport bus, you could see the reflection of the crew ... you know what? It was a guy who looked like a Sony camcorder and probably not even his. Well, I assume that the only audience for this movie is people with a bloody fetish ... and it was not even good.
