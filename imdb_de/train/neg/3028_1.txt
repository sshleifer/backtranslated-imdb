My roommate recently rented this movie, so we watched the movie together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is actually positive, because the entire film is shot in this colorful, grainy post-MTV texture. Quick sequences, cool angles, moving camera movements - for the moment you feel like watching another "snatch," for the moment ... <br /> <br /> When the story unfolds, it starts one as if one dosed amphetamine. Things just do not make sense anymore. I would hate to spoil the fun of watching by distributing certain scenes, but on the other hand, the movie is so bad that you actually feel better if you do not watch it. <br /> <br /> At first you think it's a crime story told in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu. NOT CORRECT. This conversation does not provide any coherent narrative. Rather, on the contrary, Domino's lesbian actress on Lucy Liu's character in the second part of the film throws the audience into further confusion. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it might be a movie about a wealthy girl but a dysfunctional background that became a tough bounty hunter. In any case, this is the message conveyed by the opening scenes. After that, the question of Domino's character for the criminal conspiracy is completely lost. In short, NO, this is NOT a movie about Domino's character. <br /> <br /> Then I thought, it's probably a story of a robbery. A pretty bloody robbery. 10 million were missing, bounty hunters chase alleged robbers, Mafia children are executed, hands taken away, Domino tries to crack, why they get this time no bounty certificates, etc. But soon this impression will be destroyed by another turn plot. <br /> <br /> This time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese African-American woman who fakes driving licenses at the local MVD and is a youngest grandmother at 28 years old. Lateesha starred in the Jerry Springer show, trying to release some new, crazy racial theories while fighting to find money for her sick granddaughter. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the main presentation? Ah, well, nobody knows. Apart from the fact that the director had to explain to the viewers, where bounty hunters put their collector fee of 300.000. Then at some point you start to think, "Oh, it's about our society and the way the media distort things." There is a reality TV team that drives around with the bounty hunters and takes violent pictures. The bounty hunters are also bogged down with a string of Hollywood actors who moan about it all the time for breaking their noses and dragging themselves around too many crime scenes. But NO, this is not a film about media, they only appear sporadically throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are numerous other negotiations: The crazy Afghani who wants to liberate Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, the mescaline episode, the FBI surveillance operation ... Can all the above things in one 2-hour movie packed? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - it's a mess!
