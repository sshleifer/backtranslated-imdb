Cash (now played by Khrystyne Haje in Angelina Jolie) has wandered to a desert landscape after the Apocalypse (after her protector died from old age and the protector was played by Elias Koteas, a truly decent actor) the debris after cyborgs seeks to trade with metal and cash. She leads a group of burned-out cyborgs (including William Katt, Evan Lurie and a Zach Galligan-trained humanist) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 manages to be better than the other two entries, but it's still a pretty boring feature. The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never well used, the action sequences are routine and the names like McDowell, Katt and Galligan have little to do. Haje is indeed a vain heroine and Lynch is (as usual) too over the top and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun as its hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the second is just boring.) Also disappointing is the science fiction angle, which almost aggressively defies any good idea. As an action movie, this is routine and through the numbers B-movie stuff and it's done competently, that's the only positive thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4 (Poor)
