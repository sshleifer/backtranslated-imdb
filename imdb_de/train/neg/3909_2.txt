When I found out that there was a movie in which my favorite actresses were Meryl Streep and Wynona Ryder, I went through the roof! But I had a hard crash after seeing this lame movie, and I still have the bruise of Jeremy Iron (an actor whom I still admire after this disappointment) was just terrible. He treated his family like crap, especially his sister, played by Glenn Close. I could not relate or sympathize with any of the characters, and I'm not proud, but the sex scenes were really unnecessary, or they could have been toned down. The characters of Wynona and Antonio could have been much more developed and their romance could have been much more passionate. And what about Meryl's character and her "mystical powers"? Why did not you answer that? This movie had many dead ends and the end result is that this is a really lousy movie and there was a lot of talent here.
