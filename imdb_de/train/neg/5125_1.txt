As a youth pastor I have heard good about this film. Then I saw it. Acting was not the best. That's forgivable. The message is not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you'll fight better, make amazing catches, stop fumbling, make touchdown passes and even play the playoffs. All this because Jesus magically makes terrible, too small weaklings all-American athletes. I laughed out loud when a trainer quoted from the scriptures to explain to the kicker why he missed the field goals. But wait, that's not all. You get a brand new truck, a survey of $ 6,000, and you and your wife suddenly struggle with infertility in pregnancy - twice. THEN, you will win the state championship because God helps a weakling to push the winning field goal 12 yards further than he has ever kicked - and into the wind, not less - all because "God wanted him to do it". Then you win the national championship again next year. None of this good stuff would have happened if the team had not decided to follow Jesus. <br /> <br /> What I've learned from the movie is that God can do whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to - and it's about making our lives better, easier and more enjoyable. He selects his favorite team and helps them to win games. On which Bible is this story based? I bet St. Stephen wished he had known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned. Someone should have made this film before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for Jesus. It would have spared them all trouble.
