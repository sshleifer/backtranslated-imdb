Did they spend their entire budget on the porn stars or what?!? <br /> <br /> Sound effects, background music and editing in general were so bad that you believe a 12-year-old Wanna-be made the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was good considering the script ... The "innocent maiden" played her role really well. <br /> <br /> The mutants look really cool and that actually It could have been a really cool movie, with the right brain behind the wheel ... but unfortunately that was not the case for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Turn Left was better than this movie and the boys did not make it. I have no money !!! Good thing I did not rent the movie myself!
