The humor in Who's Your Daddy is so bad that I actually closed my eyes in certain scenes. Close ups of sperm are not funny! Nobody thinks they are. People get nervous when they see something so rough and to hide their nervousness, they laugh. Seeing who your daddy is gave me a disgusting nervous feeling.
