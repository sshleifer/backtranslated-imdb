The movie is pretty funny and includes about four dates. Then he becomes a blatant commercial for a guy you (and even his "friends") really can not stand. It's a pretty interesting concept. Film dates in search of true love in modern LA. The problem is that sometimes it feels unbelievable (and bad) as a script and obviously self-promoting. It is difficult to care for the characters and get involved in them because the author / actor is so selfish, uncooled, untrue and just unlikely. In the end, you are sorry for his data.
