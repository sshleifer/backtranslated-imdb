This is a strange movie that was hacked together. One has the feeling that the bond company had to come to it. I am not surprised that there is no credit that would be associated with this film. The actions of all those involved are staggered and the plot jumps everywhere, everything makes little sense. As I said, it looks like the bond company has to come in, because it does not look like much material was needed, and the music was very bad in library music (cheap, I think). Very, very strange. I could even buy a DVD of it, if I could know what the hell is going on and what happened to this movie.
