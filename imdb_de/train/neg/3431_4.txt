This is not as funny and bloody as the DVD box claims. I really love twisted and funny movies, but this one is just boring! It's an hour of torn penises, flying baby born dolls and lots of rape! I think with this amateur sleaze I wanted to make a movie that is so bad, but it fails. It's just bad! A few scenes are alright, but overall it's a mess. If you like amateur splashes like these (only much better), I would recommend Andreas Schnass' Violent Shit 2 and 3.
