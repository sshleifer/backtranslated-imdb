This movie is one of the most awfully bad action movies ever made. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese accent is weird enough, but add really awesome buddy-buddy action to the mix, an eccentric and exaggerated villain, a cliched love interlude, and one of the worst endings of all time. You've seen yourself as a small suicide for humans who enjoyed their lives and had never thought to kill themselves with a blowtorch until "Showdown". <br /> <br /> I do not know if it's just me, but the whole homosexual subtext is not too subtle. There are constant references to male genitalia and not to women. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other's male parts, and Brandon tells Dolphy, "If we do not make it, I want to tell you that you have the greatest success." I have seen it before. "Well, would a normal man tell this to another man, not less in an action movie, and would you like these to be your last words? <br /> <br /> Later, there is this gem: <br /> <br /> Dolph (referring to the villain): "I want to cut off certain parts of his anatomy. "Brandon:" Man, you have a fixation. "<br /> <br /> As the guy from RuthlessReviews.com said," Unfortunately, Dolph does not answer, "I have a fixation? I have a fixation?! You are The one who just chopped off my ears and nose, man. "<br /> <br /> This is relentlessly stupid stuff and great fun if you're someone who likes to receive root canals from unlicensed dentists without novocaine , It's about eye level. Great fun for the whole family!
