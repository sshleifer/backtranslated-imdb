For the first 20 minutes, every possible cliché was tricked by the plowman and director. There was the NTSB chief investigator with the tortured family life; the politically tortured NTSB board member of Ted McGinley (I can kill any TV); the tortured father of an accident victim; and the agonizing, dirty ambulance-hunting lawyer. Hollywood still has no idea of ​​the fragility of aircraft. The crashed plane was a 737 and it sat mostly on the ground like a hippo that decided to take a nap. The first third of the fuselage was intact, the rear half of the aircraft was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines. Most people should have left because of the number of people who survived the plane that was shredded in Iowa after losing its hydraulics. Most of this television plane was not even burned. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the scene in "Air Force One" where the 747 hits the water and then jumps out of centimeter thick steel. <br /> <br /> The show was so bad it was impossible to watch. Even my wife, who accepts more than me, commented on technical mistakes. What had baffled me was how this POS could ever be made. Are the producers of these things so used to stereotypes that they can not even recognize them? Someone read this script and said: Yes, I would like to spend a million dollars to really do that. I wish I was the guy's next appointment. I have the title of a wonderful bridge in New York, which I would sell cheap.
