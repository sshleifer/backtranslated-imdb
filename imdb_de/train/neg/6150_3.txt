I have seen this movie with the intention of disliking it. I certainly did not do it. It's one of those films that seems to have been made exclusively for the Oscars: music in almost every frame, almost no profanity playing in a bygone era, sepia-toned images, presumptuous titles, NO SEX, and a genius that does it all Explains what he thinks and closes in sfx / cgi so we (the stupid audience) get it. One thing that amused me is the fact that they spelled the NOBEL PRIZE WRONG! Instead, they call the Nobel Prize (named after a real person named Alfred Nobel) "the precious prize" .. Jesus! How can you make such a mistake in such a big production that is supposed to be based on a true story? What a scam! What did you and the others think about RON?
