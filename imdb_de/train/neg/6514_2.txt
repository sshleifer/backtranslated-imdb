The film tries to be a mockumentar - filmed in documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts - but fails to provide the audience with characters that can create the illusion of mockumentary. The film also claims to find real love in Los Angeles, but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first "big movie".
