Oh, it's the movie - I thought I waited too long to take the dog out ... I can not believe I saw it all. I think I was optimistic that things would get better. Terribly incoherent dialogue, pathetic action and utterly unlikely events. Just as Toby's mother hung herself in the time Col went up and back to a room with a 24-inch ceiling and no chairs, counters, or anything about her motionless suspended body she might have climbed onto to do to herself The little girl who played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie, and the first couple's puppy was just off the mark. The basic plot has potential and with a good script and director could be a serious scary movie, but unfortunately this version is not. I'm more scared when I open my electricity bill every month.
