I had high expectations of this indie after reading the many thumbs up. Then .... <br /> <br /> Here are my additional 'two cents' for the already published, excellent 'lost in translation' review. Premise: Morgan is sitting in a dusty little town where he meets the cute Scarlet who works at the local supermarket. Can Morgan help lift the beautiful Scarlet out of trailer trash life? <br /> <br /> Realistic dialogue? NOT. How about shopping in Target? Freeman first looks at the target inside, as if he had entered Harrods. He is then fetched around a T-shirt rack to confirm that he has NEVER been to a store where the beautiful Scarlet is. Morgan is detached from all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is depicted as happy in his ignorance of everything and everything in Scarlet's life. <br /> <br /> One critic enjoyed the Scarlet and Ex-Hubby fighting scene in which she survived. A car in this case requires that it physically attacks its ex-Hubbie. Run Freeman in her defense ... well ... he is incredulous and huddled, unable to cope with such a blunt aspect of her very real, sad lot in life. <br /> <br /> Freeman's character believes that a car wash and a new, very revealing, tight-fitting blouse is the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless "stage talk", in which all aspects of Scarlet's reality were reduced to one or the other step-related Freeman experience, was irritating. Freeman is right to stress that Scarlet is still young and has her future ahead of her. Then he conveniently ignores the brick walls facing her: uneducated, no collar skills or experience, VERY HEAVY, no family support, and low self-esteem for life. Scarlet learns lessons from Freeman in life: Some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt, and a revealing blouse can open doors instead of lacking education and staff skills. In the end, Freeman Scarlet offers little more than a strange distraction with a "star" who has not even paid for gasoline to return Scarlet's night's sleep to his unaltered life in a city Freeman does not want to know the name of.
