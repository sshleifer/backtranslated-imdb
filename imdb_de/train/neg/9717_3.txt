A pretty obvious thriller on numbers, where the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding place for nothing. I mainly looked at the English performance of Isabelle Huppert. It was not great, but then it was a strange role. It would not surprise me if it turned out that half of her contribution, along with some final scripting, remained on the floor of the workroom. Steve Guttenburg looks like he's trying to refine his role with the charm that everyone says he has. There is a sensationally stupid sequence in which it is suggested that his sexual ability can help treat PTSD. It is an uninteresting achievement. Elizabeth McGovern is more of a draw with real charm and character, but it's a small consolation. 3.10
