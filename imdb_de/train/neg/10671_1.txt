MST 3000 should make this movie. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. First of all, the shooter has not had a bank account or a history since leaving the army in 1993 and is paying his rent in cash. There is no way in hell that such a person should ever be so close to a president as not to speak of a high-profile job. Nor would the head of security of the POTHUS be so emotional that he would start to sweat in the fog if the president were shot. This movie is shit. I can not say how extreme this movie was. Every single actor was terrible. Even the chick at the caravan. I shit on this garbage. What a waste of time.
