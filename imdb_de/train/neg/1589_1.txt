It is hard to believe that a script as a clich√© and completely absurd can make any screen even small. The dialogue in this film makes Catwoman look like a classic of high culture. Billy Zane plays the harmonica that mimics Elvis, scratching, and is a martial arts master who strikes the life of a former footballer who becomes a gambling addict played by the winner of NBC's Craptastic show Next Action Star. His performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way. The "movie" takes place in Vegas, and with people playing poker there, the writers felt it was the perfect location for a movie about a man who wants to survive 24 hours against a ubiquitous, wealthy player who is his target $ 2.4 million has been offered if he can make it through the day. And so follows the hunt. A hunt that smells of nondescript explosions, yard settings, inferior cinematography and single lines with the word "bet" or "gambling". The female winner is also thrown into the mix, but for whatever reason, I have no idea. Oh, but do not worry "NAS" fans, the losers also make their unforgettable cameos. The surprise ends when you love predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should re-evaluate his decision to sell even more. I wish he could give me back those two hours of my life.
