This program bothers me! There is no humor and is too serious to be called "fun"! It's just too educational for my taste! The characters are very stereotyped and unsightly. The actions are superfluous and the moral repeats itself over and over again. Where is the fun? I also think that was too long for the BBC and too much is being broadcast. Does it really have to have a TV slot every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show has no more episodes? I think it's time for the BBC to bring back some of their older shows, such as: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Raccoons and Count Duckula. I thought the BBC brought Danger Mouse, what's the matter ?! 3.10
