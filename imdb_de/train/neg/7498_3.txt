Spike Lee has been in decline since his early successes, and this mess is no help. I often looked at my watch and hoped the movie would end or get down to business. Lee's first full-white movie is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What is it about? That Italians swear and like funky sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I would go to a Scorsese movie. The incredibly lame godfather figure contributes only to the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I admired some of Lee's films, especially Do the Right Thing. This movie is a waste of time.
