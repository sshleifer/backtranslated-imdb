Ritchie's first two films were snappy, stylish entertainment. Here he attacks two current classics? "The usual suspects" and "Fight Club"? and still comes out empty-handed. <br /> <br /> Even though he himself has been a mystery (with the controversy of "Usual Suspects" "the biggest dizziness he ever pulled out, it convinced you that he was you" or whatever it was was ...) and the attempt of a 'fight-club', which characters are real and which inner manifestations, the film tries to maintain interest in its second half. In the last third, you know that you are being led through a dead end, and that is slow. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages, chess and game theory are all big issues, but Ritchie gets too superficial and too deep in them to make much of the material. <br /> <br /> The only thing the movie can (almost) see is Ritchie's bold way with a scene and Maurice-Jones' dynamic camera. If Ritchie stuck to a satisfying act and was subjected to stricter editing, there is no reason why he could not have made another beautiful gangster caper. <br /> <br /> Revolver is a waste of time. Incomprehensibility is not the same. If you want to see a great movie that does not make sense, but makes a virtue out of it (and also includes an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement), check out 'Lost Highway'.
