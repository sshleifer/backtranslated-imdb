Charles Band has been responsible for hundreds of science fiction, fantasy and horror films since the 1970s. Some of them are wonderful examples of how to make the most of a small budget. many of them are pretty bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare gems. <br /> <br /> As a Terminator story of time travel and action, Trancer's Tim Thomerson, who played Jack Deth, saw a future policeman tasked with tracking down bad guys Whistler, who travels the past by taking the body of one Ancestor inhabited. Whistler is able to control other people with his psychic powers, transform them into obedient zombies (the "teasers" of the title), and seeks to change the course of history by killing the ancestors of the future leaders. Jack follows him until 1985, determined to stop him. In this sequel from 1991, Jack still lives in 1985. After he destroyed Whistler, he settled down and married the young woman Leena (Helen Hunt) who helped him succeed in the first film. But for Jack, things do not stay calm for long, and in the form of Whistler's brother E. D. Wardo, who is trying to build a troop army. <br /> <br /> Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a big disappointment, considering how good the original was. The story is hard to understand if you have not seen the first movie (or at least not for a long time), and there are a lot of nondescript action and some bad special effects. Way is the ingenuity and the joke that made Trancers so much fun; Instead, we get some cheesy one-liners and a script that feels like it was written on-the-fly. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can recommend this movie to fans of the genre is the cast. There are many names known to supporters of science fiction and horror movies: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to have a "day off" while shooting Trancers II, and the performances are mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The Trancers series obviously has its fans. Four more sequels have come out now. If quality has not taken off, I can not imagine that they are good.
