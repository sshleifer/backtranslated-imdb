Spoiler ... if this is possible .... , , , , , As a rabid Robin Williams fanatic, I felt it necessary to buy this movie as my first appearance on the screen. Wow ... I could not imagine a wackier movie. Basically, the movie takes one bad joke at a time that your uncle Artie would tell you after dinner and dramatizes it. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30-second sketch. <br /> <br /> I'm all for moody humor, but that humor was not pleasant vulgar or shabby ... it was just stunning. There are no redeeming qualities for this film, apart from Robin Williams fanatics like me, who just have to own every bit of film.
