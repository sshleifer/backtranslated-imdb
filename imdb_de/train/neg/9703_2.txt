For those who are too young to know, or for those who have forgotten, the Disney company almost came to a halt in the late '80s. People no longer saw their films and the company did not produce the usual healthy material ... at least not what people expected. One main problem: obscenity. <br /> <br /> Yeah, the idiots who ran the Disney movies this decade produced films with dirty words - including the name of the Lord, if you can believe that, if you can believe that - in those " Family "interspersed movies. "In fact, this happens twice in the first 20 minutes! <br /> <br /> This film has an unpleasant sound in addition to the language problems, which made it almost unlikely from the beginning." Fortunately, Disney has woken up and has since decadent movies of the 80s produced a lot of great material. ("Touchstone" is Disney, just under a different name.)
