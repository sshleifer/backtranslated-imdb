Like most people, I love "A Christmas Story." I had never heard of this movie and maybe for a good reason - it's awful. Same scene, same speaker, same director, but the warm blur of the original was missing. Charles Grodin was a bad choice to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can not imagine anyone replacing him. The story seems enforced and lacks the sweetness of the original. The interaction with the neighbors, the bumps, is ridiculous. In "A Christmas Story," Ralphie's obsession with the BB gun seems cute, but his obsession with the movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the original neighborhood tyrant, is replaced in this movie by another kid with braces and a weird hat, but little of Scud Farkus's looks. It would be quite difficult to reach the original, even if this movie had been shot with the original crew.
