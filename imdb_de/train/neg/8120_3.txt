At least among the films with 100 or more votes. Nominated for the best script written directly for the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role? Nominated for the best picture? I always agree with many of the Oscar favorites, but this movie could be the worst movie of all time, honored by the Academy. Writing and acting were both terrible. In particular, Blethyn's performance was one of the worst I've ever seen, and probably the overrated acting performance of all time. Terrible movie that is not worthy of the big screen and worthy of any cable or TV station that has ever played it, including HBO (where I've seen it). I'm just thankful that I did not pay to see one of the most rated films of all time.
