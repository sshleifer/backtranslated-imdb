Kurosawa really missed it in this matter. Every genius may fail. The concept is good, but the design is heavily blurred. <br /> <br /> It's a touch of fantasy about this movie that makes it an art movie. Poverty in Tokyo deserves a fairer and more realistic portrayal. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. A very disappointing movie.
