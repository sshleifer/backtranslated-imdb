This is one of the cruelest paraphrases I have ever seen. If you want to make a movie with a lousy story, you should deny it the title of a beautiful book. There's hardly any connection between Wolfe's book and this movie, other than the title. I do not mind if the pictures move on the screen. At least the changes should not hurt the end product. The last scene in the film is painfully unconvincing. The actors are wrong. The director and / or the scriptwriter obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon. <br /> <br /> If you have seen this movie and did not like it, try the book out. If you have seen and liked this movie, read the book.
