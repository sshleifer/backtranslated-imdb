After watching the movie, the first question in my head was: should it be ironic or not? After reading some comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic book series, I knew that this movie should not be ironic. So the story tells the story of a US American super-doc who saved a South American republic from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But this comes so unrealistic that it becomes ridiculous. The compulsory final battle shows the worst display of martial arts I've ever seen. The film may be interesting as a bad example for low-budget movie designers.
