There is a bit of spoiler that could ruin the surprise of the ONE's unexpected and really funny scene in this movie. There is also information about the first movie in this series. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie on DVD someone gave to my roommate. It came as a set along with the first movie in the "Blind Dead" series. <br /> <br /> This movie was certainly much worse than the first "La Noche del Terror Ciego". In addition, many features of the first movie have changed significantly. In addition, the film was dubbed in English (the first was subtitled), which I find distracting. <br /> <br /> The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Knights Templar was involved in vile and secret rituals. In discovering these crimes, the local peasantry killed the Templars in such a way that their eyes can no longer be used, preventing them from returning from hell to avenge themselves. We then jump into the modern day, when the Templars are resurrected from the dead due to an event, to take revenge on the villagers whose ancestors have disturbed them. Since the undead knights have no eyes, of course, they can only find their victims if they make noises. <br /> <br /> The Templars were a secret order dating back to the 12th century. Crusades They were only around 150 years old before being suppressed by the Pope and others in the early 13th century. Since they were silent, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, especially for the initiation. Because of the way society was organized, there were not necessarily church officials overseeing things, which meant they had no inner man when things got hot. Because of the nature of their lawsuits, they were tortured to confessions. Order was strongest in France, but it existed in Portugal and Spain, where the films take place. <br /> <br /> Where the first movie had a virgin offering and knights drank the blood straight out of the virgin's body (breasts of course here, after all, that's a horror movie after all), and as soon as the knights are brought back to life, they will attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood; Everything disappears in this episode. They still have the same scene (re-made, not the same footage) in which they sacrifice the virgin, but they let the blood run into a bowl and drink it. When they come back, they just hack people with their swords or scratch them to death, which, I have to say, is a much less effective way to disturb your audience. There is also a time problem: In the first film, the dating is much closer to the Templars, where they now say it is the 500th anniversary of the peasants burning these guys in the stake that the Templars lose their eyes, is also less interesting , In the first case they are picked by crows. Now they are just burned out and in a ridiculous way. Oh yes, and maybe it was just me, but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie in this movie (though dead). Not really a problem as the movie is totally different and not a sequel in the sense of a sequel, but strangely no less. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie is the rich guy who has a kid to distract the undead while he pauses for the jeep. The child's father had already been advised by this rich man to get the Jeep, so he goes out and asks her to find her father. It comes out of the blue and is by far the funniest scene in the movie. Why the child does not die at this point is of course far from me and is disappointed for horror fans. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone. It's not so bad that it's funny, and it's going to be a mediocre horror movie. The bulk of the film has captured several people in a church, each of whom makes various attempts to walk alone to escape the blind dead that surrounded them. When the movie ends, you are not at all surprised at the result. indeed quite disappointed. If you want to see the novelty of a Spanish horror movie, read the first movie that has at least some innovative ideas and less-than-expected results.
