This movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time. I generally like the cheap horror monster movies, but this movie was a disappointment. The main flaw is the lack of explanation of the creatures. When they entered the house and found the man, he could explain it to him. He does not really say anything about them except that they killed his parents, and if I missed something he would not say how he managed to escape. Only survivors will essentially stay and feed the creatures for their own near-death experience. It would have seemed that after the "cross-incident" she had the opportunity to leave.
