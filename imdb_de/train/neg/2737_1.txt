There are no spoilers in this review. There is nothing to ruin. <br /> <br /> No conspiracy, nothing; Most clip shows at least try to put the clips into the plot with a thin stretch, but that did not even do that. Clips, three lines, to lead into the next endless series of boring clips ... OK, maybe they had little production time, but they could have skipped this episode better. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how that was done. Scrubs is usually much better at infiltrating the tropics, but somehow that came through ... Thank you, Heavens, they were back in shape in the next episode.
