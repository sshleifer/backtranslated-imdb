I like quality crapness, and that's among the best. The CG is out of this world, or at least goes beyond our world, and the insanity of a two-meter-long guy in a rat outfit chasing people is ridiculously bad. I enjoyed some of that, but acting is so goddamn awful, and even the obligatory nude scene does not really enjoy it. Just a complete waste of time if I had ever seen one. I do not know who wasted more time, I looked at it or the poor, who were forced to create the faint hope that this will usher in their acting career. I can assure you, it will not be like this. On the other hand, I have successfully completed the six degrees of Kevin Bacon from this film. I think it was almost worth watching the 91 minutes of the movie.
