1. watched 27.05.2009 - 4 von 10 (Dir - Harold Young): The 3rd Universal Mummy Film is roughly the same as the first two, as far as the end result is concerned from the viewer's point of view. The story is similar and the results are louder. This time the US is in history as the new supporter of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our land in the hope that he can revive him to kill the descendants of those who opened the original tomb. This time, the mummy is played by Lon Chaney (which does not make a big difference, because he really is not asked if he is acting a lot for this character). The new priest becomes a morgue in the city and sends the mummy to his dirty deeds after giving him the tanna leaf juice. Again, a girl gets in the way when the priest falls in love with a descendant's fianc√©e and wants her to be - immortal with him (have not we heard that already?). The plan is thwarted, of course, as the citizens chase the mummy with torches (similar to the Frankenstein monster) and the creature's burning ends the story ... how do they get a sequel? I think you will find out with the next in the series? or not.....
