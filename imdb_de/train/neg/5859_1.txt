Turkish cinema has a big problem. Directors are not interested in global cinema. They are indigenous and folkloristic, but they want to be international. That brings kitsch results like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has translated jokes from Turkish into Spanish and they have no meaning for the non-Turkish audience. Even for the Turkish audience after 10 years. <br/> <br /> Players even have Ferhan SENSOY a worse spectacle than the average. They look like dolls. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Cuba, but nothing contains Cuba. Cuba is considered as a banana republic. <br /> <br /> A waste of money, a waste of time.
