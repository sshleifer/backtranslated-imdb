By far the most important prerequisite for any movie that relies on cartoons is that it has to be able to persuade us at least once, as well as the stupid tracks, the cops, the mob, and (ideally) each other. But this movie NEVER takes off. Every scam can be seen a mile away (especially the big ones!). They are also not very interesting, complicated or demanding. Perhaps Mammet hoped to compensate for this with nimble dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, he failed. The lines are fine, but they are delivered in such a stilted, unnatural, stylized way that I thought that maybe a smart point is that we all act all the time ... but that was not it. As for the psychological complexity, the main character is a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced Freudians that their father considers her a whore, but she gets over it. I really liked the street scenes. Looked like an Edward Hopper painting.
