The first (and only) time I saw "Shades" was during a sneakpreview. It had not even been in Premiere. I remember there was someone from the directors, not even who. It was a Belgian movie, we never heard of it, so we were pretty neutral and did not know what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and is ahead of everyone else. He plays an actor whose star has long stopped rising. He helps to realize a film in Belgium entitled "Shades". <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie started, we noticed how much cursing there is. Nothing against the occasional swear word. This was far more than annoying. Whenever Rourke uses the word F *** to express something, it comes naturally. However, if someone from the cast, a non-English speaker, uses the word F **** or S ***, it becomes arrogant and aggressively used the F and S words. Everyone was happy to be out of the theater. And we had to vote, but it was hard for us because it was only between 0 and 10 and we were looking for the -10.
