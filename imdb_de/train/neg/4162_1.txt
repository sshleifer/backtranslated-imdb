If you really enjoyed the 2002 Resident Evil movie, you should just see it instead of waiting for two hours, and you will never return. I can not believe that no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap departure from RE. First, a "special" commander is the unique defense of a device with a computer matrix that has an AI and a holographic projection. And this "hive" rip-off has a series of traps that inevitably kill a member of the squad at the same time. There is even a chess reference in the code name that was included in the dialogue of RE. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, the film's "Rook," the nemesis, is a kind of bi-creature that's very angular in color, suggesting necrotic tissue, with many cyborg components like a super mutant from RE. So, a joker to Mr. Richard Taylor, because he used some credits for this story. <br /> <br /> They are obviously not the same movie, but the author had the idea to see Resident Evil, I think.
