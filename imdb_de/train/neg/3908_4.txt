There's enough star power to create another galaxy in THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS, and yet the end product is quite controversial. The movie and its messages are very noble and I think most would agree. (Liberal Democracy good, violent fascist regime bad, open-mindedness good, racism bad etc.). Unfortunately, we are smashed from head to toe with it, and it takes as much subtlety as I've described. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, we observe very noble people, without any mistakes with evil cretins who have no redeeming qualities. It radiates with the excitement of a poorly orchestrated "pro" wrestling match. Jeremy Irons plays the Patron, a man with many contradictions. Meryl Streep as a gifted bride and Glenn Close as a sister-in-law. If the camera stays with these people, the movie tends to move and is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS simply picks up too many subplots, and characters emerge from the picture like shooting gallery goals. We do not get to know her, so we do not care about her. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If Bille August, the director and scriptwriter (from the book of Isabel Allende) either extended the movie or cut some characters, this movie might have worked out completely. As it stands, it was a nice try, with nice news and a bang-hard Yawnfest. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
