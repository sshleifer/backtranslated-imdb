Theoretically, "Commentary by the Director" should have worked. The talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former television director who talks about his experiences behind the camera. Some of the programs he has allegedly worked on include Bonanza, Flambards, The Duchess Of Duke Street, and The Bounder. His comments are not least revealing, as he is used to leaving the spot. <br /> <br /> In practice, however, this has failed terribly. It's a one-joke show, and the joke is not funny. The scripts lack the joke, and Bryden can not convince as an old man. Whenever it's amusing to say what's going on every five seconds, he laughs hissing. Instead of enjoying DeLane, you want to shoot him. If senile old men find you funny, then this is the thing for you. <br /> <br /> It did not help that the ridiculed shows, except for Mr. & Mrs. and Crossroads, were rather good. For the joke to work, they really had to be awful, like Charlie's Angels, OTT, Telly Addicts, Neighbors and New Faces. The show was big time so fortunately we are spared the horror of future issues. Would not it be deliciously ironic if "Director's Commentary" were themselves the subject of a parody?
