I love Henry James books and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to launch a new movie based on the title of this title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an extraordinary actress and Ben Chaplin good enough to play the lead roles. Albert Finney is miscast and does not play the role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith ... or rather her stupid, dull role. The real problem and what's missing in this latest release is a good script, good music and a good direction. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep in the theater and saw this long, boring and exceptionally boring movie. The dialog contains more pauses than a pinter-play. In the book, I felt a deep concern for Catherine Sloper and her life. The movie had exactly the opposite effect. I do not like it when her aunt has a sexual attraction to Morris. Eeeeeeeek YUK. <br /> <br /> If you can not sleep, it's definitely a Snoozer. Do not look at you when you are depressed. After that you need Zoloft. Sure, "The Heiress" was exceptional, Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the title roles. The actor who played her father was a rash, cold father on the ground ... still sad for his dead wife and hating Catherine for it. The film was not faithful to the book, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This movie was a cinematic. I have no doubt why.
