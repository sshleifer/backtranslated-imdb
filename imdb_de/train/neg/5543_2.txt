Seriously, I absolutely adore these old movies and their simplicity, but last time I looked at them for the first time and it easily fitted into my five best films of all time. Was it about the love story or the zombies? This movie was so bad that when it ended graciously I could only laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was. Luckily I'm too anal to turn off a movie without seeing the whole thing, otherwise I could not boast that I would watch all this in one session! I like to think that something positive about anything in life can be said. According to this theory, I will recognize the positive effect of this film. It was very short for a full length movie.
