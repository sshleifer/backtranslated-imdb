The actual material at the beginning of the film has disturbed me so much that my stomach was sick and I finally turned off the movie. How can anyone surprise this movie more than a rating of 1? I know that the intention of the film is to shock, but it shows the actual footage of a dog that was skinned alive (holding back vomiting while I write) - PLEASE! I turned it off after the scene with the crumbling baby. I had covered my eyes most of the time by that time. No wonder this movie was found in HMV on Bargain Square. I really do not want to see another movie of this Uwe person. Who has enjoyed this, needs a therapy. Period.
