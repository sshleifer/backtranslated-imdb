I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial doubt. The first few moments, with a naked woman and a painter, Diana, who just wanted to paint her and then sucked her blood to drain it so that she can use it for her art, give the impression that this might be a kick. be an ass artist. Vampire stripes. It turns out that this first impression is wrong. Oh, Troma, a sign of a certain lack of quality: Sometimes they offer something that is garbage but is funny and at least has some experience with the junk food craft (or sometimes not). This is a case in which it is not even much fun to watch as his attempts at humor (ie, the father of the protagonist is an old Vaud citizen who makes the impressions of Jimmy Durante?) Are at best weak, and any unintentional laughter is undercut by Sergio Lapel bargain cellar direction. <br /> <br /> And it's not without him, oh Lord, no. He tries a lot, which is a big part of the problem. Although he and his producers had money for light, but as used in the film, I, a former student filmmaker and aspiring director, pouted in my seat: If I saw this in a theater, I would have to be blinded in many eyes Cases and would wonder if his DP has really understood the basic 3-point lighting. While this should be nothing along with a very dull sound design (or just a lot of random loud buzzing as in the art gallery scene) that stands out during a Troma release, it should be something * basic * that a filmmaker can be too if the script is (and is not) very funny or scary, or if Lapel makes a weird mix of songs to bizarre moments. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie If you're a hardened vampire (or just a vampire period), this could be a low-cost alternative to Near Dark, or a slight improvement over the 1972 Blood Freak. Overall, you have better options to lose your time.
