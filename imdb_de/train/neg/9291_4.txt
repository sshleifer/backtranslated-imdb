I can not believe that NOT the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two pretty exciting scenes of sexual assault. It's as if our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not seem to condemn these abuses - like in, the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressurized never holds the men responsible for their actions and no one else. A man can not stop the attack if someone throws a dagger at him, but he only gets "You can not force a woman to love you" and not "You should never sexually force a woman to wank you." Woman, the film is disappointed. It's a sort of "bone" for women to make them both capable fighters and leaders, but the movie is much more defined by romance - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality is an imbalance of power Men Must Master The Woman They Love This amazing martial artist does not use her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers. She does not even apologize - she seems to apologize. All in all a depressing and disturbing movie with some great cinematography and some cool fighting scenes, but not nearly as good as Hero.
