As a native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst movies with native content I've ever seen. I'd rather get a root canal than watch this movie again. The use of stereotypes, uncreative attempts to use parts of traditional coyote stories, and bad camera work were compounded only by the uncreative story and the bad script. The author and director have shown the worst parts of a colonized approach to depicting Aborigines and communities. If this person is Native, she must go home and apologize to all who know her as an apple and to the internalized racism and bad humor they have developed. If this person is not native, she must seriously consider her white privilege and wonder if she shows unchecked, unintentional racism or if they are deliberately ignorant. My only hope is that the local actors had a good time in this movie and at least got paid for their efforts. If you want to see some good local movies, check it out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance Me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals ... just to name a few.
