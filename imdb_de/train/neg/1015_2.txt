Poor ... worse than a bad TV movie. I can not believe Spacey and Freeman were in this movie. For some reason, Morgan Freeman's character constantly talks about "pussy" when referring to the girlfriend of the NSync boy. Morgan Freeman calls women "pussy" and is just awkward ... What the hell did the people think about this movie? Too many storylines you can imagine, combined with the terrible drama, confusing camera angles, a lame script and cheap background music, made this movie absolutely unbearable. ..well ... it was really shitty.
