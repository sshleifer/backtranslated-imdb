A few weeks ago I read the classic by George Orwell, 1984. I was intrigued by it and thought that it was one of the best books I've read recently. When I borrowed the DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adaptation could be measured. Unfortunately, the movie did not come close to creating the ambience or developing the characters that Orwell so masterfully made in his book. The director seems to believe that anyone who watches the movie has read the book because he does not try WHY the characters act and feel the way they do. John Hurt, the lead actor, has burned all the way and barely works until the end. We never really get to know what he's doing professionally, why his love relationship is banned or what the political climate is and why the main character wants rebellion. This book can not be justified in film form without proper narrative and explanation of the political system that suppresses the characters, and the fact that they are missing is the main drawback of this film. Besides, John Hurt was a horrible casting choice. He looked fifteen years older than the 39-year-old Winston he was supposed to portray. More positively, however, that the rest of the cast was well chosen. It's just too bad that they were put in such a terribly adapted film with a false lead actor. -Brian O.
