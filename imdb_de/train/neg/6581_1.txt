I rented "New Best Friend" and hoped for a movie that resembled inspiring teen thrillers like "Gossip" and "The Curve". Instead, "New Best Friend" is much more like "The In Crowd", where there is no thrill and the spectacle is incredibly spurious. "New Best Friend" is boring and the events during the movie are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
