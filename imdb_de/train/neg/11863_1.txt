I thought this movie was a letdown that I expected to be so much better than it was. I am so glad that I did not pay to see this movie and that I did not sit in a cinema for this movie. Where to start with this film, the acting in this film was average, the humor was terrible and only the overall story of this movie was not special. I thought this movie might be great, but it was just a waste of wasting time. I think the drama in this movie was terrible, none of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just was not there. I think if we might have played an actor other than Kirk than Jay Baruchel, it might have been better, but the whole time I saw this movie, he looked tall and did not feel like he was in that Movie did not act. Well, Alice Eve did a great job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All actors in this film were not names and had very little influence in this film. The humor in this movie was not funny at all, there were a few one-liners in this movie that were alright, but it's not worth telling your friends that they would understand them. I think Jim Field Smith had a hard time because he could not decide whether he wanted a romance or a comedy. Frankly, I think he has to stick to Burger King commercials. I think this movie could have been better if the authors had gone to another director. The story of this movie is just like any other hot girl, just OK guy love story? Boring I think it would have been better if it had more originality, but what a hell of a fall. I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie. I think you have more entertainment with the dentist than in this movie. Save yourself the agony and just do not see it.
