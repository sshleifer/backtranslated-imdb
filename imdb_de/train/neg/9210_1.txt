I had completely forgotten this movie until now. This was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonize a hobby I've ever seen. The message seemed to be, "Do not use fantasies of teenagers, they can take games seriously, go crazy and hurt people." I can only guess that the unimaginative authors of this piece believed that D & D games were a form of evil ritual or mysterious worship.
