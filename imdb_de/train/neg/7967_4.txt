Although I'm not a big admirer of the original creep show, its trashy sequel makes this anthology look like perfection! And to think I would go into that expectation to like this more. Five years after his predecessor, George Romero returns to the EC comic trail, triggering the script for Steve Kings three stories in the incident. However, the direction will be handed over to Michael Gornick. The movie will most likely falter with uneven brushes by Gornick. But most of the blame Romero would have to be terribly static and unbearably cringe-like (especially in the dialogues that flow through the first and last story). Moralist messages (mostly from sour characters) simply took on the black humor. Oh, it was painful and the same can be said about the vivid, spoiled music score that accompanies the picture. Combining the three tales (Old Chief Woodenhead, The Raft, and The Hitchhiker) is a slightly curious and effective storyline, done in nostalgic (80s) animation form. I preferred this segment and the fleeting creep character was a glowing light. <br /> <br /> # The first story "Old Chief Woodenhead" depicts two older owners (George Kennedy & Dorothy Lamour) of a department store in a dying hometown, Dead River. Get robbed and eventually killed by a few punks who want to live in Hollywood. In front of the shop stands a wooden statue of an Indian chief who avenges her death. <br /> <br /> - Listen to George Kennedy's waffle. And take 10 minutes to say how committed he is to his "big" community. What a nice and delicate time. Well, just like Kennedy's speeches, this is a monotonously colorless and overdrawn object that never fulfills a good premise. The presumptuous script is simple and the performances are appropriate. These two factors really contributed to my headache. When the Indian comes alive and becomes an avenger, the idiots are properly exposed to a very quick (but cruel) death. The effects have been commended, but what about the free-flowing hair? How could Hollywood beat back this strand of hair? Pooh! <br /> <br /> # Second story "The Raft" follows a group of intoxicants and Yahoo teenagers heading for a remote lake. After swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake, they get stuck on the platform due to an ominous-looking creature lurking in the water. <br /> <br /> -This is much better, MUCH better. What starts as your elementary teenagers walk around turns into a mysteriously scary setup that's full of tense and claustrophobic suspense. And it does not even happen when nudity or spiteful spatters pop up. It's pretty morbid and that goes for his humor as well. The surprisingly ironic ending has a nice touch. The appearances of the Nobodies are acceptable without leaving much marks. Gornick's direction sticks to the evil and rather sticky side. While the alarming music on this occasion squeezed the right chords. The muddy creature in the lake (as many have already mentioned) looks like a black black tarpaulin (yeah, you read that right!) That floats on the water. <br /> <br /> # Finally, number three ends with "The Hitchhiker". A rich but sexually missing woman is on her way home after being with her male gigolo, but she's late. She thought about some ideas she should explain for her delay, when she is needed, she slips off the road and accidentally hits a hitchhiker. Instead of checking or getting help, she hopes to get home in front of her husband. Soon she is terrified by the mutilated corpse of the dead hitchhiker. <br /> <br /> - Not terrible, but I really did not engage in this ridiculously ridiculous exercise. Compared to the first two, this sound was so different and instead tried to tickle the funny bone. Lois Chiles was fine in the lead role, but that constant assurance and the small talk she had with herself became pathetic and tiring. The lively make-up effects are clearly visible and tarnish in front of view. When she meets the hitchhiker, it becomes hectic, cheesy and exaggerated in execution. From then on, we endlessly hear our supposedly hitchhiker repeat and repeat? and repeat the line "Thanks for the rider!" This happens every time she decides to run over him. Have a little courtesy for the dead treasure. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's the second short story, "The Raft," and the unpleasant, well thought-out effects that make up this extremely inferior sequel.
