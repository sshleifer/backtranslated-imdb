I do not think anyone watching this movie expects anything that seems remotely like a classic ghost story, but you have to wonder when it's over, when you're ever scared. That does not really work on this level, but the cast is hard and the movie does not attack one of those lucky endings. The story is about an American couple traveling to Kyoto, Japan, so Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) can write a book and he brings along his wife Laura (Susan George) and daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Her friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure), who works at the American Consulate, helps them find a home to live in, and finds a home that is being persecuted. About 140 years ago, a samurai found in the same house that his wife cheated on him, killing them and committing suicide. Their spirits are still living in the house and when the Fletchers arrive, it does not take long for strange things to happen. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Sometimes the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the Fletchers and they behave like the Japanese they were before, and Laura flirts with Alex, which leads to an affair. Meanwhile, Ted behaves harder and after he has poured Amy in the throat, he asks a monk for help. Unfortunately, the ghosts make Ted, Laura and Alex play their death scene as they did 140 years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie was filmed by Kevin Connor, who is known as a good TV director, but he has made horror and sci-fi films and has worked on some of them with McClure. While this never comes close to a frightening or evolving atmosphere, it has two things that I liked. First, there are none of those juicy ends that the couple embraces after defeating the demons. Instead, it ends in a very bloody fight in which everyone succumbs to the evil of the spirits. Second, it has Susan George in the cast! I have always been a fan of her, even though she has appeared mainly in Schlock, but her performances are always top notch. Also, she usually looks nude, which she does here in two different scenes, and although she has no classic features, she has a unique tomboy-like look and she's one of the reasons she was so popular. But after I worked in such stupid movies, I think, it made her quit or just work sporadically. This is not a bad movie, but it is never convincing to observe the spirits running around when the monk gives an exorcism that practically earns one or two giggles. The bottom line is stupid and I hope George decides to continue her career.
