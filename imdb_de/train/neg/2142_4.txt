If you are under 6 or 7 years old, you will really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter sticks to the TV when she sees him. As an adult, I can not stand it !! I'm ready for sequels ... if they have a decent story. However, this is by no means standard. Please forgive me for making a movie about children, but if you have to deal with it almost every day, if your children love it so much, you'll understand why. My daughter would watch this movie again and again the same day if we let her. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie as 4 out of 10 just because it entertains my youngest child.
