I hope whoever coached these losers with their accents was fired. The only highlight are some of the minor characters. 3 out of 5 of my favorites were killed at the end of the season (and one of them was a cat to put that in perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole story is about sex and nothing else. Sex with vampires, Gay sex with gay vampires, Gay sex with straight vampires, Sex to vampire blood, Sex after drinking vampire blood, Sex before vampires, Vampire sex, Sex without vampire, Sex, because we are afraid of vampires, Sex because we are mad at vampires, sex, because we've just become a vampire, etc. Nothing against sex, it would be nice if it was a little more subtle if you put it into the storyline. Maybe you have an action and then some sex into it. But they did not even do that ... and Anna Paquin is a dizzying gap-tongue bitch. Either she sucks or her figure is shit, I can not figure out which one. <br /> <br /> Another part of the plot that I find highly implausible is why 150-year-old vampire Bill, who seems to have his things together, is interested in someone like Sookie. She is constantly flying away from him for things he can not control. He goes for two days and she already decides that he "will not come back" and suddenly has feelings for dog man? Give me a break. She is said to be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old. People around her die everywhere and she has the brightest smile on her face because she's just given her V-card to a guy because she can not read his thoughts? As a protagonist of the story, I hoped the show would do a little more to make it understandable, and someone you could invest in your interest in, not someone you secretly hope to get killed or put into a coma. I can not find anything about her character that I like, and even the fact that she can read minds is impressively uninspiring and not in the least interesting. <br /> <br /> I will not waste my time watching season 2. Come on in June.
