This is the absolute worst performance of Robert Duval, who sounds like William Buckley throughout the movie. His hammy melodramatic drama takes away all dramatic interest. I'm not sure if it was deliberate stealing or carelessness, but it's the only thing I can remember from a truly memorable movie. This picture should be shown in every amateur acting class by an example of what not to do. Thankfully, Duvall went on to bigger and better things and no longer tried to create a cultivated accent. He is a good character actor, but that's about it. Klaus is so much better. His performance is muted and remarkable.
