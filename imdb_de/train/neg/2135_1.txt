Just garbage. I'm a big fan of the Cusacks, that's the only reason I've seen this movie, but the only reason I can see for their presence was the recapitulation in full and in lower depth, their exact roles Great Point Blanc. Besides, the role of the film as a political satire fails miserably, as if it were too obvious for even the feeble-minded to fulfill any purpose. And to charge for satirical satire would be an insult even to chimpanzees. Imitation is apparently the highest form of flattery, but seeing as if this is nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as the (see an idiot) Spartan in terms of political satire, drop it Be good enough and leave this disappearing in the darkness that absolutely deserves it.
