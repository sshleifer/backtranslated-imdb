I saw the movie on cable one night and could not believe how bad it was. I usually like bad movies, but that was so disgusting that it was not even entertaining. The highlights of this film include the absurd music that is constantly playing throughout the movie, the hideous special effects (when someone is shot with a laser gun, they turn neon green and disintegrate immediately) and disgusting acting. Acting is indeed what I feel like stealing the show. I have not recognized any of the actors in the movie and I hope I'll never have to see any of them again. Overall, I recommend renting this movie (if you can find it, I can not think of a video library that carries this junk) just so you can appreciate the quality of the movies after you've seen that junk.
