"What happens if you give a homeless $ 100,000?" As if they were asking this question, they are somehow morally released from what will eventually happen. The creators of "Reversal of Fortune" are trying to get their voyeuristic giggles while disguising their antics as a kind of responsible social experiment. <br /> <br /> They take Ted, a homeless person in Pasadena, and give him $ 100,000 to see if he turns his life around. Then, just with the most cursory guidance and advice, they let him go on his happy journey. <br /> <br /> What are you trying to say? "Money can not buy you any luck?" "Homeless are homeless because they deserve it?" Or how about "Lift a man up - it's more fun to see him fall from a height." They took a man with nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and then watched him pour everything down the drain. That should be entertainment? They dress this sow with some dark music and dramatic camera shots, but in the end she has all the moral heights of car crash videos - only this time they've constructed the car crashes and asked, "What happens when you stop, signs?"
