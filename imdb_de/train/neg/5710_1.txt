Well, on paper it looked good, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer working together again, this time on a mix of robbery film, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh dear, that's for Indiana Jones, which is Speed ​​2 for Speed. A reasonable cast (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fights against a puerile script and loses heavily. The movie is not much more than an extended advertisement for the Masons. However, these freemasons are not ordinary shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf. These Freemasons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and nobody mentions "From Hell" or Jack the Ripper.) I do not think I uncovered Plotspoiler because there are none. There is virtually no tension, no surprises and no climax - it just stops. National Treasure targets Dan Brown, but achieves the same intellectual level as an Scooby Doo episode without humor.
