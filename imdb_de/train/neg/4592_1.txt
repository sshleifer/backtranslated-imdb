This movie made me very angry. I really wanted to throttle the "scientists" and unseen filmmakers. Very, very painful to sit through. Sophomoric and in the worst way presumptuous. The little good information about brain function / chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of ​​a new age. The worst offenders were the crackpot-charlatans Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza tells us that most people live a mediocre life and clearly indicates that he lives on a higher level. Even the ideas and attitudes with which I agree in principle become so hard-hearted, awkward, superior, presumptuous, and preached that I felt the need to reject them. I think that made me so angry, the fact that they took up the really profound aspects of established scientific thinking and clouded them with their new age hokum. Much is based on the misapprehension of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro-world. Fittingly, the dramatized parts with Marlee Matlin are amateurish and clichéd. <br /> <br /> Instead, I would refer people to Bill Bryson's excellent overview of science: "A Brief History of Almost Everything." In current, established science, there are many deep wonders about life and the universe.
