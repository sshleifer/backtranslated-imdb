Faces are slashed, throats are cut, blood spurts, and in the end, the three main characters are either depressed or die. They even blow up Kevin Costner's dog with a gun. Why would anyone want to watch such a movie? Violence only applies if the good kill the bad, not the other way around. Take, for example, Underworld and Underworld Evolution, where you can see justice when the demons are killed. In this movie, the good ones are cut. See the difference? Why would someone MAKE a movie that depressed the audience? Gorgeous photography and skilful editing in a movie like this is a waste of talent. Let's put this in the category of the exquisite corpse.
