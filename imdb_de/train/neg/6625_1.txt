This is the first time I've commented on a movie on IMDb. but I had to write it for this. his 3 hours of unadulterated torture. From the beginning you have the idea that the movie will be bad. action is pitiful. I'm a big fan of Ajay Devgan (I loved him in Bhagat Singh), but he's the worst in this movie. Amitabh seems to have worked hard for it, but somehow the fear is missing. Prashant Raj is not an actor. and the most irritating part of the movie is Nisha Kothari. I have no idea why the director took her in this movie. The background score is repeated. Somehow I had the feeling that Ramu was trying to repeat a sarkar, the color design, the background score, the camera angles, but it did not work. PLEASE DO NOT NOTE IT
