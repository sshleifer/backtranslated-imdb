Since this picture is classified as "pure entertainment work" and as there are already many comments on it, I would like to comment on something relevant to the abuse of humor. We can see that Marlon Wayans plays the joker role in this movie. Certainly, as long as he was involved in the casting, he has always acted as a small man - an actor can change his usual attire, but he can barely change his appearance - and the latter can be of benefit if needed. But far from what I had expected, I saw a picture that was very disguised and pretended to uncover various aspects of baby life by mistake of a forty-year-old criminal. And with a ridiculous happy ending. What is the point? Many elements are mixed, some of the most important being violence, sex and criminal activities, under which history is poorly composed and to some extent lacking common sense: where is Vanessa, when the peace of her home is violated and her husband's life is persecuted? Besides, the diamond is even bigger than the cullinan of the world! But the worst facet is the constant attempt to invent the little man as a superman, showing his physical weaknesses. And they call it humor. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile. It can not be cut by any other material, but can only be defeated with the hot blood of a male goat. It is no longer a diamond, but debris.
