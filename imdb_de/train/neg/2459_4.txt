Obviously, I was not interested in Things to Come (aka "The Form of Things to Come"), as were most viewers. This means that there is a good chance that you will enjoy it more than me. In any case, it might be helpful to hear the film described from a different angle. <br /> <br /> Director: William Cameron Menzies, who also had experience as a production designer and above all as an art director. This is a movie adaptation by HG Wells from his eponymous novel. In my opinion, it helps to show why a great novelist does not necessarily become a good scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> The movie opens in 1940 in a London "Everytown". The war is brewing and the citizens of Everytown are worried they might reach them. It does. And it becomes a decade-long affair that basically destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies keep jumping forward and show us different scenes related to the war and its consequences. We see two pilots, one of whom is depressed and dealing with the consequences of their fight. We meet a post-apocalyptic community ruled by a possible warlord. We meet a man from an emerging futuristic society. We see how technology is changing. And finally, we are led to the full realization of this futuristic society around 2036, when leaders discuss the merits of sending people to the moon. <br /> <br /> This may sound very exciting, but it's all just not working as a movie. Structurally, the film is far too episodic, with little to connect dramatically with each other. In the third section, I completely lost interest in keeping an eye on the characters. I could barely find them in the first few segments. There are always new faces. We can not learn anything about them. <br /> <br /> It does not help that, with a few exceptions, the individual segments tend to be clumsily routed and edited. They are also occasionally manipulative - it almost feels like a propaganda film. But perhaps the segments are also a bit cold and dry. <br /> <br /> In fact, an overlong section is more of a music video / commercial video. If you see shots of the building of the futuristic city with many big machines, a lot of welding and so on. At some point, a guy who looks like an astronaut waves through a futuristic glass into the camera. The music for this section is somewhere between a militaristic and a crowded horror score. I can not say that "Things to Come" consists of dramaturgical material. <br /> <br /> But the general call to support "Things to Come" is that it's a "movie about ideas". That may be true, but if you look at it that way, there are some problems. First, it still does not work as a film, ie as a visual and sonic dramatic work of art, and secondly, too many ideas are presented here. <br /> <br /> The main idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations. That's a fine thing to shoot a movie about. It is also a notable anticipation of World War II when the things to come were written and filmed in 1935 (published in 1936). Wells has some interesting things to say about the war, some of which contradict the usual interpretation of the film. For example, the end seems to indicate that a new war is breaking out or is the will at all times. The general message seems a bit pessimistic. Wells seems to show that war is simply a part of human nature that can not be ruled out, though it does not exclude "progress." In fact, it may encourage progress, at least indirectly. <br /> <br /> That would certainly be enough for a movie. But there are many more ideas. The scene between the two pilots is one of the more moving scenes in the film. It is a complex dilemma. One pilot shot down the other but is coming to help him. The shot-down pilot carried a poisonous gas now blowing across the field. They can not both breathe the gas without harm. A girl comes along. They only have two working gas masks between them. The downed pilot offers his mask because he dies anyway. What should I do? It's not that this scene itself could stretch to length, but the ideas - the bizarre complex of helping each other and trying to hurt one another in the midst of a war - are enough to make a movie. <Br /> <br /> Another example. During the scenes with the possible warlord in the post-apocalyptic environment, there is an unpleasant contagious disease called "walking disease". It turns victims into something like drunken zombies. The usual procedure is to shoot victims in the field to ward off the disease. This material is treated as if it were a reflection. It's a great idea and deserves a movie of its own. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Wells presents the future society with controversial socialist ideas. That was enough for a movie of its own. It is simply impossible to deal with so much material effectively within 100 minutes, especially if the film's pivotal point is to be at least one visit rather than dramatic appeal. If you're a science fiction fan at all, this is a historically important movie. Against the background of Menzies, the production and the scenery are interesting, even if the cinematography seems very outdated. It is also interesting to see how Wells in his "predictions" was either forward-looking or subsequently humorous. I particularly liked the drive to the moon, which strongly reminded of George Méliès' journey to the moon of 1902 (aka Le Voyage dans la lune). Just do not expect too much from Things to Come.
