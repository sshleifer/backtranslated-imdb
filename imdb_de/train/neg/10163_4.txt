When I think of the revelation that the main character in "Bubble" can be seen at the end of the film, I remember last year's "Machinist" with Christian Bale. The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> An inconspicuous but realistic depiction of life in a small town. The title is a reason for contemplation. Maybe we, the spectators, are in the "bubble" because we are not rewarded in the 90 minute films. The reactions of the audience were often complacent and judgmental. This clearly shows how detached people can be when they see a human thread in characters so alien. These characters are those people refer to as those who have George W. back in office for a second term. <br /> <br /> It is sobering to think about how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when an audience jumps to it's feet for the exit once the credits roll. This film has its merits and deserves consideration for the things it does not say directly.
