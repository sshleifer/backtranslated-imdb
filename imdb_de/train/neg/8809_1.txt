A bunch of women who can not act sit around, talk, smoke jug. They have another woman in a wheelchair hiding them because she's deformed, and occasionally they kill somebody to feed that person with human flesh that really looks like a commercially bought ham they disguise with some plastic fingers. We do not see how they kill someone. Suddenly a body is on the floor, covered with a bloody sheet. That's why I can not eat spam covers from a leaf anymore. The mere thought of a spam cover through a sheet is enough to provoke the same narcolepsy that comes with trying to get through this whole movie. Occasionally there are random scenes of a guy "chasing" them, torturing a guy he's strapped into a chair. Why he got this guy and how he is connected to the Sit On The Couch sisters is never explained. There are also scenes of a "superhuman" guy freaking out. He is bleeding and beating through a wall, but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor involved in the story. <br /> <br /> There's no action, no special effects, no story If you want to see some boring people talk profoundly about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking, it's 90 minutes of it, because, except for a scene where a chick hooks on a street corner and the random scenes mentioned above, absolutely nothing happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you see them moving, including the deformed sister as they move into their new apartment. It is one of the few times that you do not sit on a couch or lie in bed.
