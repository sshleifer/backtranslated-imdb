I literally fell asleep 3 times when I saw this movie. Granted, it's Shakespeare, and that requires some mindset to be interested or not. But this film goes beyond any barrier to long one-to-one talks and what does not, which could prevent many from being interested in a Shakespearean-based story. <br /> <br /> The biggest blockage of this production is the complete flatness of the characters. Often it is almost difficult to distinguish between who the lines are and who during the interaction with the character. Granted, I think this movie will be dubbed in English. Surely they would have received speakers who could give this classic, literary lines a bit more drama. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to rate this movie as 1, although this may be based on prejudice, maybe age and what seems like a very low budget. Nevertheless, it is absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1.10
