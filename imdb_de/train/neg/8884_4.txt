"Dominique" is one of those films for which the term "molasses" has to be invented. Too many endless and repetitive sequences (how often do we see Robertson walking slowly downstairs because he can hear someone playing the piano?). It is almost at the end redeemed by a surprising twist, which unfortunately follows a second turn, which leaves only a bad taste in the mouth. Not a very nice movie.
