Would anyone shaq say he should stick to what he does well in basketball? This movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level. In this film, shaq plays a genius who lives in a boom box, that is, a genius in a boom box instead of a lamp. He is to help a little boy who is played by the equally annoying Francais Cappra. This film had the thinnest action since the water world, acting was terrible and I think anyone who likes this movie is scared to admit it.
