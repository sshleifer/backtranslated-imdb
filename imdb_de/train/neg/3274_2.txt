Once again, a television series like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget, and Thunderbirds is turned into a full-length movie and ruined for all the hundreds of people who saw it. Basically, Duke cousins ​​Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) spend a lot of time in "The General Lee" in Hazzard County. But they need to get together and prevent their family farm, along with most of the city, from being demolished by the nasty Jefferson Davis 'boss' Hogg (who was nominated by Razzie for Burt Reynolds) to make way for a huge coal mine. They receive help from their sexy cousin Daisy (Razzie for Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) while being persecuted by Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's M. C. Gainey) and the police. With Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason I'm giving the movie an extra star is because of some impressive auto stunts and of course the gorgeous bodywork of Simpson (I admit their legs are not quite Catherine Bach, but still!), But also it is pretty boring. Worst Picture Razzies, Worst Director for Jay Chandrasekhar, Worst Remake or Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Simpson & Her "Daisy Dukes" and Worst Screenplay were nominated. Pretty poor!
