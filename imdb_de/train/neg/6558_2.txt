We rented five movies for the New Year's Eve weekend and saw this first. All I can say is that there was no place to go. It was senseless and vulgar. Harvey Keitel's script must have been easy to write - just make two curses out of two words. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good in a character role, but the movie has nothing else to recommend.
