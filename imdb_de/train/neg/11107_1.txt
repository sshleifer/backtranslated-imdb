That was a horrible movie. There was no action at all. To top it off, if they could not explain the blood and blood flow (the only good part) ... they threw in some aliens! I hate it when the directors (or whatever) run out of ideas and then accuse the aliens! Watch this movie if you want. But do not say I did not warn you. Two things: how could Vinny say "welcome" if he had no tongue? It's a pity Mr. Jones did not matter much. Second, what bothered me, why we showed Vinny Jones' boils and he cut them off and put them in blue liquid, then they have no other role. Why not? I do not like being shown anything, and that has nothing to do with the story at all. Together sum. Bad story. I would not waste my time - I wish I had seen Mirrors instead.
