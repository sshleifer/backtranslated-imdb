I suspect that this director / writer had something to say. Let's see what it could have been ... a. Frog storms would be scary? b. Can I often get someone like Tom Cruise to say the word "C" and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? c. Throw my wife and let her speak the word "F" every 2 seconds. Apart from that, I really liked the beginning and the frogstorm. The rest was a relentless, overly long (too unworked), excessive failure. Nice that many of you liked it! <br /> <br />
