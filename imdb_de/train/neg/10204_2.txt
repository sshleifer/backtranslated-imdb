At first the movie seemed to be great, they had defined the profiles of the characters ... the plot seemed to be going in the right direction ... But as the movie progressed it seemed like the director was focusing on the wrong things. ..or just a lot was edited from the movie. The identity of the characters has deteriorated in the film. There also seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning - in other words - they had things within the film that did not fit the movie itself. And the title ... No, where in the movie fits the title to the movie ... I suppose the title works for the previews ... Actors have gotten along well with what they had when they had a better director and writer Maybe that would have worked better. But did not do it Now comes out a new terrible movie this Friday ... My opinion! Do not waste your time and money.
