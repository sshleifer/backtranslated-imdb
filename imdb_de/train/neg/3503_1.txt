And when I see Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love whimsical, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so damn B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying and yawning. She also misses everything that is humorous. The total way she tries to deliver her lines is simply dead on arrival, simply because she is not funny. I saw two sections of her program and was ready for Novocaine. Geez, my kid (19 years old) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was a "stupid girl". I found that a compliment. The one in which she says "Look at my show or I kill my dog" is really believable. I know she wants to be a comedian. It just looks like a spoiled nut box. I just never want to see her with my dog.
