I discovered this strip on the shelf under "New Releases" and found the idea of ​​a hip-hop zombie strip far too interesting to miss. That's how it was billed and I thought, "What a great idea!" There is also a "Welcome to Oakland" sign on the cover. How could I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part lasted only as long as the initial theme. Neither hip-hop music nor hip-hop culture played a major role in the film. I've lived in Oakland myself and I know there are many aspiring hip-hop artists there. The low budget of this strip was no excuse not to have a suitable soundtrack. Any number of artists who have difficulties would have taken the chance to contribute to this film. Why the Quiroz brothers did not take advantage of this is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Once the movie started rolling, it was a very typical zombie movie with a cast that happened to be completely black and Latino. You may think that makes the movie look unusual, but it did not. Somehow, the vision of "Quiroz Brothers" of "urban culture" amounts to making passing shootings and throwing an F-bomb on every line of the movie. The quick use of the word "fuck" is probably the most prominent feature of this film; There were single lines that contained the word three or four times, and no line contained it at least once. I'm not squeamish about cursing in a movie at all, but the feeling here was the result of a lack of ideas from the writers (including the Quiroz brothers), and the script was generally very bad. <br /> The movie was generally a disappointment. It would have been interesting to see a real "zombie movie" in "urban culture," but "Hood of the Living Dead" does not bring that. The characters in the movie might as well have been white or Eskimo or something else. The movie did not have a special character. It's just an ordinary low-budget movie with bad actors, lousy writing, amateurish directing, boring cinematography, a cheap soundtrack and nothing that could recommend it.
