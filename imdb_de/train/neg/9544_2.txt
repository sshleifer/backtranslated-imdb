I did not enjoy this movie. I did not find the acting very good and the story was boring. A 20 year old computer that saves the day? I thought that was a bit far-fetched for a movie as well. I could not figure out why they could not turn it off, why not take a sledgehammer. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, but after the original movie from the 80's you expected so much more What was actually delivered? This movie could not have been a 21st century version of the old movie, it was not. If you want that, do not look at this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer did not show up to save the day, it would always be a very cheesy movie, in my opinion.
