Mario Van Peebles appears for less than five seconds cameo. Glenn Plummer appears a bit longer, but it's a ladies show. Stacey Dash and Lisa Raye were in better projects. Bobby Brown looks at the screen through his short time. So it was set up ... Five hard women shooting and loving in the wild wild west. Four blacks and one Asian. Oh, and Lil 'Kim is a tough talk heartbreaker and Marie Matiko can bring the market for Pacific Rim. We can shoot it for less than 15 million. Straight to the video and we double, but more likely, triple our dollars.
