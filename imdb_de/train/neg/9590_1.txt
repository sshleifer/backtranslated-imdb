The film is based on a real novel from the 50s. <br /> <br /> Journalist Colin McInnes wrote three "London novels": "Absolute Beginner", "City of Spades" and "Mr Love and Justice". I have read all three. The first two are excellent. The last, maybe an experiment that did not materialize. McInnes' work, however, is highly praised. And rightly so. This musical is the author's ultimate nightmare - to see the fruits of his mind turn into a dazzling, ill-acting, fragrant, one-dimensional excuse for a movie that says he captures the spirit of London in the 1950s and does nothing like that. Fortunately, Colin McInnes was not alive.
