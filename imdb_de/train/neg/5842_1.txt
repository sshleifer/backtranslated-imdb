What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> It starts off well, with the title sequence, but that's about as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> The film is about rats that turn into monsters and go on a murder rush. The acting is not so bad, but the script is pointless and the film is not even scary despite the atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> It's really amazing that some groups have cobbled together this trash bag and these thoughts. It would make a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. It's garbage, and I urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it! One in ten.
