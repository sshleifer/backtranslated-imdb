I started to watch this movie and expected a barely tolerable Hammer horror movie ... and I was not far away. There are a lot of glances and they have thrown in a lot of nudity, but the last half of the movie has some ironic twists. Holy Cow, they were actually busy with the story and did not quite fall into the predictable stuff that was expected at the beginning. And dare I say it, some of the "unfounded" nudity were not so unfounded, because they fit into the story and setting Bad movie, but like bad movies, he's a bit smarter than the REALLY terrible threesome like Mesa of Lost Women and Robot Monster.
