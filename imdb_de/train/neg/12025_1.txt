This movie was on the Romance channel, and I thought it might be a silly 80's movie that would be fun on some level, so my brother and I looked at it. Boy sucked it. Boy has a crush on girls - correction, his * dream * girl (evidently there is a difference, and I'm surprised he realizes that she was his dream girl - he was beaten with her from over 30 yards away), I think (shows only the power of the dream girls), the boy ends up as a woman to be near a dream girl (creative in the sense that it is a distant plan, but uncreative in the sense that it is probably better) is solutions that you could possibly think of), unpleasant situations arise, a match is made (everything seems to take place around the late afternoon - either the location was somehow responsible for this weird lighting, or the actors had to wait until they got there To get out of their day jobs to come to the set (I suspect the latter) Very awkward, very pathetic It is almost never amusing * by chance *, so it is effective nothing to save it. Unless you're interested in seeing Chad Lowe's early days, before he finally got his share of the business with his role as HIV-positive gay in the series "Life Goes On" or Gail O'Grady, who was with NYPD Blue Cake got and probably stared at Dennis Franz's buttocks). But these are unlikely motives - I would say, "systematic aberration" would be a more legitimate purpose. I am surprised that I saw everything. I think it's the sort of thing you see halfway through a morbid, self-flagellated inner problem and think you might as well end it so you can tell your friends and family that you're actually sitting through such a horrible movie, at the chance that you get some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health. Can you accept the challenge?
