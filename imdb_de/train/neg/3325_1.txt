I found terrible. If you think everyone in the South is dumb, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, a religious nut, or a child molester, then this movie might be for you. Everyone is poor and seemingly ignorant. In one scene, two older men talk in a grocery store, and one mentions that he had abused sisters before they could put on their shoes. The man seemed proud of his actions, and the other man obviously considered it a normal part of life. Very nice. A young girl goes down the back streets looking for her sister, and no one offers her help - despite obvious slackness and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). Strathairn's character is not only disgusting and slimy, he also shows up as a religious believer who (typical of Hollywood) reflects the hideous nature of the Christians. One scene in the film is strongly reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear (the one with DeNiro) - Bible verses injected by evil. I'm from the Great Northwest, but found this film offensive because of the wonderful people I know, from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN, and so on.
