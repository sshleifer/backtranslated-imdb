After seeing "Triumph of the Will," all I can say is that this movie is scary, even against the historically low "standards" of the time. Of course, everything is totally fabricated and unprejudiced. That would be expected from the German propaganda of the 1930s. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself is fraudulent and cheap. It is also so ridiculous that even contemporary Germans must have left the theater with their noses. In a genre known for its appeal, lack of originality and unwise minds, this movie is not even considered "bad". To achieve this status, it would have to improve significantly!
