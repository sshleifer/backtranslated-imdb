In 1985, I caught this thing (I can not even call it a movie) via cable. I was in college and I was with a high school girlfriend whose hormones are out of control. I realized early that this was hopeless. Stupid script (a bunch of old men hiring some young people to show them how to score with women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. The luscious female nudity has made my girlfriend happy for a while - but even after 30 minutes she was bored bored. Remember - this was a HIGH SCHOOL BOY! This was back before the nudity of the Internet and so easy to reach. We always hoped for something interesting or funny, but that never happened. The funniest thing was the original advertising campaign, in which the studio admitted that this movie was crap! (A poster had a fictitious review: "This is the best movie I saw this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer at the top showed talent and has actually made a career in the industry. No-budget and boring T & A. Skip it.
