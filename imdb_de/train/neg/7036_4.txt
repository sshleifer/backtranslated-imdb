I do not ruin if I let you know that in this movie you see a woman having sex with a goat. If that's your thing, your movie has arrived. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband go to their estranged sister in the family villa in the woods. Her sister is a scary woman, to say the least, and she seems to have interests that go beyond the love of the family. On the site, a group of unappetizing characters appears and begins performing all sorts of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is pretty weak and the characters are pretty stupid. The woman stays around even if her husband starts jerking off and hanging out with the gentiles, even continuing sex with him. On the exploitative side of things, there's a lot of bared meat and a few kinky couplings, but nothing better nowhere else. Oh, and the goat sex scene mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will not make it to the end. Exploitation fans will be exhausted, but there will be more left over. <br /> <br /> 4/10
