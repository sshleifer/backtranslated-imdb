I do not think they made this movie. Completely unnecessary. The first movie was alright. But there was no need for a sequel, certainly not for a television series that was already a sequel to the first film. This movie feels like a soap opera. Writing is so bad, it's easy. The jokes do not come over, the acting is flat, it is shot like a soap, the direction is missing. The first movie had a good emotional backbone. Each character had a small bow. It was very simple back then, but somehow it worked and I could see the value of this movie. But this time there is no coherent action. The characters are boring clich√©s and nothing interesting happened. One good thing: The Brazilian, who plays Axel Daeseleire's son, is pretty well manned. That was her only moment of creative success in this film. I have heard that they have already made a second TV series as a sequel to 'Team Spirit 2'.
