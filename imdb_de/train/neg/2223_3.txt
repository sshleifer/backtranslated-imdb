Trite, clich√©d dialogue and plotting (the same stuff we've seen in the fantasy movies of the 1980s), hokey music, and a paint-by-number character make this impossible for all hardcore fans. <Br /> <br /> What keeps this movie from garbage is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi's work, the rotoscopy and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him. That's Frazetta ... on the move. The violence is spectacular and the artistic direction and animation are unlike any other sword and sorcery films of the time. <br /> <br /> I like watching the sound off and instead play the soundtrack to the first Conan movie.
