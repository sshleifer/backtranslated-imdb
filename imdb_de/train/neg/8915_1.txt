My comments on this movie have been deleted twice. I find that quite offensive, as I try to judge this movie for other people. Please be tolerant of the opinion of others. Obviously writing in the sense of Nietzsche's works is not understood, so I completely change my comment. <br /> <br /> I think that's a really bad movie for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Subject: One It should be very cautious to make a film about a philosopher who has not been understood by the masses to-day, and who engages in passionate discussions among like-minded people. Philosophers agree that Nietzsche was a great thinker. To make a film about his life, which obviously also includes his "ideas", one should be extremely careful or best not to do at all. Wisdom starts with knowing what you do not know. You might think that this is not a review of the movie itself, but the movie is not about an imaginary figure, but about the life of a man who actually lived and has great influence on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow would have. When someone tells a story about a tomato, I can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the chosen topic, the tomato. There is a responsibility for the producers when they make a movie about actual facts. Especially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken. <br /> <br /> Screenplay: One of the first things I noticed were the ridiculous accents. Why? It distracts from what it should be about; Nietzsche and the found truths. It does not help to put things in a correct geographical perspective or time! Come on, do it right English or even better; German! Even Mel Gibson had done this part right by letting his characters speak in the Passion for a bit of Aramaic. <br /> <br /> Second, it's pretty over the top. <br /> <br /> 3d, Assante is not an actor to portray Nietzsche. Bad casting. <br /> <br /> 4. Facts are gone. <br /> <br /> And so on. It's a waste of celluloid.
