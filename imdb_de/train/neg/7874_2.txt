In a way, Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie achieves its goal of being seen by thousands. But it does not help to make them laugh ... <br /> <br /> Les Visiteurs had its success, because the theme was an original way to consider time travel: Forget Zemeckis' Back to the Future, here comes Old France, the medieval knight and his almost barbarous way of life. Full of pride, witty thanks to the old words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but he holds his honor. Then the sequel follows. No one had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs, the first. It does not make sense to be a movie expert to understand that the corridors of time have been made for money. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs and immediately seeks to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed a second lesson. Explanation: There is no point in retrieving the jewelry Jacquouille stole. Do not you remember that beautiful red shiny and expensive car that he bought at the end of the first epoch? Where do you think he found the money? Selling the jewelry ... And that's just one of many holes that Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Let's look at the characters: Montmirail does not change, he's just a bit more boring. Frenegonde ... that's another story: Valérie Lemercier did not make any compromises in this sequel so as not to get stuck in the bourgeois role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pathetic that I almost felt pain. And Poiré does not know that a group of humorists is not enough to make a good comedy. Forget the time, the digital effects, focus on the story, and you'll see that on a stamp is enough space to write ten times. <br /> <br /> The main interest of this film is the landscape. A movie for teenagers, say up to 13 years old.
