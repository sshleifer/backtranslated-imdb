Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie. The actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is fine. Although I was very interested in the topic and I like to reflect on and discuss religion (I am an atheist), it was hard to force me to watch the movie end in a bitter and, in my opinion, somewhat unconsciously funny ending. Why is this movie so boring? I dont know. It's just that way and it's not recommended.
