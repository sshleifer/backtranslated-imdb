I'm a real fan of the original cracker series and I own them all on DVD. Cracker had the tendency to be exaggerated at times, but Robbie Coltrane and the other members of the cast, as well as the writers, always seemed to take it with them. I count the original cracker among the big UK TV crime series of the time, and there's tough competition: Prime Suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Homes, and many others. Cracker was at the top of my list with Prime Suspect. <br /> <br /> What makes "A New Terror" sadder ... <br /> <br /> After all, this was a very pale imitation of Cracker's former glory. I forced myself to endure the whole thing, convinced that it could not be that bad and that at some point a spark would ignite. I was wrong, it was bad from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> A few points of criticism: First, to dispel possible prejudices: I was offended by the anti-American anti-war attack screed, which was blasted on throughout the show. The Top: The murder of two Americans who are innocent of a crime, and a British junkie is, according to Fitz words "understandable, but not justified". I thought, "I've been crap for two hours just to drop that disgusting bit of droppings?" So I had a negative reaction to the anti-war / American tone created by my beliefs. Aside from politics, I had the distinct feeling that this cracker was just a propaganda prop and actually helped to undermine one already dreadfully weak script. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how much air time did Robbie Coltrane get? Fitz was almost a bit of a player in this case, as if he were a thinker in a story originally written without thinking of Fitz's role. Coltrane could have worn the show on his own broad and still rather slack shoulders, but the author evidently thought of other things and missed the opportunity and by a long way. <br /> <br /> Third: WHAT TO ABYSMAL SCRIPT! There was a bit of sparkle and some details about the character's development (Fitz's son scolded that Fitz could not stay in his house if he missed his plane to Australia), the detective who liked to beat his poor performers behind their backs heads and some of the old sparks between Fitz and his wife), but not nearly enough to carry the boring plot. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where the hell was Panhallagan? Well, that would have been interesting ... After all, it was Manchester and ten years later she was in the ranks. Another wasted opportunity (or maybe the actress was not interested?) <br /> <br /> Well, there's a lot more (that's bad) to say, but I close curiously: at the end of the show (like it's on BBCA aired) when the ad announced that the "Director's Cut" is available on BBC On-Demand, I thought, AH-HA! The Director's Cut, which you probably have to pay for, could have all the goodies that I expected tonight, but never, like a coherent, interesting plot. Having convinced myself to sit through the terrible free version of "A New Terror", hoping to see something, something worth seeing, just to be disappointed, I have no hope to motivate me to actually pay for a second. possibly longer and more boring version. I was also annoyed by the thought that BBCA had sliced ​​and diced and sacrificed show time to accommodate the endless (every ten minutes) stream of commercials. Then he turned around and asked me to pay for the version that is likely to air today. <br /> <br /> Finally, I quote the first paragraph of Variety's review of "A New Terror": It really says everything: "First excitement about Robbie Coltrane playing his role as BBC's flawed, boozy, happy face The criminal psychologist is snowed by the lumbering political statement writer Jimmy McGovern, who is determined to deliver within these revival vipages Do you know about terrorism before he's on our doorstep McGovern's chest cleansing song overwhelmed the narrative and silenced the pleasure of seeing Fitz again in that case.
