Normally, I have much better time to write than write reviews, but I was so disappointed with this movie that I signed up for IMDb for an hour just to get it off my chest. A movie called Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bankable bet ... well, this movie was just awful. It is almost impossible to "expose unbelief"; I really tried, I wanted to enjoy it, but Justin Timberlake just did not let me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should stay with the music, what a terrible idea - NO presence as an actor, NO character. I can not put everything on Justin: The film also offers a terrible plot and time-consuming editing; It's definitely an "F". <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I have to wonder what really motivates the actors. I mean, surely Morgan read the script before he took over the role. Did not he see how poor it was? What could motivate him to take on the role? Money? Of course, sometimes acting is more about who you see with than developing quality work. LL Cool J is a great actor. He gets a lot more time in this movie than Freeman or Spacey and has trouble dealing with the bad script. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the audience says, "What the hell is going on here, you expect me to believe that crap?" executed - very disappointing.
