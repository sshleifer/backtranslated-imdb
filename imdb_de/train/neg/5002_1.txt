How did such a horrible screenplay manage to attract this cast? Ridiculous, predictable and absolutely incredible. This is good-natured and cunning, but the material is so bad that it still describes itself as one of the worst thrillers of all time that I've seen in years. Amazingly bad and not in an entertaining way. Avoid it at all costs, even if you are a fan of someone in the cast.
