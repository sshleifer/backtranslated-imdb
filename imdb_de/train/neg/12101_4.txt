I saw it, 100% agree with it, but I did not care about its delivery. He just came out as an asshole in a badly worked out, fake youth campaign. Edit cuts in abundance, etc ... The camera would focus on it, and you would see 2 or 3 edit cuts over a minute or two of dialogue. Insert the camera that is a movie no-no in the standing boommikes. <br /> <br /> This documentary captures a theme with so many points of view, so many interesting stories, that the movie is so easy to do. Choosing religious fanatics is like choosing the backward child. It's so easy it's just wrong. I mean, how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags? To make them contradictory, just let them recite more than one or two verses. I like it when he jumped back between people of the same religion and showed that they completely contradict each other. <br /> <br /> I just think he could have done something more creative. The part in which the neurologist spoke about brain activity has never been substantiated. It could have been interesting to show brain tests of people during religious seizures compared to drugs, sex or sex. He could have played more on the women, who all enjoyed the Passion Play, which looked more like a snuff scene in a new Rob Zombie movie. More could have gone down in the story of John Smith, the founder of the Mormons, who had a long history. Immersion in science v. Religion. One is a very methodical, very rigorous process to increase confidence in theories. It builds on a solid foundation, a new layer over a proven layer. Every step requires a huge burden of proof. The other starts at the top and has unassailable claims. It is so, because good? I said it. <br /> <br /> Done? I would say, turn it into a HBO original series? met every week a different religion. <br /> <br /> It was an eye-opener in one thing. I must have been blind. Good old G.W.Bush ... no wonder he was elected. He had the religious majority. And well ... now this is the blind man who runs the blind. <br /> <br /> Bill Moyer .. Well ... what can I expect from a man handing out in Sutra, Newport Beach?
