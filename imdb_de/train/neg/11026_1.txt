I have just read a book about Dillinger. This movie was terribly inaccurate. It's like having a list of names and inventing everything. His raids and getaways were well planned right up to the second - when the time was up they left, whether they had all the money or not. They had notes from every street where they had to turn, etc. Purvis never saw him in the restaurant. He was told that Dillinger paid for his food after Dillinger left. Purvis never saw Dillinger before the night when Dillinger was killed, just photos of him. The way his gang members died was fictional. Dillinger has never robbed a bank alone, as he did in this movie. If I had never read the book, maybe I could have enjoyed the movie. The acting was in places somewhat exaggerated. The action was also overkill. The second thought I doubt that I would have liked, even if I had NOT read the book.
