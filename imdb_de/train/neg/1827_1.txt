Envy stars some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and the great Christopher Walken. With such a cast you can only expect the best. Nobody could save this catastrophe with Envy. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and employees of a sandpaper factory. They both deserve a decent life, but since Tim performs better at work, he can afford more than his buddy Nick. Nick is a dreamer who always has new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with the idea for a spray can to make dog feces disappear (yes, I'm serious). Nick falls in love with the idea and decides to really invent this product. He makes an offer to Tim to invest in his idea and share the profit 50/50. Tim refuses to think that the idea will never work. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention titled "va-poo-rize" (again, I'm serious) makes millions in the end. He likes to spend his money on things that are a much bigger house, a horse, a personal trainer and fancy desserts. Tim starts to feel envy for Nick. Hence the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it still turns out to be awful. This movie contains some of the worst dialogues and very bad performances of all actors. As mentioned before, none of them could save this mess. Not even the great Christoper Walken, who played a homeless character called "J-man", made this movie funny. The movie is bad from the beginning and gets worse and worse. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if: * you like crap (no pun intended) * you want to see Jack Black in a white tuxedo /> <br /> I say, avoid this movie at all costs but avoid ESP if: * you are offended by bathroom humor * you love animals
