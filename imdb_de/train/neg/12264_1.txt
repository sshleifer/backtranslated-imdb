They get 5 authors together, each one writing a different story with a different genre and then trying to make a movie out of it. It's action, it's adventure, it's sci-fi, it's western, it's a mess. Sorry, but this movie stinks absolutely. 4.5 rated it with an incredibly high rating. That is, it's films like these that make me think I could write films, and I can barely write.
