I'm the guy who usually keeps opinions to myself, but I've just come back from this film and felt I had to express my opinion. Let me first say that I am a huge horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I like it when I see a good bit of script and character development even a little bit. I know they often miss horror movies, but Prom Night looked like she did not make any effort in this department. Next we love all the suspense. Being on the edge of your seat is exciting with unpredictable surprises. Yes, Prom Night had none of that! Of course we like a terrible murderer. Prom Night have that? No, it has a pretty boy with a cute little knife. And if all else fails ... at least the horror has its guilty pleasure of making it edible like Gore Gore Gore and the occasional nude scene! Yes, if you rated a horror movie with PG-13 like Prom Night, then you can do that too. So if all those elements are missing, I ask ... does that still count as a horror movie? Nope. I would rather call it a comedy. The people in my theater laughed more about it than when I saw "Semi-Pro", which was supposed to be a comedy (which is shit, but that's another story!). I think I just have to give up the new horror. All the good horror movies of the good old days were turned into garbage so that movie studios can earn money. The people I saw with did not even know it was a remake! What made me angry! I wonder what happens if there are no more films to remake? Where is the horror going next?
