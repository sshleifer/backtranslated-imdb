I can not figure out Al Pacino. I watch him in the Godfather, Scarface, Carlitos Way, and I think I watch one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years. Then I see him in Two for the Money, Any Given Sunday and Revolution, and I wonder what the guy thinks. <br /> <br /> A few days ago I came across Revolution and thought I would spend the next two hours on it. Here is a news flash: Would you like to make prisoners talk? Force them to watch over and over again ... they profess to do something. <br /> <br /> I will not retake the story because there is no coherent plot, but it takes place during the American Revolution. Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to participate, but ultimately does. Although he has no money, no education, and dresses like a caveman, a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason, having only two minutes of dialogue with each other. <br /> <br /> Frankly, if "Al Smith" starred in this movie instead of "Al Pacino," it would have ruined her career. The script was awful, but Pacino's demotivated performance and obvious wrong accents made it even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was ridiculous. I really can not describe it. Natasha Kinski is a main character but has 5 lines in the movie. In fact, nobody talks much in this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most ludicrous premises in this film is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this uncanny ability to constantly meet on the battlefield. It's like the entire northeast Starbucks. "Hey, fun to see you again, on ANOTHER battlefield 100 miles away ... see you in a few months". <br /> <br /> I have to award this star from IMDb as there is nothing here for a negative score.
