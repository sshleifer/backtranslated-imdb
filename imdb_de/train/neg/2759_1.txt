Hilarious, laugh loud moments ... and yet no comedy. I especially liked the planted gag of the ambulance, soaking the "dirty butt", who then in anger calls out to them "you dirty butt". I mean, wow, someone's online degree in literature pays off! The worst script imaginable, with plot introductions in an instant, ridiculous movement in the story, zero character development (even between the characters that meet ... it's as if they all knew each other for years and trusted them ) dodgy voice with additional echo effects and plot holes .. oh god there are plotting holes !! To be honest, I do not even write that down, but I certainly expect that the last 30 minutes will not actually improve the already pathetic attempt in the movies ... Thank God we've made a good-looking push to do something Do not forget that the movie has a lot of ... well ... use your imagination to finish this sentence!
