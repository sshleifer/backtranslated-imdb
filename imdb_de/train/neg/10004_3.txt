"It seems many critics consider the idea of ​​a Woody Allen drama inedible." And for good reason: they are unbearable wooden and arrogant imitations of Bergman. And let's face it: critics mostly support Allen's Bergman Allegations, but Allen complains about the opposite allegations. What I do not understand is this: Why was Allen generally applauded for his originality of imitating Bergman, but contemporary Brian DePalma was scared off in his horror movies for his "Hitchcock movies"? In Robin Wood's view, this is a curious form of cultural snobbery. I would have to agree.
