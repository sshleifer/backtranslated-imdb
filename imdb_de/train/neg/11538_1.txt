A really horrible movie that made me uncomfortable after seeing the forty minutes I could stand in it. Not the guilt of the actors, but the author / director, producers, financiers, etc. need a very stiff conversation. Maybe it thinks it's profound. It's not This rape and ultra-violence, in contrast to the central role of Clockwork Orange, has nothing to say and nothing to add to the sum of human understanding. There are no straw dogs I've compared to. It feels more like something Pete Walker was addressing, even though I said I might be unfair to Pete Walker. Revenge is a strong human desire, but the bedroom window has more to say about male defections than about this miserable effort. <br /> <br /> I do not think that it is particularly misogynistic, only too much joy in the presentation of certain details - the blood running along GAs leg rape par example. It is neither challenging nor confrontational, although I am sure that the filmmakers feel very "daring", simply deeply unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Is that as high as we wish? So did those involved want to make films? (I've written here the Latin phrase translated as Oh the Times!) Oh, the habits! But the new spell checker from IMDb did not let me post until I removed them, as I had to remove square brackets ordered IMDb.) < br /> <br /> Where is the sublime claim? The noble impulse? If you look at the British movie - the happy comedies of Ealing or the Boulting Brothers; Carol Reed's work with Graham Greene on Fallen Idol, Our Man in Havana, or the sublime The Third Man (a movie that has far more to say about the evil than a thousand straightheads); the work of Powell & Pressburger; or, if you want to talk about sex, violence and male emasculation, look at "The Offense" Dir. Sidney Lumet, from an original piece by John Hopkins; Look at "Tunes of Glory" to make something valuable, that has something to say. <br /> <br /> Unlike the above, Straightheads is unfortunately a hateful waste of celluloid.
