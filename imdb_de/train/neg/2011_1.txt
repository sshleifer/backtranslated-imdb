This movie is pure Guano. Mom always said when you can not say anything nice ... but even Mom would do my part to warn others about this movie. I can guarantee that this is the movie that Geoffrey Rush wishes just go away. I'd hope Greg Kinnear fired his agent from a gun because he gave him the script. Ben Stiller then probably prays that someone "There is still something about Mary". I have always been a fan of Wes Studi, thanks to whatever you consider sacred, that he wore a mask through the film, so people may not identify with the movie. <br /> <br /> It starts off promisingly with a stylistic parody of the cinematography of Batman movies and then just loses something ... like a coherent storyline and half-decent effects. <br /> <br /> The jokes are telegraphed one hour before the start of the punch line, and even then they fall flat. If you want to see an effective parody of the comic world, read "Chasing Amy." <br /> <br /> RUN! Do not go away from "MYSTERY MEN"!
