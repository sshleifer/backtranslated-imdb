The film is about a man in love in an amusement park where teenagers are on the scavenger hunt. Since there are no rules, they break into a building and are killed. The deaths are cheesy and stupid. But at least it had better effects than Sabretooth. I gave him three because Stacy was there and I loved the movie Sabretooth. I thought it was okay, but some deaths were not on the screen. There was a stupid scene in which the two teenagers kissed and the head of the sabroucus pops out, and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind to have them completely fake red-headed. Then the Sabretooth stands in the vents and bites the children's head off. The death with the owner was totally fake graphics. Even death was stupid because the statu√±a tooth went through his mouth and gets stuck there, so it supports him, and there is a scene where a Goth girl loses his contacts, does not find her, and it seems she is do not need that. The movie is idiotic and a waste of time.
