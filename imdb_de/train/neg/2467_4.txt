This movie gets both a 6/10 rating from me and a 9/10. Here's the reason: as a standard horror movie for the standard horror forces, where action and gore and anxiety are taken into account, this movie will bore you. It's basically a family drama, similar to what you would see on the Lifetime Channel, but it's a horror universe. The story and the formula are ancient, have been retreaded hundreds of times. If you are looking for originality in the plot structure or for minimal conflicts, you will be disappointed. Take away the zombies and you have something as melodramatic as A Beautiful Mind stumbling on cheese. This is the 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the basic summary and idea is quite original and exaggerated. It's literally something that you and your friends would joke about when you're half drunk. , , But this joke was actually published theatrically. The idea gets a 9/10 from me. The only reason why it is not perfect is that they could go further, which was not the case. <br /> <br /> The mixture of the two is mixed. I thought it was funny, but like most comedies, it was not so funny. I had my mother and little sister with me, and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes played. There were moments of absolute genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope that other films take on this kind of exaggerated risk and original ideas. I just can not say it was perfect, or even close, because the plot lacks originality. <br /> <br /> A great family movie. A great movie to watch with a lot of guys (or girls). A great movie that you can watch with anyone. , , But if you look at it alone, it gets a bit boring. Other people make this kind of movie funnier and richer. <br /> <br /> 4/10
