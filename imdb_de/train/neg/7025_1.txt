I wish I could give this movie a zero or less, because that's what it deserves. I honestly never go out of a movie, but this movie was so terribly awful that I could not stand another minute of it. Please, please, please, please, for the sake of humanity, skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really immerse in, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> It has unsightly, unappetizing traces, choppy structure, ridiculous dialogues and is absolutely convincing in every way imaginable. It can not entertain on an absolutely fundamental level. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so bold, it's HEAVIER than any student movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> As if that was not enough, the entire movie is based on constant (and I mean CONSTANT) voice over narration. The scriptwriter could also have written a novel because he insisted on telling everything rather than showing it. We should just assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best friends and have a special connection, even if there is no character development that illustrates this. In addition, after the first five minutes, the film introduces new characters over and over, not in a natural way, but in a still image of the characters whose name is written across the screen. There is no introduction, no development of one of the figures. We do not really get to know any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the amateur movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm a gay woman who saw this movie with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both thought this movie was a depressing portrayal of queer cinema. I start to think that lesbian and gay movies are very similar to Christian rock - no matter how horrible it is, people still flock to it and stand up for it, no matter how bad the quality is. Please do not rent this !! Instead, let's promote the production of gay and lesbian QUALITY movies by renting "But I'm a Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures." ,
