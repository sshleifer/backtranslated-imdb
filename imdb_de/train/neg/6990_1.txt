What the hell is that? It's one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why people on this site love it so much. It is meaningless and nakedness without reason. Worst of all is Resident Evil. I highly recommend it, unless you want to see chessy, bad-looking crap. Watch real Horor movies like Stephen King's, The Shining, Jurassic Park (somehow Horor), JAWS and more. Leave that crap out for a rental if nothing else is for rent. It's bad like Crudy vs Gayson. The Killer Tomatoes attack is better than this crap. Oh wow, meat-eating zombies. How many fucking Zobie movies do we need? SKip this. <br /> <br /> * outta ****
