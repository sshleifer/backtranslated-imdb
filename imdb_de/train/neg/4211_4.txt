About 4 years ago I liked this movie. I would watch it over and over again. But now ... not me. I think this movie was great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. He has a lot of commentator-heavy actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a rather kitschy plot. My favorite part is when Culkin rides his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says, "Hey, Tyler, where are you going, the moon?" Also pay attention to the classic line "Do you have a feeling in your toes?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's better than "The Good Son".
