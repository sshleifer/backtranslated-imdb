It's such a strange movie, you can call it terrible, or when you're sitting with friends, it can be a killer laugh. Strange, it always comes back to my mind. Shot amateurish, acted worse and the directions maybe no. The special effects are funny, but the music that accompanies a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit. See it if you have time to kill. But do not even try to take it seriously. Probably a tribute to the "Porno Holocaust". Since I have not seen it, I can assume that it is so bad. Should have been 1/10, but it has brought me one or two good laughs, so it gets a 3rd Excessive gutter, the only thing anyone has worked on. Stay away if you're squeamish, more anger than laughter. I wonder if the creators had a laugh?
