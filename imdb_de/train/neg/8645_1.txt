I've just come back from this free screening, and this "Osama Witch Project" is the worst movie I've seen this year, worse than even "Catwoman" - who had the decency to at least pretend to be a fiction. <br /> <br /> In "September Tapes" a "film crew" of "documentary journalists" travel to Afghanistan - even though they are totally unprepared for the journey, the conditions and, oh yes, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker's leader to avenge the death of his wife on September 11th - to find Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> They "made" eight cassettes on their journey, which are now "documenting" their travels and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (Fortunately, the eight tapes all end up in important places in the narrative, which is beneficial for a "documentary.") The psychotic, idiotic protagonist - who's too long, meaningful talking probably learned to watch "MacGyver" - does not care his own life or the life of his innocent crew, as he puts them in danger through a series of completely stupid mishaps. I do not know why he was not just wearing a shield on his back saying, "Shoot me." <br /> <br /> The translator of the crew, supposedly their rational voice, does little more than whine and is astonished when the idiot hero leads them into destiny. <br /> <br /> They wished they had taken someone along to call them all idiots. <br /> <br /> Near "Tape 4" I started looking for the terrorists who were supposed to shoot the film crew.
