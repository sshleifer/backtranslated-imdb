Millie is a juice. She marries a rich man named Maitland and they have a child. Then she gets him cheating on her and divorces ... but he keeps the kid she claims to love. Back in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to strong support from spouses and children, but let the guy go surprisingly easily ... without support ... what a jerk! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, it turns out that it's also a scam! Wow, she has a hard time picking men. <br /> <br /> Millie changes as a result of these bad relationships. Now she is a wild party girl - she does everything to distract herself from her hard luck. Suddenly many years pass. Millie's daughter, who left her early in the movie, is now 17 and fashion has not changed a bit. An old friend of Millie (yes, it's another bad man!) Pretends to be the daughter's friend, but he has horny plans. Millie promises him she will kill him if he touches the girl. Take what happens next! <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess - a bit like "Madam X," but much, much less focused. Millie's motivations and actions often seem to make little sense. And the movie seems to have a little of everything as long as it underpins the idea that all men are pigs. Unusual but not very good.
