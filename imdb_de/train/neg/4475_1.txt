terrible, just terrible! My old roommate looked at this garbage and it drove me crazy. The book is one of my favorites and it is a shame that some people will never know what it really looks like, because their first impressions come from dribbling of this kind. They have changed so much that it is barely recognizable. which amazes me, because the book reads like a soap opera anyway and offers enough food for modern entertainment. It's like one of those Lifetime movies that say "based on a true story," but totally fictional. There is no emotion or depth of the book, just a thoughtless melodrama. If you're a high school student looking for a way out of reading, try a different version.
