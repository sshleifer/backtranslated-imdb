I really wanted to have this western, a fan of the genre and a fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane", who are all in this story! Add Gary Cooper as lead actor to the mix, and it sounded great. <br /> <br /> The problem was ... it was not like that. After 40 minutes, I looked at my watch and was bored to death. Jean Arthur's character was a bit annoying and James Ellison just did not look and behaved like "Buffalo Bill". Cooper was also in bad shape and sounded too wooden. This was several years before he reached his heyday as an actor. <br /> <br /> In short, his western blanks. Go up the pass and look at another eater, because most of them were far better than this one.
