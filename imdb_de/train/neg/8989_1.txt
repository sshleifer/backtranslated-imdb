There are some good things about the movie. The music and the cinematography are great. Alex Wilson is hot and does a great job. Ryan Bauer is hot too. The production was lucky enough to have cast it because it really gives the film a production value. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many guys who do not speak are cute too. Why is the actress playing Amy not listed in the credits? Brandon Alexander gives a great comedic performance as Clitarissa Pink. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is probably star James Townsend. He can not act. He is also very skinny, not nice to look at all. His arms are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. You have no muscle tone at all. It's no wonder he has to make his own movie and play in it himself. No one else would throw him into anything. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not to be believed as someone who even has a girlfriend because he looks so gay. They should have been playing another lead role if they wanted the best for the movie. On the other hand, maybe he just wants to use this film as a vehicle to start a career in softcore porn, definitely not a real acting because he took acting lessons. Also, anyone who does porn is blacklisted in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The most ludicrous thing about this movie is probably the casting of a fair-skinned Latina as Devon's mother. Sonja Fisher does not seem to be an actress at all. All in all, this movie is softcore porn and is no better than something you would see on Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best of this film, is embarrassed and does not want to be associated with it. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else is listed, so Alex Wilson is probably a disposable name. I also met him recently in West Hollywood. When I mentioned this movie, he just turned around and walked away. I understand. If I had worked on this film, I would be embarrassed and would not want to be associated with it.
