I'm never much for classic films. Films like Patton, Going My Way, How Green My Valley Was, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Citizen Kane bore me. However, I would watch each of these films 3,469 times, while I'm tied up in a chair, as An American in Paris, once in the most luxurious suite ever. If I did the latter, I would probably sleep all the time. <br /> <br /> The direction of color art and the music did not interest me, Gershwin or non-Gershwin. Dancing and singing could help a sleepless man fall asleep. The dialogue does not fit Singin 'in the Rain. Basically, this movie is boring. The only other movie I fell asleep watching was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. I only slept 5 minutes the night before. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (too bad we can not give zeros.)
