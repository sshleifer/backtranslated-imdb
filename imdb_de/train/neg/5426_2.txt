`In the tradition of 'Carrie' and 'Heathers'? Try a shameless rip-off of not only these two films, but also 'The Evil Dead' and 'The Shining'. That means they really do not make any bad horror movies anymore, and that's a shame, because it's gas. Rainbow Harvest is the replacement for Winona, and although she does little more than mumble her lines (and occasionally shout "YOU'RE UGLY !!!" in her haunted mirror), she's Goth before she's in fashion, so have to you respect her. (And she's also pretty creative with black leather shawls and a sort of black-painted Hawaiian Punch Guy hat.) Eat your heart out, Cher.) Karen Black works but she's not without dignity, and you can not help but to sympathize with her. (If you are not a friend of mine who asked, "Who is this, Horse Lips from 'MASH'?", When she first appeared on screen.) <br /> <br /> There is Neat support from Kristin Dattilo (as a square chick who befriends Rainbow), Ricky Paull Goldin (in his role known as Wisecracking) and William `Larry, Darryl and Darryl 'Sanderson (as a kind of pet entrepreneur or something). However, it is sad to see that once-smoking Yvonne DeCarlo limits herself to what can only be thought of as a Charlotte Rae part. The Eighties were the heyday of witty, insanely stupid horror movies like this and "Mirror, Mirror" was one of the last of its kind. Definitely worth a look.
