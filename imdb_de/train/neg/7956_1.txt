This movie should be number one among the last 100. The acting is so terrible that when my son and I saw him, we almost became physically ill. And the story is worse. I could go on and on and say how bad it is, but all I really wanted to do was add a warning to Frankbob's review because no one has ever bothered to do so. Do not waste your time, your money, your energy or anything else with this movie. Luckily we saw it on TV, so we did not spend anything on it. If we had, I would have been forced to write those responsible for this atrocity and throw an Exekration in their general direction. Finally, I would like to say that I have always enjoyed seeing Carrie Fisher. But unfortunately I have to say that she does not pay to see this movie. Do not spoil your opinion about Carrie by looking at her.
