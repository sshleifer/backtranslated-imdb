(aka: The Bloodsucker performs the dance) <br /> <br /> Many nude girls in this movie with some lesbian scenes. The film is set to play in Ireland, but looks more like Rome and the Adriatic for me. <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians are invited for a weekend in the castle of a count. One after the other, they seem to be missing their heads because a madman walked around. <br /> <br /> It's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they're lit by floodlights, though candles are lit. Go figure ... (sic) <br /> <br /> Dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by the Euro horror actor Alfredo Rizzo, this is a snoozer. <br /> <br /> Pretty boring 2 out of 10
