I saw Free Money last night and it was the longest over 90 minutes of my life. With such a fascinating cast I really thought that I would do something good - especially as I'm a Brando fan. NOT CORRECT! What a talent waste. It's almost embarrassing to watch sometimes (as in the livestock scene), and there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups (why did not they show Charlie Sheen's character dragging Brando's truck back?) It's trying to be a slapstick comedy but I just did not care. Skip this. Only for diehard Brando fans. <br /> <br /> I give 2 out of 10 points because I still think the worse movie ever made was Skidoo.
