Two days after seeing this thing, I'm still in a panic because I saw it. It's so bad that you have to ask yourself how anyone could write this trip, and certainly not that it stays loose in public. Standing acting, a leading man who looks like he's sleepwalking, and Alison Eastwood is embarrassing himself. The action is a sign of low budget movie making, which means that it is painfully bad. The plot? If you were 6 years old, you could have written this movie. Simplistic, idealistic and just lame.
