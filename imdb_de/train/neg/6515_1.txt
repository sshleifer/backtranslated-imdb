This is not a boring movie, the audience could sit in his chair, fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both filmmaker and actor here. The plot is simple: After a divorce and ten years as a Hollywood non-career, the author plays love in front of the camera. The first question is how true it all is: What is written, what happened by accident? Both answers, "Yes" or "No", make M. Berkowitz a low average person. If you're looking for a selfish fiction like this, I recommend you read some independent comic books: Chester Brown, Joe Matt. .. <br /> <br /> Besides, I was pretty disappointed with my country, France. I know that Americans usually say the French are arrogant (that could be true), etc., and certainly the French (and the whole world) have a lot of mourning for America, but why do they hate so much? I do not think I would like this movie anyway.
