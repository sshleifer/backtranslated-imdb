I stole this movie while I was still in college. I tried three times to see the second because friends wanted to see it. "Sweet Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since it's so funny, it has to be funny." Not correct! I can not look at that bunch of crap after the Dream War / Insulting War, where the guy gets burned with a good zinger when he causes physical pain to the opponent. You might think a horrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but once you've seen that, you know it's true. This movie is not worth the price I paid for it. I watched a lot of Steven Segal movies and even saw Crossroads twice ... but I still could not see it.
