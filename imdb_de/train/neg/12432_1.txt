This is the worst rip off of Home Alone movies I've ever seen! Look at Parts 1 and 2, but do not let anyone say that this is BETTER than the first two! I mean, you do not actually make a movie, then you do a sequel with the same characters and actors and then do another episode with DIFFERENT characters and actors! I mean, it would have been alright if this was not a "home alone" movie, but they made it a "home alone" movie. Culkin is too old now, so you should stop doing sequels! Gosh, this movie makes me sick! Buy parts 1 and 2.
