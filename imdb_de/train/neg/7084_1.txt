As many others have said, this is a horrible movie, from every aspect of film production. It's amazing how they've ever won some well-known name actors for this project. <br /> <br /> Many people have complained that it was shot with "cheap" video cameras. Yes, it was shot on video, but not a "cheap" video. What made it bad was the lighting, the white balance, the recording technique and the editing. <br /> <br /> So many different recording and editing techniques were used that it was a production mess. Hard, inconsistent lighting, via hand shooting (alias Woody Allen), choppy editing (another Allen technique) but poorly done, with no real purpose. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes are embarrassing; very amateur. <br /> <br /> The simulated sex scenes did not have a theatrical value at any level. <br /> <br /> How this video ever managed to print is a mystery to me. It's worth it just to marvel at how bad it is.
