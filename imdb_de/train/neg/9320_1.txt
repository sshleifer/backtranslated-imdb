If this movie was a comedy, I would have given it a 10. Oh my god, where do I start? To put it this way: I've seen a lot of terrible horror movies, but this makes Troll 2 like a fucking saving private Ryan. It's as if a group of pornographers choose a horror movie, change their stance in the mid-production and decide on a comedy, then go back to horror and then decide they should just hang on to porn (softcore) , Everything about this movie is just awful: the music (someone shoots the man who invented the Yamaha keyboard), the script, the direction, the cinematography, the acting. There are simply no words to describe it. Oh wait, yes, there are: Holy $ *%!
