... or an audience. A quick review .... <br /> <br /> So you have this doctor, who for some reason experimented with stolen body parts. He wants to perfect the transplants, but feels comfortable in his basement. WTF ??? And suddenly, unfortunately and conveniently, his fiancé loses his head in a traffic accident for which he is responsible. With grief, he refreshes her head in a lasagne pan (or strudel?) And pumps it with "adreno serum" (sic) to keep it alive. And then she wakes up and talks (sort of) off her head, even though her neck was obviously severed on the vocal cords and she has no lungs, so she could not speak even if she had her. Seems that ungrateful b * tch does not appreciate everything her fiancé did for her. Just like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then his grief turns to horniness as he sees the opportunity to graft his loved one's head onto the body of the first sloppy bimbo he gets off the street can pick up. Meanwhile, the assistant of the doctor, a kind of dime-store Igor, gets into a philosophical confrontation with the head, which has closed with the "monster in the closet" (every crazy scientist has a telekinetic friendship). Finally, the scriptwriter states that he can not burden the audience with his misogyny and fear of confidentiality problems for an infinite period of time, so he kills everyone and presumably goes to the bank to cash the check before the film's payers can stop paying /> <br /> Did I mention that I think this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Somebody should ask Turner Classic Movies to show this edited version without bloody stuff. The sight of the wizard with a torn arm and pirouettes in the house, without leaving much blood, is simply too valuable.
