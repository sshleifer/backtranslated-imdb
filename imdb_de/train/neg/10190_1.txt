Having looked at this in the MST3K episode, I have to wonder how many movies this movie came from. It seems to combine elements from Logan's Run, Farenheight 451, Final Sacrifice, and at least some others. At some point I really expected Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the director has any idea how many holes there are in the plot. For example, the fact that although there is no gas available, there are plenty of abandoned gas stations and the stations are close enough to each other to drive an F1 racing car across the country.
