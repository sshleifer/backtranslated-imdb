As I write this report in 2008, we have a remake culture. Movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic movies as they can, with thoroughly meaningless updates, including "King Kong," "The Wicker Man," and virtually every movie Michael Caine has ever seen. However, this lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, as "Dough for the Do-Do" proves. A wholly meaningless colored version of Bob Clampett's surreal masterpiece "Porky in Wackyland," "Dough for the Do-Do," sucks life from the original by splattering paint on Clampett's original material and adding lame new material that Friz Freleng overlooks has been. Freleng was a totally inappropriate director to manipulate Clampett's source material, though in reality no director could hope for Clampett's inspired madness. Inevitably, "Dough for the Do-Do" is nothing more than the rape of a classic with a terrible new title. For cartoon fans like me, this is a coloration of 'Casablanca'.
