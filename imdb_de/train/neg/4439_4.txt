Yikes That's pretty bad. The play is not great at first, and the decision to make it into the movie is no use - especially as Peploe does not decide how to handle the theatrical origins of the material (we occasionally get a glimpse of an observing theater audience, etc.). ) and decided to use a jumpy style of editing that keeps reminding you that you are watching a movie, while this is actually just to remind you that you are watching a very bad movie from an overburdened director their material. Mira Sorvino's central performance is staggeringly bad: stage and plush, it's as if she plays the role of Helena Bonham-Carter's Merchant Ivory oeuvre. Only Fiona Shaw delivers a remarkable performance - and it may be that she is best able to handle the material with her theatrical pedigree - but it is difficult to see a movie alone for a performance, even if that performance is so easy, truthful and honest is much like Shaw. Ben Kingsley turns on an average and detached lap, and Diana Riggs daughter Rachel Stirling plays her supporting role. Unfortunately, Bertolucci's magic has lost nothing of his wife, if this film should be the proof.
