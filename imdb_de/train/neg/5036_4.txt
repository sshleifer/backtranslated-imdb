SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Soto's Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee and Dana Kimmell It's a desert town and it does not take long for people to die around them , The detective needs to put the clues together with his good daughter Nancy Drew, who was played on Friday, the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The indigenous Native Americans are prime suspects as they seem to upset the prejudices of the city dwellers. All these events lead to the killer's unveiling at Melissa's 16th birthday party. <br /> <br /> This underperforming slasher is not overly memorable. It has a feel for television without much to play except for the title song's own shaky title track, which plays a few times throughout. Lines like "the killer turns us into coleslaw." Pair in standard 1980s Slasher scenarios. Marci calls Melissa a bad name and then somehow immediately develops into a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how difficult it is to adapt, because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This film would be hard to produce today as the main character is fifteen and the director inserts several free close-ups of her. The social commentary on the Indians was not sufficiently developed to be taken seriously. I'm too surprised at the pretty high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to honor the birthday party tradition from that time to create an intense succession of carnage, but I feel miserable. However, on the bright side, obscure films like this one are difficult to release on DVD, and others will follow.
