90 minutes Mindy ... Mindy is a friend of Bill ... Mindy tricks high school dance ... Mindy trudges to Big Sur, shoplifting "shepherd's bread", Mindy is almost raped .. Ah, the joys of the Drive International Features of Crown International. You must remember that these movies were never developed for DVD players. They were designed as a 90-minute setting, so that the teens of the 70s had a soundtrack when they recorded it in their pintos and citations. The lack of pace and structure was not of concern to the original audience - they probably did not get in until the screen conditions matched their expectations in the parking lot. The movie is really irritating when viewed as a story. It's much more fun to talk about than to look at. My favorite pastimes: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy. Without changing luggage or underwear, they spend two nights in a motel room with the teacher, just like in real life. 2) After being abducted by rogue bikers and nearly raped, and after her innocent friend "Pan" was brutally beaten, Mindy and her friend find an unattended motorcycle in the street. Mindy gets brighter and chirps: "I'm going to Big Sur !!" But even here it is much more fun to talk about it than to read.
