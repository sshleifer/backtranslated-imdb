I was only able to join the first 20 minutes of this low budget movie. The most blatant absurdity was that the American prisoners in a North Korean POW camp allegedly all suffered from severe food and drug shortages, did not go swimming, shivering in threadbare and dirty parkas and sleeping on bare floors and - let's not forget torture - they succeed always to wear perfectly styled hair. Apart from a correspondingly strict-looking Harry Morgan as army major, casting and acting are simply awful. Ronald Regan does not seem to cling to depicting a single character, but creates a rather schizophrenic blend of previous roles. Although a predominantly Caucasian occupation, which shows the North Korean camp officers, was pardonable, but allegedly Russian officers who act as advisors to the Koreans, stumble around and wear newly dressed Nazi uniforms, complete with riding breeches and ankle boots (obvious costume sections from the Second World War ), and to speak of accents like General Burkhalter of Hogans Heroes, these are just six kinds of fools. Do not waste your time with it.
