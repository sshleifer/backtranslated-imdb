This was one of the worst movies ever. When Kate shows up and Jed is with some guys, they all clap ... like Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate ran her hands over the sidewalk, it seemed she was examining the texture of the sidewalk. Andie's acting is so bad in this movie - I could not connect with them or feel in love with them. The other two women, however, were very good and shaded Andie. Anyway, that was such a tough movie. I usually like these kinds of movies, but I just could not get used to this movie. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's acting did not help the movie. It's all gum too. Lancome has to make up with a spatula because it looks glamorous in the merchandise.
