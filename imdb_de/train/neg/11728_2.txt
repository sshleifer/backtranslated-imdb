I've already enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action movies and I expected a lot more, even if one does not entertain the movie from a 5.8 IMDb and although the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is unfortunately more unfortunate and goes after a "worst-case Scenario "where" strong "feelings are associated with bad action. Do not dare that this movie is not exactly entertaining, if you want it, even if your tears are cried because of seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action movie would-be comedy ... <br /> <br /> I give this 2/10 really terrible, if you want to watch a decent movie, go to the shooter or hire him, all his good things This movie is not.
