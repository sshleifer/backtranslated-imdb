> You are warned that this is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. great direction the shots were well thought out. the actors were very good, especially richard pryor, i would have liked to see more of him. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classics. Dudley More God bless him could have done better. I would have liked to see John Ritter more of him. In my opinion, this failure is entirely due to the writer's failure. Maybe the producer could have pulled the plug as soon as he saw what he had created. It is just too bad that so much money flowed into this cauldron when, with a small change, it would be repaired here and there in my opinion. To make a giggle.
