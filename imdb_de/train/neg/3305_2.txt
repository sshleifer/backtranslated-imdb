I absolutely do not understand what's funny in this movie. The humor seems to be for corpses. It is slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not bring much sympathy, some unimportant characters aside. Nothing surprising happens. What did the authors of this script think? "Oooo funny! Let's make an old lady high in the pot! Let's giggle her ... Let's ... behave like little kids !! Oooo, yes, that's absolutely brilliant and original!" <br /> <This movie has irritated me the most about all the movies I have seen in the last five years.
