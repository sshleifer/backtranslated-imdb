Celia Johnson is good as a nurse. Michael Hordern is good as a capulet, though it is his usual neighing and weighing and no stain on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse well as Friar Laurence, though he never takes it anywhere. Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt, in the first of his "Yuk" roles that would make him famous. Christopher Straulis Benvolio is sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The sets are pretty, if not stunning, like other BBC Shakespeare's. <br /> <br /> And that's it. The rest is weak to terrible. Rebecca Saire was 15 years old during production and has no idea how to behave. She opens her eyes wide and wails each line in the same way. Patrick Ryecart is poorly attuned to her and his self esteem is inexplicable. The balcony scene runs smoothly and without any emotional or erotic effect. Her death is a relief. If I had a dagger, I would have offered it to them hours before. <br/> Anthony Andrews is unspeakable as Mercutio, a great shock to remember his good work in "Brideshead Revisited". He breaks the mirror of Shakespeare's verse into a thousand shards of two or three words each, and calls the fragments as incoherent and incomprehensible as possible. In this production Queen Mab renounces. Dreadful. <br /> <br /> The director Alvin Rakoff just shows a temporary gift to place the camera where it shows us what we want to see. The opening brawl is noticeably incoherent. However, there is humor when Romeo Tybalt apparently holds directly in the cobbler in a later fight. Tybalt then grabs the offended region. But did it come through? <br /> <br /> R & J is a long way. This version is not recommended for use in the classroom.
