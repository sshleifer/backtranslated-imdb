National Treasure is as good as overvalued and hyped. Nicholas Cage is by no means a credible action hero and this movie is not an "Indiana Jones". People who have compared this movie to Indian Jones' classic Indian trilogy have fallen seriously from their rocker. <br /> <br /> I can not really figure out what kind of target this movie really wanted. Maybe the younger crowd will like it, but I thought it was ridiculous. I also can not imagine that adults or young adults find this great for a movie. Simply put, it's okay. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is unimagined and uninspired, borrowing what he has from The Da Vinci Code. I would recommend to wait for the release of this movie in 2006 and pass on this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​being able to steal the Declaration of Independence so easily and running all over Washington DC and Philadelphia With him (without damaging it once), fight against the "bad guys" and experience what "non-stop action" is absurd. I was particularly fond of the scene where the declaration folded in the tube lay in the middle of a busy street as cars whizzed through them without damaging them. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> Reminded me of this episode of "Brady Bunch," where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. Besides, this episode of Brady Bunch was a lot better than this whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such a big treasure that nobody believes is buried in a secret US ruin is alien. Literally, there are thousands of undiscovered "priceless" items in this treasure chest. Yes exactly!! Ridiculous!! <br /> <br /> Worse, the speed and accuracy with which Cage finds out what "hard" clues to these ancient puzzles should be, are unimaginable !!! Oh, the humanity! <br /> <br /> The performances of Cage, Voight and the other actors in "National Treasure" are as stiff, wooden and flat as they come. However, if you work with such lousy dialogues, it's hard to fault the actor's 100% guilt. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is an okay-looking movie. I can not recommend it beyond that and would definitely NOT buy it over the top, fancy scavenger hunt of a mess. <br /> <br /> Rent it when you first have to see it .......
