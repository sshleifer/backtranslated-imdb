I have nothing more to say, but it was terrible. I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this humiliating mess. And if certain actors do not want people to question their sexuality, maybe they should not make those movies anymore. There was at least one that made me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER thinking what was going on was cut out of the movie. SHUDDER, to wonder what went through the minds of the actors. Shuddering to think about the train of thought and voyeurism that took place in the minds of the directors. As I said, it's a humiliating confusion. It is not even funny. As Ebert said about the movie Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, not a good story and not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
