This is another typical, unbelievable and nonsensical piece of Hollywood dirt. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, as Snake Pliskin in a business suit, convinces me that he was a better 2nd baseman. Ray Liotta as a psychotic policeman is completely predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her ordinary cardboard self and does little to be a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable right up to the end when Kurt Ray taps him down and out with a vase or something. Kurt and Madeline then make their obligatory hug at the end of the film and ALL - except Russell and Stowe, KNOW that Liotta gets up and threatens the pair again. He does it of course, and Russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm, which was totally unnecessary. This movie might as well end with the bloody scene: EXCEPT Hollywood writes about unnecessary violence and the more they add or "improve", the more slavery they get.
