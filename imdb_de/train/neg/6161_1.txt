This is possibly the worst fencing, sword fighting, movie ever made. This is not only because the so-called sports fencing is bad, but also because the plot is so weak that they have to insert a semi-nude sex scene and later allegedly tried group dance around a fencing in the fencing club I suppose to maintain the interest of the audience. What a waste of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're better served with washed-out, confusing films like Zorro, Scaramouche, and everything that Basil Rathbone has as a villain. As a fencer myself, I recognize the near-impossible possibility of capturing fencing as a sport in the film, but if it ever happens, it must be fresher, better-drawn characters, and a plot with more depth.
