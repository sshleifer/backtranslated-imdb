The thing is terrible. The Ben Affleck character is selfish and joyously sadistic - Piss-in-the-nose-fratboy-sadist. And he is the romantic HERO! His cartoon does not change from start to finish, but his money ultimately allows him to buy happiness. If I was a socialist, I would believe unbelievably, but I'm not a socialist We capitalists sometimes like a little Christmas magic. This is not magic. I do not know what it is. It's just awful. And it's a terrible talent waste. O'Hara has been making me laugh hysterically since the late '70s. Gandolfini Applegies. These people were all little used. If Ben was not able, those people might have come up with something great.
