I like musicals, but as a Dickens fan I hate this one. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse? The poor of London come to sing? Fagin and Dodger go into the sunset? Not exactly faithful to the novel. As I recall, Dodger was hanged publicly and Fagin went crazy in jail. ** END OF SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes and does not do much more than growl to point out his evil. However, the worst is Mark Lester as Oliver, who is often so awkward and passive in coming to see if you are really the main character. His portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best she can do when singing is the voice of a girl. Presumably, they did not realize that boy-heights can be found in almost every church in England. <br /> <br /> Dickens fans who respect themselves: stick to David Lean's amazing 1948 movie or the BBC's 6-hour mid-80s adaptation Avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical.
