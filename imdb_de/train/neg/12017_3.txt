I'm a big fan of Ludlum's work and the Covert One books, and I've often thought how unbelievable they would turn into a movie. Imagine my excitement when I learned that such a movie actually existed! The 'Hades Factor', the first in the series, seemed to be an obvious starting point. <br /> <br /> The movie was disappointing from the start. Simple elements of the film, such as Griffin's first meeting with Smith, are unnecessarily different from the book and less exciting. Some characters are also poorly staffed. For starters Dorff is sad as Smith. Not a bad actor, just an unbelievably bad choice, as he is way too soft and does not have many of the features critical to John Smith. <br /> <br /> Renaming, reassignment and even omission certain characters further worsen this movie. For example, the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire backstory of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM, make the whole point of the film a bit blurry. Marty Zellerbach is a very big part of the book, and in his seat he takes several back sessions (not to mention that the movie character has nothing in common with the character in the book) another big mistake <br /> Rachel Russel is supposed to be Randi Be Russel from the book. Not only should she be the sister of Sophie Amsden (should be called Sophia Russel), but she should also work from the CIA, NOT "Covert-One". Which brings me to my last point, and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE does not even exist at this time! Only in the second book of the series Covert-One is designed by the president as a preventive measure against further biological terrorism. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I could go on all day. In short, if you like the books and you want to see a good fit, you will be bitterly disappointed. Even as an action film, it is quite average, mainly due to very clean cut and bad effects. The awkward action and the boring water lotion are the last nails in the very cheap coffin of this movie.
