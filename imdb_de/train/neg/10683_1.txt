A guy is hit. In the distance, the other man shoots him. He has some bodyguards and they beat the killer, but a reporter is interested in it. She goes to the hospital where they brought the guy who was beaten. She goes in and takes a bodyguard into the corner, but he does not feel like talking. I can not understand why. It's not like someone else is interested. She is the only reporter there. However, her editor discourages her from working on this lame story. But she does it anyway. She goes to the sister and mother of the murderer. A few minutes after she leaves, they are totally screwed-someone blows her trailer-a huge fireball. Then she chooses the bodyguard from the hospital. She finds him hungry on his boat, but a minute later they both suck underwater and suck on a dip tank because three guys are trying to hit them (and blown up the boat - a huge fireball). The reporter and the bodyguard beat two of the guys trying to beat her. <br /> <br /> Over the next hour, another guy is hit across the street, there's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse, some chases of rubble and death, a fake suicide, etc., etc. Lotsa Stiffs, all kinds of carnage. <br /> <br /> Great stuff, but what the reporter and bodyguard can not understand is why was the original guy beaten? What is the motivation? Of course, it could help us figure out why the reporter is interested at all. By almost everything, she is the only reporter in history. Nobody else cares about the media. Not even with all the big fireballs and corpses. The original guy who was beaten was not exactly a celebrity. His job was a bit boring. He was just the president. Yes, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is an intelligence agent. <br /> <br /> Is this the spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After all, there are no television cameras, no other print reporters, no bloggers ... just another of those police crimes ... <br /> <br /> So, what's the spoiler? <br /> <br /> Lemme think ... <br /> <br /> No! Waiting! The spoiler is that his wife did it! Yes ... the first lady. She was convicted because the president was kidding. And she gets away with it. She is really hot, right? But how the hell could anyone ever find out? Why would someone bother? After all, only one reporter is interested. <br /> <br /> I give this train a "1". It was so stupid that I just had to keep watching. And it just got dumber! That's the real spoiler! But even though I told you, you have to see it to believe it!
