Almost a two-person game, and so the dialogue and the performance of the leads are important. Neither are particularly good. This might have been even stronger if it had first been designed as a two-person game and then incorporated into a movie. Anyway, a crazy vampire, who seems to be a bit autistic, gets enchanted into a movie stripper (as a result of too much porn in his crappy home). He wants her to tell him about the daylight. It would have been better to find somebody with a day job, or someone who is known for painting a picture with words like a poet, but then maybe they do not have a hot body. <br /> <br /> After bringing her whatever he wants (and he's not very good at it), he wants to feed her at 6 in the morning, after which the sun rises. A lot is done about this period, although he also says that he can go without feeding, it just makes him hungrier. In addition, he claims he can not let the stripper go because she knows about him, but he lets a number of other people go and learn what he is. There are many discrepancies. <br /> <br /> Why this vampire lives in a house that is so badly penned that the light of street lamps and neighboring buildings seems as if it were daytime, I'm not sure. With all the time in the world you would think he did a better job or repaired the place a bit. He is clearly not a rich vampire. <br /> <br /> This is supposedly a remake, and I'm curious about the original version of Dance of the Damned. Although directed by Katt Shea, and the other films she shot for Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were pretty bad.
