Since nothing was wrong with the actors, etc., writing for the episode is gone for this serial phantom or no phantom. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the Martian hunter. It's important to know that in the middle of the 6th series, no matter what, it's not true what's going on and really does not contribute to the story's story, except to meet the Martians again and waste 30 minutes by far a different case bad writing in the soap opera of Smallville. I really like the show, but mostly because of the cast and the three or so good episodes every year, but whoever is on the cast, working or working on the soaps, has to be canned. This was by far the worst. In the first 4 minutes, you know what's going on is a scam, and all that happens is a dream based on Clark's addition, evidently caused by a phantom zone character. I really need to create a villain who does the story continues this week. May may also have added another dying villain in the last episode of the Martian Human Hunter, who will let him fly away, or he tells Clark that he forgot his sunglasses to take a closer look at this episode and call it a day ,
