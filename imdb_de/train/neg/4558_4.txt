Honestly I was disappointed in "expiration date". Super smart title and interesting premise, but I do not think it was delivered. What was it? The desire of the main character to reconnect with his native roots? Or he was more likely to overcome his fear of death. But he was not founded as someone who lived his life in fear - it seems his life is going well, but since the day of his downfall he should be worried now. I did not buy it. In the meantime, the secondary characters of the film had no needs that mingled with a cross-cutting story. They just did their thing and ran parallel to the main character. What was treated as a "curse" looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? After all, why did not he intend to stay in his flat all day on his birthday? These are my points of criticism, but I loved the recordings of Seattle, the cinematography was beautiful, and the acting was good in times when it was not outstanding.
