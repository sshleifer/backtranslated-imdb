A very "straight" nice old lady, desperately looking for money to save her house and her property, grows up in her house "pot", smokes it with some old friends and then sells it. This is the story of this unremarkable comedy, which highlights the absurdity of the situation and the humor it brings. It works for most of the movie. The humor is not the exuberant variety, but you will be entertained for an hour and a half, so I think it serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> There are fun moments and Brenda Blethyn is having fun in the lead role. But the end has really ruined a "cute" movie with insulting bad messages that only the ultra-liberals want to get past the movie world. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I would prefer a happy ending. too, but it should not all be warm and fuzzy for those who obviously break the law. Again, there are the typical (1) illegitimate children, but that is not a problem and is considered ok. (2) clerics as morally weak people; and (3) even a doctor who is also stoned! <br /> <br /> Hello? And critics here blast Hollywood? This is Exhibit A, as a secular society has generally lowered standards in the UK and Europe. Hey, guys: At least a trace of morality instead of nothing but a Timothy Leary "If it feels good, do it."
