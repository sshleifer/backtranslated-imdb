First of all, I would like to add that I myself am a certain historian. What I am looking for in a movie based on historical events is that it is actually based on historical facts. However, this is not the case here. Sure, the movie is entertaining and anything but the fact that it's not based entirely on true facts is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for Jews before the First World War. However, it was during the First World War and after that he formulated his views on the Jews. His education in this film is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child was not a disturbed little brat. He had a more or less normal education. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important parts that contribute to Hitler's puzzles. Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but he does not really fit in the role of Hitler. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he is portrayed here. At a young age he was a charismatic person who "manipulated" people through his charms. His unstable demeanor and outbursts of anger began at the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a film about Hitler's life, based on real historical facts and not allegations. I really hate when people use blaming, for example, to point to Hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as a pure evil. It's much better to tell the story exactly as it was so everyone can learn what it was like! Those who are behind this film should have done some research before. Because it looks like they do not even know what really happened. During the revolutionary march in Munch Hitler was not even shot, his shoulder was torn from the socket. <br /> <br /> It gives you more than just a good documentation.
