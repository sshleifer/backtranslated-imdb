The French film "Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte" by the iconoclast filmmaker Philippe Harel is based on the eponymous book by the controversial writer Michel Houellebecq. He also worked on the scenario of this film. After the British cinema magazine Sight Sound is also known as "Whatever". This movie was hailed as fresh air for French cinema because of its not-so-common subject of sexual politics and its impact on two stupid information technology workers. The film is confused by its far too obvious voice, about which we get acquainted with the main character. This gives viewers the feeling that we are looking at a book that is read to them. The basic premise for loneliness-related chronic sexual drought issues is fine, but the movie gets out of control as soon as the hero tells the misery he and his friend are facing. Instead of sticking to its main theme, the film turns in other directions to its downfall. Crockery: Some female viewers may not only find the movie, but even their two heroes as idiotic misogynists.
