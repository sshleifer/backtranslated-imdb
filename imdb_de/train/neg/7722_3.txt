Extremely weak action movie with the ever-wooden Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee trapped in a role as a sidekick that never seems to work. The action is average at best, a bit of nudity has moved in and yes, Tia Carrera uses a body double! <br /> <br /> The setup is the usual Renegade cop forced to break a new partner in a big case. The makers at least try to give the formula a twist, which makes Lundgren a policeman with oriental values ​​and Lee the Modern city is slimmer, but there are no character traits, which makes it almost weird. Lundgren's oriental warrior outfit for the big showdown has to be believed. The action sequences are from the numbers and Lee (who would make the excellent The Crow) will never have the opportunity to show any special martial arts brilliance. But with his illustrious ancestry, he was under tremendous pressure and far better off not having to do his father justice, taking on a very different role in The Crow, where he had become a unique actor. If not for his tragic and early death. <br /> <br /> If you are not a hardcore Lundgren fan or a fan of 1980s-style action movies (Cobra, etc.), you should avoid this. <br /> <br /> Arm 3/10
