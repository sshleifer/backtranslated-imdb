This movie was a big disappointment for me. I had been waiting for years for this movie to come out, and I was a staunch supporter of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. Not only did they cut out half of the story, they also changed the information. The statement that Lucifer is the father of hope is untrue. He has corrupted her father, but he himself is not her father. Nor did the voices match the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your head can never be returned. I can not even remember everything that was wrong with this movie. If you love Lady Death, do not watch this movie. It just did not look weird !!
