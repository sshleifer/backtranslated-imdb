I had high hopes in this movie. I found the premise interesting. I kept it up, though I found the acting as Helena Bonham Carter inconspicuous. I always hoped that my time would pay off, but in the end I wondered why they had ever bothered to do this thing. There may be a message in George Orwell's version worth communicating. When this film has achieved anything, it has inspired me to read Orwell's classics. It's hard to believe that his story could be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the filmmaker's message is, "Worldly life is worth living," then it will be successful. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Wasted 101 minutes of my life.
