If you want to watch a good movie about how women can defend themselves against sexual assault, this movie is not the movie you want to watch. It was a social commentary about a woman who became a victim and resisted. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the attacker over. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to vigilance. It essentially destroys the justice system. The movie "The Accused" was a much better movie because the victim uses and wins the justice system. What does "descent" do to the victims of abuse, that they should resort to violence? Is the victim better than the prosecutor? No!!!
