While the original classic of exploitation is not pleasing on any level when it comes to guys turning cats into human carnivorous monsters because the cat food they make is made with humans, it's restored with additional scifi elements , The cats can not get enough, and when the meat-contaminated food runs out, the cats turn to their owners. Badly put together on almost every level, this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that was actually played in cinemas in the early 1970s, where alien cats and dog breeds fought for supremacy. Director Ted Mikel is a hack, but such a lovely person (I like the guy in general, thanks to his smile, which triggers interviews and commentary tracks) that you can pretty much excuse the garbage he's found most of the time. Mikels wanted to make movies and did not care how they evolved as long as he produced something. More power for him, but I wish he would not give us his home videos
