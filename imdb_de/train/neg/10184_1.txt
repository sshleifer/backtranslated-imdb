I've heard about this little movie for months and now I've seen it. I think it's sweet, cute, how many young directors make films that combine other people's creative ideas to make their own joke premise of a movie. Troops, Swingblade, one of the millions of Blair Witch parodies comes to my mind. If these directors just want to have a foot in Hollywood's door, then they're doing the right thing and they should go on, because the interplay of plot sketches is the way Hollywood makes movies. How often have you heard the phrase "It's Animal Shed Meets Back to the Future"? "It's Wall Street meets Dead Poet's Society"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember that independent films were original and daring, not sure and predictable.
