What a weekend. Two days ago I saw the first half of "War Games 2: Dead Code", now "While she was on the way". I try to make a decision that was inferior in regard to the pain in my thoughts while looking at. I think, "while she was traveling" was worse. <br /> <br /> In other comments everything was said before: unrealistic, illogical, etc. - the only thing I really need to add is that at some point I felt more for the bad guys than for the wife because I loved them recommended for a Darwin Prize if she had actually died (only first half looked, I do not know). Soon I was at two Darwin Awards (if at all possible) for her immense stupidity. <br /> <br /> And, hey: Produced by Kim Basinger? Not only did she know the script, but she was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us, the human being. I look at people who waste a lot of money to be angry because the money could be used to feed and dress some people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the movies and 20 percent, the idiots are good times to show how much of an idiot they are.
