Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii ... full of clich√©s, very predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. With nothing better to do, it offers 40 minutes of simple, unpretentious entertainment, endless views of great male and female muscles, and a very good photograph of Hawaii's spectacular scenery. On the other hand, if you're looking for something more than that, stay away ... Oh, and by the way, if you've ever worked in a hotel or know anything about running, you have two options: 1. You will feel sick every two minutes when the Show Hotel Business in stupidity and stupidity presents it!
