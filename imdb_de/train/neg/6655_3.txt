The only redeeming quality of this extra-long melodrama is the landscape of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the theme song. Stephanie Powers is wrong and is betrayed with a false accent. As mentioned earlier, is she too old to play an 18-year-old, and does she look far too young to be a grandmother with a college-aged granddaughter? Lee Remick is good, although she is timeless in her later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is under-utilized and looks eternally young when her son (Robert Urich) middle-aged finally marries grandmother Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's relentless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. You do not know how a viewer could relate to his exaggerated portrayal? Most credible is Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like Rangamateurs. It hurts the credibility that the handsome male contenders in this epic always remain alone, patiently waiting for the theme of their affection to finally approve. Can anyone believe that the handsome Robert Urich would be left alone for decades until Stephanie Powers finally accepted his endless marriage proposals? The commitment of the Second World War between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is ridiculous. First, the Germans occupied the French provincial department late in the war, it was controlled by the French Vichy puppet government. We see the French Resistance staging a day robbery at Mistral's Mansion to steal plates, whereupon they are under a bridge, waiting for a lumbering load of Nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them? If you want to see a well-functioning miniseries in a foreign country, do not look at Mistral's daughter. A far better alternative would be The Thorn Birds.
