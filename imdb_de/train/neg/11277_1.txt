There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast, but unfortunately that does not help with the film's main drawbacks. I never understand why directors ask actors to use accents that are not their own, when it's obvious to everyone that they can not convince. Fiennes just can not speak Irish and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. If the voice is wrong, the character, no matter how good the play, will never convince. As for the main problem .... the plot .... was there one? I suppose it was some sort of story, but it was so full of holes that I just could not wait for the end of the movie ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and do not watch this movie!
