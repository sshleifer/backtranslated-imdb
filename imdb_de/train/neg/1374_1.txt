Man, that was weird. It should be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. It would have made it clear what a heap of stink made this much easier. Serious? I want everyone to be associated with this film and take effect immediately. For those who are thinking of watching this "movie", we go through some action points. Oh, wait a minute. There is none. There is literally no action. I think Casper Van Dien was bored, and he decided to film something with some random people. This movie is literally the worst movie ever. Do not believe me. Look at it. Do it, man. I dare you. But be ready to tear your eyes out. If you can stand this without blowing a cow, you are very strong and courageous.
