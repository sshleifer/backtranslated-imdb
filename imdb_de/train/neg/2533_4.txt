I agree with most, if not all, of the previous commentator's toms (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great swordplay and suspense. <br /> <br /> I saw Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe 14 has not yet been released in Zone 1 (USA). Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing. The plot was complicated and seemed to be a mixture of many previous Zatoichi actions. At some point, I wondered if I did not see a remake of a previous Zatoichi movie. This film was disappointing because it began to become dependent on effects (a head roll, limbs, blood) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character. All previous films were successful due to the action and the action and have gained a large fan base without having to resort to effects. <br /> <br /> I just hope that the other Zatoichi movies NOT follow the same trend. This is the first Zatoichi movie from his studio. I highly recommend all previous Zatoichi films - and recommend them.
