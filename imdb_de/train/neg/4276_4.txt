This overrated, short-lived series (only two seasons) is as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar. I'm not quite sure what they mean by "groundbreaking" and "original" when they play Lynch and his stupid little TV opus. What exactly are your criteria for the original? Sure, compared to the "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues," it's the original. Certainly. Besides "Law & Order", TP spits originality left and right. <br /> <br /> Fans of TP often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers were not smart enough, open enough for the supposed "oddity" of the show, "its supposed wild ingenuity or whatever. As a fan of craziness, I have to correct this misunderstanding.There is nothing unusual about TP: It is a merely observable, rather stupid, whodunit that walks around in a circle, spinning nets in each corner, but (or perhaps because of that) ultimately, going nowhere Madness is always enforced, the characters do not behave as strangely as they behave in an IDIOTIC way half the time, there is a difference ... <br /> <br /> Whenever I look at the sequence "Weird Dream" in "Living In Oblivion," in which the dwarf criticizes the director (Buscemi) for succumbing to the tired old let-use-a-midget-in-a-dream-scene clich√©, I think of Lynch Wanna be funny? "Erase rhead "is weird - in fact it's more than funny, basically abstract. You want a unique TV show? Watch "The Prisoner". You want a strange-looking cast? This is what Felinis and Leone offer films. TP looks like an alien TV crime thriller in which all young people look like models. The casting gives TP a sculptural look. Kens & Barbies en masse. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of the TP manufacturers said Lynch was looking for "unique faces" for the series. Unique faces? As with Lara Flynn Boyle? Sheryl Fenns? Like these darn "guys" directly from the catalogs (or gay magazines) of men? Do not get me wrong; There is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like Fenn (as Madonna would look if she were 1000 times prettier), but then you should not say that you are doing a "weird show with strange-looking people And I never understood Lynch's misleading fascination for Kyle MacLachlan (I should get a medal if I bothered to spell his name properly) .He is not unlikely, but he lacks the charisma to go with it The ridiculous "eccentricities" of his character were not at all interesting, just one of Lynch's many attempts to force the craziness, and tried to live up to his reputation - he had completely lost his edge at that time Lynch made "Elephant Man" was very subordinate to his first two films, which resulted in mediocre efforts that were often on L Ynch's relatively small but fanatical fan base helped to keep him in public by interpreting meanings in his poorly composed stories that, on closer inspection, contain no water. In other words, Lynch is the darling of every intellectual wannabe. <br /> <br /> So Laura Palmer was killed by her father ...? He was obsessed with the devil or such nonsense. That's the best thing that "great mind" could come up with ... They have B-movie horror movies that end up with more originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch is neither smart nor hardworking enough to tell a terrific story. <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and look at my "TV Device: 150 Worst Cases Of Nepotism" list.
