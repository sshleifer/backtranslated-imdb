This movie proves that you can not judge a movie by the impressive artwork on the DVD cover. It also shows that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it (or get it for somebody at Christmas). The beginning of this movie really looks promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old guy from below) gets the college to publish a book of witch spells he leaves in his annual haunted house (where the movie takes place). Then there is drinking, fighting and softcore porn. Then the action follows after more than an hour. <br/> <br /> Hallow's End was predictable, meaningless and reminiscent of a softcore porno. This movie is probably best seen with a group of friends who have nothing better to do, as it is a good movie to make fun of. And for first-time visitors, it's really fun to make predictions about the order of people dying.
