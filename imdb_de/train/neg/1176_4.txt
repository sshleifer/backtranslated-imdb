Revolutions always provide opportunities for dramatic films, as most revolutions are themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, what this film lacks in dramas is offset by an overabundance of boredom. You do not care who wins, loses, dies or lives - finish it as fast as you can. This is largely due to the seemingly superficial application of background technology. Scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality. You could better be done on a bare stage and stay that way. The amazing effects of "The House of the Flying Daggers" or "The Golden Compass" can not be expected, but this is a 2002 digitally mastered production. Characters seem to enter a scene to enter a scene, so much so that one no longer counts how many times the character enters and leaves the room. In my view, this film transforms the French Revolution of the 1790s into the papier mache revolution of a paper-collector world.
