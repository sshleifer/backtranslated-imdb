One of Boris Karloff's real clinkers. Basically, the dying Karloff (who looked about 120 years older than he was) is a scientist who needs money to finish his experiments before he dies. After moving from Morocco, where his money is taken over by someone else, he goes to southern France, where he works as a doctor and tries to waste enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for money, he makes a deal with the young, wealthy wife of a cotton baron who is dying. She will finance him if he helps her husband poison the man so that she can take his money and continue with a gigolo (whom I consider married). If you think I got misunderstood by watching the movie, I had to read what other people wrote to find out what happened. Why? I had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and several converging plotting lines. Little is said and much is said towards the end, until I really did not care. It is a boring mess of interest only for Karloff's performance, which is sometimes quite strange. To be honest, it's the only time I've seen him in the bizarre Bela Lugosi territory. It's not every scene, but a few, and I wonder how much they've hung up.
