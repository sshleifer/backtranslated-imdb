This is a badly made, bad remake of Bimalda's classic Parineeta. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's eponymous book and is a distortion of the original. Well, you can appreciate a certain amount of creativity, but not fake creativity. The spectacle of everyone is affected and the entire movie is a farce. Shekars father's choice in the abuse of Lolita (Balan) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scene in which Shekhar (Saif) beats Lolita is pretty out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters, quite upsetting to the senses, and could easily be avoided. Likewise, the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite unpleasant for the movie and a cheap trick to attract the audience. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its mind, the work falls apart. The song "Piyu Bole" is fine. Another silver stroke in the dark cloud of this film is the scene in which Saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and worthy of recognition. In this regard, this movie deserves 3 stars. The song and the dance of Rekha smell of craftsmanship and it is a dressing. The song is melodic, but I remember hearing it somewhere before, and if I'm not mistaken, the tune seems to have been plagiarized. <br /> <br /> Well, we all agree that the times of that time have changed so far. But then this movie does not even reflect modern times. <br /> <br /> This happens when modern Bollywood filmmakers are increasingly obsessed with impressing the NRIs and snatching up the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such films do not belong to India or any other part of the world.
