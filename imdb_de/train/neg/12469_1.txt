Rarely do I give up a movie without seeing the whole show. This is especially true if I borrowed it on DVD. Syriana was one in which I gave up. Half way I turned it off with bored disgust. <br /> <br /> This film is incoherent, boring, confusing and dull. The acting was dry and without credible representations. The general conspiracy was good, but it developed so boringly that it did not catch my attention or interest. The multiple sub-sites often could not connect with each other and seemed more like random stories than a truly interrelated plot. Too bad that such a serious topic and such great actors could make such a flop. I can not imagine that this film will get any nominations, let alone an award.
