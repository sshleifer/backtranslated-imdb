These reviews, which claim that this film is so bad that it is good, go overboard with this film. This movie does not have the guilty pleasure that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. These films were entertaining in their fearlessness, but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad that it's so painful. I have not been in such great pain since seeing Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before I start the review, I want to tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million bust that The New Line Cinema did not want to air. They reduce the losses when they are sent directly to video, making it the most expensive direct video for decades. Whoopi gave in after a huge paycheck to be in that disaster. Plot: A millionaire clones dinosaurs so that he can fire rockets at the sun that would kill humanity and start a new ice age. A policewoman named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly team up to stop him after a buddy dies. <br /> <br /> The plot is given to you at the beginning of the movie, which robs her of all his mystery movie. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is really pretty awful. Whoopi looks excited and tries to boost her performance, but to no avail. Theodore Rex is annoying and after five minutes on the screen he is quite grumpy. Most jokes revolve around him, threatening to bite people and hit people with his tail (accidentally and deliberately). I thought the burglar had been bad, but Theodore Rex was a backseat: the worst film of Whoopi's career. <br /> <br /> Do not let it be said that this monstrosity is bad enough to have fun. I did not see that when I saw this movie. All I saw was a train crash written by people who must have had a sick admiration for Howard The Duck. The humor is at this level and Theodore Rex looks like Barney's inbred cousin. Extremely painful from beginning to end.
