I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. When I finally saw him as the star of a new movie, I was happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I was in college looking at film appreciation and the only thing I can not say was that I did not like the movie being shot in a deserted part of town and there was no background traffic or Lookie-Loos gave. <br /> <br /> I have to say that acting leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor. I have to chalk in lousy direction and the supportive cast leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vosloo and he made the movie visible. Otherwise, I would have written it off as another bad movie. <br /> <br /> I thought the rape scene was brutal and unnecessary, but the actors who came out of it were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shooting were pretty bad. There are some disruptions in the film (continuity) that are overlooked given the film's low caliber. <br /> <br /> All in all, I liked the movie because Arnold Vosloo was there. <br /> <br /> Jackie
