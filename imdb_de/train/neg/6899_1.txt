Wondering why the Pacific islanders automatically seem to adopt the humor of black Americans? regardless of their ethnic origin? Well, this movie will not answer this much-discussed question - but it will provide an excellent case study. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this film has been acting as a kind of "old school" for Pacific Island New Zealanders, which immediately raises the question of what exactly the purpose of such a task is. Is it meant to perpetuate deep-rooted stereotypes of Pacific Island New Zealanders? or should this potential market be used? The story is weak, witless funny and the end is expected. This film has not done anything for New Zealand cinema, as it is just a appropriated romantic comedy that has no merit.
