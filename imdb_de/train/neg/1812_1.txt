Go ahead and borrow this movie. It's on a local shelf in your local video store and is covered in dust. Nobody will have touched it for years. It may even be a $ .50 special! It's worth ten dollars, I swear it! Buy it! There are not many comparable films - the celluloid version of this putty that forms at the end of a garbage bin after a few years. Yes, I gave him a '1', but it really does earn a lot less. 1-10 scales were not designed for such things.
