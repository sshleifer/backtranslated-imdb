The Wayward Cloud is a frustrating movie. Enigmatically puzzling, he treats every shot like a work of art. They feel that the composition of each shot has been designed and prepared with a certain amount of care bordering on obsession. The expression of the progress of cinema since the first films were filmed in the 19th century and imitate their construction, the camera hardly moves here? apart from the warehouse and colorful music numbers. Ambient noise is reduced to a minimum and hardly a word is spoken. This inquisitive but effective device forces the audience to focus their attention solely on visual stimuli, so that even if the story moves at a snail's pace, we immerse ourselves in it. Unfortunately, this immersion begins sometime around the hour to solve. I felt as though the film challenged me to keep looking as it got harder as the minutes dragged on, turning mere looking into a struggle of will. <br /> <br /> If the content of this movie was not as sexual as it is, it would undoubtedly have been even darker for the Western public. There is a plethora of female nudity and sexual abuse of an unconscious (or possibly dead) woman so repulsive that she speaks volumes about the humiliation that pornography exposes to both men and women (the users) and the used ones ) it is so overzealous in the way in which it decides to present its position in such a way that it effectively becomes ineffective. Of course, the worst and most enthusiastic participants in the explosion of available pornographic content are looking for this film for all the wrong reasons and looking at it with the sticky finger on the remote control's fast-forward button. <br /> <br /> With all its problems, the movie is definitely a steward, and the more you think about it, the more meaningful it seems to be. Ironically, for a movie where so little happens, the viewer would likely be proportionally rewarded by a second or even third time. But once enough for me?
