Probably someone has heard of Alberto Tomba. A former police officer, a former Sky Champion and now a terrible actor. "Alex L'Ariete" was supposed to be a "mini-series" on television, but Italian television declined to show the film on its channels. Now it's a ridiculous movie. The script is just funny (it's supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like a five-year child labor. But what really blows you away is the amateurish drama: Alberto Tomba, who was not credible even as a cop, terribly plays a totally dumb character: an Italian Special Operations officer specializing in opening doors! ("ariete" is "ram"). This super guy will try to save a young nice girl life (a real Italian "little" TV showgirl, married to the singer Eros Ramazzotti): nice, but totally incompetent in acting. Lose them and do yourself a favor. A film that is a shame for the Italian cinema industry: Only John Travolta in Earth Attack came closer.
