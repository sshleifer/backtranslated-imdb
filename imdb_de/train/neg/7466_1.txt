Impressive. Some movies just leave me speechless. This was undoubtedly one of those films. When I left the theater, not a single word came to my mouth. All I had was the incredible urge to hit my head against the theater wall so I could forget the last hour and a half. Unfortunately it did not work. Honestly, this movie has nothing to recommend. The humor was in first grade, at best stupid, and the plot was astronomically far-fetched. I've decided to never see another movie with Chris Kattan or any other actor from SNL.
