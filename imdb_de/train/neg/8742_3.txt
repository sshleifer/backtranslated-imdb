After seeing the trailer for this movie in the movies, I thought it was an original concept for a thriller that would put him in the competitive world of computer companies. The All Star Cast was another message that this movie would probably be good. But when I did not watch it in the first week of release, it disappeared in the second week. I was afraid something was missing. Patiently, I waited for the DVD release and then bought it home to enjoy a nice evening. The anticipation on the way home was far better than the movie. For one, the direction is appalling. There is no thought and the director only makes up a part of himself so that he can participate in the film. I would not hurry him in the future. Second, the main role as Ryan Phillipe is completely wrong. Phillipe is usually the cool character as in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun, but in this he's supposed to be a limping hero he tries to portray by slipping while running and geeky friends, but he just does not look right. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani, do not have enough to offer, but when they do, none of their accomplishments are close to their best. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been made for him, and it is his fiery temper and his mysterious way of pulling the movie with him. The last point is that this movie is another one that fills the trailer with scenes that you do not see in the movie, and is instead only included in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. The disappointment is even greater, for although some of these scenes are gross, they fill important gaps in the story.
