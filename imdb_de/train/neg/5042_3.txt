The main complaint with this film is the fact that I can NOT say who is who. No racism is intended, but these Asians all look the same! I can tell you something about the story, but the hell it works. The identities of people are no secret, if they were a secret I would be interested in them. Instead, I was not on the screen as fast as possible. <br /> <br /> Tons of wide shots and quiet, emotionless faces occupy this movie. Heck it is boring, not only do I not know these people, but they just sit there. <br /> <br /> The production is a typical Chinese John Woo, a horrible video with spotty scenes. That just looks a little better than Andy Lau's "Fulltime Killer" (which was a great movie). With a decent budget, you might think they look at least the Hollywood of the 90s. I did not know that the Chinese had these art house beatniks.
