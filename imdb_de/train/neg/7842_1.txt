Accidentally caught on a TV. show - and could hardly believe how terrible the whole experience was. In comparison, the original "A Man Called Horse" was literally binding because it had all the interest. But this nonsense fails me. It was bad enough to have a sort of "story" with all the effects of a wet loaf of bread presented, but this error was compounded by the apparent lack of subtitles whenever the so-called "Sioux" spoke. For God's sake, would not the filmmakers have found enough North American Indians who were also actors and close actors to act as "Indians" in this Farrago, rather than the cheaters who actually used them? I also found it rather embarrassing how Richard Harris sailed around the country when the director stood directly behind the camera and told him to run and jump from pointless point A to pointless point B just to make footage and minutes. Absolutely terrible in every way!
