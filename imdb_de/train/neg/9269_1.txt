Well, since I saw Part 1 through 3, I can honestly say that they should NEVER have done Part 4. Everything from the wobbly, and I get my tacky score to the really bad acting mind. <br /> <br /> I mean, parts 1 to 3 kept the mood on the Damion story strong, but without him in this part it just is not the same thing. At the end of Part 3, I was a bit tired from continuing the storyline, but at the end of the third, it was a good ending. Again, there was no reason for Part 4. Even if there could have been one, they could have done a much better job than what I had to go through, lol. I will never see one and a half hours of my life again.
