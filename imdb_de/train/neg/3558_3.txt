Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John WATCHER IN THE WOODS Hough bust has little to offer. <br /> <br /> Although there is no shortage of bloody violence, there is a lack of narrative sensitivity and "characters". <br /> <br /> The Incubus of the title is a demon equipped with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into the vagina during sexual intercourse - or, more accurately, rape. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes, who has gone moonlighting from his successful directing career, is convinced that he is a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> The dreadful possibilities of victims producing demonic offspring are not taken into account - nor is the audience's tolerance for slow garbage. <br /> <br /> The script's refusal to explore the dramatic effects of a fertile environment illustrates the main problems of this vicious Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise.
