Wow and I thought that every Steven Segal movie was bad. Every time I thought the movie could not get any worse, it turned out to be wrong. The story was good, but the actors could not take it. In addition, they made many mistakes in the proper archaeological excavation. For example, you treat artifacts only when they are cataloged and billed. The biggest crime in the casting was the archiologist. She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic than it already was. The whole idea that the Knights Templar were underground all those years seemed pretty stupid to me. I like the idea of ​​how they disappeared and all that, and that seemed almost depressing. I thought that the characters were not explained well enough. They did not learn much about the background and that made it harder to get in touch with them.
