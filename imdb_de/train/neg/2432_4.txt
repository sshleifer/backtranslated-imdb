Not much to say. An action can pretty much be anchored in the first 10 minutes. Nothing overly wrong with this movie, very little action action action. It was possible to occasionally explore the emotions of the characters. Whether an action movie is the right genre, I'm still undecided. Sniper was one of the easiest-to-see films, without attracting full attention because he had small twists and a clear plot. I was probably guilty about that, so with a second watch or with undivided attention it might be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10)
