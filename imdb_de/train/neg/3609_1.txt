This must be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I remember looking at it years ago, when it was initially released as a video. For some reason, I thought that I enjoyed it. So I went out like an idiot to buy the DVD once it was released ... what a tragic mistake! I will not even bother to go into the plot because it's so transparent that you can still see through it. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to cheesy gore effects and bad acting, but these people take it to a whole new level. It's almost as if they purposely try to make the worst movie human ... if that was the goal, they were successful. If they were going to make a movie that would scare you or somehow make you believe it's real, then they failed ... MISERABLY! Avoid this movie ... read the storyline and you have seen it!
