When I looked at Wrestlemania's Matchcard this year, I was so excited and could not control myself because I was in a state of excitement. <br /> <br /> It starts ... and ends. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting there, angry with hell because I wanted my money back. I mean, you see Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) going down as a classic, and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have from time to time. The only moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when HBK erupted !!!! At this moment HBK lost to JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser / poser. It almost ruined Wrestlemania 22 when he hit TRIPLE H! I could not see WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I start to see it again (luckily). I have confidence in the WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the biggest I've ever seen), which was a pure classic wrestlemania. It definitely compensated for 'Mania 23' and also gave us many memorable moments. <br /> <br /> If you've seen ANY of the Wrestlemanias before this movie, like the ones that make you a fan (Wrestlemania 20 was filmed) I'm a fan, please do not look at it and do it the same mistake as me and leave WWE behind. And if you see it and get angry, then take a look again and look at Wrestlemania 24, it's absolutely classic.
