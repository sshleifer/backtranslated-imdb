If this movie was more about the character of Piper Perabo and less about the bar, it might have been reasonably decent. Piper's Violet Stanford and Karen Friendly (The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle) both have a virgin teacher for kindergarten teachers who is loveable. I hope she will find a better movie.
