Please save your money and look at something else. This movie was such a bitch. I did not want to leave, but I had to think I would laugh at least once, NOPE. not a single laugh, it was so terrible! chris kattan will never play a good comedy after that and "a night at roxbury". This movie is totally obvious, does not have any clever humor, and repeats itself over and over again. Listen to me and get as far away from this movie as possible!
