I agree with everyone that this show was both badly produced and written. Acting was not much about lower production values, but I think an actor can only rely on the material he has made available to make the best of it. I think it's important to point out that an actor has risen up and has evolved beyond this campaign to a tasteless production that has become a respectable and quite talented actress. I am referring to Laura Harris, a native of Canada, her way through many badly produced shows and movies to find a spot on the HBO hit "Dead Like Me," where she plays the role of Daisy Adair, and handles it in her honor They do this role efficiently. I remember a typical boyhood about the young actress during this series, in which she played Ashley, a gentle yet intelligent 7th student. I felt that someone in this series "could do it", that it would certainly be Laura Harris, who was true to her character in order to gain the respect of many producers she now for her talent as well as for the unique Nordic Excite blonde. If you ever have the opportunity to see this series, I recommend seeing epics after stations such as "Godfather" or perhaps "Beach", to remind you that there is still a lot of true production integrity and appreciation, that this series is just a simple reminder of what Laura Harris can say about her time on the show, and I bet she would quote the defense speech of many young actors by saying, "It's a start!"
