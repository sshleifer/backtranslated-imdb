Fine performances and art direction do not make a good movie. This movie is so bleak and depressing that I could not enjoy the "happy" end of the union strike. The experiments of humor concerning the pregnancy of Lake are utterly catastrophic, and every movie involving a Baldwin brother is already on strike. On the plus side, Lang is still one of America's most underrated actors. But he almost makes it worth keeping him in the video recorder. I give a 4.
