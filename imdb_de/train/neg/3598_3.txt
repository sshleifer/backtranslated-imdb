As you look at your collection of old video-recorded films, you know that there are some that you've only seen once or twice, and you can not remember if they're worth the time to see them ? The alibi is / was one of those films; I found it not too long ago and decided that I could give it a shot as well. I'm not sure I'm happy with my decision ... On the one hand, the movie is really bad, on the other hand, there's another band available now ... Yes, you understand it. The plot is predictable and not original. The pace is bad. Acting is bad, but that's not really surprising, as the two main roles are former soap opera stars ... they take some getting used to. The characters are poorly written clichés. The movie even manages to find the easiest way to impress me (through the movie): court scenes. Even these do not trigger emotion for or against one of the thin cardboard characters. The film just does not have any truly redeeming qualities ... even the dialogue is bad. The thing is, it's so full of stereotypes that it's ridiculous. And that's one thing that puts this beyond a 1/10 rating: the (albeit unwanted) comic relief of the many clichés and stereotypes. I did not pay much attention to the movie, but every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh about. One last note: I've considered using the line "Tori Spelling Can not Act" as a one-line summary, but I think everyone knows that, so I chose the current one because it's more informative. All in all, a thoroughly bad movie, but not the worst if you have nothing else to do and are on TV. Good for a few laughs, if you can stand it. 3.10
