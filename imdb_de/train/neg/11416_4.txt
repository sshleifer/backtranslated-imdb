The fact that this film has been one of the most successful films in Swiss film history makes me shake my head! It is true, but pitiful at the same time. A streak about the Swiss army could be a lot better. <br /> <br /> The story sounds interesting in the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to do his army military training while in the army The church married his love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter) , <br /> <br /> Acting is, in a sense, not really different from just a few recruits who get drunk and stoned in reality. Melanie Winiger plays her role as the mediocre Michelle Bluntschi, personally I found her quite annoying. <br /> <br /> The plot contains a comedy combined with a romance that does not work as expected. The romance part is too dirty and the comedy part is not funny at all, it's just a cheap try and does not change throughout the movie. It's fun for kids ages 12-13, but not for those looking for a fun comedy. The humor is weak except for a few settings. <br /> <br /> Dope? Cool! Steal? Cool! If you want a real comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure you have not completed your military training yet, and do not expect too much! <br /> <br /> I give 4 out of 10 stars because Marco Rima is pretty funny during his screen time. Not much time for the cinema
