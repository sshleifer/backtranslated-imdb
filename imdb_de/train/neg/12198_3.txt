When I grew up with the Beast Wars transformers, I was not very familiar with the original transformers, and now that I've seen the great movie and now that I've seen the older cartoon it's based on, I have to say That I like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> Not that I do not like the BW characters. I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal. <br /> I mean "AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT!" sounds much better than "MAXIMIZE MAX!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me convinced that he is a real commander, more than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> Also, the Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more powerful than Optimus Optimus. Just look on the web! <br /> <br /> Megatron in the BW character looked more like a humorous version of the nastier version of him in the original series. <br /> <br /> Aside from being cooler, robots are turning into animals or robots into vehicles and spaceships? Gimme the original transformers through Beast Wars every day!
