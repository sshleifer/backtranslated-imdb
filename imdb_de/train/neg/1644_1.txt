Undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen. I thought nothing would ever dethrone Last Action Hero, but it's easy. The film is about 3 individual boys who meet on Sundays to discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend. A fourth man - who is married and - who was formerly part of the group, appears and tells what he and his wife are doing. Nothing works in this movie. The jokes are not funny, but they are repeated throughout the movie. The big kicker at the end of the film is ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.
