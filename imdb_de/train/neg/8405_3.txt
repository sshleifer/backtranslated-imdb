Before I saw this movie, I expected a fictitious drama based on ideas from the book. Instead, it is the book, punctuated by dramatic scenes that illustrate the various "diseases". That did not bother me much, but I hindered the enjoyment of the movie. A story, or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book that extend through the film, would be preferable in my opinion. If you want to create a movie based on a psychological text, you need to find a more interesting (and as accurate as possible) text than this one. The film is drawn in parts, in which it is little more than a video encyclopaedia of 19th century sexual psychology, and would be absolutely unbearable if it were not of a sexual nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us, even to me). Fortunately, there are several stories with current character development that attract us. <br /> <br /> But disappointingly, Krafft-Ebing's theories of sexuality were largely unchallenged. I had hoped it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology, which many still hold today, exist. <br /> <br /> What do you have in the end? A detailed catalog with some fetishes and orientations, with some slightly interesting stories showing the problems and afflictions of some "sexual deviants" before they are cured. For the most part of the movie, the movie moves with the creep speed (and mood) of a caster. And as a film with an apparently low budget, cinematography and acting are not the highest priority. Although I was * content with the music, the costumes and the interior design *, I felt that the theme of this movie was right in my alley, and I still think it's a substandard movie. It deserves a 3/10; a 4/10 if I felt very generous. I can not imagine anyone enjoying it if they are not already interested in sexual fetishism.
