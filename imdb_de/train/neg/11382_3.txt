Everyone notices that Tommy has only three facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. He gives the angry eyes to every enemy. 2. Holding hands on face, mouth open and scared eyes. 3. The smiling Tommy Turnbull. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I pretty much hate this show, I do not watch it, but it's like code Lyoko, we've all seen at least one, I have to say that this show is borderline racist, uninteresting and is meaningless. <br /> <br /> Each episode ends in winning the robot boy, with the exception of one exception, when the robotic boy lets fly off this overly geeky freakazoid on a jetpack br /> The jokes are also pretty crude, I think they are mostly People who say or fart the word "suck". I think the series bullies are also pretty shocking. <br /> <br /> Is not there one hiding a bowling ball under his hatred, and the other uses a chain, for God's sake, what kind of school is he going to? Not to mention his older brother, who is marginal and has no other character traits. <br /> <br /> The whole show I feel breaks Megas XLR and Fosters. How could you say that the trio of Coop, Jamie and Kiva and Robotboy Megas is similar where he beats everyone, no matter how big the odds are, and despite the robot he is free of ghost. <br /> <br /> There's just no incentive for this show, I'm surprised it still works.
