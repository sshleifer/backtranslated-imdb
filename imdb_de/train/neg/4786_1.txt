I despise horror movies, that's no secret. No conspiracy, bad acting and gallons of blood are staples of these cinema mistakes, and this "movie" is no exception. I can not believe that some cable stations actually operate this garbage. (This rubbish was, I remember, directly posted in the video.) Since I mentioned that any other movie would be a big insult to this other movie, I say the following: All Phantasm Movies, All Jason Movies, Freddy Movies , Chucky movies and most Michael Myers movies can be summed up in one word: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
