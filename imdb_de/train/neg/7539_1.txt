Where, oh, where do you start describing the vast misery of Neil LaBute's latest filmmaker attempt? <br /> <br /> There are many types of movie fans, but by far the most annoying and superficial is Mr. Intrigant. You know Mr. Intriguing, right? <br /> <br /> He's the guy who, no matter how stupid, lame and incomprehensibly boring, is a movie, he says, "I do not know why everyone hated him, I found him fascinating." He's the type who fascinates the smell of dog feces. Especially when he lubricates him in the form of a Hitler mustache on the upper lip and walk over the house, calling over the brilliance of science fiction stories in which the veiled allusions to Greek mythology are short. He's also the guy this version of The Wicker Man was made for. Nobody else could stand it.
