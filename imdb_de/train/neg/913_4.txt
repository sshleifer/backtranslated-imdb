OK, let's see. What was funny in the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, people who fall into the water, stupid boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams. In this movie they have twisted the accent part a maximum, not good. A lot of people fall into the water for unsafe reasons, nothing good. Boat crash, check. Funny comments between the two teams, they tried, but failed. There are also personalities whom they follow in this film. This movie should be about what happens on the water, not on land. I am sorry to say that it is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are used to the maximum. Not good. All in all, I give four out of ten points because it has some funny parts.
