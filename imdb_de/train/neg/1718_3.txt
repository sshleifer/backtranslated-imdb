I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, as their costumes and locations reflect the photos taken by the gang. Especially successful is the death of Buck Barrow and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks just like the photos taken that day when Blanche mourned her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our antiheroes remain beautiful to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in a car accident the year before her famous ambush and did not look like a naughty cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is boring and acting is bad, especially the leads. Very disappointing. Stay with Beatty and Dunaway. While her is not "the true story," it's a great movie.
