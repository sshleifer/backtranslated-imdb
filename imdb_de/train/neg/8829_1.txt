This is a terrible piece of storytelling. It's about an hour in the movie until we know a lot about what it's about. the characters often mumble inaudibly; Actions often seem to have no relation to each other; nobody seems to worry about who actually murdered the girl; a few creepy children swim in waters that seem threatening, but nothing happens; The Irishman is slapped in the face by one of his buddies for no apparent reason. Continuing would be just as boring as the movie itself. The only half entertaining element is landscape photography. But anyone could point at the Australian outback with a camera and make memorable shots. Overall - bleak, incoherent, presumptuous - and downright annoying because he has wasted so much time by the viewer.
