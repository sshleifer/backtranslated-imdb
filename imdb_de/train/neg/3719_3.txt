Imagine withdrawing the mask of a deadly assassin and finding Barbara Cartland there ... that's what's going on with this movie. <br /> <br /> The opening was promising, but it soon becomes apparent that it is a thriller (or even.) A fanciful love story) and the only reason they made this story becomes clear: To close a gap in their female market, another re-hash of "misunderstood, brutal bad boy" (Andrei) and "innocent" whimsical beauty "(Paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of taking time wasting to create an original premise, the filmmakers set off on the money-shot: the vicious boy was tamed by the bizarre beauty, followed by a series of disingenuous and heavily cliched love scenes sprinkled with pseudo-philosophical / poetic fluff Andrei's admission to be (eponymically) a "poet" is used to round off the perceived qualities of a Byronic hero - but even if we do so in heavy, underlined writing It is still hard to believe - and no matter - who and what he is. <br /> <br /> For a Byronic Hero / Anti-Hero to work, the story needs subtlety, style, and innovation that are completely lacking here. This is not a modern phantom of the opera, it is exactly what happens when a weak and rather dumb woman (with a loose rubber band) meets a wicked man who, after hitting her, looks as dangerous as bunny slippers. <br /> <br /> The performances might have saved this film if they had been good: The female lead role is busy looking "sexy" and "extra-secular," no matter how obsessive or ridiculous she is. and poor Dougray Scott seems to have been drugged as he shuffles through his role. This is not his best work. The shimmer of interest was brought by JÃ¼rgen Prochnow as 'Vashon' and Andrew Lee Potts as a young photographer / brother. A better movie would have spoiled the sister and instead keep the brother.
