For a movie about a murderer, this is surprisingly boring. <br /> <br /> It does not happen much and even when things happen, they do not generate real excitement or interest. <br /> <br /> The acting is good of the two leads, especially Cassetti offers a great performance that combines the certainty and stupidity of Succo, but the rest of the cast also does what they need. <br /> <br /> and the fact that Succo is not interesting as a true story, Succo is not a unique character, it is neither interesting nor exciting. Films of this kind usually try to create excitement and empathy and that produces nothing but a sense of regret that you have wasted your time watching it.
