Bah. Another tired, redundant revision of an out-of-copyright work never designed for filming. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Toni Collette is as always superb (to be a real actress, you understand), and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between the scenes. There are even some really funny lines, and the filming, the score and the editing are competent, except for a bizarre crash in voiceover and talking to the camera at the end. <br /> <br /> But, ah, but. Much of the occupation seems to be on autopilots, and they are almost all too old (and in one case too young) for their stated age. Worse, they all speak "Austinese," that strange falsetto that's self-satisfied, a song that was not further from the way the people in Austen's time actually spoke (think, Yosemite Sam, me do not joke). This is particularly sad, considering that we seem to finally see the demise of the equally facultative "Fakespearan" that Olivier and his buddies so much like bellowing that they roar at the top of their lungs. <br /> <br /> Everything is Gwyneth Paltrow. She has always played one character in her films, and she stays in shape by moving through her entire spectrum for the first ten minutes (grinning to pout) and then repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film. There is absolutely no chemistry between them and their admirers, or any obvious reason why they would care about them. <br /> <br /> In short, there's very little reason to watch Emma. It's an amiable adaptation, but if you want to pack a movie full of anacronisms (ie, an inappropriate, thin leash that can not bow or edit a point accent), you can do it just as well as with the far superior "unsuspecting."
