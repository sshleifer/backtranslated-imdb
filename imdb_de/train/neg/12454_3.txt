I have read posts about Wonder Woman's costume for this TV movie. At the time the film was made, it should be noted that she was not wearing her traditional outfit. The producers have actually adhered to the conception of the comic book author of WW for the early seventies. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, I have to agree with many other posters here. Snoozefest! When it appeared on ABC in 1974, I was a kid, so I was the right age to appreciate a movie about a comic book hero. Nevertheless, I was so "captivated" by the plot that I did not look at three quarters of the movie anymore. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was not the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)
