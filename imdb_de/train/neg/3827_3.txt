Cliched, distracted, unoriginal and boring west. The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) both give performances that are far from their best, and rightly so; Both have superficial roles and traits that are mainly defined through dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "liked the world better than he used to," and Coburn is an outlaw who "owes the man something that imprisoned him and has to pay his debts." Besides, Heston is so old he struggles to ride a horse, and Coburn is mean and tough, but not as cold-blooded as a killer like some of the smaller villains. Apparently, the filmmakers could not deal with a single idea on how to differentiate this film a bit. (* 1/2)
