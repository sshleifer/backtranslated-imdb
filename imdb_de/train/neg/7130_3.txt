This movie should have been called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played the games, Need For Speed ​​are mostly hot cars and beautiful women and almost no action. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing about this movie A-Level was the cars. The acting seemed to be enforced and scripted, the premise was at best weak and the plot was almost nonexistent. I really only saw this movie to see how bad it was, and although it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was entertaining. I just wish they had Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, do not pay for it, do not bother to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and nothing else, it's a decent distraction.
