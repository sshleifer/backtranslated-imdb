I have to admit that there are few books with related films that I actually read before I see the filming of the film. Ninety-four happens to be one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was immersive and interestingly prophetic. But the movie is just shit. It's by far the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I did not turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was a half-two-part job for a class. It was dark and grotesque, but nothing succeeded in achieving the right atmosphere. The acting was not above average and given the fact that there was not much to do, this was extremely disappointing. The book, for example, did not give me the impression that Winston could not spit out more than one syllable at a time. Boring, disturbing and visually unsightly, the film could completely exclude the book. Wait a second ... Is not that British?
