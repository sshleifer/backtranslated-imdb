I had to look for the actresses to find the board of this movie because the title is now "An unexpected love". It's not really worth looking for, but I was unfamiliar with both leads and was wondering why they outperform a lesbian strip on Lifetime. Everything is pretty restrained and you can not really imagine who these characters are. As a spectator, I could not emotionally invest in the plot. I think I'm not the target audience, but I'm not sure who that is. Everything is muted and soft focus and earth tones ... nothing is very interesting. I was very interested in seeing two women, but it was handled so discreetly that I was disappointed. Rent staff best instead.
