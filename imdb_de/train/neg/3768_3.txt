Right. A film written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and his family. (Fred should have known better after editing the sets of 'Titantic' and 'Dogma'). <br /> <br /> So the plot. There are some scientists and forest guards and a hot chick with huge fake breasts. They are all really bad in their work, including the hot chicks (which I should consider a photographer, but who cares because she wears a bikini). One of the forest guards says the scientists are "professional people", which is good, because it would be terrible if they were professional maggots or jellybeans or ewoks. <br /> <br /> You are wandering through the forest of some strange monkey-like bones, and no one mentions that the bones could be those of the infamous Bigfoot. They just walk around and one of the Rangers brazenly meets the hottie. We all hope that he dies soon (along with his sister, who should be the cute naive, but really annoying). Then they find * gasp * a Sasqu ... I mean, a monkey-like animal burial ground. Of course not mentioning that it's just bigfoot bones that they're dealing with ... I think scientists and forest wardens just do not think about these kinds of things. <br /> <br /> Then Sasquatch and his tribe Get really angry and kill all the people we do not like, chase away the other losers and bury his great aunt Muriel and cousin Josh (the one with an unfortunate trout accident has died). <br /> <br /> Fade, boring dialogue (I counted several times), inhumane action, unlikely characters, bad CGI (a man in a monkey costume would look better), and the acting, which was just not very good, summed up become a movie that I do not watch again. <br /> <br /> But you check it; It is good for some unintentional laughs.
