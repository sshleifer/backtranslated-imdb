... and I have seen some bad. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this film. Acting is bad by Jennifer Tilly - as expected. Daryl Hannah does an OK job, but nothing close to being able to save this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in this movie is that the plot is so weak - though based on a good premise - the author resorted to the "stupid heroic trick" to create an artificial tension. If Daryl Hannah just has to hide, she runs in front of her pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without giving away too much of the conspiracy, I think it would be difficult for a bloody, petite woman to carry a pregnant woman out of the hospital without being noticed. Lame. Very lame. <br /> <br /> Save some time and choose another movie.
