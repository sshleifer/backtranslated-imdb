Six different couples. Six different love stories. Six different love angles. Eighty spectators in the cinema. I look at the eighty different parts of the canvas. <br /> <br /> I sit somewhere in between and look in the middle of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All stories have no connection with each other, but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani tries to establish a relationship between them. I tried to find out a few lines that I could write as a review, but after 3 hours 15 minutes I found nothing to write. The film is a bad copy of the Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Do not watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie.
