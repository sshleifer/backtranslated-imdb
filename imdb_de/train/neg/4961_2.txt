And that's all that is. This thing is slow. The actors have the ability, they just do not seem to be motivated to bother. The plot is not great and is further hampered by the mentioned slowness of the whole. The accents, if any, are British. Many of these people are said to be Danes. OK, OK, accents are not that important. But language is. I do not think they used words like "yeah" and "OK" on Beowulf's days. And this supposedly cool weapon that his king gave him? Did he ever reload this thing? Has he ever seen it? Or was Beowulf just such a goal? Well, his goal was at least the computer graphics used to create the monsters. That was also offside. Bad special effects. Bright spot? Only one that comes to mind. Marina Sirtis has performed well over the years.
