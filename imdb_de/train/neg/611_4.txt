Okay, "enjoying" is a pretty relative term, but flexibility is fine if you're dealing with a James Glickenhaus' caliber filmmaker. McBain is truly one of the most ridiculous, exaggerated action movies I've ever seen without the nasty edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews expressed a suspension of disbelief over the film's heroic commands, but what about filming a film in the Philippines that plays in Colombia? All extras are Filipino. In fact, the only person to see Hispanic from afar is good old Victor Argo as the much-cursed "El Presidente"! Oh yes, we also exaggerated Maria Conchita Alonso as a crazy rebel leader. Countless explosions and bodies fly everywhere in this amusing model to the glory of American imperialism.
