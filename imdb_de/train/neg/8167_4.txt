The Forest is not only your usual standard for Slasher / backwoods, but also an interesting mix of supernatural elements. The story is about two couples wandering in the woods on a camping trip. A cave dwelling, cannibalistic forest workers and the spirits of his deceased wife and two children are terrorizing her soon. There is something you do not see every slasher. Director Don Jones gets an "A" for effort, though the film falls flat at almost every level. Acting is just average, with the exception of Jeanette Kelly, who plays the Forest Girl's Dead Woman (Michael Brody aka Gary Kent) /> <br /> The film begins with beautiful shots of a couple walking through a valley and into a forest , They realize too late that someone is following them. Both are shipped in the typical Slasher fare. Our killer uses a reliable hunting knife throughout the movie, except during a flashback, when he uses a hand saw, a pitchfork and a rusty saw blade to send the lover to his cheating wife. The forest has a good story The movie just does not work. I found it rather boring with just shabby actors. 4.10
