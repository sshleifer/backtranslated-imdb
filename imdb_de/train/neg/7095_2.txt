"Diary of Sex Addict" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness. Probably a movie marketing scam, this movie is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else. Under the line "Diary ..." we would believe that our sex addict character has the stupidest woman in the world, a stable of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than dropping their panties at will not a profession despite restaurateur. At best, this movie could have been a good drama. In the worst case, cheap softcore. "Diary ..." is not synonymous and nowhere in between. This is for the dumpster. (D)
