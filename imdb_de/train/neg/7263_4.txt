This British-Spanish star co-production looks great, as you can see. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all are terribly curtailed, so much so that it looks like buildings are talking to each other. Few films suffer as much from Pan & Scan as this, as director Robert Parrish seems so enthusiastic about the widescreen process that he tends to use both sides of the screen simultaneously, neglecting the middle. Another user comments that we see the entire population of a church massacred in the beginning; not in one of the copies I have. There are some abrupt cuts from farmers firing their rifles, a Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau are celebrating, and that's it. We never find out why Shaw became a priest (if he really is), we never know what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas), although I suspect he was called home in Kojak because his departure seems arbitrary , And there's a weird flashback sequence in which Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) dances in a melon and a swimsuit in the tradition of the old English music hall to the 1960s hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, which is not sung here by Johnny Horton, but with some lyrics that I've never heard before. On the positive side, the location is magnificent, a huge old castle ruin with Escher-style staircases leading nowhere, some beautiful landscaping chews by Robert Shaw and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I did not really like this movie, but I did not really see it. I will search the widescreen version and then make my decision.
