Personally, I find this show pretty cheap. Some of the actors are terrible. They make it over and seem fake. I can always say how it will end up playing within the first 10 minutes or less, because they make it so transparent. It is not very well written either. I love to see, to laugh about it. You know the saying "It's so bad that it's good?" Well, that goes for this show. I also like to watch, just to see if I'm right when I think how it all will end. Until now, I have always been right. It's like a little game I play. It's nice if you get bored and you want to laugh about something.
