I found "The Arab Conspiracy" in a bargain basket and thought I had discovered a lost treasure. Guys, there's a reason you do not hear much about this movie. The plot is muddy, the tempo is slow, Cornelia Sharpe is as vivacious as normal, cold tofu, and the end leaves you flat. Not even Sean Connery can save this.
