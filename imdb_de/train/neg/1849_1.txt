I was interested in the train, which thinks it could be a rough diamond, but the only thing I found was bad writing. It looks very uninspired and immature. The editing could have been done by anyone with 2 video recorders and the inventory was a low budget video. I would say that it was not even as easy as digital mini-video. <br /> <br /> There are a few simple ways to fix a movie with what the director has, for example: There's so much trouble in this movie like a ham sandwich. It could be done better, but that would require extra work.
