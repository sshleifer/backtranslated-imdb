Boring, long, overbearing, repetitive, self-involved? this move felt like a bad date. Worse, the boring art school management - with a stubborn use of the whirling shot so exaggerated that I almost sucks - is constantly screaming to be noticed. Add the thinnest of actions and virtually no dialogue, and the movie feels like a four-hour epic after about 30 minutes. It gets worse: instead of dialogues, there are poorly written voice-overs AND quotes and songs that are obviously only to comment on the characters. Really loud opera music. Blame the director. <br /> <br /> The actors are all pretty good. The main actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suitable for the movie star. He and the other actors have some erotic moments. Even these get boring after 5 minutes, and one wonders if the director plays for a Bel Ami porn job. The impressive architecture of the college campus as a location in Mexico City is inspiring. Why is it that universities in the US are so boring (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD in this movie. You want to use the quick scan button? a lot of.
