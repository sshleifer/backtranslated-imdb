I chose 3 for this movie because it looks just as good as the entire Greenaways edition. However, it was his usual mix of "art" sex and overbearing crap. I know a lot of people who like this movie, but I got tired very quickly. It's definitely not for everyone. The omnipresent McGregor obviously took on the role of faith, but he really should not have wasted his time. I hate sending anyone to the corner of the pseudo, but please ..... !!! On the positive side, it is visually very attractive and I enjoyed the music, but I could not see through to the end and I can not say that for many movies. Usually I look at the whole thing, but that is unbearable !!
