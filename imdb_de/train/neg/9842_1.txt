It seems everyone in this movie channeled Woody Allen. They stutter and pause and stutter even more. Only for really hard-bitten DeNero fans! It tries to look edgy and artistic - but it looks like a very, very cheap movie made by students. The most used word in the entire movie is "humming". However, the film has shaped the atmosphere of the late sixties / early seventies. If you like movies in which people talk to each other constantly, terrible lighting (even if it's about art) and you feel like you're in a political meeting, you like it - but you have to be really boring yourself. I found this CD in the dollar container and now I know why.
