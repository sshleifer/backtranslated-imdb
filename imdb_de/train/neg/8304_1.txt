"A Christmas Story" is one of the most popular films of all time. ACS was able to take the viewer to a time and place that had so few movies ever. It had a sweetness and a good will, which is rare. <br /> <br /> So I've been waiting (and waiting) for his successor "It Runs In The Family". The movie was almost released a few times, just to be pulled at the last minute. When it finally came out, IRITF was and is a total failure. <br /> <br /> The sets and cinematography were fine, but the director completely missed the target. The movie was nothing more than a cash flow formula of lazy casting, lazy writing, and disjointed drama. Narrator Jean Shepard, one of America's great humorists and narrators, was forced to give us a false reprise of the warm joke he used in ACS. He was overreaching and why he did that I will never know. He somehow managed to become an annoying, overworked parody of himself. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting in IRITF is inauthentic and forced. The actors may have seen ACS, but whatever wit and nuance in ACS may not have registered with any of them. The acting was embarrassingly shitty and robbed of Shepard's dry humor. ACS will always be a real treasure, but calling IRITF a sequel will offend all fans of Jean Shepard and ACS.
