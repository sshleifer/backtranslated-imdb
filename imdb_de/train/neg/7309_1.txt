I borrowed this movie for the first time on DVD and watched it without having read any reviews about it. After 15 minutes, I saw that something was wrong with this film. it is terrible! I mean, in the trailers it looked scary and serious! <br /> <br /> I think Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thought if all the characters in this movie were stupid, the movie would be funny ... (So silly, it's funny ...? WRONG He should watch and learn from better horror comedies, such as: Eg "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Return of the Living Dead"! This is funny! <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is the reason why I have registered on www.IMDb.com so that I can release my thoughts of dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the movie a second time> AAARGH! <and take notes for my partial "review" to show how stupid the film is. "Resident Evil" (horror) or "Dude, where is my car?" (Comedy) I can always watch and enjoy anyway! But that ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can a script and a director be ??? So bad. Here are the terrible scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> In the early scenes, we see Henry, who does not realize his dog is lying on the floor with his tongue hanging out of his mouth and the look is dead dead! <br /> <br /> The film does not explain anything about the blonde long-haired kid who likes to bite people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("What's wrong with the forest?") is "nothing." The screenplay lets warn the bearded guy just because of "tension" in front of the woods. <br /> <br /> Then the "smartest" of the pack of 5, Bert, gives us almost an example of how a forest fire is triggered. He meets the now infected Henry, who asks for help, and from here the movie wants to break the record with the "F-word". Bert freaks out because Henry looks terribly ill. Bert: "Do not let me shoot you!" (Forgets to say, "... with my BB gun!") Bert goes back to the cabin, but how about that? He meets Marcy and Jeff, who had sex, but suddenly they decide to take a walk! Marcy wisely takes off the unguarded campfire that Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change?) Bert does not mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he killed him with his BB weapon. <br /> <br /> Later, as the Five Estupidos sit around the campfire, another madman shows up with his dog. (Maybe it's the warning of the woods? It's full of madmen ... and their dogs !?) They just let him sit with him just because he has a huge bag full of cannabis. (Her brain is completely intoxicated, no wonder they are all so stupid!) This is the last time that we will see this forgetful character ... alive. <br /> <br /> Henry appears in her cabin, (NOTE: He lied a few feet from her cabin all the time !!!) and looked worse, almost like a zombie, covered with goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the boys of Einstein refuse to help the poor fool. He gets into her unlocked truck, which, of course, also has his key in the ignition. Henry seems almost smart enough to drive the hell out of there, but instead he begins to puke dashboard, seats, and windows with blood. The Fantastic Five race with armed equipment: BB gun, knife, baseball bat (* huh, have you ever tried to play baseball in the middle of the woods ???), a poker and an (insecticide?) Spray? may be willing to fight the individual, unarmed and terribly ill man. (Clever script!) Bert manages to kill the car with one shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the eyes of director Eli Roth. "What should I do otherwise?" Bert screams in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker, but do not miss the windows of the truck. Henry goes to the stupid girls who say, "He's coming up to us!" (Thanks for the info, stupid women, I can see that!) But I do not think he wants to hurt you!) Marcy squirts in his eyes and lets Henry howl! And our "hero" Paul touches Henry by the arm with a burning trunk from the campfire, which they ruthlessly burned while in the cabin! (Where has all this wisdom gone, I think the cannabis had taken its toll!) Henry transforms into The Human Torch and runs away screaming. <br /> <br /> The next day, Bert and Jeff go overboard for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to "seek help" alone in the woods while Paul stays with Karen ... Does not that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already "seeking help"! <br /> <br /> I'm skipping my comments on Marcy suddenly rowing across a huge and winding river in a CANOE! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she's going !? Anyway, she goes to the riverbank and finds a very large and seemingly abandoned cabin. Like most horror movies, she walks into the cabin and says, "Hello, is anyone there?" Bert suddenly appears behind a piece of furniture and scares her (and me first). And Jeff comes too. How did you come here? Did you swim across the river? See how brainless the script is !? Deputy Winston meets Paul in the cabin. He somehow does not notice the blood on her truck. This happens after about 35 minutes, and I have decided not to torture myself anymore and to get the DVD out. (Before I take my own eyes off ... Well, THAT is funny!) <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed this movie, do yourself a favor and check out "Fright Night," "The Lost Boys "or" The Return of the Living Dead ". Then you will see that they are MORE entertaining than this ... thing. Even the "Toxic Avenger Part 2", which is also a lousy movie, is much funnier than "Cabin Fever".
