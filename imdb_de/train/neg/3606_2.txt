This movie is the worst, but very high for me. This is supposed to be a Slasher movie. It takes place at a university where there are only a handful of students. The teachers are stupider than a bag of hammers. It is filled with good Catholic priest and sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so clich√©d that I can hardly believe that I could predict lines in quotes. The cuts are somewhat creative and seem to revolve around stinging people in the genitals. Lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters who deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this movie for a fun time. Get a cheap beer and some friends, watch and laugh.
