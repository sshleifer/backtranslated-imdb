Contrary to my principles, I would first like to come to a conclusion, because I have just seen this piece of "art" and still stand under strong impressions. The reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is absolutely terrible, and I would never bother to write a single word about it, if not for the fact, "44 minutes" "made me sick to death, which was me The fact that I've paid for it does not make me any better, and the fact that the film deserves the high user rating here. <br /> <br /> So what's up with the movie? a fashionable title - "44 Minutes." One thinks first of "15 Minutes," which by the way is a much better movie, but still bad in my book, and the two can be compared to some extent, but as luck would have it , the things they share are their worst qualities, both of which show Mr Oleg Taktarov, who with his strong Russian accent obviously fulfills the expectations and prejudices of the people, his aim being to appeal to the spirit of the Cold War Ah, we miss the good ones ancient times? Well, I'm not saying he's a bad actor, I still have to judge his true performance, but he's just not a real human here, he's more of an archetype. How anyone can indulge such things, I find completely incomprehensible. We can detect here modern American xenophobia. The point in the film when Taktarov tells his companion that Romanians are not Germans and that they are in America is really ridiculous. Should we assume that the unfortunate duo's biggest wish is to become "real" Americans? <br /> <br /> Then there is the media issue. Yes, it seems that most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. The director should have felt the rhythm of the supposed 44 minutes. Instead, he bores us with interviews throughout the movie like a cheap TV show and tries to reinvent the wheel. In 15 minutes, the issue of media is the central theme. The point is presented as a teacher addressing a blunt student who deserves a separate comment, we are now focusing on 44 minutes. So I tried to determine the purpose of this movie. What is it? To give the audience a good time? To glorify weapons? To glorify the police? Represent violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the Bible to the minor delinquent. So it has to promote peace and understanding? I do not think so, but do not ask me. All I know is that I did not like it all. <br /> <br /> Ah, Michael Madsen. I admit, I'm a big fan. I hoped it would be a good point, but I was wrong. It is not his fault. <br /> <br /> As a final remark, the comparison of "firepower" with "willpower" at the end of the film was one of the worst lines I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> In summary, on the scale 1-10 I give a pure, unadulterated 1.
