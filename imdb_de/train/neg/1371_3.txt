I can not figure out how anyone can budget for such a bad movie. It's as if the TV station is desperately looking for something. They are buried under a pile of snow, the electricity is constantly flashing on and off, and magical is a backlight that remains constant. Where does all this (false) light come from? That and all that stupid argument between the characters. They seem more interested in complaining than trying to invent survival options. It tries to create a sense of need and people who help. But because it's so bad, directing and acting, you will not fix your Florence Nightingale with this movie, sorry. I agree with the negative feedback and agree that this is one of the worst films ever.
