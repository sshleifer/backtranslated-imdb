We can start playing wood, but this movie is a disaster. I grew up in NY and I can tell you that this movie is an insult to anyone familiar with the community or people. I am in no way a defender of culture, and I find that this is a Hollywood trash that fits in with its own fictional, ridiculous cultural presentation and language that everyone who observes Seinfeld is inaccurate. This is a colossal waste of time and, even worse, not exactly interesting, as the result is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are ridiculously bad. Who is acting like this? Nobody. <br /> <br /> The writer's name sounds Israeli or something similar, but it's clear he has no idea about the subject he's writing about. Looking at his biography, it is shocking that he lived in New York and wondered how much connection he really had with the community. Even mediocre films like "A Stranger Among Us" are better and closer to the truth than this filth. If you read the credits of this man, it's no wonder he has written scripts for all the C-grade films that somehow have stars. shocking. Maybe he knows someone, because this script is even below average for a bad Dolph Lundgren movie.
