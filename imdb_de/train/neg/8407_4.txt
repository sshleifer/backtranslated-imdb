From the stupid "rustic African natives" to our poorly overlaid principals who act as storytellers, to the terrible fake ears that turn docile Indian elephants into African elephants, to the complete absence of any logic, to Maureen O'Sullivan whining " Tarzan! Tarzan! ", There is nothing about this film that deserves the classic status. <br /> <br /> 4/10
