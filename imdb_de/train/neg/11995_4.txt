I was so excited that I saw this movie when the promos first hit the market in November. It looked great and the songs! I was pretty disappointed when I saw it! This is a movie that connects 6 couples together. It has a cast of 12 people! A large number of stars worked on this film. I think the director Nikhil Advani did not handle the situation well and should not have had many people in the film as it would make it easier for him. Compared to Nikhil's directorial debut "Kal Ho Naa Ho", "Salaam-e-Ishq" falls behind quite a bit. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star. I think the best parts of this movie are the songs! The songs are excellent and I think all the songs are fantastic. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy has done a great job and done a great job over the years. I think that the ratings of this film can rise because of the excellent songs! I was disappointed that the director in this movie, shot by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar, should not have included nudity. I found that extremely rude to see that with the family! Although some find this act a comedy, it's not something you want to see with parents! I think the best show was performed by Salman and Priyanka. Overall, I think it's a good movie!
