This film could have been a decent B-movie if 3/4 of the movie is not so much focused on the sex scenes. I mean, he's a sex addict and I'm sure there are more sex addicts than having sex all the time. Michael Des Barres did a good job, considering what he had to do, which was not much. At some point you had to laugh at him, because his character was so pathetic. Nastassja Kinski was fine in her role as a concerned sex therapist, but she could have done more, and I do not suggest that she have sex. The person who stood out most in this film was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as a loving and caring woman. There is something about inside and outside that appeals to me. She played that role and when you looked at the movie you feel bad for her. <br /> <br /> "Diary Of A Sex Addict", although no Oscar material or a modern classic is suitable for everyone, is very informative and does a fair job of showing you exactly how your personal demons do Things in life that you can cherish, take over and ruin.
