This movie is one of my favorites. It's not really good, but it's great to laugh about it. The dialogue can be incredibly ridiculous and badly played (eg, "Manji, can we ask you a few questions?" "Sure." Watch out for Brock, the white guy who attacks the main characters, he has only two lines, but he is one of the best guys in the movie!
