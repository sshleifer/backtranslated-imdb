Probably one of the toughest slasher films of all time, poorly played and poorly written. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT Five students staying on vacation close a dorm, but someone has plans and gets them done One of them is or could be the main suspect in the scary space guard John Hemmitt, played by Woody Roll one of the five characters is too fast and should have been the main hero, and the rest is pretty boring, though Laura Lapinski, the main character, sometimes has her charm and in the end she is sorry for her. <br /> <br /> THE KILLS Can not really see why they have forbidden that, the kills look mostly fake. One has cut his hand in half at the beginning, which looks really spotty alive and another is burned alive. <br /> <br /> TOTAL Not really a great slasher cou It would have been much better
