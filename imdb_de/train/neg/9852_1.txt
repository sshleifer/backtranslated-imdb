Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed. This fantasy is modeled after the series "Walking with Dinosuars". Although this is 100% fantasy, it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even the mixing of fantasy dragons with T-Rex and dinosaur extinction. Instead of being shown on an educational channel, rather than sci-fi, it adds a touch of factual authenticity to the show. But as it is presented, I have to give it a 1/10. Do not get me wrong I have no problem with the imagination, but it is wrong how they bring it out. I can really see young children and slow adults believing that they have found a dragon and that this is real with the thought of how much imagination is on this mini series.
