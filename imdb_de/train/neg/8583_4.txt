Americans have the attention of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest very quickly. <br /> <br /> I found out an exciting fact from this film: someone has to paint pylons and do it on a schedule! And guess what, they really want to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). <br /> <br /> When I got bored of watching infomercials late at night and decided to actually watch this movie, I found the movie characters interesting and very appealing. <br /> <br /> I do not usually watch so much late-night TV, so I can not recommend this movie unless dry painting is your idea of ​​an exciting two hours out of your life.
