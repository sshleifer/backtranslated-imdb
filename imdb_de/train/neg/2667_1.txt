California is disturbing. I believe that there is no reason to tell this story. It is neither entertaining nor does it have social value. Technically, the film is very well done, the services are first class and first class. The story is fascinating and interesting. But in the end, the movie gets sick and loathes the decency. I can not recommend Kalifornia to anyone.
