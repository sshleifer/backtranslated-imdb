I've seen many of Guy Maddin's films and most of them liked them, but they literally gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke's cut is far too hectic, and apart from a tour-de-force sequence that shows a series of heads looking at an object, it does not affect the actors' ability to communicate with the audience , <br /> <br /> Another thing I did not like about this movie was that it was more brutal than Maddin's earlier works - though his films always had dark elements, his compassion for the characters gave the films a supreme feeling of humanity. This seemed to be more of a hardness. <br /> <br /> As I need to add more lines of text before IMDb accepts my review, I will mention that the actor playing "Guy Maddin" manages to ape his facial expressions pretty well.
