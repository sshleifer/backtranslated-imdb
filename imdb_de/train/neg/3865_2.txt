This is so bad. Poor Actors It can be said that they really have a lot of trouble polishing a crap, but we all know you can not do that. The writing is so obvious and straightforward that it's sad when they try to sell it. The humor and tempo are so tedious that it's hard to believe that one of those good actors is committed to it. We just have to know where the train is going. But that's just because we caught it on TV. If we had actually PAID for it, we would be disgusted. <br /> <br /> So it gets 2 stars because it's at least amusing / fascinatingly bad. And the casual music (as opposed to the harsh indie soundtrack) is laughingly reminiscent of an episode of Scooby-Doo ... but not so well.
