A film about a number of filmmakers who want to do a documentary on a new way of surfing in shark-infested waters. As an absolute fan of movies, including vicious animals or monsters, I thought that might be my kind of movie ... it was not !!! This should rather be a guideline for how not to do it! It has a lot of random humor and the evil beast is an incredible joke, in the final scene is about the main characters * roles *, the feet are obviously in the air! It looks ridiculous! Good for a laugh. If it was just the lack of talent between the actors, the embarrassing stupid dialogues, and the stupid crocodile that would be worth a laugh at least how weak it was, so they considered the old idea of ​​"sex sells" ... all in I mean TOTALLY for no reason that one of the main actresses shows the animal her breasts. And somewhere in the beginning there is a kind of pointless "make-out". This is the last ingredient that makes the movie absolute rubbish for me. It's unbelievable how people actually spend time producing such garbage! If you are looking for a real waste of time, take a look at this movie !!!
