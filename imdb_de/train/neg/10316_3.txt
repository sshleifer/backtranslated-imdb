To be honest, when I heard about this show for the first time, maybe it was a bad idea to do a show where Muslims use racial jokes for themselves, but it's the opposite. I realized that the show that does that can help people to understand that if a Muslim uses a word like this in real life, that does not mean it's a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype. When they look at the show, ordinary people will realize that all Muslims are bad, but that does not mean we're all bad, we're just trying to live day by day, how hard it was for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words like "Blow up" or Yaser that said we'd blow the competition and people would have misunderstood it. As a Muslim, I know that such things usually do not happen, but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq. It is not right that things are not so. People will see how badly we are treated by watching this show, and it can make them think about how they act. I am glad that a show like this was broadcast. There are many shows in which Piotr Muslims act as terrorists. Many people find them funny to my opinion. It's alright to do it from time to time, because it's a lot of fun to say that you can not make fun of it unfair, but it's often done and gives the Muslims a bad name.
