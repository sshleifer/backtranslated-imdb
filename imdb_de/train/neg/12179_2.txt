It's not worth looking at this sticky spoiler ruining everything on 'Annie'. The characters seem to be almost cheapened by the poorly written plot, and the quality of production is low. It was clearly made for television, but if I found it on my TV, I would turn it around right away. The kids in the movie do a good job, but the adult acting is incredible and so the movie does not really attract you. This movie had no music / dance numbers that made the original brilliant and really awaken the shine of Annie all love. Johnson, Annie is sometimes annoying and over the top. You can not convince herself that she really is Annie. The differences in the look of the characters irritated me throughout the movie. Sad to say this sequel was a total flop.
