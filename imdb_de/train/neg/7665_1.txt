Honestly, I can not bother writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is just too short. What I want to say is that Alone In The Dark does only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. It succeeds in throwing several useless plans into the air but dropping them all. <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> 3. The classic PC game it claims to be based on is a total failure because it is a complete failure in all aspects of filmmaking. Doctor Boll, if that's what you really are (I'm thinking of proctology here, what are you doing on a director's chair?
