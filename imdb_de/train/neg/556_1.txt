In my book, "Basic Instinct" was a perfect movie. It had outstanding acting in the areas of Stone, Douglas and all supporting actors down to the smallest role. There was wonderful photography, music and the noirest noir script of all time. All in all, make a movie as good as it will ever be! <br /> <br /> This sequel is the exact opposite, it can not possibly get worse, bad acting and a lame script, combined with a totally inappropriate direction, that's really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that keeps you focused is the relatively short wait for the next scene, which is an exact copy of the original. These copies are so bad that they make you laugh, and I laughed a lot despite myself, because it was like watching the demolition of a glowing monument. The only thing that's good in this terrible mess is the excerpts from the Jerry Goldsmith review by BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the halffan who was responsible for the script even included the dialogue "It's not smoking in this room" in the interrogation scene and yes, she sends her lawyer (who is now a lawyer) away! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I saw this horrible movie that should never have been done! It damages the original, it is that bad. The only redeeming value is the recognition that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure that Ms. Stone has done the best surgeon) can do a good job, but obviously can not restore the perfection of the original. And as far as the human body is concerned, that also applies to filming. There should be a law: Never make a sequel to a perfect movie!
