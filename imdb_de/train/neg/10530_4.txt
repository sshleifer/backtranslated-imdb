Disappointing musical version of Margaret Landon's "Anna and the King of Siam", shot in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, makes Deborah Kerr appear as a widowed teacher and mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to work as a teacher there accept the King's many children - and perhaps teach the King one or two things! Stagy's picture starts well, but quickly loses energy and focus. Yul Brynner repeats his stage triumph as king and is a towering presence, but - like the burned-up story - is used as a buffoon. Kerr keeps her cool dignity and goes better, even though she has to lip-read Marni Nixon's vocals. Maybe Brynner has played that role to death already, and it looks like he has nothing left for the screen translation except bombast. In the second half with Anna and the Moppets performing a musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin", it's pretty ridiculous, and the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs are mostly clumsy. Brynner won an Oscar for Best Actor, but it is the lively Kerr who keeps this ball above water. Overly long, heavy and "old-fashioned" in the worst sense. ** from ****
