I was sadly disappointed with this film because it felt wrong and the characters were not strong enough to watch the movies pretty weakly. The basic idea for the film was interesting, but unfortunately it could not excite, really scare or shock me - there was a part of the entire movie that I thought was cruel, but even that did not trigger it. I really liked the character of Kate at the end of the film when she finally got a bit softer and more realistic. The character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not really needed for this movie, and I think the director / writer The countless characters who were not used for any purpose could be upset if he had left it with the basic characters, what Kate's solo rather as a single effort turned out. Maybe it worked - Jeremy's acting was uncomfortable to say the least and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen - or the absence. Such a shame. Disappointing.
