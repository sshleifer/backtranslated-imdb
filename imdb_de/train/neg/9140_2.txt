Phew - I do not know what to say. This is a movie that could be really good with some bunch of stoned viewers. Some of the acting reminded me of John Waters early offerings. Maybe I should take that back - I do not want to insult Waters' ability as a director / storyteller. <br /> <br /> I particularly loved the lawyer when he spoke about the clause "full of faith and credibility". By the way, it is "full of faith and credit"! <br /> <br /> This also reminds me of "The Conrad Boys", where the lead actor is also the author, the director, the film editor etc. Multi-involved companies like this one should probably be left to the very experienced film professionals who are the ones have technical abilities (albeit a stunt, some say) to achieve something like that.
