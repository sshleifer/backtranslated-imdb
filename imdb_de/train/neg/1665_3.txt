It was a decent movie, I kinda enjoyed it. But the end is so abrupt !! There is absolutely no closure and leaves many loose ends. What happens after the concert? What happens to her friend? Is she connecting with Grant? Will she beck in the next semester? And what about Angela? Obviously, Holly's performance would give Angela a few bumps, but there's nothing to suggest her reaction. There is so much in the air and it is very unsatisfactory. I do not know if it's trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but it's a terrible end and I think it's really fun for the movie. I was very disappointed.
