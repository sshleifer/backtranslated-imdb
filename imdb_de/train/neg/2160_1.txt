Gods ... where should I start? I could only get tired for the first 10 minutes before turning away from disgust. Apart from the actor who played Robin Hood himself, the rest was awful. And I can only extend my suspension of unbelief so far. <br /> <br /> Already at the beginning of the first episode I lost the number of mistakes, plot holes and terrible costumes. It started with a poor farmer who was looking for a deer to feed his family. Everything good and good. The poor blower must, however, have been mostly deaf, because a handful of soldiers in full armor and on horseback could creep up to him to 10 feet. <br /> <br /> Then he runs away he walks 10 feet behind them to a shot where you can not see them, followed immediately by them about 20 feet behind him. Then he encounters some bushes and is immediately abused by two of the soldiers ... who galloped on their backs just seconds before leaving dozens of feet behind. <br /> <br /> The "armor" on The soldiers are so painfully obvious cloth that they look like maille and failed miserably. Not to mention that the "armor" of the main soldier is about 5 sizes too big for the poor guy. Seriously, he looks like he's a little kid wearing his father's oversized armor! Finally, Robin manages to be perfectly shot for about 5 seconds, in a time span of about 2 seconds, out of what appears to be a recursion arc. No human alive could make these kinds of shots in that short time with a riflescope rifle and even less with a bow. After that, they escape the soldier and stop to help a remarkably well-dressed man and clean "farmer" with digging a trench ... something that all the nobles were always ready for, right? How this sad excuse for a series that has ever received a second season exceeds, is incomprehensible to me. The production cost (at least for what I've seen) must have risen in the tens of dollars (or euros) ... Seriously - I think a high school drama class could provide a better rendition , That was so bad, even the terrible Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood was better. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest that you skip this monstrosity and rent or buy the "Robin of Sherwood" series in the mid-80s. Much better written, traded, disguised and produced. <br /> <br /> For the shame, BBC ... for the shame ...
