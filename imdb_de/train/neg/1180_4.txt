For more than a quarter of a century notorious (and often banned), uncertainty was the greatest asset it seems. Hey, it's often better to be talked about than to actually be seen if you can not substantiate the "legend". <br /> <br /> The film was recently released in Los Angeles and is available as a home video, so the veil is slowly raised. While there is still enough to offend the masses, it bores her rather than arouse much genuine passion. Apart from a lengthy XXX sex scene between two horses ("Nature Documentary"), follows almost an hour of a boringly arranged marriage melodrama. <br /> <br /> Once sex and nudity begin, it's an uninterrupted sequence of masturbation, a looooooooon look back on an alleged encounter between "Beauty and the Beast" and a naked woman walking around the mansion (Nobody, not even her supposedly protective aunt, even seems to think of putting her on!). I think on video you can rush through the banality, but it's not really worth it. The nudity does not go beyond what one can see in something much more substantial like Bertolucci's THE DREAMERS. <br /> <br /> Try to find something like "morality" or "symbolism" in carnality, I doubt it worthy of any effort. Unfortunately for LA BETE, after you can see the movie more easily, the notoriety of something "forbidden" has been lifted. And this beast has been tamed.
