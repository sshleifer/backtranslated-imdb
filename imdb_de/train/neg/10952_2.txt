I hate that this movie has absolutely no creative input. I know that they choose realism, but to be honest, I just do not want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I live. Tell me an interesting story and we talk. I can handle the low production levels, the hell I'm a fan of low production values, but at least I work with some good ideas. The direction just goes so far as to grab a camcorder and walk around a bit, but of course I should dig that up, because it becomes so much more realistic. Hitchcock used to say that drama was essentially life with the blunt pieces. I can only conclude that this is not a drama, not a long time ago. We see Rosetta going somewhere, Rosetta working in a bakery, Rosetta eating a waffle, Rosetta carrying around, Rosetta going home, Rosetta running somewhere ... it's just not that entertaining. There is no deeper meaning. I got so bored that I started to look for life in this movie, but it's just realism, the overrated quality in the industry. I think I should love that, but come on, there's nothing in it.
