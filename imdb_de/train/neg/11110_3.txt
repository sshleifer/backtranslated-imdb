I just want to know that I do not take movies under 5 often. I was originally very excited to see this movie. His numerous trailer bumps for several months on television made me really see this movie. Another night, when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed fascinating enough to be the subway. There is a photographer who is obsessed with the missing people. Where you go? What happens to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some of the photos he took and becomes obsessed with the butcher who follows him, Yada Yada. The film had a chance to suck you in, though the plot was very predictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look after you," I say, bored with the cheap thrill. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable but fascinating ... until the end. "That was good until the end ... Then it just became stupid," says Jack_skellington_freke in the Message Boards. And I totally agree. And here are the spoilers ... <br /> <br /> Look, I was hoping it would be an insane killer, a psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. No. It was a secret society that kept creatures alive for centuries. Woo. How original. How unrealistic. How boring. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on, Lionsgate. You had great movies, but this one has dropped.
