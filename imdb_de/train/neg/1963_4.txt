This movie is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but also much more graphical than both and not so good. He is also slow and quite predictable. He also has shades of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus. We get some New Age flair in the mix and some of these scenes seem like a motivating / inspirational sermon. Actually, this movie is a mix of almost everything. Even if it's bloody, the make-up effects are not very realistic. In fact, they look somehow cheap. Apart from all this, there are some really terrible stereotyped dialogues. And I will not say when, but there is a point where some actions of the character under the given circumstances were not authentic or credible. Nobody knows what would have happened. If you watch the movie, you know what I mean. There is also a superfluous nudity for the sake of nudity. It just was not necessary Acting was actually pretty good. Better than this movie deserves After careful consideration of the evidence, I say this movie is passable, but not good. My verdict for The Tooth fairy: 4/10
