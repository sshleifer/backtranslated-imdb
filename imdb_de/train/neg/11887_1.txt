The world could be over. Unfortunately, this film is further proof of Canada's inability to make films that go beyond the exaggerated. Maybe it's because all of our really good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short and others) go to Hollywood.) In fact, it's a pity that Short was not cast in this presumptuous and banal movie. He might have made it believable. The Canadian government should realize - and this film is an excellent example - that money in the trough does not lead to a good movie. If the people holding this public money had to compete, they might have come up with something valuable. So it is that they have produced another giggling embarrassment.
