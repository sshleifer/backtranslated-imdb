I looked at the first 15 minutes and thought it was a real documentary (with an irritatingly overly dramatic producer for the camera). <br /> <br /> When I realized that everything was set in scene, I thought, "Why should I waste it? My time to see this garbage?" So I turned it off and came online to other people to warn. The characters do not act credibly. too much immature emotion. For a man who travels halfway around the world to a war-torn country, he behaved like a child. and I do not think it was because "his character was so upset about the bombing of the mall". <br /> <br /> very banal and stupid. <br /> <br /> Did you see "City of the Lost" Children? "French Dark Fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps children and steals their dreams ... I liked it!
