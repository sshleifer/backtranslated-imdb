Just bought the VHS for two dollars in this movie. Did I waste my money? Hey, I'm digging Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan's Island" Louise, but hello! This third-rate production is a replenishment of a dozen other biker films; Crazy bunch of biker psychos ride into a hip city, beating up everything and everything and being defeated in the man by a brisk hero. Adam West looks like a hero, but he lacks a cape and his Batman uniform. Sorry, just is not the same. Tina L. looks really nervous and scared, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" when she was rescued from the island ... The bikers are a colorful group and it is well known that they ever acted again should or should not have. Hell Riders is hell to watch!
