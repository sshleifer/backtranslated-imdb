CAMILLE 2000 <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> In love with a Rumbesuch, a loving nobleman (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love herself into a beautiful young Libertine (Daniele Gaubert), but her unusual romance is rejected by Castelnuovo's wealthy father (Massimo Serato), and Fate has a tragic blow ... <br /> <br /> A Sexual Love A story for the swinging sixties, which scriptwriter Michael DeForrest has taken from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas 'La Dame aux Camelias'), and Radley Metzger, who is also well known alongside Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, with a free-spirited flair led by a redefinition of the parameters of "adult" cinema in the 1960s and 70s. Metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita' uses the Scope format for the last time in his career and is rich in visual excesses (note, for example, the emphasis on reflective surfaces), even though the film's sexual openness is alarming by modern standards. The production values ​​are consistently beautiful, and the performances are engaging and humane despite weak re-synchronization practices (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable). Although Enrico Sabbatini's unwanted stage sets are set in an indefinite future, the film is firmly anchored within its period, and Piero Piccioni's 'Wah Wah' score has become a cult object among cultivators. After all, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of the director's elegant softcore eroticism will not be disappointed. Next up was Metzger THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider his best film.
