The film has a nude scene: a man sitting on the edge of the bed and smacking his exposed genitals in the middle of the canvas. It's a pretty long scene. What was the point? I almost think it should be funny, but we saw it with my mother and it was not funny that THAT stared at us for a full minute. <br /> <br /> The movie is cold. None of the characters is even sympathetic. Audrey Tatou is cute, of course, but her character is an unlucky girl. I really would not recommend this movie. I expected it to be charming and fresh, but it was depressing. I wondered if the director came from a well-educated, educated French family and he looked down on those characters. <br /> <br />
