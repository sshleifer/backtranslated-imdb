This film reminded me so much of "A History of Violence," which purported to deal in depth with violence and violent behavior, but ultimately nothing more than a cheap action movie was that disguises itself as a thinking film about violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new bride British pull in a small English town and be endlessly harassed by the local drunks who hang the whole day in the pub and make trouble. Do not these men have a job? Anyway, Dustin takes everything that it can hold, and at the end of the film he keeps in his house and fighting each of the drunken attackers with cruel means, such as boiling Whiskey being poured over someone fall head in a bear trap. Funny that anyone would need such a large bear trap in a small British town, unless perhaps he appointed a head. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah, who made the "Wild Bunch" that transmits the theme treated blood, the violence in which no one was spared. But it was done in style, and you believed it. Straw Dogs is not credible. First, the place is wrong and does not work. Why place it in England? I might think in a downtown location or in a small town in the American South of the 1930s or so. Secondly, in my view, it is never really clear why these men are so violent unless they got drunk and felt the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. Sam Peckinpah missed the goal of this.
