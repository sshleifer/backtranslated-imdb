First let me say, the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks great and the CGI is done well. It's a shame that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment, <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS BELOW ******** <br /> <br /> by The opening scene in which we can see this movie is anti-American. Normally, this kind of stereotyping would not bother me (we Brits get enough out of Hollywood). It goes beyond the point of realism and your left is wondering if a Yank has raped the director's mother. <br /> <br /> The grief scene was really poor and the part of the movie that is going downhill <br /> Here we are introduced to the Olympic medal winner Aunt and the drunken uncle who enter the memorial and the father accuse for the death of his daughters. Then they beat him before they all roll around on the ground. Hardly realistic bond in times of crisis! <br /> <br /> The whole side extension of the virus is ridiculous. If Americans know there is no virus, why waste time, money and resources on the investigation? The US government agent orders the brain hole of an innocent Korean for nothing and makes the Americans look evil (or stupid), which has not helped this guy was crossed for comical reasons with the eyes. > The movie is about the hunt for the monster. US and Korean special forces are assigned to find the creature, although they are not visible throughout the movie. The only people who hunt the monster all over Korea are the main family and an occasional tramp that appears in the end to save the day! Of course, some US / Korean agents are trying to stop them on the way. <br /> <br /> The nurse was only in the movie so she could make the deciding shot in the end. It was a clich√©, you knew it was going to happen, but to make matters worse, it annoys everything up to this part! and my last trouble, how the hell did the kid end up surviving? The monster had been swimming underwater for about 5 minutes! Why did not the monster eat the kids at all?
