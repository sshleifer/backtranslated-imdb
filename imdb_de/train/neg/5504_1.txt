There is no possible reason why I can find the reason why this movie was ever made. Why does Hollywood still need to continue a terrible update of one classic after another? (Examples: Mister Magoo, The Avengers - awful!) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, whom I usually like, was miserably misfitted in this role. His manic portrayal of our beloved "Uncle Martin" is so incredible that he is almost criminal. His chattering, groaning, grimacing, and histrionics give us no reason to care about his character except as a one-dimensional cartoon character. "Slapstick had a certain resemblance to the comedy, apparently telling EVERY ACTOR to pretend that he had they have red ants in their pants. <br/> <br/> Mistake must be with the irresponsible script I think the author has "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" as an example of a good comedy script As manic as this classic of 1963 is, it is far superior to this claptrap, in fact, it suddenly looks pretty good. <br /> <br /> What's saddest to this movie is that it seems to be written I was just not sure who the children were made for, certainly not a self-respecting, carded kid that I know! <br /> <br /> If they are "My Favorite Martian " again why did not they add the timeless charm of the original classic? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com can not consider the rating "zero" for its readers, this is the only assessment that comes to mind when describing this travesty. <br /> <br /> A good thing came from this movie, the actors and the crew were paid - I think.
