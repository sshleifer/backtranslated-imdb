Beverly garland was born at the wrong time. She was an actress who was ahead of her time and who gave power and grace to even lame movies like the Corman movies in which she starred. In Gunslinger, she is the wife of the city sheriff. He is released, so she takes his job to persecute his killers. It is far better than the material it works with. The film is gray, stilted and mostly boring. There are (unwanted) humor with the tire marks everywhere, people are running up behind one building and suddenly appearing in front of another (I heard from wrong fronts, but that's ridiculous!) And the really stupid plotline of the newly widowed sheriff fell in love the guy who was hired to kill her. Even if she had not loved her husband, only a week or two had passed since his death! And in the end she finally shoots the guy to death. No luck with men, this one here. <br /> <br /> The villain of the play is another woman, the salon owner. She plans to buy a piece of land just in case the railroad goes through and makes her rich. Her action plan is, if not quite lame, she'll just steal as much of the city as she can and skate. Hell, it's just her and her weapon in the end against a whole city. Tell me, these people are not armed? Look at what happened in real Old West towns when bank robbers came to rob the bank. Then they were mowed down by armed and dangerous city dwellers in a hail of bullets. <br /> <br /> There's a lot. It was useless to walk around and ride around, interspersed with a few lame gunfights. The end is as grim as usual in a Corman movie, though luckily it lacks the moral proselytizing that took place in It Conquered the World. The sheriff gives her badge to Sam Bass and rides into the sunset, though the movie was so gray you've never seen the sun.
