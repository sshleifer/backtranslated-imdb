This movie is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran the one of Olivier and Malikka as the perfect fraudulent wife of Lane. They have changed the second half of the movie to suit the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even then, the film has the full traces of Unfaithful, although he could not catch up with the original. It was a cheap, soft porn of the Bollywood lovers, in which Mallika showed much more skin than one would have dared. Emran played more in this role and was even referred to as a serial killer. If Indian directors intend to revise an English film, they will need to consider the feasibility of conspiring with Indian censors in the future. Although the film was bombed at the box office, the actors received the inappropriate recognition. In the future, directors should be more cautious in repeating an Oscar-nominated film. All in all, this is not a family movie, so be extra cautious when looking at it at home with your family.
