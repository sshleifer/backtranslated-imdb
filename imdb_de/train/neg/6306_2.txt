In a video store I can see some movies and occasionally I try to watch some of the not so big movies. Pride happened to be one of them. The initial idea of ​​telling the story of a mainly black crew ship during World War II had some merit. But in less than 10 minutes watching the movie, you realize that the main point of the film was to tell about inter-race tensions in World War II. The underlying story is about the ship, the crew and their achievements in the war. This primary point is hammered to excess during the entire movie. I commend the men who served on the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and the hardships they had to endure. A film should have been made focusing on the achievements that these men made for themselves, the navy, and their country, rather than making a film that focuses on racism in World War II.
