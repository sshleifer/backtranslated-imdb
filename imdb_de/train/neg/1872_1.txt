BE WARNED. This movie is such a mess. It's a disaster. Do not waste your time with this. I warned you! <br /> <br /> The acting, the story, the dialogue, the music ... basically everything is so exaggerated, it is absolutely annoying and ridiculous. It made me want to throw myself over (if dialogue / acting / history did not do it, everyone will be shot crooked). You will look like a comedy. The problem is that the parts that are supposedly funny are not even funny. The drama, the story, the cinematography, you feel that WAAAAY is just too hard - but it never succeeds. Practically every shot is tilted, but what the hell ?! This movie just feels like a student movie. No wonder they shot this in HD because it would be a waste to spend more to make it into the movie Clich√©s, everything that's forced into your face, oh, and did I mention bad action? (Well, not only is the actor to blame - it's the director!) Then I guess you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to look at this for a lesson. I would have turned it off immediately if I could. If you still can not recognize it, I hated this movie. I wanted to vomit and regain my time. At least I did not have to pay for this garbage. Jeff Goldblum, you know ... the guy from Jurassic Park / Independence Day is in this movie, but he went downhill from then on - he accepted roles for movies like this disaster.
