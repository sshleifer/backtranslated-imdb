"Triumph of Love" proves that not every Comédie Française author, who uses disguised crossdressing like Shakespeare, is worth a visit. <br /> <br /> Or perhaps something has been lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux, a dramatist inspired by Commedia Dell Arte, of which Brittannica says: "His nuanced feel and clever pun has become known as Marivaudage." <br /> <br /> While Mira Sorvino enjoys dangling three jumbled romance, her trouser roll was not even Cherubino in "The Marriage of Figaro". <br /> <br /> The intrusive editing is annoying and just seems to point out that a lot of takes were required for each long speech. <br /> <br /> Best was Fiona Shaw as a cuckold and costume. <br /> <br /> The looks of the audience we see and the closing curtain that winks that this is all workmanship do not really help. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 29.05.2002)
