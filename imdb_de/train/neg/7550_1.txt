OK, so I'm a real Wicker Man fan and usually I do not like British films recreated by Americans. So why did I take myself through the most painful cinema experiences of all time? I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan and maybe I had a moment of madness? The movie was horrible! The play in the beginning with the crash / fire had no relevance to the movie at all and the cop knew where Edward would go, so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland the whole thing would have been investigated. The story behind the willow knight was not really explored - and I think it did not really help to play in America. This movie was slow and contained no atmosphere or tension. I have to say, the best was over when Nicolas Cage went up in flames! I need a desperate need to see the original again to cleanse my disappointed soul. I really can not stress how disappointing this movie is. Please do not see him if you: <br /> <br /> A) I do not like British Movies American B moves B) You are a fan of the original C) I hate Nicolas Cage
