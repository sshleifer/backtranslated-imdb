I will not waste my time writing an essay and wasting your time. However, I would like to say that those who are upset about this movie are totally ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can not play this card, and I mean the nationalist patriotic card, so that people will not see this movie. This is a film that expresses its free will in this country (oh yes, I played this card), even though the director is German and deserves a slap on the wrist every time he reaches for a camera, but the World is full of controversy It's the same thing you've heard before, like the GTA controversy. It's a comedy, laugh and be disgusted, not all disgusted, its dark humor and obviously you do not have the heart to endure it, the past is over, yes, people remember the lost, but it's time to move on was !!! 7 !!! years ago. You can still see this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> Also, am I crazy and who needs a soul?
