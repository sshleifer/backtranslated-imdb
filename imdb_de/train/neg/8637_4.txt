More of a mystery movie with some free horror elements; Mediocre overall. <br /> <br /> It starts with a woman who has a nightmare in which her sex partner gets out of bed, goes into her crying child's room and kills it. She wakes up. Then this man dies in a hospital and spits blood. His estranged daughter arrives and he manages to contact her through her dreams (I think), and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body completely decomposes in his grave. <br /> <br /> puzzle about who did it or even how; Most viewers will have found this out well before the discovery. I'm not sure how he would have been killed. Anyway, the horror elements come through: a bloody autopsy, the recurring dream of the man who killed the boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turns into eyes that are being cut, and several settings of the decay man both in nightmares and indeed in his grave. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised when I saw a dedication from Fulci to Clive Barker! Interesting.
