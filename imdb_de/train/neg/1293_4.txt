I'm probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this movie. As visually stunning as all the work of Ang Lee (each still seems to be worth a print), I was really disappointed with the film's incoherent tempo. It was really too long. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in Missouri from the time of the Civil War and is about a young man (Roedel), who joins the wild forces of Bushwackers, a kind of renegade Confederate sympathizers, the Geurilla conduct type fights with the Jayhawkers, her colleague in the Union. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles, played by Skeet Ulrich join the group after Chile's father was shot at close range and his house is believed to be burned by Jayhawkers. The story tells of Roedel's and Chiles' looters and their interactions with other war victims, including a former slave who fights for the Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt, played by Jeffery Wright), and a war widow played by Jewel. <br /> <br /> It seemed that every time he turned the story into an interesting point, the movie turned to another subplot and left things undeveloped. For example, the agitation under the Roedel group caused by the former slave Holt, who is involved in the Confederate cause, is briefly outlined by some conflicts of decency and protocol and then dropped in the film until later , A young Bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and sets up a lot of fear and violence against him, but we never know why. Some of the characters never seem to dive; I think that's because the movie hugs too many of them and takes on a lot of history. <br /> <br /> The historical detail was excellent. I liked looking at the cases, furniture, clothes, etc., and I thought that the main characters wonderfully humanized the characters, although they stumbled a bit with the dialogue. If you really enjoy the story or are a big fan of Ang Lee, you should get that passport.
