When I saw Robotboy for the first time, I found it fresh and interesting, but then I noticed that with every episode, this show tries to teach you how to behave, which is good / bad. Episodes became predictable. And main characters are not interesting. Again we see a hyper-intelligent boy being beaten by his older brother, parents who do not understand their child, and his friends: girl and fat boy. This show has no logic either. A super-modern robot that works with two AA batteries and can use many weapons. The biggest problem, however, is the difference between enabled and super-activated modes. We see two different robots and reject the basic idea of ​​the show: "Robot must learn how it behaves in human society"
