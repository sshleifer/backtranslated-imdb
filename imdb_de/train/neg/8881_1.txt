The character looks a bit stiff, as if it were the first time a man appeared on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the better actresses, Jean Simmons (played many roles on television, as in Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night), dies quickly and after that her acting can be clearly missed. <br /> <br /> The lead role is Mr. Ballard, as depicted by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to wear this movie most of the time with his body language. He does not do a bad job, but it's a bit of an exaggeration to stuff an actor's oceans with empty screen time, when the characters do NOT talk or act their time. Robertsons most memorable role could have been Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man films (with Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. A husband murders his rich wife for her money. After that, the woman seems to return and persecute the husband who drives him mad until he jumps out of the high window (afraid of the ghost that his dead wife is approaching him) on the day he is expected to be no less The second chauffeur hired by Mr. Ballard looks like an English brand Hamill. Really scary! The only thing that stands out is the total disregard of the dialogue. Many minutes pass in peace, nobody speaks, and few act. It's a shame the MST3K guys never got this movie. It could have been much better, if not as predictable, with more dialogue or shorter scenes of "nothingness". I've always expected G'Mork's red eyes to pop out of the shadows and proclaim him work for the "nothing" that inhabits this movie.
