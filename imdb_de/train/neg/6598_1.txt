This "movie" is a travesty. No, wait - an abomination. NO, WAIT - this is without doubt the most WONEST movie ever made with beloved characters created by other actors. <br /> <br /> I thought of "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin (!) Instead of Peter Sellers was ridiculous and sacrilegious, but even the daring to remake Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy is dishonest and greedy. <br /> <br /> Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy have been dead since 1957 and 1965, respectively. Why anyone could imagine that suitable updates for L & H would be in the person of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain me a puzzle. I was fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed, and I was not disappointed. Anyone involved in this miserable, feeble shame should be struck down by everything and everything that has to do with Hollywood and filmmaking. AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS - YOU WILL BE WARNING DULY.
