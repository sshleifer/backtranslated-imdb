There are few uplifting things, but I can mention that Matt Dillon does his best to make something out of nowhere, and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile. Since most racing films suffer from the premise that car lovers are not so intelligent, we end up in films like this one. Lindsay Lohan, who has surprised so much in Mean Girls, needs to make better decisions about which roles he plays. Here she can only fail. <br /> <br /> Children are mildly entertained because they are more adults than children (though they are still pretty stupid). Those in the theater with whom I saw it showed no real interest after a few minutes. And as a family sports movie that's awful. The better moments begin at Scrapyard to create some feeling, and later at the Car-bash festival, which creates some tension. If you develop a car as a central character, you have to develop it better than here. After some compulsory racing scenes you have the best: you can leave the multiplex in your own car.
