** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Mia (Helin) returns from the capital Stockholm to rural Rättvik to celebrate her dad's 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest child and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik, and Gunilla divorced and moved a city away. Mia is still single and concentrates on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and almost hostility between the sisters and conflicts occur everywhere when they face each other and each has personal issues that he can not handle. As the party goes on (and alcohol is consumed), more and more secrets are revealed and more and more conflicts arise. Watch this movie in exactly the same tracks that older Swedish comedies / dramas have been following for years. There are really no new elements or ideas. This movie is based on three basic areas. 1) Embarrassing humor that only consists of fooling characters. 2) sadness and 3) fear. This movement has forgotten the focus on the last, almost the first point as the movie progresses. No loss, because the humor is not funny. The appearances of the cast are good, I think, though they are lost behind all the agony and will soon be forgotten. I had hoped that there would be new ideas and influences, but there were none. In the end, there are better ways to spend your time than to look at it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
