The author of the book with the same title should not have used her name for this film. If you've read the book, this film interprets the actual events and the mind so liberally that film and book, with the exception of the title and some superficial details, seem to have little in common. In terms of artistic value, the film adds nothing to the literary performance of the book. <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the book: they will also be disappointed. Not only does the storyline move at an unbelievably slow pace, it also does not offer anything when moving slowly (such as character development). Some viewers will be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later in the film, but you can also see a Showtime special for what they're showing in Therese and Isabelle - it's pretty tame and not at all imaginative.
