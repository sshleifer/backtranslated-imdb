I can not say that this is the worst movie ever made, but I personally think so, because when he first appeared in theaters, the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted that we see him Actually, we STOOD IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) it's still the only "serious" movie I remember when the audience started giggling at a certain point and basically watching the movie to laugh at the rest of the way. When we reached the notorious (and endless) battle scene, everyone gave up. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say is the lush location. Oh, and there are Bos Breasts, too, though their play is so wooden that nudity is not exotic and is little more than a playboy image. <br /> <br /> The "dramatic tension" in this film lies between Bo's terrible acting and the terrible direction of her husband. The snake fight must be one of the most incompetent action sequences ever filmed. However, this is one of those films that is bad enough. It may be worthwhile to look at unintentional humor. Definitely the worst movie I ever paid.
