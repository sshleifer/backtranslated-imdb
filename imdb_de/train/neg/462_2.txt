This must be considered one of the worst movies ever. Terrible drama, terrible script ... and those were the good points! One to definitely miss! The jokes, if you could call them that, were so predictable that they were pathetic. Pamela Anderson still relies on her body to divert the fact that her acting is just as plastic! I sat ready to give him a chance and hoped that would improve, which unfortunately was not the case! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you choose to read it well! I like Denise Richards, which is why I tried this movie, but why she makes herself appear in this film is a mystery to me!
