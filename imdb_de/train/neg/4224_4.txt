STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** just misses the mark *** This little bit in between ** Afterward * The Pits <br /> <br /> On this debut for Nick Park's beloved husband and dog, they are forced to fly to the moon when good old Wallace runs out of cheese. <br /> <br /> This W / G adventure is the shortest feature at just 22 minutes and even the earliest it somehow shows. The modeling clay animation is a bit creaky and funny. It reminds of the Mork animation about the little man in the box. <br /> <br /> Although the craftsmanship behind it is admirable, I've never been so busy Wallace & Gromit (maybe a bit too clean and too traditional for someone my generation.) The only one I really enjoyed The Wrong Trousers (and that was more of the past when I was younger and less conscious, let's say the seedling joys of life.) I was anxious to make that early effort due to the resurgence of popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent To actively search film adaptation. Technically impressive like the first two (all things considered!) This lacks the emotional angle that his followers should possess. Apart from that, it makes a lot of fun on the first try and certainly sets the standard for the biggest thing to come. Two stars, but good two stars. **
