Early movie by D.W. Griffith; it features a delightfully happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the king leaves the scene, his queen plays with the minnesinger of the castle (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovers the lovers, he decides to make a terrible revenge on Edgar Allen Poe. It's hard to believe that the lovers can not hear this conspiracy against them. Although the actors try to look alternately loud (the lovers) and calm (the cement mixers). The sets make "The Sealed Room" very staged. The performances are fine and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** The Sealed Room (02.09.09) D.W. Griffith Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B.
