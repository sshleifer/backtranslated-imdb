As the title picture "The hamlet of our time, for our time" says. <br /> <br /> I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet right after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was really a disappointing experience /> <br /> This release goes into several aspects of the game, including sexuality. a VERY VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (60s) this was a very well made version of Hamlet, but can not be compared to the full version of Branagh Australia) and I'm looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD that I can buy if there is anything at all. If anyone knows about it, tell me.
