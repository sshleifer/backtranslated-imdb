The upcoming attractions of "The Order" make it seem like a decent horror mystery / thriller, but what we get is a conspiracy that has the potential to be excellent and all thrown together to form a garbage heap. First Once the entire movie is made up of horrible dialogues and God's terrible special effects. Acting was not something to be proud of, but Keath Ledger (I think I wrote that right) saved the movie in this category. <br /> <br /> For God's sake: DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!
