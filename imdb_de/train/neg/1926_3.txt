I have been forced by my children to see this at least ten times for each of the last two Christmas celebrations, and I feel adequately qualified to receive this version of Dr. Ing. To judge Seuss' classic story. First of all, it will be difficult for anyone to follow a classic act like the animated TV special by Chuck Jones, but this interpretation is so cumbersome and padded that it positively stuns. I admit that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall, the movie comes out as calculated cash, while at the same time barring the commercialization of Christmas. Jim Carrey is usually over the top, but that does not match the character of the Grinch. Boris Borstoff was a slow fire; methodical and smart. There is no method for Carrey's madness, and that is just the most obvious mistake. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are completely wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will do almost any role offered (much like his fellow countryman Michael Caine), but this one has to be put under "films that should never be done". This is not a good sign for the cat in the hat, an even thinner case that Universal is preparing for this Christmas. I have the feeling that I will make the same recommendation as I do with this one: skip it and either read the book or watch the TV special. These are 2 hours you can never get back.
