This movie looked promising but was actually pretty bad. The premise was OK, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors tried their best with limited material, but could not rise above the average vivacity of this sticky college movie. Jason Schwartzman was once again very irritating - even more than in Rushmore the rest of the cast was quite uneventful. Scenes that were supposed to be fun turned out to be disgusting and unbelievably youthful. Trying to be a Road Trip / American Pie, however, fails gloomily on all levels. A total waste of everyone's time.
