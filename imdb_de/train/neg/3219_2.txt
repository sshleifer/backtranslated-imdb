Someone called Howard Koch a beater, but he wrote the screenplay for "Casablanca," right? Or does not he have. Maybe more than one cook is sneaking around in Hollywood, and I do not like "Casablanca" anyway. Wait a minute - yes, there's another Howard cook running around in Hollwyood. That's the one who wrote "Casablanca". No matter. I will pay as much attention to this commentary as Howard W. Koch has put into this production, that is, just a little bit. <br /> <br /> Do you know what that sounds like? Someone read Cliff's notes about Shakespeare's "King Lear" and decided, as there were no original thoughts aboard the Inbound Inspiration Express, to update it and Hollywoodize with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to divide his huge estates between three sisters and asks them how much they love him. Two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose to get his money. The third is the good girl and refuses to operate on Lear. But in the play, Lear lives to repent of his decision, to give his reserves to the two connoisseurs and to rob the honest girl. He wraps himself insane and naked during a storm in the moors, puts flowers in his hair and hallucinates. Children can do that for you. (Take, for example, my child, after all the effort I've wasted growing up, does it show an interest in becoming a doctor or lawyer?) Finally, everyone dies in the game. <br /> <br Obviously the good sister in the movie is grumpy and suicidal, but when she tries to leave herself, someone jumps in and rescues her, so the end is more or less happy. That's the difference between Hollywood and a real tragedy, unless you define Hollywood as a sufficient tragedy for itself.
