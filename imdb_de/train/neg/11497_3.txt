This warning about anti-Semitism is well-intentioned and may have had its purpose, but it is made without the slightest idea how to make a movie. The director has no idea of ​​staging; The cast varies from bad to bad. <br /> <br /> The great Austrian comic Hans Moser is wasted. In his part he ends up in a lunatic asylum, which as a set of Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari is designed. One wonders if the makers had all their mental abilities. <br /> <br /> The restored copy (Dutch Film Museum) that I have seen gives the impression that some scenes were not placed in the right place, but the original editing was bad too.
