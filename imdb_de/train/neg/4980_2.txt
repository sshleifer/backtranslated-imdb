I've just read a review that defends this movie because it had a low budget, now my views on things. <br /> <br /> The CGI monsters were reasonably well animated, but were implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes were not even a fight, it was just an actor's shot, then a shot of a monster with a lot of interaction. When the monster interacted, it looked like it had been done in Paint Shop Pro. I think you should use models and dolls if you have a low budget. They may not look very fancy, but at least they interact with each other, just look at the early films of Peter Jackson. As for acting, Beowulf did a relegation job, but the rest of the cast either did not try it or forgot where to go. <br /> <br /> The script seemed confused. In a minute, they would talk as if it were a modern day, and in the next, you'll get a drama club talk by Shakespeare. I'm not saying it should all be "you" and "that's it", but you have to find a coherent balance so that the lines sound as if they came from the same person. <br /> <br /> I've noticed one thing before the start, when Beowulf quoted the old testament that would have been found if he had not spent the rest of the movies talking about the gods and omens. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is a little bit damn damn, but still a twist.
