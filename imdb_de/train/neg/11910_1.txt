Interesting is the actors; was not bad, just not enough. It was rather lame. Special effects or lines were the only reason for this failure. Standing alone they were not so bad, but taken together was a tragic step. The show seemed lengthy and slow with special effects that were apparently designed to get the movie going, but failed completely. They were kind of cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor. Although maybe she was everything they chose to do with a bit of fan recognition. An experienced actress would have done something that Appleby never did. Scfi publishes some really good original movies, it's just too bad that this has failed so drastically.
