If you have not seen the gong show TV series yet, you will not like this movie at all. Not knowing that the series is going to be a great movie. <br /> <br /> I give 5 out of 10 points because some things cause the amusing problems to be solved. <br /> <br /> 1) It's a funny snapshot of it was made in the late 70's and early 80's. 2) You get a lot of funny cameos from people you saw on the show. 3) It's interesting to see Chuck (the presenter) if he does not broadcast his TV personality. 4) You can see a lot of bizarre people doing all kinds of craziness as you see them in the TV series. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the bad things, since there are many, but here are some of the most prominent ones. <br /> <br /> 1) The Gong Show Movie contains many of the current TV broadcast clips that get tired at movie length. 2) The storyline of the film outside of the clip segments is very weak and essentially consists of only one plot point. 3) Chuck is actually reasonably decent as an actor, but most of the other actors make a typical journey across the flatness of the 70s. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to watch, if you do not have one and a half hours you want to see everyone at the same time. Watch each 20 minutes and it's not that bad. But even then it is not so good. ;)
