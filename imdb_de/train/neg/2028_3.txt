On the surface, "Show Me The Money" should have ended at least a full season. They had entertaining William Shatner as the host, surrounded by a dozen bakers of beautiful, long-legged models, collectively known as "The Million Dollar Dancers." They had knowledgeable competitors who told interesting stories from their lives and probably knew about many pop culture trifles. And you had big money! So, what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of this game was the mistake. A good game show requires at least two out of three things: very simple rules, exciting tempo, and the viewer's ability to play at home. The best and most consistent have all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM had none. <br /> <br /> The rules for this game were among the most complex primetime game shows in history. Let me try to explain how the game works as short as possible. <br /> <br /> A candidate started with a single word or a short phrase, followed by the letters A, B, C (subtle connector for the network?). ). Each letter was linked to a separate question that all started with that word or phrase. Once a competitor chooses one of the letters, they can either answer that question or select a second letter. If they had passed, they could see the next question and have the same opportunity. However, if they had passed the second question, they had to answer the third option. After they had answered and before they found out if their answer was correct, they had to select one of the 13 dancers on the stage, each with a different amount of money in a scroll by his side. They revealed their dollar amount (between $ 20,000 and $ 250,000) and depending on whether the competitor responded correctly ... or incorrectly, this amount is added to or subtracted from his pot. <br /> <br /> with me so far? There was also a dancer who held something known as The Killer Card. If you selected the dancer with the killer card and your question was asked correctly, you were safe and the game continued. However, if you were wrong, you had one last question to answer. If you misunderstood this last question, you were out of the game. If you got it right, the game went on. <br /> <br /> There was no stopping, no leaving with the money you earned, until you either answered six questions correctly or misunderstood six questions or you were so far through the hole you could not earn enough money to get out again. I have it? OK! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem, as I saw it, was a complete lack of tension, due to the design of the game. One candidate could ask questions that he knew they did not know, and answer many questions he knew, reducing the pressure even further. Then they could still find a small dollar amount, even after they had knowingly missed a question, which meant that there was still no "drama". And the fact that they were able to answer five questions incorrectly and still have a chance to win was a big mistake. And the pace of the questions was deadly slow: Often the questions were so obvious that it was ridiculous to try to build tension, as if there were doubts about some of the most common answers. <br /> <br /> The Tempo The absence of any tension during the show and these very complicated rules prevented this program despite Shatner's Terpsichoric talents.
