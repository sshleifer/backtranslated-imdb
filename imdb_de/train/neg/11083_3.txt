This movie was late at night when I saw it. At first it was interesting, but it did not convince me altogether. I'm not a Tyson fan. In fact, I do not like boxing at all. It is barbaric, obscene, and double sided (by society) that some get money when they beat each other up. Actors okay, especially George C. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I do not know how reliable the strip is. I have not read books and books about boxing or Tyson. I do not know anything about the man, but it was pretty entertaining. <br /> <br /> As the movie progressed, I felt that he lost some of his charm and that I also lost interest. I was able to stay awake, but the last hour was just not good enough.
