In 1692, Salem, a deceitful child, sent lies about the involvement of a slave in witchcraft, sending a whole community into turmoil. Costume drama with Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not stuffy, though it's not a graphic depiction of contagious hysteria. The story elements, written by three authors (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead, and Bradley King), are quite interesting (especially from Hollywood in 1937), but for everyone, Arthur Miller's "The Crucible," The one exhibited here Melodrama will not be tolerated for long. The biggest problem with the image may be in the casting: Colbert and MacMurray are a badly matched pair of lovers, which is hampered by the witch hunt. MacMurray is far too contemporary for this environment. * 1/2 of ****
