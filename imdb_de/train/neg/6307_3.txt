I'll give him a 3 just because it showed the story we need to know to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the remarks of the British gentleman. The movie was pretty awful. All stereotype, no real conspiracy. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Take a look at the specifications on DE 529 or any Destroyer escort in the Everts class, and you'll see what I mean. I am now a black history month in the US, and I am called a racist just because I said that, but the history of this ship is not great. They did escorted work, hunted a "submarine" that turned out to be Hulk they rammed. I'm sorry, but black people did much more in World War II than they deserved in this silly movie. This movie makes her look like a whine. Let the name call, I can handle it.
