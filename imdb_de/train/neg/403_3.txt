Another violent, angry fantasy by Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a mystery: it is difficult to say whether he takes his dirty impulses seriously with sardonic intent or completely oblivious. He also seems to be completely unaware that all the brilliant images of the world (and this has some outstanding ones) can not hide a negligence in the story, the dialogue and the performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a sympathetic actor who occasionally shows his dark side ("The River Wild") to balance his boyish gaze. However, considering the material, Bacon is not nearly hateful enough to force him. The other main characters are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, none of whom have the necessary skills to make a solid impression, and who embarrass themselves when forced to engage in a crazy dialogue. The highlight is a study on overweight, and unbelief really needs to be suspended.
