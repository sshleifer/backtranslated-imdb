If someone does not enlighten me, I really have no idea what this movie is about. It looks like a picture with a message, but it is far from it. This film tells a meaningless story of a New York press agent and his problems. And that's basically everything. If this agent is played by Pacino, you have to think that it has to be something important. However, it is not difficult to think about how meaningless and boring this movie is. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the other is "Simone"), which deserves the title of "The Most Dull and Pointless Film of the Year". So, what's up, Al?
