I am a christian. However, I have always been skeptical of films made by Christians. As a rule, they are "knowledge" when it comes to film production. I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus positively and honestly on the screen. But they did a terrible job. Acting was horrible, and if you're not familiar with the Bible, you CAN not have understood what the movie was trying to convey. The movie was not only made terrible, but the people who made it even had some facts wrong. In this "critique," however, these facts are irrelevant and too profound to address. In short, the omega code is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen, and I would not recommend it to anyone except the comic relief of everyday life.
