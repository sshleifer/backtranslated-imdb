The original movie Man From Snowy River is one of the best I've ever seen, almost perfect. A Lady and the Tramp Action in Two Directions - Rich Girl / Poor Boy and Ability Vs. Bloodline. However, the sequel is not only a shameless attempt to use the good name of the original, but also a ridiculous, exaggerated Disneyfied chaos, best summarized as "Rambo Meets the Black Stallion". Without the charm of the black stallion. The young hero comes back from a three-year absence and suddenly he is Superman on horseback; In the original, good movie, he was real and believable, but was subsequently reduced to a cartoon. I was hardly so disappointed in a movie and sometimes this thing made me pretty angry - they hardly missed a clich√©. Outrageous public manipulation - do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience is to put pretty horses in front of them to make them happy? A mess of a movie.
