This movie was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had difficult times to see it through to the end. I saw this Rodney guy in Natural Born Killers and thought he was damn funny, but this movie was crap. The "jokes" were not funny, actors were not funny, anything about it was not that funny at all. Do not waste your time on it! The only positive thing about it were the beautiful women :) and Molly Shannon, who certainly did her best, but the script was just too horrible. That's why I rated it "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
