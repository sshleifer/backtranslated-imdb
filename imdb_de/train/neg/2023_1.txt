As the summary says, you have just made the most ignorant comment I've ever heard on a role play. They seriously thought they were gay? Are you mentally handicapped? If you wanted to save your best friend and someone with a good heart decides to help you, then you have a heavy debt to this man. Lavitz was a good person and every time they helped each other, they came closer than friends. They were not gay lovers, as you make fun of it. And to let you know that the game is set in a medieval period. At the time, women were preparing meals while the men were fighting. Do you even know your story? Do you know how long it took for women to join the army today? This game contains a lot of realism, even if you're too slow to catch it, and you really have to spy out solid evidence, rather than ignorant assumptions based on your misguided act to interpret the story.
