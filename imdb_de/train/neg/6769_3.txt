An error. The movie was just not good. It has humor that 5-year-olds will not even giggle. Sure, some parts were amusing, but most of it is not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer), and she should work on better films. The film should have been aired as an original Disney Channel movie that is FREE. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was the music. Nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to beautify your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy Song, Fun Fun Fun. 4 out of 10 points. If I gave it a 10, 9 of it would be the music and 1 would be the movie. Not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.
