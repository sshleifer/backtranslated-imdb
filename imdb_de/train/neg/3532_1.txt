It's as if you were taking over the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, taking away all of their style and teaching and mixing them with a lot of presumptuous New Wave "I'm intellectual" so that my movie is hard to understand, in one a few extra styles mixed, chopped off, finally cut off, there you have revolvers. Yes, I thought a little bit after watching it, and yes, it was nice, but it does not make sense that it's garbage. <br /> <br /> waste of money. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> Since the worst movie I've ever seen, it's not even a bad movie value that can redeem it.
