As an inspiring director, it was exciting to see this film critically. Taken with low-end digital camera, probably with 35mm adapter for DOF. The cut is decent, the sound effects are not over the top. I would have given a 7 for an indie movie, but the story is not that interesting. It's more on the drama side, character developments than a horror movie. <br /> <br /> It's not for those who want to get scared frightened or popcorn together to just enjoy it. Honestly, this movie would be fine if we were in the 50s. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family that has a dry field, and that's just it.
