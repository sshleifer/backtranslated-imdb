Mary Pickford becomes the head of a Scottish clan after the death of her father and then has a romance. As the commentator Snow Leopard said, the film is quite episodic. Some of them are amusing, like Pickford whipping his clanmen into the church while others are just there. All in all, the story is weak, especially the recycled, invented romance and its climax. The transmission is so dark that it is difficult to appreciate the scenery, but even taking that into consideration, this does not seem to be the best work by director Maurice Tourneur. Pickford and Tourneur collaborated again on the more accessible "The Poor Little Rich Girl," in which they typed Pickford as a child figure.
