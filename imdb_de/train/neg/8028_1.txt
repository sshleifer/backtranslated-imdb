You're welcome! Do not waste money on this movie. It really is nothing but a boring German Blair Witch rip-off made by some high school kids. I could not finish it, and usually I like to watch all kinds of B movies. How on earth could you find a distributor for it? !!! Funny though: Visit Wikipedia for "Dark Area". The guy who wrote the entry must be completely crazy. Maybe he got a lot of money from the producers. Money to spend for actors, camera and editing. Even that would not have helped, because behind this movie absolutely no interesting idea. Unfortunately, "dark area" has already attracted too much attention. Please, director, producer and author of this film. Stop making such films ... you do not do yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this film.
