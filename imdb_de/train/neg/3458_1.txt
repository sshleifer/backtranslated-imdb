Usually I am not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so agonizing that I feel like I have to. I writhed at the terribly predictable plot that Lame played and laughed at moments that should be tense. Most viewers were bored and talkative even in the "tense" moment of the movie. Molly Ringwald was the only performance of any kind in a tortured production. Even the "turn" in the end was not like that. I heard that the movie did not take itself seriously. However, I could find little evidence in the film. <br /> <br /> Cut should have stayed on the floor of the cutting room. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
