This is one of those movies that I remember when I was in the can for years before anything happened. I do not think it's terrible, but not really good. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is bland at best. The cast is pretty good in what they are given, but again you are only as good as the script. Baldwin directed, though I could have sworn that he did not fix everything. I thought I read somewhere or many re-shoots were not bad, but he definitely has some potential. Although his work on "30 Rock" is a genius, he should keep him busy for a while. I just hope that the show is graceful in his Seinfeld, but maybe not so long either. 9 years went. So if you want to watch a movie that you do not get much, but do not really hate, this is for you. I can not remember the last time a movie was packed for so long before it was finally released and only on DVD. It was nice to see Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins back together, as their excellent but not very many people have seen "The Edge". Get this great movie for real entertainment now.
