Leslie Sand's "Deadlock" game becomes a bad vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, shortly after their joint success in "All About Eve". After killing her husband, a woman completing the plan visits her husband's best friend, posing as her husband as soon as others stop at the house. Unfortunately, Irving Rapper, one of Bette's best directors of her best years, can not raise this ridiculous material, in which Davis is curiously cautious and reserved, to the horrendous finale (where, thankfully, she pulls out all the stops). Production and accompaniment of the occupation only secondary; only for Bette Davis completists. * 1/2 of ****
