The premise of the film is scary: A woman becomes pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a bar. <br /> <br /> But once the movie starts, a horrible opening scene finds it's a C-Sci-Fi TV movie. It's a big Star Trek and a bit of X-Files, but most of all, it's boring. <br /> <br /> When the movie comes into action, everything is predictable and a clich√©. It looked more like a two-parter in a bad sci-fi TV series. No tension and no thrill, but not for lack of attempts. Only many predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
