I see a lot of people who liked this movie. For me, this was a movie with the right to write 101 and the person failed in class. From the moment Lindsey Price appeared on the videographer, the film was very predictable. I was constantly checking to see if it went anywhere. <br /> <br /> First, we have the widowed young dad. Cliche # 1 movies / movies always kill the mother when the child is a girl, or a brood of boys, so that the single parent can fall over his dead wife and be utterly distracted while looking after the children. Starting from my 3 sons to 2 1/2 fathers. These films are usually dramas and comedies are TV programs. Cliche # 2 When an intrusive woman holds a video camera in her hand, she plays an important role in the film. And will always have solutions or even if this person is an airhead. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 3 If the person at risk is a foreigner, they must be from Latino. And they have to be illegal. Apparently, there are no legal Latinos and illegal Europeans, unless it is an IRA element. Cliche # 4 The said Latino must be highly educated in his native country. In this case, he was a professor who made 200 a month. And the well-educated Latino now has to behave as if he has no more sense in his head now and lets take the air side kick of the air. Cliche # 5 The crime that the person committed was really not a crime but an accident. But because in this case he lost everything he had when he crossed the border, he now behaves as a bleating idiot and has now endangered his own daughter by putting her on a fruitless search to the limit with the idiot side takes kick. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6 You never run across a stick runner who runs from a crime, but a poor little cute kid. This is because the child's parents need to play a large part of the movie and because the person who accidentally killed the child can have a ridiculous interaction with the parents. Cliche # 7 Give me a movie in which a cop is not the mad vet and they are paired with a beginner. Even if they are homicide detectives, they need to be the most experienced police officers. Sev7n and Copy cat and Law and Order come to mind immediately. And even if the veterinarian from the outside has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 8 Let's summarize some unemployed soap stars. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can not work her way out of a paper bag, and when she was Marty on One Life To Live, he swayed from right to left every time she opened her mouth. It made me sick. She could be better anchored on land now, but she still can not act. <br /> <br /> The movie might have been more revealing if it were not filled with stereotypes. I do not think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good. But that was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I will not spoil the end. Oh man, I'll do it because I think it will be a downside to humanity if someone wastes time, that he'll never see this movie again. It includes Cliché # 6 and # 7. Unless a person has never seen a movie before, you had to see what came. The dad also makes a stupid mistake that ends up being run by the cops and shot dead by the angry veteran who is suddenly very excited. You'd think she thought the poor guy was innocent throughout the movie, and she accidentally shot him. If she did not do Well to the little girl the father brought. Guess what's happening to her? Sometimes she lives with the family whose child was killed by her father !! Come on! They all knew that would happen because she is a substitute child !! Therefore she did not live with the Lindey Price character. <br /> <br /> This film was an insult to me. Because there were so many ways to explore this film, he went back, but he chose to take the cliché. The 2 stars are for two of the stars, the little girl that I thought was very good, and Lindsey Price, the character annoying, but she did what she could. My advice is to take a vice and squeeze my head with it instead of looking at that filth
