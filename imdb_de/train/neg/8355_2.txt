Wanda Nevada is a pubescent fantasy film that used around 1979 ideas of minor romanticism for 13-year-old girls. Script, step and direction are equally horrible. Action sequences defy belief. Characters speak with the simplified diction normally found in films for the sub-10 series, but they also include several sexual clues concerning the character of shields and graphic deaths. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be a comedy on a certain level, but it's never funny, it's an adventure image, but plot and action are bland, and a children's movie introduces pedophilia and rape as real possibilities. It also wants to be a buddy, a coming of age, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a travelogue and a western. The general effect is a massive stupidity with a nasty twist. Wanda Nevada is a waste of time, unless you want to see many great pictures of the Grand Canyon. That it works well.
