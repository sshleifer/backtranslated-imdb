The director explains in the feature Behind the Scenes that he loves horror movies. He loves her so much that he dedicated the movie to Dario Argento and other well-known directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. If you basically dedicate this movie to these great directors, give your mother a piece for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was the casting. People who can act. Do not throw 40-year-old persons into the role of a misunderstood, 18-year-old hermit. That's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. The reactions of people when they watch their friends rip their hearts out is amusing. Or as a part, when a man with an ear of corn in the ear is stung (haha), and his girlfriend simply says: "Oh ... my ... God?" The scarecrow itself is quite a figure. If you turn cars away and call people losers. <br /> <br /> The film has a redemption factor ... oh, do not wait movie than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the DVD. It handles everything and has a really crisp song type.
