Tell the Truth I'm a bit stunned to see all these positive reviews from so many people, which is also the main reason why I actually choose to watch this movie. And after I saw it, I was really disappointed, and that comes from the guy who loves this genre of film. I am surprised that this film is complete - it's like a nudity children's movie for no reason and all involves little kids cursing and cursing. I'm not righteous at all, but that really went too far in my account. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: The story of two guys was sent to the big brother program because of their reckless behavior. There they met with a child who was obsessed with one breast, and the other is a medieval freak. <br /> <br /> Only the name itself is not really connected to the story. They are not role models and do nothing but spend their time doing what they did. The story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. And have not we seen the same characters (played by Mc Lovin) in so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh three times and almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> Well, the casting was fine, after all, he's the one who produced the script. And the spectacle is as expected when you see this kind of movie. And the direction, what do you expect? This is the same guy who brought us the Wet Hot American Summer, and that movie is shit, too. But somehow he always managed to bring a star to wear his horrible movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, I did not feel totally smart, but a mere waste of time. Only the bare scenes seem to be the best part of the movie. Can I really understand why I recommend this to everyone? <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank Two topless scenes. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Not funny, horrible story, nudity and kids do not mix. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3,5 / 10 (Rating: F)
