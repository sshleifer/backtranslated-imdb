I was lured by the title ... I was expecting a revealing and intriguing journey into alcoholism, instead I got a rather boring and uninspiring story about a wild guy. The main character is not given much psychological depth, unless you are willing to classify cheesy, youthful poetry as psychology. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because the heart of the story could have been good, with a better effort to portray the inner feelings of a man who had been living with alcohol and violence since his youth. Unfortunately, the general idea seems more like "I'm the way I am, because that's me." And the laughingly bad attempt to give some kind of poetic edge to a lower man makes things even worse. The usual cliché of "Poète Maudit" reaches for a quick solution, a cheap way to make a boring film appear wise, artistic and meaningful. <br /> <br /> But "16 years of alcohol" is not the case of much clever, artistic or meaningful ... The main character does not develop at all and the faint attempt of change fails without a good explanation. Just as the first attempt was out of the blue. <br /> <br /> The film borrowed a lot from classics such as A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but in the end it can not get its size back, even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson has put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story and neglected the rest, giving us a movie that is pleasing to the eye but bland for the brain.
