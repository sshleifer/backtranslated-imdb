"American Nightmare" is in my opinion officially "It's Pat!" for the BAD FILM EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (very similar to the K-Mart version of the cast of "Friends") gather in a caf√© to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. It is hosted by a man with a beard. That's the most exciting aspect of his show. Chandler, Monica, Joey, and ... oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of the bad one-track spout that everyone takes away turns to the bearded DJ. Unknowingly, a crazy nurse / serial killer listens ... <br /> <br /> Crazy nurse then tortures Ross and Rachel and ... wait, apologize again ... bringing their fears to life , These fears include stunners like "voodoo" and old women with bits. "No". Really. <br /> <br /> This movie was rotting in a word. Crazy Nurse's rampage lacks motivation, there is nothing that makes the viewer jump, the end of the punches and - again - voodoo? <br /> <br /> If you pay no attention to your loved ones, hire "American Nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> If you care for your relatives, go to your local blockbuster, rent all copies of "American Nightmare" and hide them in your freezer.
