Boring, predictable and uninteresting story of a man who is contaminated by a chemical substance (Weller) and finds only his ex-wife and children throughout the country; In the meantime, he only kills everyone in his own way by a single touch of his hands. In his dangerous trail, a doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The film has a non-original premise but could be a lot better as well. The end result is just a movie with no moments or tension. Even the good cast is completely wasteful. I give a 4 (four).
