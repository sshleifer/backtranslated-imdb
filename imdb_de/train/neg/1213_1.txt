I can not believe Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger got involved in this garbage! The script is written so poorly and the direction is so weak (both by the same person) that it's hard to find more one-dimensional characters in a movie. The dialogues are so lame that this so-called thriller made the few fools who came to the theater laugh. The setup is tricky, inviting you to believe that you'll see a deterrent thriller and suddenly it becomes the stupidest chase film. Bassinger's character is so stupid that she actually stops screaming to God, "Where are you?" so people can follow her and then take a leak !!!! And then she seems to have fallen into the smallest wood in the world, I mean, she runs around and the killers never lose track, and this happens in the middle of the night. I'm really surprised that really the best people people write in Hollywood can see that they spend millions on the production.
