Dan Duryea, an absolutely decent B-movie actor who made many looking noirs in the 1940s, can not do much with this film: The young man is accused of murdering an unfortunate married singer; If sentenced to death, his wife decides to solve the case with the help of the dead woman's husband himself. After a stunning opening shot, the movie quickly becomes a B-movie formula. It certainly looks good, but the twist finish is colorless and the cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is just a bit stiff. Based on a Cornell Woolrich novel and passable for a single viewing. <br /> <br /> ** of ****
