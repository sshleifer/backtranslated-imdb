I have no idea how someone managed to stay awake. The acting was amateurs and amateurs, the story was old news and the development of the plot (or the absence of it) drove my eyelids down less than half of each episode. That's almost all you can say because it really lacked substance of any kind. <br /> <br /> How do you like this crap? It's damn stupid, it's an insult to your intelligence. I do not even know how to explain it anymore ... It's like some of you just stare at the trash just because you like actors who look like some actors, or because, for some crazy reason, you are not there. I've seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times. <br /> <br /> I just forget it. This show is shitty and luckily it's over forever. I wish they were working to demolish The O.C. once and for all.
