I remember, when THE GOLDEN CHILD came out in 1986, it was widely hacked by critics, and I speak so badly that it more or less ended Eddie Murphy's glittering career. I think this movie has something to offer /> <br /> It starts badly when Buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank face expression. Villains enter the temple <br /> <br /> Child sits with blank expression <br /> <br /> Villains hack the monks <br /> <br /> Child sits with blank expression <br /> <br /> Villains pull out a huge birdcage and put the kid inside, who is now sitting with them ... Well, guess what? They feel that even if they took him to Michael Jackson's Wonderland Ranch for an overnight stay, he would still give the same blank expression, this movie would better be titled THE WOODEN CHILD <br /> <br /> The. Carrying The title sequence begins and a movie from the 1980s is a pop soundtrack. Obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time, but now in 2004 it seems to be very outdated. Not only that, but it shines completely with the somewhat bloody opening. In fact, this is the main problem (and it's a serious problem) with this movie. The mood seems to change so much from scene to scene that sometimes it's like watching scenes from very different fused films together. I blame the director personally, but it should also be noted that both the writer and the producer should share the same debt. Did anyone know before the shoot what kind of movie this would be? It's part fantasy, part martial arts, part buddy movie, part comedy and everything is crap
