Not sure why this movie was advertised as a wild, quirky, laughing comedy. There is not much in this film that will amuse or amuse the moviegoer. Annette Bening (whose acting has been described as Oscar-worthy) comes here as artificial, their performance seems to be routine. Brian Cox's character is confusing and irritating, and starring Augusten ?? Joseph Cross ?? just does not seem to have the personality to carry his role. The best thing about the movie is Evan Rachel Wood, but it's not enough to support this boring, unappetizing movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has disappeared quickly, and that seems to be a good reason. I found some scenes uncomfortable (the scene with Brian Cox and his recently used Toilet Rival, some of the worst scenes in "You and Me and All We Know" and "The Squid and the Whale") unsettle her. I found the whole experience a waste of time. Do not you waste your time?
