Again the same familiar story about a man (here writer) who sells his soul to the devil to have his most ambitious ambition in life: success. Unpleasant script (we should "go home and write better"), ridiculous lines, the "strong" "christian" message (our only purpose in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a very long time Test to understand scene at the end where Agent Hopkins defeated the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is not at all sexy or evil) for all the bad things she has done on this unlikely character. Not bad efforts of the actors (Baldwin also as a director, Cattrall again in a "Sex and the City" role, Aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role). P.S. Also try a not so popular movie from Greece titled "Alloimono stous neous", a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man gives the devil his soul to recapture his youth)
