The sun should go down forever in this movie. <br /> <br /> It goes on forever (which is not usually a bad thing - The English Patient, Schindler's list), but it's SO boring. The aging of the actors is unbelievable, as well as the long-drawn, infinite plot that seems to lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> In short, a waste of talent and film.
