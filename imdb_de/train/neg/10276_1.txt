So you may be reading some of the comments posted in this movie and may be thinking of yourself: "Huh, there were certainly a number of RAVE REVIEWS posted on December 30th." The funny thing is, most of these rave reviews sound like they're from the same person, or at best from a small, coordinated group of "open house" groups. The truth, my friends, is that this movie is truly unsurpassable. Just because it is "independent" does not mean that it gets a free pass. If you are making a musical, whether in the movie or on stage, on Broadway or in the local playhouse, you should probably make sure that (a.) Your actors can sing, (b.) Your actors can dance (c.) You have a decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well written score and (e.) you have funny and charming lyrics. Even Anthony Rapp can not save this one. It's one of those unfortunate cinematic experiences that made me deeply embarrassed for everyone involved.
