My wife and I just saw BÃ»su AKA The Booth. She has fallen asleep during some parts of the movie. I really wish I had taken a nap with her, but the unfortunate fact is that the main character's voice is so loud and grating that I could not sleep. When our protagonist speaks, I want Regis Philbin and William Shatner to sing karaoke. He also has no redeeming qualities. I had hoped that he would be hit by a bus in five minutes. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the Asian horror movie, but The Booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that are really interesting do not make damned sense. If you want a good Asian movie, read A Tale of Two Sisters or In The Mirror. Avoid The Booth like the plague, especially if you frequently suffer from migraines.
