I will not spend much time and energy on this comment. I just want to add it, because all the comments were so positive that I felt I let people know that not everyone is so enthusiastic, not to mention trying to create a fascinating philosophical film riddle. Some scenes seemed promising and played with the visual dimensions, but could not stop the rest. I felt stoned for the first time, and had semi-philosophical conversations with other teenagers. <br /> <br /> What a futile attempt to take Dutch cinema to new heights. I would rather watch as Jesus is a Palestinian, without presumptuousness and with straightforward humor, which also raises questions about the life and the realities that we create for ourselves. Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and will never seem to be.
