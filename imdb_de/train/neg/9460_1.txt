This movie has upset me! When I think of Cat in a hat. I think of a cat in the hat books. You already know that the parents read to their children a few years ago. Well, I think that this movie would be very similar! But to my surprise, nothing was like the books! Installed it is more like a young adult humor movie. In one part cat is talking with a garden tool (hoe), with which the cat speaks as if it were his hoe (an adult humor). The naming of his car for me was anything but unpleasant for a children's film. Below the rating you will find: mild cude humor and some double doenders. In short, that means adult humor. I wish I could return this movie! Wal-Mart said that they would not do it because the movie was opened. If you are considering buying this, I suggest renting before buying.
