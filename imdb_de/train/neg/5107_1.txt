There is a British version of this show that is less extravagant than the US version. The affected person gets a new kitchen or maybe a bedroom and a bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have. The US version of this show is all that reality TV should not be. Instead of making a few improvements to a house that the residents could not or would not afford, the entire house is being remodeled. I do not know if this show tries to show what a nasty social system there is in the US, or if you beg hard enough. The rather vulgar product placement, which takes place especially by Sears, is also undesirable. Rather than turning a family in a deprived area into potential millionaires, it would be far better to help the community as a whole, where the hundreds of thousands of dollars are not spent on a house, but something for the whole community. Maybe a place where home improvement and power tools can be lent and returned with building materials, so anyone can benefit if they want. Giving everything to a single person can lead to angry resentment among the other residents of the local community who still live in the same run-down houses.
