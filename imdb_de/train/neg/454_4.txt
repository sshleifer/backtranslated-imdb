Generally overrated film that offers a strong cast and some clever dialogue and of course Dean Martin songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher almost made up for it as she responded to Cage's shifting accent and body language went out of control. Cage never just sits down in his role. He tries everything he can imagine and acts as an actor rather than a real person, and that's what's needed in a love story. Cage had the same performance issues in other roles that require more of a Jimmy Stewart character. Cage keeps taking those roles over and over again, maybe because he likes these kinds of movies, but his own energy as an actor is not suitable for them, though he's gotten better through repeated attempts. He should leave that kind of role to less interesting actors who would be fully committed to the film and spend his energy and talent on other roles and films in which he can be his crazy, interesting me.
