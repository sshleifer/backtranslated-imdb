Ok, I like B movies ... I know what B movies are supposed to do. That's terrible. I am amazed that there is such a good overall score. The only redeeming features of this strip are the (mostly) slight splatter effects. Do not get me wrong, there are a lot of attacks in this movie - but only a few effects have really troubled me (like the anal "rehearsal" ... that was great!) Filmed on a camcorder. Come on - at least lend me a Betacam. I've seen porn with better production values ​​(and better as an actor). <br /> <br /> Acting - shitty! But not in the way of Troma or full moon. <br /> <br /> History - invented! But you get that from such films. Very cool! <br /> <br /> Sets & Props - sucked! My 16-year-old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Synchronization and dialogue - crappy! Horrible Voice Acting (I should not even call it Acting) and every other word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There are loads of good classics and B-horror / splatter flutter out there and they are not that hard to find. Do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap!
