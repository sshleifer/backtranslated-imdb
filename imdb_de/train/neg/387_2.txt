You have to wonder if there was a <br /> <br /> script at any point in the production of this movie that made sense. Was the rough cut 3 hours long and was it trimmed into the incoherent chaos that survived? <br /> <br /> Why should someone finance this mess? I will say that Tom Wlaschiha is a handsome young man and he does what he can with the dialogue and the dramatic (?) Situations that are given to him. But <br /> <br /> characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is nonexistent, and the acting, the cinematography, and the direction are polite (not until <br /> <br /> formulated.) Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate <br /> <br /> choice of title as it is likely to be untrue if someone actually tries to actually watch this movie.
