How was this rip-off of Being There ever so beloved? People say it's proof that a decent, honest man can succeed despite his lack of intelligence. You are wrong. The film is the proof that happiness is everything: hope that your friend invests all your money in Apple and not in Atari; I hope your shrimp boat is the only one at sea when a storm breaks. I hope you do not die of shock if you are fortunately shot in the buttocks and not in the back. I hope you do not get AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically reactionary - all those who rebel against social conventions lose their legs, take drugs, beat their girlfriends or die young. In addition, the product placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. An emotionally manipulative film that is very, very empty.
