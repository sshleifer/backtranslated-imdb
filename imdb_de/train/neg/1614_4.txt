The second half of Steven Soderbergh's revolutionary biography of Che Guevara deals with his latest campaign to export revolution to Bolivia. In order to maintain his sacred countenance of Che Soderbergh, the frogmen jump comfortably after the revolution in Cuba and the folly of his Congo adventure ("This is the story of a failure"), he writes in the foreword to his Congo Journal) completely on Che's attempt focus on gaining support against the government in Bolivia. It would turn out to be a catastrophe and Guevara's last action. <br /> <br /> What plagued the first chapter follows as Soderbergh slows his movie to a crawl to re-study the blissful face of the contemplative Guevara like James Dean in the East of Eden by Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is that Guevara has little success in winning converts, and he soon finds that he and his starving comrades are swallowed up in the heart of the Bolivian jungle of darkness. In contrast to Werner Herzog in the great Aguirre, the wrath of God Soderbergh fails due to the metaphorical possibilities of the jungle in order to intensify the despair of the guerrillas. He seems more concerned about keeping Che's notoriety over his head than exploring the dead assailants' panic. There is a duchy moment when Che sits astride a stubborn horse kicking and screaming to get it moving, but the whole Soderbergh scene remains flat, sloppy and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> In his two films, Soderbergh shows that he is clearly a Che groupie, and therefore his focus remains shortsighted and narrow. He spends too much time building his memorial for Che and too little to develop his relationships with key actors in his saga, notably Fidel Castro. Making things worse, he does with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire. One might think that he had penetrated enough Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that sweeping changes with far-reaching style are much more effective.
