The main flaw in this movie is that it's impossible to believe that any of these people would ever be transformed into a Macbeth professional production. Listening to David Lansbury's soft voice struggling with the famous "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow" speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for that role. I still believed that he did not get the role because he was a bad actor. Not because a bigger name was available. If we then see parts of the piece in the rehearsal, it is hard to believe that the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly false, misguided travesty of actors who are unable to understand the verses and directors who are playing the game see their own screwball, articulate or understand interpretations. Sometimes, directors are so intent on making their films spin (and authors think they could direct their own works) that they settle for less. This seems to be such an example.
