This film was physically painful, because I (like many people my age and younger) with Dr. med. Seuss had grown up and loved his books - funny, smart, bizarre and subversive at the same time. "The cat in the hat" sucks the interest and the spark of the story, and Mike Myers performance as a cat is mostly confusing. Why the accent of the borscht belt, the merry chatter, the inappropriate jokes, the charming costume? I had to go back and read the books again to see the real problem: the books are EASY. This movie is OVERVIEW and far too long. <br /> <br /> You do not expect every children's movie to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this movie has set a new low. How could Mike Myers need the money?
