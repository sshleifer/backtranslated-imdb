Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not save this movie before laying an emu-sized egg. It was bombarded based on the classic television series Phil Silvers because: a) it was updated in the 1990s and b) the simple premise of the TV series was turned into a confusing, weak and stupid script. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used a small group of talented actors to portray adorable characters that are simple but fun pranks. To extend this premise into a film from the 1990s meant problems, and that shows. No one could pay me to sit through this stinker a second time.
