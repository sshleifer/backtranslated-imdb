This movie was definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen some pretty bad movies. I did not like how this movie was shot. All the actors are unknown and it looks like a few friends have banded together and decided to shoot their own movie. but it is absolutely terrible. I have never seen a worse movie. The story is so bogus, and I just realized that it took a very long time to reach the end of the movie. There was no plot, it looked like it was not planned before they started filming. The story is too funny. I did not like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie. It was useless to shoot this movie. If you are considering watching this movie, do not do that. You only waste your time.
