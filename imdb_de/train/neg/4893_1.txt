The movie is actually too slow. There are a few nice pictures, but it can not prevail that the movie is actually boring. You see intercourse, lots of watermelons, and intercourse while you eat a melon and maybe a little more. It may seem interesting to someone, but believe me, that I will not watch it for 2 hours is not fun at all. Although you laugh several times, it really is not enough and it can be more out of desperation and disbelief than out of fun. To disturb the boredom, the director tries to insert a few movie video clips into the film. These are really colorful clips of absurd songs, maybe from the 50s, but it's hard to say exactly and they're trying to be so weird that they're really sad. There are several times the feeling that the action could develop into something that creates a powerful scene, but in the end, it somehow evaporates and that's it. Besides the clips, there are hardly any dialogues, let alone music. The director tries to be original and artistic at all costs. Personally, I can not recommend the film. I believe that art is something that should not be boring. During projection, there was yawning everywhere in the cinema, which confirms my short review.
