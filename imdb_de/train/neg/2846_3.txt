What a horrible movie that is. The only reason you want to step through this mess is the pleasant sight of Miss Eleniak. The painful over-functioning of Mr. McNamara, which was sometimes embarrassing, ruined a sensible movie if the right actors had been played. Mr McNamara is not Tom Cruise, the actor he wants to be obvious.
