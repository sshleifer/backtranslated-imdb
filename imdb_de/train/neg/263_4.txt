After a day's work, I sat down and turned on the movie channels. The movie appeared in the guide and sounded interesting, so I tuned in just before the start. The first 30 minutes were enough to interest me, but the lack of acting ability of Jamie Foxx and the slow action caused me to get up and eat during the movie. If any recognition for acting was given in this film, it should go to David Morse, who at least tries to make the movie interesting. All in all, you should not impress your friends by selecting them as tenants for a movie night.
