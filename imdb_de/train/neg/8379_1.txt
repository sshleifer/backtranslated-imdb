As some of the other reviewers have suggested before, I'd like to know which idiot actually read the script and went, "Yes, that's it, this is the next movie we'll get the green light for !!" And whoever that person is should have their minds examined for actual brain activity. Because whoever is responsible for spending money so that he was earned after reading the script. Well, I would like to tell you my e-mail address and maybe you just want to give some money away. This movie is cruel in every way. <br /> <br /> The Wayans are funny, at least they can be. They did some good movies and showed some really funny gigs on the way. But here's the premise not only logical, it's not only terrible, not only the entire movie is offensive from beginning to end, not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find, but they also want to pay for it to see. If it was free ... well, it would still be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would be tempted to write a lengthy, in-depth review of why this movie is so bad, but suffice to say that my brevity is to do the talking. This is the lowest common denominator of filmmaking and it is about as unreliable as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0/10. makes my top ten list of the worst movies ever!
