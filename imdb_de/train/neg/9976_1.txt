In the first scene in 'Problem Child' a baby pisses into the face of a nun. This is funny for this movie. An evil, common "comedy" that is inappropriate on so many levels that it rejects the belief in it. John Ritter is the benevolent father who adopts the child from hell and thanks him for keeping his dignity in the environment of monotonous, annoying performances and puerile humor. And what is Jack Warden doing in this mess? Directed by Dennis Dugan and rude in his attempts to control sentimentality when he's done with cruelty. But all that does not matter. The weak point of the whole is Michael Oliver, the most disgusting and improbable child actor ever to appear on the screen. Believe me, you want to punch him right in the mouth.
