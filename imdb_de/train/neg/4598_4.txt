The wife of a stage producer in London hopes to assemble the American vocalist and dancer who starred in her husband's most recent show with a friend, an American, who establishes herself as a modeler in social circles. Unfortunately, the couple has already met alone, and the girl thinks the guy is actually the show producer who is married to her boyfriend (the fact that he does not wear a wedding ring would discourage misunderstandings!). Wafty Fred's Astaire-Ginger Roger's Musical is finally pulled back to earth by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott's idiotic script, which is full of youthful behavior. Astaire and Rogers "not only meet sweetly" - they get ridiculous (he's dancing like a madman in the hotel suite over her and she's complaining). The public of 1935 probably was not interested in how these two would come together - as long as they did, and happy. Nowadays, the main characters seem to have no motivation to end up in the other's arms: he or she flowers them (after telling his friend that he wants to stay "fancy free" in the love department), and she gives him the brush. Nothing a little dancing can not cure! These glamorous couples are just as unreal as the settings in London and Venice, but we're just watching because Fred and Ginger are starring. It's a fantasy for non-users ... for those who do not care about the planned conspiracy. The musical moments break up the monotony of the invented scenario, but do not transcend the surrounding stupidity. ** from ****
