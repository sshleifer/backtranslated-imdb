Although it is not a "great movie," there is something appealing and memorable. Like another movie commentator, I saw this in childhood. It's been thirty-three years since 1952, but I've never forgotten the story or its ridiculously ponderous title. See it if you have the opportunity. You will feel like a voyeur of the small city life as it develops over the decades. More than any other film, this film brings a human face to the historical drama of the "progress" of the early 20th century. It's engaging enough for a young viewer and memorable enough for an older one. In addition, it's easy to like the characters and watch their timing.
