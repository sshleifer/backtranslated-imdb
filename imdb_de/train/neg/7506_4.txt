Good actors and good performances can not obscure a pointless script, bad dialogues, and behavioral patterns that turn into nothing. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. No character development - no growth, no interest, just some suffering for no particular reason that teaches us nothing and does not even care about the entertainment.
