Believe me, I wanted to like "spirit". The idiotic comments people made at the time of their publication about how strange it was to see old-fashioned hand-drawn animations again, as if the last cartoon animated with pencil had been published twenty years ago, and the even more idiotic comments on it how computers had made the old techniques obsolete had drained my blood ... but then the insulting, tasteless banality that I had to endure in the first ten minutes of "Spirit" offended my blood even more. <br /> <br /> The character designs are generic, the animation (partly as a consequence) merely competent, the art genre as a whole so boring that you are wondering how this could happen (we know from "The Prince of Egypt "and" The Road to El-Dorado "(talent artist at Dreamworks), and the sophisticated use of CGI is poorly judged in each individual case. (Why are they bothering?) There is not one thing that's worth it In a cartoon this is fatal. <br /> <br /> But it gets worse ... <br /> <br /> The horses can not speak, but they are much more anthropomorphized and unconvincing than that Hirsch in "Bambi" who can, and it seems the horses can speak in a certain way Spirit himself provides the prologue (which to all the world looks like a 21st century actor selected from a mall in California ), and from then on his ent is barely audible, decidedly inglorious report in the soundtrack, though it never occurs once, tells us everything we did not yet know, or expresses a feeling that the work of art, though so poor, could not express twice as well , Incidentally, this prologue contains: (a) information that the spirit we discover later has come to know in some way; (b) expresses ideas that the mind could not express, even if it could speak; (c) contains New Age garbage like "This story may not be true, but I remember it"; and (d) to give the impression to many children (production is well accepted by six year olds) that horses are native to North America, which is in a sense true, as the common ancestor of the domestic horses is zebras, etc., native to North America - but all equines on the continent were extinct long before the arrival of the first humans, and the Mustangs of Spirit's herd (which "supposedly belong to the buffalo grass") came from horses introduced by Europeans. <br/> <br /> The prologue has I'm pretty annoyed. <br /> <br /> As often as Spirit talks, Bryan sings Adams and sounds like he has a bad sore throat - and that's not him he sings or HOW he sings, it's WHAT he sings: maudlin's narrative ballads who, if possible, contribute even less than the spoken narration of Spirit, and who sound as if they all have the same melody (though I paid close attention to it, and I realized they probably did not). If only Bryan Adams and the guy pretending to be a horse had had SHUT UP for a minute or two, the movie might have taken on its true form: mediocre and distracted rather than snappy.
