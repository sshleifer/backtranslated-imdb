This clunker of a movie sets a new standard for bad filmmaking. Jared Rushton provides an adequate performance of a very poorly crafted character in an unfortunate movie, creating the net effect of a very bad movie. The main thrust of the film is that a boy's temporary escape to the Canadian wilderness, after surviving a plane crash, allowed the angry teenager to deal with his agony by discovering his mother's extramarital affair. Unfortunately, it becomes a bizarre collage of random "survival events" (including two particularly funny scenes of fighting a bear) and strange hallucinations that ask you if this kid is just sitting in an alleyway and dreaming about this whole movie ( and what a nightmare is that!). In addition, despite the proclamation of some critics regarding the family's visibility of the film, there are several scenes that are not suitable for very young children or family visitors, including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater, with one of his eyes apparently exploding. <BR> <br /> All in all a horrible movie that nobody should go through, let alone innocent kids.
