Do you ever have the itch to kill just an hour or two when you do tiresome work and watch a movie so bad that it contradicts reason? Well, when I rent movies for a weekend, I see the boxing style for this and the T-Rex. I knew for a fact that the dinosaur was on the package of the T-Rex from Jurassic Park, and I knew I had to rent it just because I was in the mood for a bad movie. I was not disappointed the least. <br /> <br /> Crazy Scientists, Secret Formulas, a company more concerned about his fortune and his shareholders than his life, and of course, a big, badly animated sock puppet T-Rex. Was it with us through the film that scenes were clearly put together from other films? Not to mention that the hunger of the Rex is never satisfied ... never. How hungry he is is a mystery to me, because he really does not have a throat (really, if you look at the roar in the mouth, it is solid ... like a toy or something). I like to watch unbelievably bad B movies, because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is. This one was hilarious. I'm not even sure if this should be a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes in which you do not make a mistake, you will laugh. <br /> <br /> I have to blame the budget of the movie ... yes, but the acting did not help either. OK, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, because for some of the female roles ... If you cry, "Tears" should not come out? Meh, I'm not going to get mad at this movie, I knew what I'm getting into, and if you're looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, I recommend the following: recommend this movie, then Jurassic Park and then Lost World Back on the back. You write Mr Spielberg the next day thank-you letters.
