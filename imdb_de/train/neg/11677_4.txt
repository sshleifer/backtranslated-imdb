This has been criticized to death by the critics, if honestly it is not that great. Sure, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same movie, just with fluctuations of tension. But I found "CHAOS" more fun because it was as fast as the silly movie "Swordfish". The reason why this movie is more popular is that this movie was released in the US and "Chaos" was aired at film festivals and foreign theaters around the world but has not yet found distribution in the UK and US /> It is true that this movie pays homage to classic movies like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee movies, but that does not mean it's a pleasant movie. <br /> <br /> Look at it when there is nothing else on TV, but after a while you'll probably get bored.
