I did not see such a great review on IMDb, but I saw it anyway because I'm a big fan of biblical material. The first thing that bothered me was a bit too much Indiana Jones wannabe movie, but it also looked like Casper Van Dien would not see through these Jones movies (but he should). I think he did his best, but the script just stunk. Music also tried to be a bit of a Jones style. Great work, but for such a movie it seemed like too much work, as if the video did not deserve all this great music. Robert Wagner has given his best acting skills, he has done a good job, but somehow the script brought everything to a standstill. "Jokes" are old school, somewhere 20 years old; They only put a cynical smile on my face. There are some really bad camera angels, SFX looks like homemade and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea in the story (in my opinion, but I love those stories), but in the end it did not work out. Maybe he should put it on paper if it was still fresh in his head. When I saw (in the first few minutes) that this movie would become one of those "low-budget movies", I hoped that I would at least "hear" a good story, but sometimes movies just disappoint.
