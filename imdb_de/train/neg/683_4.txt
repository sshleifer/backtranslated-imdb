Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and misses something in her life. She participates in a Miss France contest against the wishes of her friend Andre (Georges Charlia) and she wins. She sets off for the Miss Europe title and leaves her friend behind. She wins again, but returns home to Andre because he asked her. Once they're together again, their lives will be out of touch, and one night she will write a message to him and go to see the fame awaiting them as Miss Europe. Andre follows her ..... <br /> <br /> This film is a silent movie with piano music. It's also faster, so everything looks fast. After that, a limited dialogue was added and it is very spurious. The cast is fine, considering it's a silent movie. The best part of the movie comes at the end, but the story is a little too long. After seeing this, I'm not really sure what the big deal about the look of Louise Brooks was - she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat. I do not have to look at it again.
