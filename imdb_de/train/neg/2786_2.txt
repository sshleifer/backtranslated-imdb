Okay, I will not criticize this movie in detail. I anticipate the many challenging reviews, and since I generally like Maria de Medeiros, I hesitated a long time to make a pejorative comment - and in that way almost a year has passed. But every time I see this DVD on my shelf, I feel an inner groan. Anyway, let the eloquent voices overwrite me! But for other cinephiles like me - beware. <br /> <br /> In the simplest and gentlest terms here is my attitude: <br /> <br /> The political turmoil and fall that forms the backdrop for this film also served as a backdrop for a certain time of my life Life - about newspapers that I read daily in my local Central European pub. At that time, I followed the news reports but never quite understood what the hell was going on. The reporters tended to report either in impartial terms or conservatism that disapproved of any group that disturbed peace or incited an uprising against the establishment. These were times when other winds of turmoil were swirling through Paris, Berlin, Prague, and various places in the US whose problems I clearly understood at the time - but dictatorship or not, my papers tended to simply treat the Portuguese government the establishment - not as a mature "evil empire" to use frivolous Star War expressions. <br /> <br /> So I read rioting week after week, but never found an intelligent editorial that could provide an insight into the history behind them, or the practices and socio-economic impact of dictatorship, and so on. <br /> <br /> So when I bought this movie, I had at least two hopes: to understand the details that lead to enjoy the social unrest and a well thought-out drama. This movie did not give me one. <br /> <br /> The film assumes that the audience already has plenty of knowledge and deep emotions regarding the historical facts. And the drama - well, as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portuguese film industry, but - it was banal and shallow. <br /> <br /> I received my DVD from France - "Official Cannes 2000 Selection - Un Certain Regard". The box shows smiling, clean-shaven actors. The main character gives the victory sign in a way that reminds me more of the Playboy bunny. After seeing the work, I wondered what the French might have thought of it - although as a flat piece of "cinema verite" with sensitive ethnic content, I understand its natural inclination to praise it for its "honesty", but ... <br /> <br /> Look at the back of the box: "Un worth chaleuruex sur la revolution" - a warm look? Describe Allende's fall and murder with a "warm respect"! Try Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try the whole series of crashes and civil uprisings! <br /> <br /> Another review: Maria de Medeiros is a son, the son paid, son enfance et son histoire. "Garbage, garbage, trash! At least for me. <br /> <br /> I love Portugal, Lisbon is home to Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague, but my love for a city and a country does not make an empty movie I'll stick to my old VHS tapes by Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa - meanwhile, I've stayed in Zone 2 of the above title, which could just as well go down in the trash.
