Yes he is! ... No, not because Pintilie likes to strip his actors and publicly show their privileges. Pintilie IS THE Naked "Emperor" - so to speak ... <br /> <br /> It's about time someone tells the truth. This cheater is a voyeur, a brat trapped in the body of an old man. His abundance of naked scenes has no artistic legitimacy. It's a 100 percent visual perversion: he gets his kick by getting the actors to strengthen themselves and watch their willies. And if he does that in front of the audience, he might get a hard sight! Did you know that he embarrassed poor Coca Bloss on the set of "Niki Ardelean" by telling her, "Oh, Coca, how do I fuck you?"? She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive and she was indescribably ashamed - to his small satisfaction! And as a worrying alarm about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in the Romanian audience, so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities "works of art"! Will anyone ever have the decency to reveal the truth?
