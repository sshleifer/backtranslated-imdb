Good grief! Although I still claim that Manos: The Hands of Fate is the worst piece of psychic torture available, hobgoblins came terribly close. This ... this ... thing offends the audience on every occasion. <br /> <br /> At least films like Space Mutiny and Future War can be shown on mst3k, this was a fight to get through. I literally writhed in pain on the couch. This thing could embarrass me alone! <br /> <br /> Even if you're an inveterate MST3K fan and you're committed to seeing every single experiment, think twice about it. <br /> It's so bad.
