99.999% pure manure. And the other 0.001% was a brief moment when I thought the blonde chick was undressing. No. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendarily bad. The action was shit and there was no sex (the above-mentioned blonde chick is modest, unfortunately, the whole movie). The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I've ever seen in the movie, and the anachronisms were numerous and disgusting. The drama was even mediocre by Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only "names" in this film. And Marina Sirtis really looked very, very bad. <br /> <br /> I have seen high school games that were produced better. This is the kind of movie MST3K benefited from. Heads should roll at sci-fi to let that steaming pile in the air.
