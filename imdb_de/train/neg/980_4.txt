My first full Heston movie. The film to which everyone already knows an end. A "sci-fi thriller". The camping factor. Everything that goes with this movie was injected into my head when I rented it, and on the morning I saw it, it was the perfect movie to look in the mood I was in ( I do not want to move in blankets). And even though I tried to understand what brought to an end that is eternally ruined by pop culture, it really did not make it. Everything was everywhere, relationships had no backbone, the end had no trace. Everything was sort of crazy and the observer has no choice but to be partially stunned at the end he achieves. Although we all know that they are human, there are quick answers to the question, WHY do the people make a serious effort to enjoy the movie for something other than the stupidity thrown out the window.
