Not a very good movie, but according to the information it is pretty accurate in the presentation of torture techniques. The purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the NK POW camps, and that is effective enough, with surprising openness to the times. Whatever technical shortcomings are (and there are many), if you observe this, you'll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and a few rather nasty things - again, unpleasant, because it's done north of the DMZ and not in Guantanamo Bay. <BR /> <br /> I do not think one of the Korean veterans tortured him when he ran for office and when you watch movies like this and Pork Chop Hill compared to the Vietnam movies. I do not know if it was the people of '54 who were included in the concepts of World War II (the boys tend to do white tricks) or the war or what, but it's interesting to see this from the same system that would make movies like "Go Tell The Spartans" 16 years later.
