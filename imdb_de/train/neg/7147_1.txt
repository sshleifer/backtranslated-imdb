My favorite part was when the credits started. I wish I could give it a .0000000000001 out of 10. I really wish I had that hour and thirty minutes back. Do not waste your money or your time doing that. I could really have seen grass grow and feel better after the wards. <br /> <br /> Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie did not destroy her career. But she decided to be there. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was more than any other movie. More than just Kazaam and glitter. That says something. <br /> <br /> Do not <br /> <br /> make <br /> <br /> it !!!!
