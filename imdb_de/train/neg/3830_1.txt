I do not know why I take the time to look through this waste of time movie. If you stick to it long enough, hoping for a satisfactory conclusion? good, bad or surprising? not finally it flickers for stiff, comprehensible dialogue and action. Indoor scenes are so heavily lit up that you think if the camera were zoomed a millimeter farther, you would see the lights. Costumes, hairstyles and sets are strengthened, pressed and flawless. Imagine that ordinary people lived in Arizona in the early 20th century? Comparisons of other reviews with Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah: At least the director brought his violence into the context of chaos and chaos. HARD MEN's Gore is an explosion of squibs made of wood imitations of bad guys with manicured fingernails. Huh? I can believe that Heston thought he could do something valuable with this film. (He may keep his weapon in his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I'll never guess why he signed up for this travesty. Would you like to see a movie about the end of the West as we know it, the end of Western as we knew it? Take another look at the SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN. THE LAST HARD MEN is a mockery of an obituary on the Western.
