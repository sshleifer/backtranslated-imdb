Horror / sci-fi, which is interesting because it is ridiculous. F / X pretty good ... for what you can see. A TV thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant, albeit misguided, scientist who interferes with stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with a hammerhead. The terrible results produce a damned killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to watch the brilliant new experiment. Of course, after laughing and stuttering in awe ... Coombs' creation, by the way, his own son is fused with a hammerhead, is released to hunt one after another of his colleague. Revenge is not always worthwhile. With in the cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
