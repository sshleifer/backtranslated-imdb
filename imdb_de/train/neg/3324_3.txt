I happened to see this on a lazy summer afternoon. It played on the HBO family program channel. First, I was attracted to a Disney animation. After a few minutes, I searched for the remote to find the "INFO BUTTON" to find out what's in the world in my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I enjoy him in many of his films, but he is not one, a voice-over artist. Sure he has one of the most unique voices in Hollywood, but it only works as part of a larger visual package. Fixing his voice to a cute duck made watching a bit difficult. As for the rest of the cast, not unimaginative. I suspect that working on this movie did not appeal to the really good voice-over talent. <br /> <br /> So, weak voice talent, strong animation ... who was the movie? Gay juvenile ducks? I do not understand it Is there really a lack of role models for young emerging homosexuals that we need to resort to animated ducks? A nice story and the title of this movie that I found hard to love, just like an ugly duckling.
