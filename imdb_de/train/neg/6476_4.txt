I had high hopes for this movie because I loved the original so much. It seems that Disney is trying to perfect the art of stupid, going straight to DVD shackles. They deserve a Razzie. In fact several. I thought the idea had gained some, but the music was absolutely terrible and the story was not much better. What happened to the great music Disney had in their films? Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King ... even Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. They have made so many great movies over the years that it's really sad that they have declined to sequels that are not even good enough to be released in no indication of the Walt Disney Corporation.
