I refer to this as a "spoiler" just because of some of my comments on the content of the show, not the content itself. <br /> <br /> When I read the comments, it is obvious that these Republicans somehow tolerate the show but despise it while the Democrats seem to enjoy their so-called truthfulness. Indeed, a reader actually (apparently) seems to believe that these events occurred or could have happened when Bush was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> But as far as the content is concerned, as I see it, I try to be neutral. is that the group that made this series really needs to be Bush haters. In the episode I last saw, s02e03, it turned out that the program must have been put together for a long time before McCain became the first place in the nomination. because the other former frontrunners are all presented. <br /> <br /> Another thing that caught my attention was the use of auxiliary cabinets. I thought that the series in Europe certainly should not have been made in the US, because I do not know any home in the US that does not have built-in wardrobes, and most likely in the homes of the artists. <br /> <If I look at the show, yes, I'm in on it. I am amazed to see what a terrible desire of the authors must be to do anything to embarrass our president. Sure, there are problems that most Americans will agree with, but that's no reason to be so hateful at public performances around the world. Perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and this network, so that IF would continue to produce Obama or Hillary, would they continue to produce the same kind of "humor" about them? <br /> <br /> Just comment on another comment from a commentator. IF the elections had changed somehow in 2000, he was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, wishful thinking from his side. As for 911 events, I really believe that Clinton was president then, and I can not understand what it would be like if Gore were president.
