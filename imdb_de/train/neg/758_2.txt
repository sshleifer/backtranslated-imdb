This show stinks. For parents, they usually want their children to see something good for them. It's usually educational, fun and bright. <br /> <br /> Is it educational? No, the Doodlebops are singing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves and try to teach nothing. <br /> <br /> Is it funny? The Doodlebops instead say something that is not meant to be a joke and laugh about it. <br /> <br /> Is it bright? It is so bright, it hurts. As for color, everything is extremely bright, so that's good. But in the world of Doodlebop, NOTHING is wrong. That's why they are always happy. A child in trouble becomes depressed because it has never been sad. <br /> <br /> The show is also extremely cheesy. Each syllable is exaggerated at the highest level and very hackneyed. It is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining for kids, but after the age of 2 you do not want your kids to see it. You will never know how to grow up.
