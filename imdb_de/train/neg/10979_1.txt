Words can not begin to describe how mild this movie is. I wish it was "so bad it's good," but it's not like that. It's just boring, lifeless and boring. It's so bad that I could not even laugh about it. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the film. The only person who is less charismatic is director Brett Kelly, who describes himself as a true statement on vanity as a male lead role. They both look like inbreeding, sister and brother. <br /> <br /> The girl Sherry Thurig is an eye-catcher. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and strong-willed and can act. It can be said that she holds back. <br /> <br /> All the actors seem to be holding back, especially the supportive man Mark. I saw less wood in a rainforest, but he's still better than Kelly. Why should Kelly keep his actors from acting? Is he really such a bad director? Everyone else has a perfect summary of the story - there are none. Children are kidnapped and Kelly steps into the basket to solve the crime. I know how he felt kicked into the poo, that's how I felt after seeing his movie. Yes, I tried to get my money back from the rental business. This is a home theater that can best be seen by the director's friends (and if you find them out, you will find that these friends gave the film positive marks).
