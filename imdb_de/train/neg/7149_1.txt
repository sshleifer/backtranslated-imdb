Anyone who has described "Redline" as a great movie must be paid by Daniel Sadek to promote this ultra-crappy, flaming, steamy bunch of amateur toys. The worst automobile movie or movie ever made. This makes showgirls look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Take every cheesy clich√© from an action TV series of the 80s, add some really shitty special effects and lame characters with no relevance Do not write scripts and do not produce movies, you should stay in the real estate business. <br /> <br /> This is such a lame film with such a lame plot and the most invented action sequences ever. What offends me is not that the creators of this movie are idiots, but that they think the movie goes public, idiots enough to fall into that crap.
