I have seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time, but they are taking the cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" puts the "c" in cheese festival. The star quality in this movie is not bad. Just as it was made, it rolls downhill. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a 1950s American high school footballer who does not get older due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the film was the violinist. He drove everyone crazy! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who has hit his own bullet. Adam's father Alan plays a shrink who apparently is not at the top of his game. After all these years, Tony seems out of place because of the attack, and then he gets the chance to catch in his condition. More laughter than bloodshed, this movie is just a beginning of the 80s. "Teen Wolf" was an improvement! 1 out of 5 stars.
