I know you've read that before. With countless other films, there is no doubt that you read the comments here. The Voodoo Academy, however, is still the absolute worst movie I've found so far. Undoubtedly, the really bad ones do not even come to buy them or watch them on TV, but nevertheless I feel that I can not qualify, that I'm not just a stupid tenant who has chosen poorly. <br /> <br /> i 've seen two - thirds of the 100 best movies here at the IMB, and with every chance I tick the rest. Most of them are standing over their heads and shoulders ... in absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I really like to rate really bad movies (like in movies without humor, even in how bad they are) by how many people you have to watch it to create all the way. If you can see it for yourself, it is not so bad. If you can see it with a single friend, it's bad, but could be a lot worse. <br /> <br /> 5 of us were to make it all the way through the Voodoo Academy. And even the usually funny moments when you see bad movies (eg the boom microphone 3 times in this, if I'm not mistaken) could leave out the dry taste in my mouth. Yes, I had seen it, but I had also forced 4 of my friends to see it with me to achieve that goal. There could be another 20-minute version with big eyebrow bites where the baby oil glands rub against her body What terrible hell scares me. So much movie is about it. <br /> <br /> I applaud David Decoteau for making this film on a tight budget in two days, just as I applaud him for persuading people to pay him for it is undoubtedly a celluloid version of some of his fetishes. but it is not a good movie. The original horror store was filmed in the same amount of time for comparable amounts (considering inflation) and was an absolute gem. It's no excuse for how bad this baby is. <br /> <br /> Spoiler ahead ... <br /> <br /> It's not even worth digging through the storylines or knowing clich√©s that all hero characters know about. The pace of the movie ... is crazy ... nothing ... is interesting for the time in which decoteau devotes himself to pectoral self-massage. No matter what your alignment or gender is ... Rubbing just can not stand this kind of screen time. <br /> <br /> The acting is cheese ... but not overly amatuer ... I've seen much better movies ... but somehow it's the semi-competent delivery of some of the worst lines you've ever seen in a movie hear what really congratulates. <br /> <br /> Rent this if you, like me, have a fascination with the worst of the worst, and only if you observe it with a group of people who are willing to work on it. This is not ha ha ha the sentence wobbled affair. It's a test of endurance that you probably want to skip. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it's even worse ... but I would not be surprised if Decote's name says so.
