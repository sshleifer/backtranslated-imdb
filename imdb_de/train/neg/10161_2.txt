I really did not expect much from this movie because it has people from Parkersburg WV where I live and work in it. This city is boring and so is this movie. There were some decent scenes in the movie, but I was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they had shown. This movie may have been good when there was actually acting, but none. If you are not from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday, stay away from this movie. The dialogue makes you fall asleep, the acting bores you, and Steven Soderberg should lose credibility in shooting such a shot. It's a predictable movie with no surprises. What you see is what you get, and this is a 73-minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a speaker.
