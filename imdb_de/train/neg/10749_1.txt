This movie was probably the worst I've ever seen. Here are the things that immediately affect me: 1. The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles with a few trees and brushes. Not scary. If you are filming in Southern California, the big bear is only an hour away. They actually have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. Writing was undoubtedly the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. Every possible line in the movie was unoriginal, clich√© or just stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "Lagerblut" (lame), the name of the clown is "the killer clown" (lame). What does a clown do in a forest? Was that the only mask they could find? 3. The last but most secure was acting. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever to assemble. A virtual cornucopia of crappy lines and bad behavior. By far the worst part was when he happened to return to that fat, strange girl who was naked for a photo. It's a really long scene and I think she should be sexy, but she was NOT. And, and this was one of the few pleasing parts of the film for me, this tool was meant to be "athletic". For example, if he gets bored, he grabs a few stones and starts curling them. Later he is said to have run for the clown and it is immediately clear that he is very "girlish", that he is quite far away from the sport. Oh, and to the girl Kat played, stop singing. The song you sang for the credits makes me kill myself. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie for some reason, I would at least recommend to look at the specifics. The group of donkeys that made this movie talks about it as if it were this really original story. In fact, one of the girls says she has the script read to some of her friends, and none of them could predict the end. Apparently she is hanging around with special children.
