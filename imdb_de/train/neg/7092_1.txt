<br /> <br /> This movie (not a movie - clearly shot on a cheap camcorder) is possibly one of the biggest cinematic stink bombs in history. Attention: The packaging advertises the film as erotic exploration of sex addiction. The movie is not an exploration of anything and more erotic than a look at your own warts. The script is meaningless and meandering, with all elements of action serving as a transition between supposed sex scenes. But the sex scenes are lame lame. Apart from the first, they are about three seconds long (then maybe my version was cut) and funny revised. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent movie, you do not want that. If you are looking for an exciting sex movie, you do not want that. Whatever the goals, desires or perspectives of your life, you do not want to see this movie. How they got Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski and Ed Begly to behave in this stink bomb is extremely puzzling.
