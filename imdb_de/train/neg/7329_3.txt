After seeing this movie, I felt a compelling need to let go of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous, currently underrated actress and Max Beesley was quite charming in "Kill Me Later". The story was not exactly original, but quite a promise. But none of that mattered ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what their deal is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent as a director. She slowed down the footage, accelerating the footage, reversing the material, using uncomfortable camera angles, using annoying color filters, making a lot of quick cuts, jumping back and forth on the timeline, filling everything with a hideous "modern" soundtrack of thunderous scrap. I can not remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job as a director. Their ego has to be big enough to throw out the acting and the story and to direct their focus to the center so the audience can see it. It's full in the throat. <br /> <br /> In "Kill Me Later" there are some good scenes that show what could and should have been. Unfortunately, just as things began to look promising, Ms. Lustig would reach into her bag of film-school cartoons and mess things up again. It's a shame, because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you could say that the movie really had a good heart. 3.10
