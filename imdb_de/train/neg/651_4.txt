I saw this movie a few days ago and jumped a bit during the terrifying games. I have to admit, I thought it was pretty decent ... until I started thinking about what the characters said. Logical Issues: <br /> <br /> 1. Your friend, who seems to be a pretty fit guy, does not make a sound while being killed. Do not you think he at least tried to take the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When the comment is made that the physical education teacher is "SOOOO in love with Lisa", I almost screamed at the screen. If your best friend's family was killed by a teacher who was in love with her, do not make such comments if you have half a heart. <br /> <br /> 3. As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many exits he has in the house and the uncle admits that there may be danger, it would not be wise to Donna, a friend, an aunt and an uncle in Getting a Car Drive far, far away, then lure the house with the HRT and the police so that the killer has no chance to come out? <br /> <br /> I could go on. And further. And further. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters were not profiled enough to actually feel empathy when slaughtered, and there were far too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER. <br />> This movie may be good for teens or young couples looking for a fun night out. If you do not consider all the fools, it's a mediocre movie.
