I got this DVD from a friend who got it from someone else (and that probably keeps going ...). Even the cover of the DVD looks cheap, just like the whole movie. Shots and fistfights with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple act that made me laugh until my stomach hurt! With very few financial resources, I have to admit that it looked pretty professional. Seen as a movie, he was one of 13 in a dozen would-be gangsta strips nobody is waiting for. So, if you're tired and want a cheap laugh, check out this movie. If not, throw it out the window.
