The film is essentially the story of a Russian prostitute returning to her native village for the funeral of a sister / girlfriend. There are a few other smaller storylines that may be more interesting than those taken, but they are not fully explored. At the heart of the film is the funeral, watchful, and later controversy over the future of a Crone community that manufactures and sells dolls to buy vodka, but now misses the artist who made their dolls marketable. Apparently the film is unedited. The prostitute's journey from town to village is a torturous endless train ride and tramp through the mud. Maybe that should impress us with the infinity of the Russian countryside. The village itself is, as it is, inhabited by a legion of widows and a husband, the wife of the dead girl. The continuation of the doll business is problematic for all concerned and seems ultimately impossible. Most of the film is shot with a handheld camera that can cause nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles do not contain the songs and laments of the old men. Do not go to this movie unless you speak Russian fluently.
