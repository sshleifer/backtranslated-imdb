1st respected 28.02.2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD version that I have seen entitled "3 Days of the Condor" movie. The premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of a CIA research group killed with Robert Redford's character, code name = Condor. Who killed her and why? That's what Redford tries to find out while not being the eighth victim at the same time. On the way, Faye Dunaway's character is involved, originally because he needs a place to hide, and then she finally helps him after a little loving time. This is one of a handful of innocent guys who are on the run, but this one does not have much tension. The flat appearances do not help and the finish does not seal the audience enough. Despite a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of classical performers, the story and the performances are not what they should be, so the movie is not what it should be.
