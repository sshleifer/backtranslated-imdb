a movie that tries to be far more intelligent than its producers can produce. The film revolves around a startling plot of "surprises" in a desperate attempt to guess the audience, trying to score the "storyline" with steamy scenes that they thought would help him. James Belushi is involved This pseudo-intellectual attempt and only sleep goes through the film. The same applies to the other "actors". The plot is pretty stupid and sticky. Which in itself is not such a crime, but towards the end the huge conspiracies become very tiresome and boring. <br /> <br /> However, the film manages to arouse some interest in the middle. All in all worth a lazy guard on a really boring day, but do not fret if you miss this one. <br /> <br /> a rather lame 4er!
