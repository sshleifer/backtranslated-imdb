Well, how should I know that this was "the" stupid ass "Lordi Motion Picture"? I mean, I realized that when this "dinosaur" costume turned up and when the lead singer performed, I hummed "Hard Rock Hallelujah" for myself ... even though I hate that song. "Dark Floors" is a young autistic girl being dragged out of the hospital by her protective father when she and the other people in the elevator are briefly detained ... When they arrive She is on her cane Surprise that no one else is around. The hospital is empty ... Aside from a myriad of monsters that are apparently being pursued for no apparent reason ... They run down the hallways and staircases, encountering all the heavy metal band members in their outrageous shock - rock costumes ... Nothing really memorable here, except the lousy acting, the lack of nudity and the totally shameless advertising edge that reminds me a lot of "KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park". Yes, do you remember this guy? I wish I had not ... I would just recommend to avoid all these Ghost House movies like a mushroom and not listen to Lordi as they are a Gwar rip off!
