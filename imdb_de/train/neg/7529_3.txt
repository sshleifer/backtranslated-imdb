Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this film is probably still one of the worst movies ever made. Bruce Lee dies as a result of a fall from a helicopter after being hit in the neck by a ninja knife, but it does not explain how he got into a helicopter since he was in the previous scene but not on the helicopter, which is already 200 feet in the air. From then on, it just becomes absurd, like from a cheap comic book. Maybe the idea is not so rotten, but from an artistic point of view, it is not finished with a certain degree of skill. There are dozens of such martial arts bombers, all made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam has improved the genre by adding plausible stories to his films and having filmmakers who know the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are far better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies shot in Hong Kong in the 1970's and early 1980's. "Game of Death II" falls in my opinion in the category "Junk Cinema", although Bruce Lee is there.
