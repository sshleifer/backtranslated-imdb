What happens if you give just enough money to a free man to lock him up in the rat race and watch him squirm? Homeless people do not answer anyone. You have no mortgages, rent or idiots. Homeless people do not have to worry about the IRS or performance ratings or credit card payments. But just give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car, and suddenly they have to worry about getting into the race, buying petrol for transportation, paying insurance for their car and working for someone else have to. They get the chance to be "productive citizens". This movie was as exploitative as a movie can be. It is an opportunity for rich and middle-class shepherds to say, "Do you see what happens when you try to help the poor?" and it confirms capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why not in a movie that asks, "What happens if you take away everything a rich man has?"
