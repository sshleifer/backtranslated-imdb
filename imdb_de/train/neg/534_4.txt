This crap is like drying paint. I'm so disappointed because I'm so curious to see it. <br /> <br /> This movie just does not matter. If it were never done, no one would notice or interest. It's being hyped up for all the big names, but if nobody was there, no one would love this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I was at the point where the movie was halfway up I looked at Vanessa Redgrave and thought, "Hurry up and die already!" This is like the "Joy Luck Club", without the friggin joy. It's the "Ocean's 13" (nothing but a big cast) of mother-daughter movies and absolutely anti-climatic ... oh, until it's finally over nominated for the Oscars ... <br /> < br /> - 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to get involved in this trash.
