Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and rightly so, so I'm excited to see one of their films. Basically, a man cracks in a horn factory, the fourth, and soon ruptured Ollie with all the horn noise. He rested at home with Stan at his side, needing some rest, and the doctor (James Finlayson) called to say he was coming to Ollie. After the paramedic discovers that the installer has messed up water and electricity, the doctor comes to the check-up. After some tests, he recommends drinking goat's milk and bringing the ocean air to the ocean. After Stan practiced a trumpet game with a telephone cord and a car accident hanging out the window, he and Ollie rented a boat from a dock. They hold the boat in the dock and try to milk a goat, and Stan has brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the front page of the newspaper reveals that killer Nick Grainger - Escape from Prison (Richard Cramer) has escaped, and he sneaks onto the boys' boat while he sleeps, and the goat chews through the boat rope and drifts onto the sea. In the morning, they see their situation, and the killer challenges him to eat and he sees Stan and Ollie making fake food. String for spaghetti, soap for cheese, bacon belt, sponge for meatballs, and he forces them to eat it. When Ollie starts choking on something, Stan blows his trumpet to help, and Ollie's anger makes him beat the killer, and it continues until the police arrive. Only Ollie's anger brings her to jail. There were the smallest moments of the comedy, but it's not a great black and white movie. "Well, here's another nice mess you brought me into!" was the number 60 on 100 years, 100 quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were the # 7 comedian Comedian. OK!
