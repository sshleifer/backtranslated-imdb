The movie never gets unbearable. To put it simply, it has nothing to show except perhaps the partially sexy Alicia Silverstone in a nerdy, not sexy character who reveals pretty sexy dresses. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see it both ways. There is no excitement, little action, inconspicuous dialogues, unsatisfactory sensuality, same boring locations and very mild actions. Kevin Dillon is absolutely worthless. Silverstone ... well, I did not focus too much on her acting, I confess. But as I said, if you do not have to do anything but watch a movie, it does not look that bad. 4.10
