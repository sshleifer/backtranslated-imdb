I'll just give this a three because it fulfills what my buddies fulfilled and I hoped it would work: entertainment. <br /> <br /> I was not stupid enough to rent this because I thought it was a zombie movie with Romero or Fulci, but what I rented was a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie for fun, or a movie shaking your head in embarrassment, look it up. This is perfect for junior Mystery Science Theater fans, but the only downside is that it's so bad it makes fun of itself. <br /> <br /> Personally, I find it a shame to associate this with any other Hollywood title we may know, because if a movie is so crappy, it has its own genre.
