In the original film was nothing of value, this was even Lamer. The fact that I had even found it to rent was absolutely amazing. Everyone connected to this movie has to be a bit high! So what was the plot? What about the girl? Was the viewer responsible for the story in the first four minutes of the movie? Unfortunately, I tried several times to see this. I even borrowed a child from someone to get feedback. Kid said it was stupid and he was four years old. I think that the director may have some merit, as some of the recordings may have made the movie more than a B-movie. That could do it. I loved the title song. Good that it was only a dollar, it was worth it. I suppose you could enjoy the movie if you are as tall as the cast and the crew. Is the pot legal in France?
