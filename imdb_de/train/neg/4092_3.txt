I like Fulci movies, I do that really and not in a boring, ironic way, but I realize that they seem hopelessly incapable and mutilated. <br /> <br /> Conquest is the place where Fulci tries on the epic fantasy genre and does not really succeed. Structurally, it's like most fulci films you've seen. Some things happen, a lot more, and occasionally one scene can be tangentially connected to another. It's really like Conan without sets, without a script, without proper actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either), no budget, stupid-looking dog soldiers and a lot of gore. <br /> <br /> This was a difficult road to get through and I could have lived on the camera without the inch of Vaseline to get the look of the Hair Metal music video.
