This was a disappointing movie. People seem to have no substance, the lead actor Martin Cahil has zero redemptive values, in fact everyone, including Jon Voight, the epitome of Sleeze. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The violence is disgusting, albeit artful. The filming is too black, at least the pressure I saw fit into this category. A disappointment.
