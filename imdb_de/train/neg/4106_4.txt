It was almost unfathomable to me that this movie would be a bust, but I was actually disappointed. After years of being a connoisseur of Pekinpah cinema, I found this drastically reduced DVD for sale and thought it was worth a try. The first few credits, iconic for Pekinpah fans, have the interface between humans and animals, but here we have non-diegetic ambient sounds of children playing in a schoolyard while a bomb is being laid. Fantastic tension. Then, as the perpetrators, Caan and Duval, travel to their next mission, Duval drops the bomb on Cann that his date last night had an STD that was only found when he sniffed through her purse while Cann intimated with her was. The ensuing laughter is fantastic and is clearly honored in Brian Depalma's Dressed to Kill at the short-lived expense of Angle Dickenson. The problem with The Killer Elite is that the movie falls flat after the opening balance. Even Bring Me The boss of Alfredo Garcia has a higher production value, a bold call for those who know what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah's credits as an adjunct lecture, but once they're done, switch off The Killer Elite.
