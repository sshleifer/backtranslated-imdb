Yes, you guessed it. Another movie in which identical twins change their place. I think now that the Olsen twins are getting older, they should try to make the plot less predictable and less like repeating 'Full House'. If you want to watch this movie, then not. Instead, look at "The Parental Trap". It is more entertaining.
