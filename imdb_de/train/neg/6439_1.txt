Honestly, that's easy in the top 5 worst movies I've ever seen. Partly because, unlike normal, light-hearted garbage, it takes so seriously, in this movie you want to be emotionally involved, feel the characters, and take care of the alleged conspiracy. None of this is almost the same as the event. <br /> <br /> **** MILD SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> There are three main reasons why this movie is so horrible: 1.) Incoherent and completely nonsensical act. 2.) Annoying "MTV" camera work. 3.) Moronal characters and action holes. <br /> <br /> Allow me to elaborate. <br /> <br /> 1.) Apparently they could not decide when these films were filmed, a movie about ecclesiastical conspiracies, the stigmata or the possession. Guess what? They combined them! An ethicist is taken possession of by a dead man who then exhibits the stigmata to expose a church conspiracy. How a normal person can overcome death by owning a rosary and possessing another person is neither explained nor spoken about. Instead of saying what he wants to say, he gives her the stigmata. WHY? Why do not you just spit it? Instead, we hear scenes of screaming things in harsh voices, carving cryptic messages in cars, and writing messages on walls. Apparently this priest was also a violent guy because the obsessed young woman also turns with one of the characters while she speaks in that clich√©d, hard, obsessive voice we've all heard countless times. This also begins to involve my second complaint, because when the young woman receives the stigmata, she also violates the laws of gravity by floating in the air and throwing everything and everyone around her as if she were in an earthquake , Why is this happening? Who knows!?! My guess is that the director thought it was cool. <br /> <br /> 2.) These films contain dozens of shots, of course in slow motion, of birds emerging from nowhere and flying away, and most annoyingly when water is dripping. The apartment of this woman is constantly dripping water! THE TIME! Logically, the place would probably fall apart with these many holes. To summarize this complaint, and for no reason at all, the camera takes pictures of dripping water in slow motion and vice versa! WHY!?! I have no idea! It has no meaning to anything, and I bet it's that again because the director thought it was cool. <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters says he has become a priest who would explain it holes in science. That does not make sense to me. I would think it would be enough to go to church, but no, he has to go through the whole thing to become a priest. I just do not buy it. Second, there are many storylines, some of which I'll explain in more detail. First, when she gets the stigmata for the first time, the scene ends with unconsciousness and bleeding. Next she is in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another is near the end when the aforementioned "scientific priest" speaks to the spirit that owns the girl. He says, "Take me as your messenger!" Not a word for word, but you have the idea. His answer? "You have no faith, only doubts!" That's why he owns an ethicist! An aetheist has no faith, much less than any scientific priest! And then there's the fact that the object of the conspiracy of this movie, this lost gospel (by St. Thomas, I think) is available in local bookstores. The characters are ready to kill to suppress this document, but you could go to a bookstore and buy it. Perhaps this should take place in an alternate story where it is not widely known, but the film never tries to tell us or even hint that this is an alternative event of uncovering this document. <br /> <Finally, this movie is terribly spectacular. It's my archenemy, and I feel the need to insult every opportunity I get. I detest it. Final grade: F
