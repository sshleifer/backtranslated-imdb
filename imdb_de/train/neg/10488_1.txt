Elvis left the building and he's lucky because he did not have to watch this listless stinker. Scene for scene director Joel Zwick finds ways to amuse a lighthearted script even less. This movie is full of funny deaths, gay characters and junking jokes and is more desperate than amusing. This kind of movie gives hope that Kim Basinger will lead Doris Day into early retirement. Let us remind her of her (talented) and not of what she has become. David Leisure, the delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are all talents here. Zwick finds a way to minimize his talents in each round. The guy who plays Elvis sounds more like Gomer than the king. The only really good casting is the young girl who plays Basinger as Preteen. She really looks like her and is actually pretty good. The only other reason to watch this movie is the cameo of Tom Hanks. The cameo is not so funny, but at least not painful. One has to wonder if Zwick has pictures of Hanks or something that would make him make this film.
