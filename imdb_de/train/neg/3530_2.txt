When Ritchie broke into the movie scene for the first time, his films were hilarious, witty, judicial and original. Considering the hype he'd created in his first two attempts, and the almost universal disgust his last two ventures produced, one should consider-has Ritchie been found out? Is he really that talented? Does he really have original ideas? Or is he simply an overbearing and selfish director who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone, all rolled into a colossal and disorganized bunch? After seeing Revolver you could apologize if everything was alright. What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did he get all these mixed and confused ideas from? Revolver tries to be smart, philosophical and concise, he tries to be an intelligent psychoanalyst, he tries to be a complicated and complicated thriller. Ritchie goes to great lengths to achieve all of these many goals and invests large parts of a script in existential considerations and action changes. Ultimately, however, it only serves to construct a strictly disjointed, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film for the public. His plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although Ritchie at least tries to give himself, he is punished for even trying to spend it as his own work. The audience, then, ends up with a terrible screenplay devoured with many arrogant onliners and awkward set pieces. Revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless motifs from masterpieces like Fight Club, Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. It targets high but inevitably many punches. <br /> <br /> Revolver deserves to be lambasted, a really bad movie that masquerades as a would-be masterpiece of a would-be Auteur. However, it falls flat on his absurd face and simply fails in everything it wants to be.
