This movie is so bad, it's weird. In fact, Mystery Science Theater 3000, the television show in which three characters see and parody bad movies, used this movie to ridicule. I suggest watching him (maybe on YouTube) instead of actually seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> Please do not see hobgoblins unless you are ready to stop in the first scene. Do not actually watch this movie, period. You're welcome. At least not serious. His jokes are not funny (to say the least), and you'll have much more fun parodying or watching a parody than watching the movie save yourself reading a book. To make the laundry. Everything is more fun than watching hobboblins.
