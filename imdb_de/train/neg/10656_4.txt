What can I say. A Kamal Hassan movie is terrible. He is doing very well, but it is a terrible story, along with a terrible direction. In my opinion, director Gautham Menon has to give up the direction. There are many tragedies throughout the movie. Besides, you just can not believe how true those terrible crimes were. There was no practicality in the film. Gautham just has no stories left. But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika work very well. The villains look too ugly, though their performance was not bad. I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa that you can see with the family. You will not sleep if you watch this movie !! Harris Jayaraj did a great job again. That's why I rated this movie 4 out of 10. His song 'Partha Modail Nallae' is soulful and reassuring. Otherwise, a great camera. On the whole, this is just a bad, bad movie. I think Kamal Hassan should have rejected this movie.
