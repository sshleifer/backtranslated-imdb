Shiri Appleby is the cutest little incarnation of the evil evil girl kicking Buffy clone, Elle. But I'm one step ahead of myself. You see, Lilith was the first woman to be made a companion to Adam by God. But she got all the evil feminists, and God banished her from Eden. A secret command known as The Fath conquers but does not kill them. Therefore, Lilith (now Elle) with amnesia (which is not really well explained) is free to become the above-mentioned Buffy clone who has to fight a madman scientist who has injected Lilith's blood. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph sounded disgustingly twisted, it's because it is. The film is also boring, generic, and he does not seem to know about it for a film with an action steeped in theology. This moderately CGIed movie from the basement was obviously a failed serial pilot. All I can say that it was not picked up is a resounding amen. <br /> <br /> My Degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Comment by Writer / Director Bill Platt and co-author Chris Regina; and stills gallery; Video Effect Examples: Before and After (There is also a "likewise available" range that you would think would lead you to some trailers, but not to DVD covers for other films, which is a stupid idea) <br /> <br /> DVD-ROM Extras: Script for final filming and transcription of deleted scenes in PDF format
