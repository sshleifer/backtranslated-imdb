This movie is very important because it reminded me of this: Sometimes you may wish to be ill ... Sometimes you may want to have a syndrome ... Sometimes you may also want to have a Goldfield Syndrome ... like You 'd not remember this boring movie ... and above all, you would not remember Adam "superfluous" Sandler ... sometimes you may just wish to have rented another movie ... <br /> <br /> My choice? 3 of 10. My suggestion? If you're not a fan of boring romantic comedies, or Adam Sandler (... it's a joke, is not the fan of Adam Sandler? Drew Barrymore ... maybe.
