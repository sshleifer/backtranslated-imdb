After reading for years how great this film was, how he established Ruiz among the French critics (especially the snobbish Cahiers), I finally found him rather disappointing about a year ago (but then I think expectations were sky high). This deliberately cerebral film (made for television and mercifully only for an hour), shot in black and white, is narrated in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as he contemplates a series of paintings (published in the Style of tableaux vivants) and try to figure out if they have clues to a hidden political crime. (The terrible Kate Beckinsale movie Uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I've read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say that almost every Borges story is more interesting than this movie.
