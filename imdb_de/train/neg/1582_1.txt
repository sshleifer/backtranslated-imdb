argh! This movie hurts me. and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just my growing hatred of the action genre, but even as a kid, if I swallowed trips like Navy Seals, I still looked at this movie with dislike. now I totally despise it. <br /> <br /> take a pretty good, fast paced history. Keep the title and throw away the rest. Instead, use a half-hearted future gladiator story so full of storylines that all things are in danger of collapsing (why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena, what about the cameras? Why did you take clear shots of it What really happened is at Bakersfeild in an unguarded room?) <br /> <br /> The whole movie screams eighties, from the truley terrible results to the silly shiny costumes. ugh. <br /> <br /> do not watch this movie. I know that some people liked it, but some people do not want to be peed on, and I do not understand it.
