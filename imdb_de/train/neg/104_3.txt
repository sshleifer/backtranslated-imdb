On the way to a small town off the beaten track (which looks suspiciously close to a highway), a reporter meets a strange hitchhiker who wants to help her bring her to her destination. The stranger then tells of a pair of cruel stories related to the area: In the first story, a couple plans to kill the husband of the wife, but suffers a much worse fate when attacked by a zombie. and in the second story, a group of campers has shortened their vacation when an undead outlaw peeks at the death of his grave. The zombie chronicles are an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes to create a zombie-themed anthology - a nice idea, but with only two stories, it's shaky. And that's not the only way this low-budget gore-flick does not work: acting is awful (with Joe Haggerty, the storyteller Ebenezer Jackson doing one of the strangest performances I've ever seen); the locations are not inspired; the script is bleak; There is a sex scene without nudity. and the end .... well, that refutes the belief. <br /> <br /> To be honest, part of Syke's creative camerawork is effective (though the gambit used as characters through the woods is a bit off the bat and Joe Castro's cheaper Gore is thrilled: an ear is bitten off Eyeballs are picked out, a face removed, the brain squeezed, and a messy decapitation done.These positives make the movie bearable, but be warned: The Zombie Chronicles are not a walk in the park, even for seasoned Z-Grade viewers -Glue. <br /> <br /> I'm giving The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously increase my rating to 3 because I could not see the movie with 3D effect (though I suspect that adds an extra dimension would not have made much difference).
