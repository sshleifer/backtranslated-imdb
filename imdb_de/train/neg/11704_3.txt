One of them: "Why was that done?" Movies. The romance is very hard to swallow. It's one of those romances that suddenly "clicks" - they're in love. The movie is full of long breaks and uncomfortable moments - the drive-in restaurant is the most notable. Charles Grodin does a credible job, but for most of the movie, it's only him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself, do you want to see Grodin with his neurosis and Lasser with her neurosis for an hour and a half together?
