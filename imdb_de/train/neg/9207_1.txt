This movie was sold for a dollar on Wal-Mart on a DVD and so I do not feel like I lost anything to the movie except my TIME. Enjoying the acting of Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling), who looked very young and did a great job, considering it was a horrible screenplay. The story is about college students who have decided to play the game "Mazes & Monsters", only in a very realistic environment. Robbie Wheeling has had problems playing this game in other colleges in the past, and it is recommended by his parents to leave the game alone and get high grades. Robbie meets a very nice girl and has a romantic momentum with her. As soon as he starts playing, he stops loving with her and behaves like a monk. There are some scenes in the film that are filmed around the former World Trade Center as well as in the observation area and the roof area. It's pretty sad to watch this part of the movie where so many people died because of evil in the world. This is not a very good movie, with the exception of Tom Hanks, who tries to keep the movie from falling entertainment levels.
