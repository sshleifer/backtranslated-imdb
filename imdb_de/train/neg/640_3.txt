Chilly, alienating adaptation of Rebecca West's book about an army captain returning from service with limited memory during World War II (now there is an original idea!). It seems he remembers the old flame Glenda Jackson, but not the current Mrs. Julie Christie, which should be enough to trigger some emotional sparks. This extremely well-staffed soap maker brings Alan Bates, Alan Bridges, and co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret, and Ian Holm together, but the burners are all on top. There are a handful of good scenes (especially when Jackson is on the screen), but Bridges' tempo is uncomfortably lethargic and the film's boring color is impressive. This "soldier" is long forgotten on the shelf best. * 1/2 of ****
