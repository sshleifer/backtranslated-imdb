You believe in God or not. You believe in Jesus or not. They believe that he is the son of God or not. The decision is yours. <br /> <br /> Director Denys Arcand has really done everything to bring Jesus to a mere historical personage, a social worker, son of two people, instead of the Son of God, the saint, spirit and Mary, who is heaven for again have opened us. Encouraging the Big Bang creates a world of evolution rather than seeing the beauty of creation. The film features a theologian who brings some "modern insights" to the actor who plays Jesus in the Passion Play, happily incorporating them into his play. <br /> <br /> The pictured priest leading the sanctuary where the Passion Play is located In Montreal, a sexual relationship has been established with one of the female players of the Passion Play rather than showing his love of God through celibacy. Mostly the director's disgust for the church is clearly visible. The director has tried to create a parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of the Passion Play actor. This is an admirable attempt, but the resurrection of transplanting organs of the Passion Play actor into other bodies means the director thinks about Jesus. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important, God's opinion is, but I do not want to follow in the footsteps of the director and the actor when he stands before the throne of Jesus.
