I'm a big fan of David Lynch. However, this movie was a pretty disappointing experience. Apart from the background music in the background? what really makes the mood of the film ?? almost all the qualities that I can combine with Lynch's work are missing. The visuals, to say the least, are boring and the dialogue is too vague and monotonous to be of interest. <br /> <br /> This feels more like an unloved movie student doing an arty dogma movie by an experienced director. I have seen many amateur films with far superior camera work, scenery, sound and script. This film has almost all artistic qualities. I feel like I'm watching one of David's home videos produced during a weekend trip with some friends.
