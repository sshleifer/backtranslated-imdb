I really did not expect this kind of movie to exist outside of America. How anyone can interpret child sexual abuse as a "thriller" is simply sick. Auteuil (whom I had previously admired), who walked around like a kind of child-sparing Rambo, was ignorant and insulting to all the children who were sexually exploited around the world. The groundbreaking movie "Happiness" appeared in the year BEFORE this movie. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed. It is admirable to read some of the smarter viewer's comments there. They could see the sloppy and ridiculous way of dealing with this subject. Those of you who think this movie is great show a disgusting amount of ignorance and you have to watch "happiness" to open yourself to the true horrors of pedophilia, kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or by neighbors, teachers, friends or even Are relatives harassed? Hmm ... I wonder. When they make a film about international childrens slavery of all kinds, they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotional instead of triggering that push of a button. 1.10
