Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is totally and totally rude, raw, crass and rude. This is indeed the only way to describe this dreadful, trashy piece of stand-up. Eddie Murphy is more of a shock than a laugh to win his followers. He manages to be funny occasionally, but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and unpleasant sex jokes. Unless you happen to enjoy Eddie's evil style. I do not think I'll deal with Eddie Murphy Raw. I prefer Eddie to the scripts in a movie. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
