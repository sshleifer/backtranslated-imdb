.... because if I were, I might have wished that I was crucified at a wooden cross! I still try to determine the plot of this movie - and I am "generous" that there was even an act. As already mentioned, it is a misnomer on the cover of the DVD that Richard Dreyfuss is the star. He was hardly in the movie. And if he was actually "frustrated," as the back cover indicated, it was him, probably because he said yes, to be in that catastrophe of a movie and not be able to get out! The movie really seemed to focus on Jared Martin, and what was his role in the film, except for the extreme close-ups, was not as big a puzzle as Gene Barry's role was or was not. And speaking of "big" ... whoever had the ingenious idea of ​​fitting Gene Barry into the clothes of Humpty Dumpty, in which his pants were literally pulled up to his chin, was going to be a hard time through this sober movie to be judged. I could always say how horrible this movie was, from the dialogue that does not match the "actors' rumors" (think of Clutch Cargo), to the unpredictable jump from scene to scene (though generous and even the picture frames is called). Scenes "), the absence of an action ... However, if you live in a bad genre of the early 70's and are in a cottage in Michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kids and cat pictures, I recommend you Drinking a good bottle of wine before embarking on this strange ride of a movie will make you grateful that you will not remember it the next day!
