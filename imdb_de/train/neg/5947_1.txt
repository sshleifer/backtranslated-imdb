This is one of the hottest and cruelest movies I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, I was tempted to stick to it because Donald Sutherland misleadingly lent credibility to his presence. [This is the last time this will happen.] Lesley Ann Warren's character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come. There were wiser characters than theirs killed in the movie. That's just one of many things in this movie that asked me, "Where is justice?" <br /> <br /> Why is late night cable so filled with sadistic garbage that is filled with pathological chaos? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women and seem to focus on being terrorized and murdered. This movie could have been just as exciting without being sick and twisted. All that has to be done is to turn the viewer's stomach with his illness and insult the viewer's intelligence. <br/> <br /> The cast is misleadingly good. My guess is that they first SUBMITTED Sutherland and used it to lure the others like Lemmings into the matter.
