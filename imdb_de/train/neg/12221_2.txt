With the exception of the sound there is no criticism of this kind of (really) independent horror movie. Make-up effects and Gore are very good and the lead actor was effective, although the lead actress is attractive because she is particularly poor. <br /> <br /> The main problem with Frightworld is the length, at 108 minutes it's the problem Half an hour too long to be effective as a Slasher movie, only about ten minutes of the first fifty actions are significant. <br /> <br /> In some places it is visually appealing and sometimes the light lacks the movies. However, when combined with the poor sound, as is the case with most films, large sections are difficult to see. <br /> <br /> This could certainly be a fun, if unoriginal, "serial killer from the dead" movie. With some ruthless cut, it plays in its present form like an unfinished rough cut.
