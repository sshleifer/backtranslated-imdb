I was looking for this movie for a reason - Al Adamson. He is one of the worst directors of all time - at the top with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the Pantheon of Dread. However, I was a bit disappointed, because although the film was really bad, he never reached the limits of his earlier fluffy films. For that reason, watching this movie for us bad movie fans was not too funny. <br /> <br /> Now I was careful watching this movie because the title "Naughty Stewardesses" makes the movie look like a porn movie - something I would not check for IMDb. However, this movie seemed to be like this at times - especially in the first 10 minutes. However, it can be seen that the script has gone through many changes, as there is no dizziness for most of the movie, and towards the end of the movie there is an action that comes from no area where it is violent and certainly not sexy ! The result is a total confusion. Unfortunately, none of the many parts is even good. For example, it shows surprisingly little as a porn video AND it is incomprehensible why they would put a 71-year-old guy in some love scenes. Sure, it looked pretty good for a 71-year-old Mr. Livingston - but he was still an old man, and no one would want to see him handle young nymphs! Then, when the last 20 minutes become very violent, when Livingston became a Rambo-like guy! Talk about funny and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is little to recommend this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to take care of it, and the movie manages to be pretty boring even with such a crazy title as "Naughty Stewardesses."
