Hard to believe that the movie from this book could surpass its horror! The plot is so thoughtful and incredible. , , Starting with putting a ton of guilt on a small child to spare their pain! Then we have the deliberate behavior of at least six and maybe more people (including clerics) involved in a crime everywhere. Next, we have a woman who seems to walk the length of a ferry from comparatively happy to very short. A very unpleasant and coo coo mother who is supported, supported and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving the hive off an island off the coast of South Carolina did not help the story, though it may have helped the filmmaker's budget. The beautiful buildings that supposedly housed the monastery did not seem to suit an island small enough to require golf carts and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger, whom I really like, is painfully thin in this movie and her hairstyle is certainly in another decade. There's just no chemistry between her and the male connections. I thoroughly liked the book this book came from, but I read it all. The film, to which I surfed again and again, had to go if the saccharine music became too much. If you do not like an incredible story, playing wood, a twisted mixture of religious / mythological / allegory, it is my advice to skip it. Oh, and maybe a little gruff critique, but would not a caring father have a life jacket with a small kid on a small boat? The best thing about this film is the landscape
