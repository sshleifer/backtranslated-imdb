An excellent example of how Hollywood could (and can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction, and it stupidly steals it. <br /> <br /> In the case of "The Big Sky", the author surmised that Dudley Nichols and his associates arrogantly could improve a classic pioneer novel by Pulitzer Prize winner AB Guthrie In this way, she removed the soul of the story and all the virtues and influence that she possibly had as a film adaptation. <br /> <br /> The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of his main character Boone Caudill. From a naive Kentucky boy to a hardened and competent survivor / miner, he was replaced by a scaled-down riverboat farce that does little resemble the author's intent. In the movie version, Boone's presence is nothing more than oppressive. <br /> <br /> Fascinating and even shocking elements that give Guthrie's novel action and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason. Most puzzling of all is the emphasis on the Zeb Calloway character, who was a random, insignificant character in the book, occupying only a handful of pages. On the other hand, missing a very important and fascinating character, the experienced pioneer Dick Summers. It is also obvious that director Hawks decided that the zeb character in the movie played by actor Hunnicutt was not irritating enough. So Zeb / Hunnicutt has been given a lot of time to make this vile voiceover narrative, which is the acronym of Hollywood for incompetent writing, editing and directing. Some films have actually improved books on which they were based (William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" is a prime example). But that's terrible and depressing, not just as an adaptation of a novel, but as a film in itself. <br /> <br /> The story is boring and clich√©d and the characters - at least the ones who were not cut out of the script - are just flat and boring shadows of Guthrie's literary vision. And unfortunately, Kirk Douglas' star appeal, which could have contributed to this film, was derided by the Milktoaster role he had received. If you can believe it, the movie version of Guthrie's Pulitzer Prize-winning sequel to "The Way West," including Kirk, is even worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" confirms Howard Hawks' position as one of the most overrated, lukewarm directors in the history of cinema
