It is unfortunate that someone decided to play the best horror movies of all time in my book. This bad copy steals a lot of footage from the first three films and is even enough to duplicate how people die and what will happen in the future, and it basically tries to put three films in one and fails. It does not even create a good, frightening atmosphere for a person (except for one or the other exception, where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old movies). <br /> <br /> The only thing we can be grateful for is that it was there was not an omen V.
