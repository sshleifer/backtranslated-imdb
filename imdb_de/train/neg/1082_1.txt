I think I've seen all the Grisham movies now, and generally they're all very poor except The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad it's unbelievable. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILERISH /> It's one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things nobody would ever do. He's a lawyer, for God's sake. Why, when his children disappear, he does not call the police. Oh yes, because the police hate lawyers, so they just ignore him and let him be attacked. <br /> <br /> If he's arrested for murder, he'll just release him, he'll be locked in a cell for a bail hearing. <br /> <br /> Why would your kids be halfway across the country if you could easily protect them at home. <br /> <br /> The police do not bother to find an escaped mental patient. they do not bother to interview his daughter. <br /> <br /> As for the ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> In summary, stupid, very unrealistic and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever made.
