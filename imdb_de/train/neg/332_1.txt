I'll start by saying that I can not quite stand it. I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart like the other reviewers on this site. I thought that I would not regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously, who approved this project? You have to be forced to watch this movie again and again until the end of eternity. That's the only appropriate punishment I can think of when you've published something like that. The shoot reminds me of the films I did for class projects on a big old VHS cam. Acting is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are some cool cameos. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is not funny and the ship's commander is an even bigger loser. That's about as much of the plot as I understand it. Overall, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and gave it to many colleagues to the reputation. Everyone comes back and laughs and says, "Wow, I did not think I'd ever say I had an Adam Sandler movie in 15 minutes ..." <br /> <br />
