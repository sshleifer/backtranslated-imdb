This film has a very hard-to-swallow premise, even by the standards of the genre. Not only are we accepting that a backward-played record can bring a dead person back to life, but also that the record contains hidden messages aimed at a child when the singer had no connection to the boy when he was alive, and, of course, no way to know in whose hands the plate would land. In any case, the movie is fun for a while, but eventually the stupidity and futility prevail. If they were really trying to create a new Freddy-like horror icon, they were far away: the rogue here has no personality, no motivation and no variety. (* 1/2)
