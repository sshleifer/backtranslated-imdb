The worst movie. Basically, the US Declaration of Independence has been replaced by a plasma screen that has been misleading the safety of the museum for a few days. Eh? <br /> <br /> The plasma screen, which theoretically would run for less than 2 seconds from this clock battery, provided it had a low internal resistance to deliver the required current, which it would not do. <Br /> <br /> It would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter, but this system would not fit in the case. I'm sorry to be an anal, but that's not nearly plausible. The rest of the movie was not much better and I wonder why the budget could not be donated to charity or for me.
