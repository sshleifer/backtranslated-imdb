It is rare that I feel the need to write a review on this website, but this film is well deserved because it was produced so poorly and how biased its product was. <br /> <br /> I felt a clear attempt by part of the filmmakers to portray the Palestinian family as boorish and unreliable. We hear them discuss the sadness they feel about oppression, but the film is so filmed and arranged that we perceive the politically oppressed population as the Jewish population of Israel. We see no sign that the position of the Palestinian teenager is parallel. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand limitations, but the political nature of the restrictions should prevent peace. I came out of the movie and I feel that the mother of the victim was selfishly in her grief and completely closed off, so to speak, because of her side of the fence. She was still unwilling to see the injuries of the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed words left the last meeting out of control. In my view, it is more realistic to see Israeli thinking as the root of the problem. ignoring requests for understanding and freedom, ignoring requests for recognition for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land admirably in a documentary, but given the lack of impartiality, everything seems to be exploitative. Also for the bad edits, lack of background in the actual case and finally the inadequate representation of the Palestinian side. After all, it's a bad documentary and a bad movie. I agree that this is partly due to the political situation, but I have a duty to note the directional errors, irrespective of the heartrending and sad topics.
