This was a disappointing movie. Considering the material - the life of the army is always good for a laugh - and for the stars this movie should have been a run-down laugh. It was worth a few giggles at best. Steve Martin was much funnier than this and it seems that Dan Ackroyd should remain in dramatic roles, perhaps following Robin Williams lead and eventually winning an Oscar.
