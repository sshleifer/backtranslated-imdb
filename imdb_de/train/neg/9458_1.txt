There are already many comments that say exactly how I felt about this movie, so I'll be brief. <br /> <br /> "The Grinch," I thought, was wonderful - Jim Carrey is a really talented, physical comedian, a versatile smart actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers, on the other hand, laughs when he sucks. I liked him so much in his "Waynes World" and "So A Married a Ax Murderer" time - but I never loved Austin Powers, and "The Cat In The Hat" just got me started. <br /> <br /> This movie was awful - the gags were awful! Not suitable for children, not just adults, but also because some of them were so old they did not entertain anyone for fifty years! The plot was messy, messy, messy! It's a pity, because the kids were very nice, as was "Mom". They could probably have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have done it if it had not been for Myers' ugly, hideous and exaggerated portrayal of the cat. I mean - did Myers even take a look at a script? Was one written? The other actors seemed to have one - but the cat seemed to be inspiring! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I would like to mention that the sets and props were wonderful !!! But unfortunately they can not save this movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Dr. Seuss - the man was a genius! Do not spoil his reputation by adapting his work so lazily and untidily !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
