Sure, it had some prerequisites for a good movie. The plot is good, albeit a bit boring, and the acting good enough, though I did not understand why Olivia d'Abo had such a pronounced Australian accent if her character had grown up in the US. My biggest problem, however, was the wardrobe. I know that the average American of every European who respects himself is a frumpy sideboard, but that was beyond. Anna's color combinations were definitely awful !! And that potato-like, sad apology for a coat she wore throughout the movie made me burst out in hives. I think the idea was to be as realistic as possible (how many schoolteachers are going around in Prada?), But just does not mean that there is no taste. A word to the wise ...
