The creativity of Frank Capra was probably almost gone when filming this movie. While Capra has some charming moments and many wonderful performers, the direct recycling of Capra is not only the script, but also vast material from his first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), downright sloppy. It's understandable that he reuses footage from the exciting horse race. However, he uses full dialogue scenes with smaller actors, then brings them back and expects us not to notice, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years older! If you do not want to see one of Oliver Hardy's last performances, skip it and watch Broadway Bill instead.
