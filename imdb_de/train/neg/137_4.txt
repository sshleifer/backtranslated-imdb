It's easy to see why the creators of Scary Movie found it so easy to fake these 'teen slasher' movies. They are so incredibly formulaic. And if Valentine had been published about a year ago, they would certainly have been faked. If you've found original material that sets them apart from the screams, I know what you did last summer and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine has nothing new in the genre, except a better ending than usual, which of course leaves plenty of room for the inevitable sequel. As always, a masked psychotic killer follows a bunch of pretty young women and gradually kills the main character's friends, usually towering. Much T & A, no character development, bad acting and excessive bloodshed. <br /> <br /> What I do not like about these kinds of movies is that they call themselves "who has it?" '. The thing is that this is not the case, because the motive will not be revealed until the killer has been unmasked and the main character says who has now murdered all the friends. Usually something that was never clarified during the film anyway (for example, the uncle of the uncle of the mother of the main character kicked the dog of his father's friend). Anyone alive during the movie is a "suspect," but there are more "Red Lords" than suspects. As we all know, the main character at this point creates an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the subject is revealed. Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. ***************SPOILER!!!!!! (Mini-spoiler anyway) ********************************************************* ************************************************** ********************************************* Teen slashes away. The problem is only partially resolved, and the target of the main killer may or may not have been achieved if one survived the bloodshed and killed almost everyone. Does the murderer want more, or have the demons really been defeated? <br /> <br /> This still did not make Valentine a good movie, instead he simply saved him from being as bad as usual, which still does not count for much. For anyone who wants to make another film in this direction, please do not. Originality is so important and it's hard to see that originality comes from this genre.
