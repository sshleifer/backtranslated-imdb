Chillers starts on a cold, dark, stormy night when a bus leaves three passengers in front of a bus stop, a little boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a university professor. Howard Conrow (David Wohl) & a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie) Pennington). Inside, they discover that they have missed their connecting bus and are stranded for the night. In the waiting area, they find two other people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) and a sleeping woman named Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimmons), who is having a fearsome nightmare ... <br /> <br /> While swimming in an indoor pool Lindsay encounters & friendships named Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson). The next time Lindsay sees Billy, he dives into the pool and then apparently disappears into the air before he shows up. Soon after Lindsay discovers that Billy Water died in a diving accident 5 years ago ... Lindsay wakes up and tells the others about her nightmare. Everyone else answers with the comment that they, too, have been experiencing disturbing dreams lately & decide to share them to pass the time ... Next is Mason, who tells a story like him and his two friends Scott (David R. Hamm) and Jimmy (Will Tuckwiller) are terrorized during a camping trip ... <br /> <br /> Sharon, whose story is about a news anchor named Tom Williams (Thom Delventhal) she calls. Tom is on her doorstep in no time, but he turns out to be a vampire ... Next up is Ronnie's turn and he describes how he discovers that he's the one Can bring the dead back to life. Unfortunately, he brings the executed mass murderer Nelson Caulder (Bradford Boll). back to the murderous life ... <br /> <br /> Conrow a story of how two of his disciples brought an ancient Aztec war god named Ixpe (Kimberly Harbo) back to life ... <br /> <br /> Then back to the bus station for a last (predictable) turn .. . <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Daniel Boyd Chillers is one of the worst horror anthologies I've ever seen and I really like this subgenre a lot. Boyd's script lacks what is needed for movies like Chillers, you can see the last turn is a mile away & every story is really lame. The first is completely meaningless and seemed to have no end. The best of these anthologies are the short, snappy stories, which are rounded off with a neat turn. The second story is predictable and ends again without profit. So it goes on in all chillers that every story is deeply unsatisfactory and receives no reward. The characters and the dialogue are poorly written, the stories do not seem to have their own ideas and overall the movie is totally crappy. At least, each story does not last long and I liked the idea behind the linking segments. <br /> <br /> Director Boyd obviously worked on a very low budget and it shows. All I can say is, if you want to see a 15-minute short story that's completely in a pool, Chillers is for you. The stories are neither smart, creepy, nor do they have any tension or build on anything. However, there are a few beautiful scenes and surprising skills that show through occasionally. There is not much going on in Chillers regarding violence and violence. A torn-out heart, a decapitated head, and a bitten-off hand are as bloody as they can get. <br /> <br /> Technically, chillers are bad things that do not impress everyone. Basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects and below-average production values. Chillers also offers one of the worst themed songs of all time. Acting is also of very low standard. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Chillers was used as a low budget movie and at least tried the filmmakers. but that still does not stop me from thinking that it's crap. Similar anthology films such as Tales From the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965), Creepshow (1982) and Tales From the Darkside: The film (1990) are far superior to the chillers.
