It really impresses me that it was made. The director / writer / actor must be really charismatic in reality. I can not imagine any other way in which the scripting phase would happen. What I want you to think about is this: While watching the movies, I felt sorry for the actors. It felt like standing in a comedy club where the guy dies on his feet and you sit there, do not enjoy it and just feel bad for him. I would really like to know what the budget is, guess it must have been low, as the movie quality is really bad. I want to write, "the jokes did not appeal to me". But the reality is that they appeal to you. You would have to be the man who wrote it. or a delay. Think of it as a script ... and that guy lit THIS green. That's impressive, right?
