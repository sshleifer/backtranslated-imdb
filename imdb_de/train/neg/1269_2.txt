This series only gets 2 stars because it puts some of Dickens' Bleak House on film and maybe someone reads the book. Contrary to the opinion probably received, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock. It was clunky and made of wood. Lady D. is a reserved character, but not a Martinet. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr. Jarndyce. So I stop myself and answer all the people who say, "I did not read the book, so I do not have to take that guy's opinion into account because he bases his assessments on the book." True and not true For example, Diana Rigg is bad in her role because she plays badly, whether you've read the book or not. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a passable Jarndyce (though too old). The series does not fail because it's unfair to compare it to the book, but because the various plotlines and characters do not come together to form a coherent, dramatic, mysterious and convincing conversation. It is boring and shallow. If you want to make Bleak House as good as possible, you'll have to spend 20 hours of film in 10 two-hour episodes. However, I suggest that producers, etc. let Dickens alone (even A Christmas Carol). Television weakens the genius of Dickens, which manifests itself in his ingenious conspiracies and unforgettable characters.
