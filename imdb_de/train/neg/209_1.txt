I could not bear to see Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast. I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie was Scott Baio (a skateboarding chase scene!). Jodie Foster turns into her usual "adult" role in her usual professional performance, but that's no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours from my life that I will never come back! No remarkable characters, incredible plot, questionable cut and terrible cinematography, but the worst of it all was that I could not care less. The story of Californian teenagers in the 70s, where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Do not waste your time watching this ugly apology for a movie.
