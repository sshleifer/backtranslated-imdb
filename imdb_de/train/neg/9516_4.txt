Frank Sinatra plays an ex-soldier and a frustrated no-goodnik writer who lives hard and wants to drink hard. He returns to his hometown in the Midwest and unites with his strange brother (Arthur Kennedy), who has now collapsed with a disinterested wife and an uninterested woman's idiosyncratic daughter. Frank gets involved with player Dean Martin, the unlearned fledgling Shirley MacLaine, and has some clashes with the law, but he really wants to write and settle down with a good wife. A simplistic drama bordering on soap opera with a role for MacLaine, who is alternately overly "colorful" and embarrassingly sentimental (her drunken girdle on "After You've Gone," however, is the highlight of the film and is expertly handled). Director Vincente Minnelli oversees it straightforward, but it's surprisingly bleak and most of the big scenes are flat or tight. The picture looks incredibly good in widescreen format, with a good eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are in the rubbish. ** from ****
