That was not great. Not terrible or hateful or anything, just forget it. <br /> <br /> It had a kind, um, hesitant, rarefied air, as if it never really knew whether it wanted to laugh or for sweetness or for satire. So we had a weak mix of the three. The actors seemed to be lost somehow. <br /> <br /> The ideas were really tired and recycled, almost zombified themselves. How often do we need to know that the 50s in the States were infected with a banal sense of conformity? And that this was perpetuated by the aggressive consumerism? And this emotional oppression in men is a matter of Baaaaad? Old hat. <br /> <br /> His biggest crime in my eyes, however, was how detached it was from reality. I know it was a comedy and everything, but - especially in a whole movie in which you have to sustain a public's interest for a long time - you still need a kind of emotional anchor, a relative guide through the story to make her captivating. So that the "hero child" can see an old woman, two classmates and ultimately his father through zombies or whatever painful death and he can greet everything with a happy smile and a shrug, then I just have trouble, in some way positive deal with it. The mother was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhumane at this level, you risk losing me and that's how it happened. <br /> <br /> The biggest plus I can offer is that I like the look of this kind of apple pie suburb. That was good enough, it was a good looking movie, especially some of those wide angle shots of the street and the house of the Robinsons. Even the opening magazine was cute, in a way it was made, but still funny. <br /> <br /> And I thought Billy Connolly was fine and that comes from someone who is not a big fan of Billy Connolly: movie star. I was just scared that he would beat it up and try to steal every scene, but he played it quite reservedly and was probably the most likable character in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, not great.
