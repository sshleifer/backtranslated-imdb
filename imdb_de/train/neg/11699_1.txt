The plot of The Thinner is extremely thin. And roughly. An overweight lawyer drives over the gypsy, and the gypsy's curse makes him lose weight and lose weight ... to the bone. OK, gypsy curses should be entertaining, but losing weight has gone bad? Nope. Except that Stephen King thinks that way. And Michael McDowell, another horror author and scriptwriter of this abysmal movie, also does. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, he's fat too, haha! The thinner is for a man who groans, as he / she has never seen anything as disgusting as a greasy, an immature piece of crap. Hey, I can only say: Well, look in the mirror.
