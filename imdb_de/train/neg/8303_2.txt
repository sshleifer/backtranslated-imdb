Since its release in 1983, "A Christmas Story," Jean Shepherd's story of his alter ego, Ralphie, has become a true classic. However, "My Summer Story" still has Shepherd as the narrator, but it has absolutely no charm and the characters are far from the caliber of the original movie. <br /> <br /> "My Summer Story" is basically a mish-mash of mediocre and just not very interesting stories involving hillbilly neighbors and fighting tops. Charles Grodin, whom I usually like, is extremely unlikely in the role of the father (more in the original more appropriate to Darren McGavin), and his character never seems to be anything but forced. Kiernan Culkin is a bad substitute for Ralphie, and his little brother is almost forgotten here. Only mom seems to have a value here, and maybe that's because she books a movie manager with a gravy boat, when he shoves his luck with angry housewives on "free dish night" are mostly insignificant and thin as paper. While this may be undemanding, as a continuation of "A Christmas Story," it is a very poor and not worth the time. 2 out of 10.
