This ambitious film suffers most from the megalomania of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. This deposited elephant, made of much better material (Altman's "Nashville", "Lumets" Network), takes far too long to get anywhere, and a few misguided detours (an embarrassing musical interlude, a biblical plague) do not help. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and plot could easily be completely eliminated, Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing fear, and how often do we have to see John C. Reilly's Sad Sack shtick ("Chicago")? and "The Hours" will be enough?) Tom Cruise compares favorably with his misogynistic, sullen Holy Roller, who was quite amusing Speaking of dishonest mouths, the script was so full of "F" bombs that they quickly became their influence Do not even talk about this awesome soundtrack filled with threadbare and annoying vocals by Aimee Mann, their extended rendition of "One," an a initially maudinen number, brought me to the beginning of the film for distraction. I should have paid attention to the handwriting on the wall and had to save three more hours. Until then, I had come to the edge of hell. One salvation feature that I have not seen in other reviews is the group's best performance, by the unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, the damaged cocaine drunkard who wants to destroy herself. Their credibility far exceeded all others. This film was far too serious and did not know when it should end.
