This film is rightly known as one of the most horrific examples of propaganda ever produced. The stubborn equation of the Jews with disease is simply pathological, and even worse it becomes almost credible by their sheer repetition for a few seconds. The fact that something raw works for a short time is a lesson in itself. You have to have a strong belly and a firm grip to get through it, and I would not recommend it unless you have a good reason.
