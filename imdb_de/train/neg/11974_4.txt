You know you've seen the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers side by side on an island, but one might think that if you see untidy heroes running half-baked through the bush with an egg on the spoon for half a decade, it's enough for them You get involved in something more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I'm not even talking about the validity of the shows, which I find questionable for the record. It's hard to stop the disbelief of "Bushy Bill" when he eats a rat, when the entire crew of producers and cameramen are housed in an air-conditioned bio-dome slurping frosty mochcinnos with Moxy. <br /> <br /> What is? the call here? I am not interested in these people or their wandering life. I just do not understand. However, if you are fascinated by hairy, unwashed people, I suggest you turn off the TV and just drive to your local bus station, where you can see such people in their TRUE habitat. They call her HOMELESS PEOPLE, and for free you can sit back and be amazed at her uncanny ability to fetch various cigarettes out of a plethora of garbage cans, finally beat "Pay-Dirt" and make a home-made cancer according to Dr. Watson. Forming Frankenstein style sticks, people are always asking for variety when the stink of "Aqua Velva" suggests something else in their breath. And the best part? Similar to Survivor, one member of the tribe "leaves" the "island" every week when it is sent to the local institution without any problem, as the frightening, non-drug condition of adult schizophrenia gets under way! THAT IS ENTERTAINMENT!
