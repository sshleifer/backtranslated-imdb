I'm not sure if it's the language or the bad acting, but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and spurious. <br /> <br /> After seeing The Fall, this is a big disappointment. There is no connection between different scenes, and acting is so incredibly poor that I could not even believe that people could make such a mess of something that had great potential. <br /> <br /> And above all everyone in Germany speaks English. Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound, and especially Hitler himself only sounds like Hitler when he speaks / cries German. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told made me believe that it was improvised on the spot The characters were empty, and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened. <br /> <br /> Whether it's English or the fact that I've already seen The Fall, everything was fake and ridiculous.
