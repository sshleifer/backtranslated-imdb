I hated this movie so much that I vividly remember it. It is not even funny. Any movie that relies on listless sex jokes and racist humor does not deserve the money to pay for it. In the first half hour Rob Schneider drinks a box of rancid milk. I could only think, "He deserves it because he made such a bad movie". Do not waste your time or your money.
