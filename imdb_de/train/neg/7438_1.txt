This movie is a waste of time, the plot is terrible, the dialogue is awful. <br /> <br /> The acting is OK, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with. The photography and some of the special effects are fine, but again there is nothing interesting to see. There is no logical progress in the story, the plot is total nonsense. It's not even scary. For a movie to be scary, there must be at least a small element of credibility. This movie is not believable at all. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Every character is flat and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most special effects and make-up work are either bad or at least mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope you read this and do not waste time with this movie, unless you are here are curious about a totally horrible movie.
