Oh my gosh ... there are so many other movies I want to see out there ... I got stuck with my nephew for the weekend, and that's exactly what he wanted - Yeah ... <br /> <br / > I used to watch this show when I was in college ... it was mindless, kind of funny and a bit action-oriented. The show had a good heart ... and the characters were cute; No one was ever killed or seriously injured ... it was as if a cartoon had come to life. Cut to 2005 ... What happened? This one does not work. As others have said, there is simply no coherent story and the performances are weird ... almost annoying - definitely not true to the original characters ... the whole thing is like a Mad TV sketch and takes over 100 minutes! This was one of the few times I saw a movie. What did they think? The best way to judge it has been for product marketing, toys, and so on. All I can say is to let this one die a quick death. The original Dukes of Hazzard seem like Masterpiece Theater ... <br /> <br /> I think the only remake left of television is Gilligan's Island ... good luck!
