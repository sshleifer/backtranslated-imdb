This is pretty much the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've seen. I say a lot because I saw Soldier playing the villain ... but from what I've heard, it's not a Jason Scott Lee movie. This is however. And if this is an indication of the quality of such films, I do not see any of the others. Lee is basically walkable as a martial artist ... as a leading actor, he is terrible. He gets into a fight every few minutes of the movie with random no-name characters, probably because the scriptwriter could not figure out how to stretch the movie to the minimum runtime for a feature film. The villain is the only character with a touch of personality, and apart from being demonically crazy, he hardly looks like a villain. The majority of the movie is essentially Lee who chases the villain through time ... or maybe it's the other way around. I can not say for sure ... and I would definitely not look again to be sure. The effects are not terrible ... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to kill Hitler. Somehow the movie messes up this interesting idea. The plot is too complicated for itself. The tempo is bad. I can not say anything positive about this movie ... I really can not. It's just too formulaic and meaningless. If only I had a time machine, I could go back and stop this movie ever being made ... no, no matter. I just hope that as few fragile minds as possible are affected by it. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend it to fans of Lee and no one else. If you are looking for a quality movie, it is not so. That's for sure. 1.10
