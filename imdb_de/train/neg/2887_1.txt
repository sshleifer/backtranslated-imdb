I've just seen this movie today and not only is it terrible and terrible, but it looks like the director has put together a few friends to make a movie about a sick man. I also think that this movie has the look of a porno video, with a clear view. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Heaven, I work in a video library and I did not have to pay for it because this movie is responsible for crap x infinity ... DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS FILM !!!!! You'd have a better time than Dude where my car is than that piece of crap! And that does not say much for this movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is lousy and the film is simply unsurpassable. I watched this movie and wanted to kill myself during and after the movie. <br /> <br /> I went home and puking myself after watching this movie, I showered and burned my clothes. <br /> <br /> If I had my brains, I'd take the movie out there and burn it, because no-one should submit to that ... well, maybe members of Al Queda ... especially those we have Child custody and child rapists who are sentenced to life imprisonment without parole ... just make an institution like Orange, and then force this cheese head to watch it over and over again.
