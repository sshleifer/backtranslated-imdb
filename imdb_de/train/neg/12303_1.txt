This movie is so bad that it is good - in an unintentionally funny way. I could not stop looking at it, I laughed so much! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except that it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, an oppressed preacher who falls heavily in love with Luke (Corey Sevier), a hunky and mysterious drifter, who we eventually learn is in jail; The only thing Sevier is guilty of is bad action! Mind you, he is not worse than the other actors. One has the feeling that the actors * no * know that they are in a really horrible movie; They are playing it right now. Everything about the film is bad: the acting, the script, the love scenes, the tempo, the twists of the plot, the choice of music. The climate scenes are just so ridiculous - first the shooting in the church, then the last words of Luke to Emily - I howled with laughter. Obviously, Luke has done a lot of weight lifting and belly scars in prison, and we see a lot of his bare chest. That's probably the highlight of the movie.
