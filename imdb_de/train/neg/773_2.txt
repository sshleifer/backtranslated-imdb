No, not the administration of GWB, the decision-maker / Strutter / Smirker - but the mini-series "Monarch Cove". The lifespan must have realized what a dog it was because the series was each burned by two episodes, most of which were broadcast between 11pm. Friday evening and Saturday morning at 1 o'clock. Why I looked at it all, I can only campaign for weekly, sudden convulsive attacks of masochism. Most performers are unknowns who probably remain unknown. The only two identifiable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who deliver the only decent performances (Jones can not make it through the entire series - Happy Woman). By the way, Ward is aging pretty well since her "Thorn Birds" days. <br /> <br /> The main strand of the conspiracy - who murdered the heroine's father, who was falsely convicted of Dad's murder - is released in six years after slamming - is stretched out so long and shut up so fast it's you it does not matter who does it. There is a lot of "steaming" sex, several murders and all sorts of rude behavior - of which practically none is interesting or credible. The majority of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented. The text and the direction are equal to the cast. <br /> <br /> If you stay until the end, the postcard is a (very small) scream. <br /> <br /> NOTE YOURSELF!
