"Raising Victor Vargas" is one of those light family movies that you look at while the crossword N.Y. Times can play at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona, you do not have to "pause" the DVD. Just let it roll because you will not miss anything really important. No twists, turns or tensions. It's not really an ethnic film, it's a movie about a poor, fighting immigrant family that happens to be Latino. They could have been any ethnic group. It made little difference. I've seen it all innumerable times. Just join a Jewish family, an Italian family, a black family or an Irish family. Only the accents and names were different. If the Vargas family were Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterian, the movie would have been an absolute nap. <br /> <br /> It's funny that the critics could not understand the locale. Some said it was Spanish Harlem. Some of the Bronx and another Brooklyn. As a lifelong New Yorker, I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seemed like the family never met anyone, except other Latinos. They lived in an isolated little enclave. Some interactions with non-Latinos may have led to excitement, interest or tension. Do you remember West Side Story? <br /> <br /> And now to the often criticized cinematographies. I do not know if it was my TV or what, but all the interior shots looked very ORANGE to me. The apartment, the furniture and the faces were all ORANGE. What does this mean? And the right one. looked pretty tight for me. Someone mentioned here that the old apartments had very large rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. The landlords have divided a large part into two or three very small and pressed into it as many immigrants as possible. <br /> <br /> And one more annoying thing ... This is the second family movie I've seen and criticized this week and wanted a teenager to jerk off. Is this private sex act necessary for us? Please spare me! What's up with these directors? <br /> <br /> "Victor Vargas" is a nice little movie. It was nice for a change to see young Latino actors taking a break and showing off their talents, which they did. But the authors abandoned them and gave them a flat, unspectacular script to work with. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the "fast-forward" button.
