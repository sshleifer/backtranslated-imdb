I saw this movie because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would try her sister, Rain Phoenix. I regret it. She was embarrassed and the movie just has this weird plot, if that's what you call it. Sissy was just funny and Jellybean just sits on a toilet, both sleeping with this old man in the mountains, what's going on? I have never been so dissatisfied in my life. It was just total garbage. I can not believe that the actors have agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. Did not bring Sissy as "beautiful" to me. I thought she was anything but that. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHAT IS THE SENSE ??? 0 out of 10, too bad that the poll does not have 0, does not even deserve a 1. Hopefully Rain is better in other films.
