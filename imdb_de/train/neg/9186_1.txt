Do you know how funny you are when you see a movie that tries so hard to be a serious, thought-provoking piece of cinema, and fails miserably? If you can not help but laugh at the horrible nature of the garbage on your screen? "House of the Dead" struggles to reach even this low-level cinema. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, "House of the Dead" makes you feel like you just woke up to find out that the cat was laying its ruffled business neatly on its forehead while you slept. It's clear from the beginning that the female actors were cast for their size (which they shamelessly exploit) while the male actors stand for their hardcore kick-ass attitude. I honestly did not care for any of the characters for the moment of the movie and actually wished her dead to save me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered showing two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. At least we'll act better then? However, it can not be all the fault attributed to the actors, since it is certainly a challenge to produce a compelling film before the script of this film. It's probably the worst part of the movie and actually contains the following lines: "These are zombies, pure and simple" and "No, we can not go there! It's evil!". <br /> <br /> We all know that zombie movies are never very thought-provoking or meaningful. At best, this is a harmless two hours of action, blood and horror. Garbage, yes, but entertaining garbage. Not the garbage that bursts out of your garbage bag when you drag it across the room and stifle your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins. According to IMDb, "House of the Dead" received so bad reviews that no Danish cinemas bought the movie. If only we could have had the same privilege. <br /> <br /> Final result: 1/10.
