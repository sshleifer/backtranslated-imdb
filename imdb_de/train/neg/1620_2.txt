This film has little to recommend, although the breathtaking scenery, cinematography, and wildlife direction are so limited, it's hard to pin down their weaknesses with such rave reviews. However, these very things make the absence of a satisfying act and its execution so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I saw this with my kids and none of us was too impressed from the end. Yes, the pictures were great, the vast landscapes in the woods and mountains magnificent, but what was in the foreground? The rather boring tale of the stupidity of a dull girl, who too slowly learns a very basic lesson about friendship with wildlife - and stands out easily from the success story of this kind. It is certainly not a new story, in fact there is nothing new about the way it is told, and we've all seen it before, and indeed much more eloquent of Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. The only thing If you can really get out of this movie, it's a feel for how to work with these wonderful lenses and forest lighting. The rest is a waste of time.
