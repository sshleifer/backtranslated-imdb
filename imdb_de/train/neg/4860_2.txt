Terrible, terrible TV show! I do not care why Comedy Central decided to repeat old episodes of this program. It's really shit! Of course I'm talking about the seasons after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if I had talked exclusively about these seasons, this show would have gotten eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians who appeared after the first two seasons and were not part of the original cast are good. They were and are terrible. The comedy is not funny at all. EVER !!! <br /> <br /> The original cast was full of very talented comedians like Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr and Mary Schorr (or whatever their name is), who all should have had better deals after leaving MAD TV , This show is highly overrated and less worthy of your channel surfing time than Saturday Night Live, another horrible show. Get out on Saturday night and have fun, and let MAD TV be spoiled and die as it deserves.
