Oh man, this movie bites ever! If you've ever been scared to see a reiteration of the Slasher genre as cheap as possible and at the same time careful (PC-friendly, does not mean nudity, a classic element of Slasher films)? Each cliche is re-read without a trace of self-confidence and action. Oh, acting redefines the word horror. I should have known better, because the direct Dutch translation of the title would have dismissed me.
