What documentary about a musician does not contain a single track by the artist? Unlike "Ray" or countless other films about music artists, half of the fun in the theater (or on the couch) makes the great songs themselves. Here are all tracks cover versions of uninteresting characters, and these renderings can not capture the slow, jazzy style of Cohen. Often the covers are poorly sung versions of the people. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The interviews are as much or more with other musicians and characters than with Cohen himself. The film is rarely recited by Cohen as he reads his own work (never sings) - like letters, poetry etc. The film has not really covered much of the artist's life history or development over the years. A big disappointment for a big Cohen fan.
