Who wrote that? A guy named John Cohen. I think this was the first script he ever worked on. Someone should have told him to write dialogues that sound like someone actually said. <br /> <br /> And who guided this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My nut fell far from the tree. Someone might want to let him know that you can actually shoot a scene in a taxi in New York and that will look real and you do not have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Had to want to know that he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully he has learned this lesson now. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... of course she can not act. Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audrey Hepburn, and yet she plays the lead role in this movie. Oh wait, it was produced by her father. Okay, that's why she got the role. That's really the only reason I can think of. <br /> <br /> So should I be surprised that it is bad? Should I be surprised how bad it is? I think a lot of people would do it if they saw as much of it as me. I mean, you expect a movie with Jessica Simpson to be bad, but that ... it's not just bad, it's the complete opposite of a classic movie. Think of a great Woody Allen movie. This movie is as bad as this movie is good. It's the Anti-Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did not pay for it. I stopped watching for ten minutes because I could not go on. No doubt I would have left the theater earlier. In fact, I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and saw the whole thing. The film starts ridiculously bad and then goes so bad that it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, when the first act ends, you realize it's only getting worse, and then you either have to go or kill yourself. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie will be included in the category Since it is so bad, it should be used instead of water in Guantanamo Bay. Some prefer the water board.
