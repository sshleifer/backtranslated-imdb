For those looking for a sequel to the fine South African miniseries of the 1980s, it is not. It's not a historical drama either. It's more of a dull little fantasy that has nothing to do with the historical Shaka but merely uses its name to signal Sinclair's idiotic story of an African superhero that is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman, and Nelson Mandela to give. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some laughing moments when Shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks a serious slave owner. You know, as Jesus would have done if he had not been such a weakling. <br /> <br /> I only saw the 98-minute version, but I can not imagine that this crap is twice as much would have been better. <br /> <br /> And what name is mongoose ?!
