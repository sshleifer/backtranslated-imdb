By far the worst movie ever. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I've heard the movie was originally titled "The Treasure," but it was changed to "Sharks' Treasure" to take advantage of the excitement of "Jaws." I think sharks were in a scene in this movie; The fact that they happened to be included in this "thriller" should sell tickets. Did not always work Whenever something "good" happens in the film, the ship's crew comes up against a certain beer brand that was just introduced at the time of filming. Do you think beer could have been a sponsor? Could they have made it even more obvious? The only time someone should break the beer is when he gets through it. Reason enough to celebrate.
