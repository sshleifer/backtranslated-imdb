..IT IS THIS! Very cool premise, straight away. <br /> <br /> Has an excellent first scene, must give credit where credit is due. <br /> <br /> Has solid characters and a decent script for a ghost story, but here are the things that bothered me: Whenever the ghosts appeared, which I actually liked, by the way; how it was done, what it looked like ... the only thing was the relationship of the mind. Because of the way things went down in the first scene, you would think their dynamics would be different. <br /> <br /> In the middle in which I felt, things slowed down a bit and the crab / spider scene was just not that good. BUT then the end is actually very good! Sure, "The Grudge" basically told the same story with a polished lens, but without a samurai, and I enjoyed that movie comparatively well. <br /> <br /> Please, someone with a tempered style remake this movie. <Br /> <br /> Fans of 'Silent Rage' would absolutely love this movie.
