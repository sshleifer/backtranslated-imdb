A quick look back though ... <br /> <br /> Avoid under any circumstances a total waste of 90 minutes. At the end of the movie, I was not smarter about what actually happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3 minutes), Jack Dee (30 seconds), the "Philadelphia" girl) and some vaguely recognizable people, but it just does not make sense. I do not know if the story got lost on average right now, but jeeez ... <br /> <br /> Instead put on a DVD or go to bed and rest. > 2 out of 10 (for the cameos and a chase by Morris Minor) <br /> <br />
