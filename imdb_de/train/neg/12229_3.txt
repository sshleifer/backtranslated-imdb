This movie started well, I felt like watching an adult version of Seinfeld. Too fast, I began to question the situations and actions of the main characters and found no answers to why they did what they did. The acting was great, but only a few scenes had short moments when they were actually funny. Dan Cortese was amazing. I loved him in this role. His agent was supposed to show this movie casting agent. Look at the first scenes and find something better. Otherwise, you will be completely confused. I found this in a clipboard in a video library. It cost me two dollars and because of the rarity of this movie, I feel it was a good price.
