What a wasted cast. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most disappointing movies I have seen. <br /> <br /> Usually Roger Ebert does not let me down, but I feel betrayed after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thrill is Elizabeth Banks in her bra. That's a sad statement about this movie. It was so promising, but it was like shaking a transvestite dry. <br /> <br /> This is a selfish threesome. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough about my bitterness to have gone through this movie and I hope I can warn you of the same disappointment.
