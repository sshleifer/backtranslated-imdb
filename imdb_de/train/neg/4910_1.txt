The word "1st" in the title has a more threatening meaning for the viewers of this film than for the victims of his crimes. At least they do not have to stand around and watch this endless movie reach its own demise. <br /> <br /> 1. should refer to: 1. draft script; 1. takes used at every performance in the last movie; 1st cut in post production; etcetera, etcetera. <br /> <br /> The film is not too badly staffed, it's just that everything about this film is worse than the third prize, from the silly font to the wooden performances. And while you suffer through this messy movie, you want to be released from your misery at the 2-hour mark. With a duration of 160 minutes it is obvious that the processing should have been changed to less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Going into details about the paralyzed script and acting is for minor purposes only. Even in the equally terrible Lake Placid, at least the performances that Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda constructed from an extremely weak script were so nuanced that made the movie laugh. In 1st to Die You just have to mourn when you're waiting to see what happens after the opening scene of preparing for female starring suicide. One of the main characters I believe (never quite told) is a DA She just appears in a scene in the middle of a conversation. Obviously, the scene in which she is presented to the viewer, filed in the hall of the editor. And no one realized that a character appearing from nowhere was an unusual movie trick. <br /> <br /> In a word, do not waste your time with this. My wife and I wished we had not done so. But at least we've created our own distractions by commenting on various parts of the movie as if it were the Mystery Science Theater. "In Cleveland by now ..." !!!!
