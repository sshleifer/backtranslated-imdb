Bad actors, bad filming, choppy dialogues, flat characters, but on the other hand, it was a poor condition in the first place. Basically, an 11-year-old who is bullied for having very little money will receive a blank check from a moronic criminal. Of course, the 11-year-old has enough technology and intelligence to buy a house, pay a $ 1,000,000 check, and even thwart three rude idiots reminiscent of the three henchmen. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is an annoying, disgusting boy who decides that if he has written a blank check from a foreign stranger, he will make the best possible use of the situation. In other words, he walks into a bank, <br /> <br /> gives a cashier a check he makes in his printer and miraculously spends a million dollars in cash. Preston also seems to be able to reach incredible speeds on his bike because a man driving a Jaguar to Preston and its 10x speed could not catch him, even though Preston had jumped a bunch of cars. <br /> <br Of course there must be a hot heroine on every adventure adventure. In this case, our hot heroine is a kid abusing an FBI agent who dates the eleven-year Preston and promises another date when he turns 17. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst aspect of this film, however, was not his casting, nor his sloppy dialogue, "The only other way to skin a cat is to put a tube in my buttocks and then that To pick up the fur ". Rather, it was the entire fact that no one in the entire movie seemed to realize that the FBI was not afraid of random people. What I could not explain is that Preston uses the alias "Macintosh" to disguise himself as an entrepreneur. The FBI finds that fascinating, of course, and sends our young heroine to Preston, who first screams with his eleven-year-old joke when lobsters fall on his face, then spoils them with hamburgers, and with a ridiculous tumult through a cemented area, water jet comes out of the ground. Our heroine does not realize during all this adventure that the FBI-chased criminal slips back and forth behind the two and slips as they drive to Preston's sedan, complete with a one-dimensional driver who always offers a bargain third prize, that the whole family can suffocate. <br /> <br /> Overall: 1/10 is unbelievably gracious for this movie. I do not see how it only has 4.4 / 10.
