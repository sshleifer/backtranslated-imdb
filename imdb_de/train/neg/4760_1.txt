This reworking of Anthony Shafer's classic game did not last long in theaters. I have recently suffered from cable and I still congratulate myself on not wasting any money on a ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter and star / producer Jude Law have been wrong to believe that their sheer prestige alone will sustain this travesty through an endless 93 minutes without the fun or class of the longer original. Michael Caine improved his reputation as the second lead in the wonderful movie of 1972. Now he seems to destroy the intent by trying the lead that Laurence Olivier has played in this version. (Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscar, but lost in The Goddather vs. Marlon Brando.) Caine slides swollen and washed out and slides through the part with less depth than he shows as Batman's butler. In the gruesome remake of GET CARTER, he had already lowered himself to a guest appearance. What's next - ALFIE II or the son of the man who would be king? <br /> <br /> But nobody benefits from this inhuman adaptation of Pinter, who believes that frequent cursing and an additional sexual angle can compensate for the absence of Shafer's witty character change. Branagh's focus is on bluish lighting and a soulless set design that does not stand up in a second-rate nightclub. Neither the shadows nor the tight, exaggerated close-ups can help Law overcome his boring personality. The result is a failure both as a drama and as a detective thriller that almost makes you forget the purpose of the title. Fans of the original stage production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Caine Film would do well to regard this company as a bad dream. The late Mr. Shaffer, who wrote the 1972 script, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and several Agatha Christie adaptations, must turn in the grave and wish he could plan one or two real killers!
