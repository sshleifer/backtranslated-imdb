Somewhere on this site somebody wrote that you should just read them to get the best version of the works of Jane Austen. I agree with that. However, we love the adaptation of great literature, and the current strike by the authors reminds that actors without good authors find it difficult to bring their roles to life. The latest version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION shows us what happens if you do not have a good foundation in a well-written edit. This version is unlike the 1995 version of Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was well-handled and retained the essence of the era and the limitations on the characters (with the exception of the bizarre parade and kissing in the street scene in Bath). , The 2007 version features a two-pronged Anne, who seems to be anxious. The other characters were not very developed, which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with carefully selected subtitles. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel was completely bypassed, and Mrs. Smith, Anne's bedridden and impoverished schoolmate, walks around in Bath - chirping, as was the case with many characters. The character and intelligence of Captain Wentworth, whom Anne loved from the start, did not seem to be written down in Wentworth by Rupert Penry-Jones. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and could convey so much more at a glance than P-J could do with his poses. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel to a handcrafted, costumed melodrama of controversial value. If they wanted to incorporate our modern emotional extravaganza into Austen's work, they should have done what they do with Shakespeare adaptations: adapting them to the present. At least "Bride & Prejudice" was taken from the historical & local settings and was fun as well as "clueless". This was not a PERSUASION, but they did not know what else to call it.
