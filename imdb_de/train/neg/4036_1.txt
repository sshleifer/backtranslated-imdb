Almost from the beginning, this film is poor and lacks conviction, but on the other hand, most people would find it hard to show such an uninspirational screenplay. The dialogue really does not flow and sometimes as in this case is less (or should have been). This is also underpinned by odd scenes (such as the Cemetry Slow Motion) that you believe lead somewhere, but only seem to lose a few seconds of your life. <br /> <br /> The plot is a weird one Combination of gangster / sitcom that I'm sure convinced was a good idea at the time, but if there was ever a case for someone to be honest with the scriptwriter Should, then it was here. Martin Freeman is alright But then he seems to have a character that always plays. I wonder if he got a script or was just filmed and said how to react normally. Finally - humor. This reminds me of the "Python quote (I think) about Shakespere", his "comedies". If he thought it was humorous, he would have put a joke into it. Well, I have not seen one. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time - I did it because I watched it with a friend and hoped that it would get better. <br /> <br /> Did not do it
