This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever made. Worse, my old hero Dolph is in and he plays along. Jesus ... The story is actually pretty good, but the way it is performed even hurt my body. The battle scenes for beginners are about as choreographed as a fight between two drunks who throw them in the gutter. The actors, apart from Dolph, who's kinda shitty, are playing so badly you're wondering if they're all friends of the director, who by the way must have been the most absent, if not all the time. This is an unimaginable amount of 12 million euros, as the cost of looking at the effects and the scenery can not be more than a thousand over the value of 1000.
