***** THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE SPOILER - but this determination would be negligible in such a classic and well-known story. ***** <br /> <br /> The Cinderella story is one of my favorite fairy tales. The world will never have enough of this wonderful story. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the story. This may not work if the story deviates or is tempted to throw some interesting ideas along with magical photography and yummy-looking production designs with poor alignment and editing. <br /> <br /> This Cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling that never hatches, or rather, never turns into a swan. <br /> <br /> The whole production value the money can buy can not acquire good kinematic timing and dramatic development - or good acting. The entrance of Cinderella on the ball as made so bad, there was no drama of anticipation or excitement of discovery. <br /> <br /> The letter also made me very nervous. The Prince Charming was the unwanted memory. Why would a girl marry a boorish, selfish prince who did not like women? <br /> <br /> Turner's role in the Stepmother role was an embarrassing performance that showed Einliner more than acting nuances. <br /> <br /> Even the Cinderella part showed little interest or sympathy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps only one sentence describes this attempt: So cheap, '90s, <br /> <br /> What MUST be mentioned in shameless excess is the glorious photography, the dull work and the production design. It was a pleasure to explore the landscapes, scenery and attitudes as the story unfolded. <br /> <br /> For some Cinderella stories there are two jewels: <br /> <br /> 1) Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious, gradual TV - 60s look of the sets, this is the best version on celluloid bar. An all-star cast strives to provide supreme entertainment. Engaging, distracting and unforgettable writing and music. This is the classic. <br /> <br /> 2) Always after - this Drew Barrymore gemstone retains the historic perspective, alters the plot, but not enough to hinder the effective development of the salient points of this classic fairy tale. The characters of the principals and all supporting roles were cleverly written and well traded.
