First and foremost, I loved Henry Fool, who takes me to a very small pool of moviegoers. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this movie was a perfect travesty. Watching Hartley and the actors in the extras talk about the movie - so proud, and making meaningless analogies to Star Wars - was terrible. This hype was maximized by the producer part (HDNET). A true example of the Emperor and his new clothes. Mostly, I feel like Hal has ruined HENRY FOOL forever. I do not think I can ever see it again in pure, innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember Hal, you can FOOLEN some of the people temporarily ... etc. If only he would throw out pointless garbage today. Unfortunately, this is a pure example of the lesson taught in the film ADAPTATION. The story has to be exciting and active, or the cash hopes are indeed weak. No matter a decent story. For the actors, it was like trying to be in a straitjacket. <br /> <br /> The score, I think, is tasteless for Hartley's. With drumbeats in the whole dialogue. There was an Apple soundtrack loop that I recognized, and gave me a smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought, oh, they are just trying to reach a new audience. But it's really this ridiculous ride. I would like to spoil this movie for you, but it's done. It is lazy. The FOOL franchise is dead. Long live Henry Fool.
