Pet Sematary, although a beautiful horror movie from the 80s, with a nice director and atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian film ZEDER by Pupi Avati. It is clear that Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas of this director (the movie Cedar was made before King wrote the book). <br /> <br /> The cat, the floor, everything was copied, that's a case of plagiarism Since Stephen Child is a famous American writer, it's perfectly normal for him to get away with it. This is obviously due to the big difference between these Italian films without budget (and partly it is crap). ) but the original idea, I repeat, it's the Italian director Avati <br /> <br /> Let the world know
