I hated that crap, every Friday, as part of tgif, and it sucked stupidity every week. If you want to see something funny, look at "No on Would Tell". It's really funny with Candice Cameron and Fred Savage. It shows why nobody experiences a good movie career after a terrible TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate those kids and Bob Saget has to jump off a bridge to do this crape test. I've seen Funner stuff everywhere but here. I write 10 lines! Take a look at "Full House" to see what humanity has to offer in terms of arts and entertainment.
