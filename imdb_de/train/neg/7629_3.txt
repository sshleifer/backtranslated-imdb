I gave this movie a very good chance and it cheated on me. This is little more than a black-and-white excuse to drive the crowd out of hell, even though the egotist Bogdanavich (who does much better with TARGETS) gets "great performances" in his debuts from a ton of ham. Many adolescent sex clich√©s come from this film, such as Doing the Teacher's Wife, Impotence, Do29, The Ugly Prostitute (which is very impractical to shoot and things stopped, not that things really went anywhere). <br/> < br /> I suppose, this movie should be funny because of all the sex nonsense, for me it was just annoying. It was much more fun to clean my fingernails than watching this mess.
