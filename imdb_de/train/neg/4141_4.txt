Well, the movie was a funny clock. The main problem with this film is the fact that it violates everything that most vampire myths follow. Like vampires running in the sunlight. Of course, there are parts where you can just enjoy how society makes movies. A scene where a vampire is stabbed and shouts, "Oh that hurts ... It's really stuck." Then it seems like scenes may be missing, but you get used to it after a while. And there are random dream sequences that really do not help with the plot. Come on, to think about it did not really make sense, but I only have a few friends and have seen it twice to get the full effect. Considering that the fight scenes were horrible and the zombies were just having fun. As I slowly write more, I like this movie more. But all in all, you can not expect Schindler's cunning, but it's a funny clock.
