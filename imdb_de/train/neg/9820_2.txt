I am glad that some people liked it, but I hated this movie. It had a very good idea for a story, but that's where it ended. It was badly written, badly played and badly done. <br /> <br /> It had some interesting action points, but they were just skipped too fast. The authors had to realize what they should keep and expand. as if she had lied, why she was kidnapped, and scrape off the slags. Instead, it was "What's going on?", 5 seconds later, they tell you. <br /> <br /> This movie was tense and I was bored from start to finish. I just wanted it done. <br /> <br /> Go and lend misery or best plans, if you want tension or twists that will let you guess right up to the end.
