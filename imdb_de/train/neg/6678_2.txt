This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day classic Romance on the High Seas. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less the same, but it is contemporary. Govinda plays a shrewd guy who replaces the husband on the trip. While Rani plays the college friend of the woman who does the same favor to her. They are reportedly trying to catch each other while the husband and wife in Bombay try to trip each other. On the trip, Govinda confuses another girl for Sanjiv's wife and spies on her while falling in love with the gorgeous Rani. <br /> <br /> Lever plays a dual role as father and son, both lawyers specializing in divorce proceedings. They are hired against each other for the belligerent couple. <br /> <br /> It's a feeble attempt to copy the original classics, and the songs are pretty dreadful. The comedy is slap stick and will not make you laugh too much.
