I can see where the filmmakers went with it. But they never really reach their goal. It is meant to be a tribute to spaghetti westerns, albeit in a sort of mythical modern timeframe. It does not have the pithy realism for which spaghetti westerns are known, the characters are not mean and desperate enough like their Italian western counterparts, and if these two points are not met, they lack humor In fact, it looks as if they were going to make a serious movie, but after the completion, they missed the target. It's impossible to take seriously, unfortunately, they missed the humor brand by a mile.
