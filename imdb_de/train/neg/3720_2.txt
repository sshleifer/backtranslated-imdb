Is this movie a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely it is not a heavy thriller? There is no indication that there is any intended humor, but the bad drama, the bad direction and the appalling script left the audience laughing in the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist who has just shot to his peak by an assassin he mistakenly enters. The killer sees the portfolio of young artists he carries with him and decides to attend an exhibition of his work. In the exhibition, the assassin meets the dead artist sister and falls in love at the end. It's all very predictable stuff and in the end nobody will guess, because it's so poorly written. The film mainly takes place in and around Vienna and shows what a beautiful city it is. Do not waste your time with this movie unless you study how NOT to play, direct or write a movie!
