I just finished, can not say that I was impressed. <br /> <br /> It all starts quite well, the look and the atmosphere give it a scary feeling, as it should be this kind of movie. But everything ends when the first Lordi monster appears. You do not only recognize them from the band lordi, but they are seriously missed in the movie. Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are in their 80s. <br /> <br /> As for the storyline, she starts off with similar horror movies in which people are trapped in a hellhole. However, there is no clear story about why and what happens. The viewer is thrown a few lines for possible reasons, but the lines never meet and end with anything but a mess. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this film, with a fascinating start and some good effects. I thought someone had taken better care of the product. I wonder if Lordi just made this movie to prove that her show costumes could be scary (unless they are not). <br /> <br /> So the movie gets the graphics, and the money had to go somewhere. The rest, however, is an embarrassing attempt by a rock band to make their monster aliases on stage more frightening.
