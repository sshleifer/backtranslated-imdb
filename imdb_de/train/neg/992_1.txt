This movie was disgusting. It should be a warning that a sadistic malignant writer is trying to make a name for himself before being held hostage for an hour and a half and watching garbage. What is garbage? The misuse of human time, the misuse of energy and the waste of any kind of education system in which she has learned to read and write. Talia, you are a sick madman. Your psychiatrist must prescribe stronger medications for your problem. <br /> <br /> The acting and the plot gave me no choice but to move me through the trash. I ended up in a scene that did not give cause. If you want to learn how people shock you, watch a Larry Clark movie. I have lost all respect for the entire cast of this film "no more support from me". How could actors or actresses sit on a stage while such crude representations of human behavior manifest themselves from the mind of a psycho? I'm sorry for all the actors who participated in this scene. I think the devil now knows who the author of this movie is. Congratulations, you have gained his attention.
