This miniseries, also based on a book by Alex Haley, the "Queen", tried to use similar formulas, that is, to build a long history that followed the life of a family for many years. While in 'Queen' the result was masterful, there was no inspiration here at Mama Flora. At first perhaps in the book itself and certainly in this TV production. Too much haste is over-used over the years, so the evolving saga is flat, superficial and not nearly as authentic as 'Queen'. Full score for the scenery in the earlier parts of the film, which were prepared with great care. In the further course of the film, however, he seemed to degenerate in the last third of about three hours to a kind of Dalasian-forsythian, inedible mix. I had hoped for more; But obviously Haley was less inspired by this story than his almost biographical queen, and Peter Werner III is no match for John Erman. Only recommended for those who have an appetite for these long generations to grow up.
