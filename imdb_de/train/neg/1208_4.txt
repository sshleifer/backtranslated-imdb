OK, if you are a woman who has aggression problems, you might like this movie. Do you hate your partner? This movie is for you. It's a sack full of laughter for the boys. <br /> <br /> It's sad when former award-winning actresses have to do cut-cut movies. <br /> <br /> The only really good part is the last 10 seconds. That too was a lot of cheese. <br /> <br /> My wife is picking the worst movies lately. That's what you (me) get for having my wife choose movies based on reading reviews on movie rental sites.
