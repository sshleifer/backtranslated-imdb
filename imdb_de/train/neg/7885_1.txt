I believe in keeping religion away from the government and the movies. If I want a sermon, I go to church, but I do not want one from a movie. I have nothing against some supernatural themes (after all, religion is about as supernatural as possible!), But this movie had so much preaching that I was really annoyed. The landlady reminded me of witches that were seen in other films. The villain even looked like he had horns. <br /> <br /> And what a silly end: The hero went into the meeting and shouted at all these old men, and that broke the spell. If only life were so easy. I think if movies are so stupid, they should be distributed with a warning: DANGER! Preaching contains here!
