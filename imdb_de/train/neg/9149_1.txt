There is absolutely nothing in this film that shows even a tiny part of the talent. No one has ever tried to act, even the extras in the coffee shop look like they're stuck. Nothing looks tried. The film quality is terrible. Most of the action takes place in narrow corridors or dwellings, with the cameraman penned afterward, swinging a cheap camera between the "actors" as they present their lines. No tripod and no real microphone, the sound quality is terrible. Even "Manos" is better than this, at least they had the right equipment. What a plot is there is simply lost in production. <br /> <br /> Stick to the home videos, which are preferably made by a 5-year-old kid trying out the video feature on Daddy's new camera phone. You will have to search a long time to find a movie that is more inappropriate than this one.
