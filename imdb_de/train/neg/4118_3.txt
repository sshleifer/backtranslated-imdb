In channel surfing, we found this movie with its promising summary. We were dismayed by the flat-style and formulaic plot. We found the exploding car scenes amusing, incredible gunfights and sets that crashed with the weight of Tyro-Foam and cardboard. It was even funnier to see all the recycled scenes of "Dante's Peak," where the church front falls onto the school bus, the shop fronts break off the main road, the overpass collapses, and the red truck drives down the lane as the bricks fall on it. It was a good laugh, even though it was unintentional, and makes the viewer wonder if it was not originally intended as a parody with low budgets of disaster movies.
