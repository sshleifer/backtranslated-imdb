I suppose I've seen worse movies, but that may be because I'm so exhausted by the standard of these bad horror movies. The killer monster thing is really bad, basically it's a guy in a green suit. As far as movie B is concerned, there is much worse acting, but do not think that was anything out of the ordinary for a second. It actually had a conspiracy with substance, but it was still pretty stupid. Basically, it's just a bad horror movie on a low budget. But at least it's not as bad as Titanic, this movie sucks balls, this one just sucks. The blood looks really fake in this movie. This is a complaint I have about all the horror of the new millinium, inferior, looks stupid. A good, cruel death scene with really bad blood is so stupid. At least there was a nice shower scene
