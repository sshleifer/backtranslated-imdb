This movie is apparently a training exercise for the Coppola family. It does not seem to know if an "A" or a "B" should be Western. I mean, the hero's name is Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd has to turn in his grave. <br /> <br /> All western clichÃ©s "B" are here. The beaded two-gun hero in the white hat with the faithful steed ("C'mon Thunder"), the black full-bearded villain, the distressed heroine, the cattle breeder in trouble, the cowardly sheriff, the villains over the roof, and so on br /> <br /> Acting is, with a few exceptions, strictly from the Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (Who?) As Hero and Louis Schweibert (Who?) As a rogue, they look like they've been at home in a 1930s Poverty Row quickie. The addition of veterans Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins may help a little, but they do not have enough to do to save it. What was the point of the Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine framing sequences? Should we believe that the Sheen character was a ghost? What was the purpose of the black gloves? It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> As a great Western lover of all genres, I've been trying to find some redeeming qualities in this movie. The cinematography was pretty good and the settings looked very authentic. Apart from the hero and the main villain, the other characters looked authentic. <br /> <br /> If the producers were to revive the Hopalong Cassidy character, they might have considered portraying it the way it was originally written - a with a chip on the shoulder, Lee Marvin would have in that regard excelled. <br /> <br /> What else can I say ... on Thunder, on big guy.
