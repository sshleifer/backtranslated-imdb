I do not even want to call this thing a movie - it's a movie that should not have won prizes. The drama was as dreadful as the stupid scenarios. This is exactly the kind of movie that so many people think it addresses to an NRI audience, but detested abroad because of its awkwardness and overwhelming sense of "trying" throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I find it strange that so many actors who are familiar with the English language find it so hard to be so convincing in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all those symbolic English expressions that are thrown into a movie, in Hindi, and in regional cinema for cool points. There are few Indian films in which English seems completely authentic - being Cyrus was recently. Although not a great movie, it was a good movie and the language did not seem to be "laid out". <br /> <br /> I am ashamed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only partially consumable parts of this garbage were Konkana and a slightly catchy background note. Do not waste your time with this movie either.
