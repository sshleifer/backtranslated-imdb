I had to write a review of this movie after reading another comment that said that this is the best movie by Sidney Poitier. Poitier had just returned from an over ten year movie break, and he is clearly creaking here. 11 of his films are mentioned in Wikipedia and do not contain it. Five of his films are on the AFI list of the top 100 inspiring films, again without them. Berenger and Poitier, Rube, and City Slicker set out to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border into Canada. Some of the comedy attempts in this film clearly fail and Berengers and Poitiers bondage was uncomfortable and awkward (not helped by a completely bland script). Kirstie Alley (hostage) was not used and almost completely ignored when she was on the screen. Some attacks are made, for example, when you try to guess which of 5 men on a fishing trip is the killer (all are cast-type villains). I understand that this is the whole attraction for most fans. I guessed who it was and I did not really try. <br /> <br /> If you're a Berenger fan, check out the Sniper (1993), and you'll even see Billy Zane strutting his stuff. It's much better. All in all, I would give Shoot to Kill 3/10. It's not daring and just too easy for me.
