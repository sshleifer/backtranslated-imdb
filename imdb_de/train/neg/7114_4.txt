In terms of cinematography, this movie was pretty good for the mid-50s. There were a few times that the lighting was way too hot, but the footage was generally in frame and remained in focus. The drama was above average for a stinker on a low budget, but the direction was terrible. Several scenes were pulled out too far in an attempt of excitement, and the effects did not exist. The attack of the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the last cut, and any attempt to give life to the skull was evident with sticks and cords. I could not help but think that the budget did not allow them to set up the house, so they kept referring to the moving companies and that all the stored things should be coming soon. Honestly ... it would have been fun if it was a worse movie. It was not bad enough to be a "good-bad" movie, but not good enough to be "good." Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
