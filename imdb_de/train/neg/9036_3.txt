I can not believe I waste my time watching this garbage! I did it because Leonard Maltin rated it "AA", and for TV movies this is usually a reliable indicator of quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> The acting was fine, but anyone who wrote it should deny access to any communication medium forever. The conspiracy is ridiculous, the motives of the "bad guys" completely absent, and the various family interactions stupid and shallow. For example, Dad preaches that the violent response to aggression is BAD, but he turns out to be an "admirable" person, NOT because of his "Ignore Idiots" philosophy, but because he's pretty good with his fists ... < br /> <br /> The ONLY message I could read about this dad was that the nuclear family is good and alternative living arrangements are bad. Oh, and bad people happen to good people.
