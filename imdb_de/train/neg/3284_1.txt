Have I seen a worse movie? Maybe only "Manos: The Hands of Fate" dragged more than "Dukes". I had more fun rummaging through the huge potholes than the film has ever given me. Let's talk to a few ... <br /> <br /> When Sheev spoke to the Dukes, there was a remarkable script for death and rebirth, and they do not answer. He shrugs his shoulders and walks on, as neither Knoxville nor Scott knows what he's talking about (and we do not either). It was as if the engine was dying and being restarted. <br /> <br /> The few times General Lee blew up were not even so exciting. Nothing that I have not seen in the TV series yet. <br /> <br /> Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo was angry because he stole the girl he liked. The only reason this works is that the script actually (though roughly) forbade it. The rest of the time it seems distant and forced. <br /> <br /> Seann William Scott's awful, terrible accent (or lack of it). <br /> <br /> I hated Willie Nelson's performance. Wanted bad jokes to be adorable? I wanted him to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson shows off great on the big screen. She actually felt like one of the better actresses in the movie. That tells you how awful this movie is. She is a goddess. <br /> <br /> During the climax of the movie, I took care of boss hogg and the bad guys to clad all over Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices. An atomic bomb would have been enough. <br /> <br /> This is not intended as a coherent disassembly of the movie, but as a release of frustration over the abysmal writing and execution of a potentially heartwarming movie. <br /> If only we could clear and start all over again ...
