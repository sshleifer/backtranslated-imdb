That was not nice to look at. Frank puts all his dreams in the background and gets a normal (boring!) Job, just so his stepson can go to film school, but his stepson decides he'll instead make a humiliating documentary about the man. A documentary filmmaker should point at the camera and simply take pictures, not manipulate and comment with short subtitles. The bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather are obvious. And sad. The goal seems to be to make Frank seem stupid and pitiful, instead he appears as the most humane of the three persons imagined. That really aloof me for the filmmaker.
