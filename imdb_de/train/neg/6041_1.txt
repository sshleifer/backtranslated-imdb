This story about three women is a very sensitive study about: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde), the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans), who is about 37 years old, and Martha (Frieda Pittors), the eldest mother of Muriël. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. The vital Laura wants a child. Muriël comes from a village and wants to change her life in Brussels. Martha dreams of her youth when she was a young girl. In fact, nothing happens in this movie, so wait for something - such as an accident - that could make this story dramatic. Over time, it is discovered that director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing else. This film is disappointing because you assume that women learn from their experiences, which is not the case. Therefore, a feeling of emptiness remains.
