Tatie Danielle is a gruesome old witch who torments her loving and unsuspecting family out of sheer defiance. There is a bit of subtext that could refer to France's colonial past, but most of the time it's just Danielle doing the stuff (such as deliberately leaving a small child in a park), where a man soon comes along broken fingers would pick up the teeth. Unfortunately, this does not happen here. It looks good and the drama is good and there is nothing really wrong with the concept, but it's just SMUG. God, does this movie love itself? Too bad it's not nearly as smart or funny as it thinks. The only impetus on the show - sorry, film - comes from Danielle, who gets more and more angry, and the only surprise is when you see the increasingly unlikely ways she does it. That's right: just like in a sitcom, that's it, with the added bonus of megalomania and a 110-minute runtime.
