Director Jonathan Lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past, including "Greedy" and "Clue." This is not one of them. Rather like a 'Police Academy' movie as its inspiration, Steve Steve plays the lead role in the old role of Phil Silvers as the sergeant of the army, drawing eternal scams under his superiors. But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky as an old enemy visits the base, which is determined to catch Bilko. It really does not happen much. It's all pretty boring. That is not very funny. Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman express a few laughs out of sheer effort, but they are all better than this and it is quite painful working with such thin material.
