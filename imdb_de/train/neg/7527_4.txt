There are so many stupid moments in 'Tower of Death' / 'Game of Death 2' that you really wonder if it's a parody. Sometimes it felt like I saw a sequel to Kung Pow rather than a Bruce Lee movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie has something to do with 'Game of Death'. If anything, it's more like a sequel / remake of 'Enter the Dragon', which contains many elements of this movie - especially the actual material. Bruce Loe's character Billy Lo (apparently) examines his friend's sudden death and encounters a piece of film left to the man's daughter. If the body is stolen during the funeral (!), Billy is also killed and it is up to his wayward brother to avenge the death of both men. <br/> <br /> Tong Long plays as Brother Bobby Lo and does not really have the kind of charisma to wear the movie. His fighting skills are very good though. Apparently, Bruce Lee shows up with (no longer) deleted material to pay for the inheritance. If you say that the footage is much better edited than 'Game of Death', but it does not prevent the movie from being a mess. <br /> <br /> OK, so the fights are really entertaining (may I say stunning) and make the movie worth seeing. However, this movie contains so many stupid elements that it really puts your patience to the test. First of all, there is the alleged villain who lives in his palatial estate ... or is it the mental hospital? Seriously, the Negro eats raw venison, drinks deer blood, carries a monkey on his shoulder and has some peacocks and lions (?!). He's just sorry for trying to make him look tough and intelligent - you'd expect someone to take him back to his room. <br /> <br /> In fact, this midsection is horrible and when the scene involved a naked whore and a lion suit arrived, I turned it off. However, I finished the movie and was kind of glad I did that because the fight scene at the end (like "GOD") was the whole reason to watch. The story is embarrassing, but the action is very good and contains excellent choreographies. <br /> <br /> But even the final disappointed when the premise was something. We were told that the "Tower of Death" was a pagoda that was upside down and underground. That sounded great, like a twist of Bruce Lee's original idea with different fighting styles on each level. Could this be the originally planned "Game of Death"? No! The movie should have been called "Generator Room of Death" because that's how far the tower goes. Yes, there were actually one or two "different" styles ... there were foil-plastered grunts, leopard-skinned henchmen and stupid monks. It's as if Enter the Dragon had never been made, the plot being a bad imitation. <br /> <br /> It is worthwhile to look once for the fast-paced battle scenes, but sometimes so stupid that it hurts. If this was intended, then fine. Thumbs up to restore the scene from the 'Enter The Dragon' projector.
