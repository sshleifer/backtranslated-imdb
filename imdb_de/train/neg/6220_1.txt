This movie was a real disappointment to me. I've been a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I found out they were making a movie about him, I was very excited. I got the movie on VHS when it came out and got sick of what I saw. The movie was not about his life but about the consequences of his death. I thought it was a progeny film about Gram's life and music, but they had to make a film about his death. I'm fed up with hearing about his death in books and movies, I wanted a movie about his life, not his notorious death. I was very disappointed. I wish people would look at his life, more than his death. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack. This movie is a disappointment for any Gram Parsons fan.
