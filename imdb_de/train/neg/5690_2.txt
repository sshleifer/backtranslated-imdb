First of all ... I have never considered myself a Uwe Boll Hater since I think I've never seen one of his films, but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie called Seed (which is the name of the serial killer I'm about to join the hate club. This film makes absolutely no sense ... the plot is a joke and although Boll clearly tries to attract attention with shock, 90% of this movie is just boredom. You can summarize this movie as follows: <br /> <br /> 1. The hooded killer watches clips about animals being tortured on television. This is a real footage of fur farms and the movie starts with the ridiculous reason to "make a statement about humanity" and give a peta address. Since this movie contains no news at all and is the worst part of the exploitation of torture pornography, you already have a reason to hate the movie from the start. <br /> <br /> 2. Electrocute death with a pretense revealing what appears later in the movie on the screen so any delay gets it. <br /> <br /> 3. Policemen watch videos of animals, babies and women starving and devastated in the basement of Seeds, stupid nightmares and crying in their whiskey because Seed is such a wicked Mofo. Although acting is alright, the movie dives every time it tries to integrate any emotion. <br /> <br /> 4. The cops blow up seeds in his house, seem stupid and can be cut in the dark. This sequence is reminiscent of a video game, you hardly see anything except flashlights. Seed is a super-killer who's everywhere at once, and all the cops look stupid enough to get killed ... except for one who breaks him. <br /> <br /> 5. Seed gets the chair and we see his electrocution as tedious as anything else in this "movie" ... he will not die and we are reminded of the opening statement that he needs to be released if he survives 3 electrical shocks. Guess what ... they just bury him alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. Seed comes out of his grave, kills everyone in another part and then looks for the chief policeman to take revenge on him. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman lashes her head in an endless sequence from a point of view with a hammer, just to add fun and shock. <br /> <br /> 8. Seed captures the police family, lures him into his home and threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail gun, the policeman shoots himself in the head and thinks about what Seed wants (he finds it hard to get into the guys head because he does not just wear his mask in prison, but also does not say a word) has hardly any dialogue anyway, so you do not mind). <br /> <br /> 9th Boll goes to a nihilistic shocker ending, where Seed encloses the daughter with her dead father to rotting like the people we saw on Video 3 in Sequence 3. <br /> <br /> That's it ... no message, no conspiracy No reason, no face behind the mask, no background except a stupid story that Seed was burned as a child. <br /> <br /> This film depends only on a few key scenes and their shock value. I can hardly remember a movie that is so devoid of emotion, messages or entertainment. It's like watching August Underground ... that's good for me, some people will enjoy this mindless snuff. What is really hard to understand, however, is the pseudo-message at the beginning and the fact that the film, taking into account camerawork, effects and even acting, is too good for this waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> So how does Boll get paid to make such "movies" when thousands of talented directors work with little money? "Seed" is not just the essence of ridiculousness, but the living proof that the free market is flawed ... Lucky Uwe, that the German taxpayer pays much of this waste for their deductions.
