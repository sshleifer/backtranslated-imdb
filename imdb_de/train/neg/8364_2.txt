I can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this movie. "Well, now we see we spend 50% on Dirk Benidict because Battle Star Galactic and the A team were cool, we spend 40% on making a demon costume, and we spend the rest on the movie." was pretty bad and VERY clich√© ... Got a loved one watching it (or bring a good book)
