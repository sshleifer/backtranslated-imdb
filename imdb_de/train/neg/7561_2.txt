Those who do not know the original 1973 British Lion movie "The Wicker Man" would undoubtedly have left the cinema with the impression of "Poor" and "Peurile". <br /> <br /> As a follower of the original I left with the impression of Purely Poor. <br /> <br /> From the gruesome reality of the foolishly tamed breeders who transform law and order into a web of pagan barbaric rituals on a secluded Scottish island called Summerisle (the original) A colony near Amazon The Maine coastline called Summersisle barely hits the remake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a case that could be a classic remake of a classic manipulated to care for a simple-minded audience. NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen (or given the revised context of the film) Ladies involved ... Hang your head in disgrace.
