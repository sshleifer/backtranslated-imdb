I just saw the guinea pig - Devils experiment. I have to say that this movie, although it had very good FX, better than expected, was NOT a good movie. I honestly can not say that I liked this movie at all. Of course it's a shocking, realistic, twisted torture of 43 minutes in its own way, but I found it very boring (and not as bloody as I had hoped). And I also found that the torturers were very angry when they talked and tried to sound harsh all the time, which ruined everything (and I'm sure there are people out there who will agree with me). I have now seen guinea pigs 1,2,3,5, and the best in my opinion guinea pig is 2 - flowers of flesh and blood. I'm not going to say much more about the Devils experiment except for Great fx, Descent that works from the girl annoying terrible torturers, overall I give him 4 stars because of the FX because they are awesome.
