This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The plot and the message are terrible. There are too many mistakes in this film that can not compete. I do not even understand how this film can get a nomination, not to mention it. 2. Here is the reason: 1) Sam Lee portrays an angry / irrational detective caused by his father's disappointment. Pros: He's angry. Disadvantages: When it comes to the explanation scene, he can not convey the sadness / disappointment he has from his father. The crying scene was too fake and it looks like he literally squeezes tears out of the corner of his eye. <br /> <br /> 2) To associate the movie with the title, during the game, barking or eyelashes were battle scenes and rape scenes that are completely irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. I understand that it's supposed to be a metaphor or not ... but it's just so stupid! 3) WHY TAIL THE COPS DOES NOT QUICK THE KILLER? What the hell is going on with this movie. When the killer stabbed an officer, he nudged him. He is already dead! What the hell? There were many occasions when the killer could be killed, but I do not know why he was not! 4) During the scene in which the girl had hurt her foot. In the scene, it was very clear that the girls left foot was injured. How the hell in the next scene, that she loads her left foot weight? And this is the actress who was nominated for Best New Actress? WTF? 5) The sounds in the movie are out of sync. <br /> <br /> 6) I suspect that this film is trying to raise awareness of the brutality and violence of children in Southeast Asia, so why does the villain win and then was the policeman in the fight? 7) This film is too violent for no reason. Policemen beat CI to a pulp, and when they work together, they give them marijuana and coke? This is the worst movie overall. I really feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadistic and sick person. I've never seen a nastier movie in my life. The worst movie ever!
