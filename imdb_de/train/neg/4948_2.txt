I have always loved historical dramas, an art form that has distinguished the BBC in the past. This presentation of "Byron" was incredible. Unbelievably bad! The script was awesome, the acting uninspiring and all the characters wistful. Obviously Byron was "insanely bad and dangerous to know" and used the hearts of the ladies. Not in this production. Here he seemed like a sprightly, jumpy splash instead of a fiery woman hero and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron hobbled. This portrayal of the man was just tired. <br /> <br /> I've watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to come to life. No splinters, not even a shimmer. It was boring from time to time, if not boring, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Believing that no one will ever make the bard of Avon any better, I also believe that Byron's poems are over-worshiped. My mind should be pushed to the abyss, and that dramatization of his life should be the same Treatment. <br /> <br /> I think the BBC lost her nous with this one
