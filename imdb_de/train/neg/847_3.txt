The film is about two brothers who are supposed to be similar - but in no way expect to be smart - one is a surgeon and they can write a computer code. Geniuses, as they like to call themselves, which sounds very exaggerated when compared to personal characteristics, can be seen from the material of the title. <br /> <br /> I honestly did not like the style of the movie. I believe that the fear, confusion, and deep blues it brings have a purpose, but I do not understand why there is so much. The film is cheap in scenes and tells the story essentially without human aspect. It gives the comic similar experiences. The viewer, however, is visually stunned, somehow bringing him into the blues with short dialogues, monotonous scenes, dynamic editing, music and abrupt noises. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is very simple, most of it is going on. For a long time, I'm dramatically portrayed, mostly in confusing deliries that simulate the effects of drug use and dynamic cuts. <br /> <br /> I'll say frankly that this movie did not meet my expectations too much.
