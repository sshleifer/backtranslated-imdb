What a great actor in such a horrible story ... <br /> <br /> However, the film and its production are pretty good, even though they play in London, but with outdoor shots in Bristol. No matter ?? Do you see a cathedral, you've seen them all, somehow. <br /> <br /> The story, however ... is about a man who was born with the power to bring death and destruction to anyone and anything he should wish to do. With a passing reference to true lifelines of telekinesis, the narrative forms the image of a man who was abused as a boy, a teenager, and finally a man, misjudged. so much so that he literally enforces revenge at will. Over time, he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is going in the wrong direction and sets out to destroy the lot. Only when thinking! <br /> <br /> The problem of the narrative, however, is that it tries to mix real scientific data about strange mental powers and combine everything with a quasi-religious gossip into a hodge-podge theory about everything. Mixing up facts and fantasies in this way rarely works. and I'm afraid Richard Burton had to exaggerate terribly on some occasions if he wanted to sound convincing. His best scene, however, is when he verbally interspersed his wife and lover leaving his house: sharp, witty and deadly conversations that only Burton could offer. <br /> <br /> Having a good supporting role helps make things look and sound much better, starting with Lino Ventura, whom I last saw as Inspector Brunel in Guard A Vu (1981); Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner; the much underrated Lee Remick as Dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as publisher, Towney and a few other well-known character actors. <br /> <br /> I liked the depiction of the story, as a flashback in the flashback, to fill in the backstory and solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of Morlar (Richard Burton), the writer with the lethal injunction. By this time, it was a good visual detective work by Brunel and his English buddy. Nevertheless, it was very predictable, as I quickly became aware of the identity of the would-be murderer. <br /> <br /> Then they broke everything in the last 15 minutes. If you want to know what that is, think of Samson and Delilah (1949) of the famous Cecil B. de Mille and how Samson got the bad guys in the end. And the very last scene is just stupid. Why? Because there are at least a hundred ways that Morlar's Rampaging could be stopped, absolutely. <br /> <br /> Too bad, because it could have been a much better story and a better movie. I think Burton really needed the money. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Burton, spend the time to see the scene I mentioned above. Otherwise, do not bother.
