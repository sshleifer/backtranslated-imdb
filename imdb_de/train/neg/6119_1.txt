Muscular apes in the jungles of Africa are being chased by an opportunistic expedition team; The pretty daughter of the team leader finds him first. The promising version of Tarzan's story has an OK production, but is crippled by the single-worst-off direction of a movie I've ever seen. John Derek is the inspiration beyond cheesy slow motion action shots and peering at the undressed body of Ms. Bo Derek; He has about as much talent behind the camera as Ed Wood. The Dereks, who strive for sparkling sexuality, lack finesse, snappy timing and taste. They have a sense of self-parody and bravado abandonment (they throw caution to the wind), but after a promising opening, everything goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who may have had marbles all the time) has the title role, but plays the third part on John Derek's ego and Bo Derek's self-esteem. * from ****
