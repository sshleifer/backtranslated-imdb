The fact that this film made it to the rental in Norway is bizarre. This movie is just awful. This image quality is just a little bit better than a mobile phone and the plot is soooo bad. The main character is just annoying and the rest just sucks. Every person associated with this movie should be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this film made their name with it is extraordinary. And the distributors; did they even see it? This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. To label a comedy is an insult to humanity. I urge you not to support this film by buying or renting.
