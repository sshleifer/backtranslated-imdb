I signed up for IMDb to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just finished with this movie, and the only thing that impressed me was that I somehow had the willpower not to stop it. <br /> <br /> I've seen a pretty decent amount of action movies and what not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I've ever seen in a movie. In most sword fights, the swords are thoughtlessly swung backwards and forth, hoping the opponent will not do the same. I have seen many student films with better action and stronger actions. <br /> <br /> Now we have a "futuristic" action movie with bad action and practically no sign of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the film has no action and shows the evolving relationship with the princess and the farmboy / terrorist and his troubled sister. The film has several storylines, and none of them is really worth anything. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may have been that I saw the dub, which was pretty bad. The entire cast mumbled all the lines, making it difficult to track what was going on. But I had the general idea. (If I knew exactly what was said, I would not have saved the movie in my eyes.) <br /> <br /> If you've heard that this is a futuristic action / ninja strip, then you've heard it wrong , So I thought it was when I heard about it, and now I have lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let that happen to you. Avoid it well.
