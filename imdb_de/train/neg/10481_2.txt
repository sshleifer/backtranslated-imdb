The film is poorly populated, apart from well-known Hollywood names. Other appearances by unknown names (by H. Jennifer Gabrielle) are not inspiring. I have seen other films by this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst. Maybe this reflects the script? <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Kim Bassinger's and Pat Morita's performance has saved the movie from being forgotten. I enjoyed Pat in Karate Kid more. There are many good movies to see, and in short, this one is not one of them. Save your money and the celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
