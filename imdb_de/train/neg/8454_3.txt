This series has ups and downs, and the latter is the case here. There are a fair amount of splashes with an imaginative implementation of the Baby Cart's weapons, but the cut film is seriously disjointed, and the film itself is rougher than usual. Sometimes the action slows down to crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the "boy," who loses himself almost early. All in all, disappointment. <br /> <br /> That said, the music and action offer an Eastern spaghetti quality that can win the approval of viewers. This installment spends much of its time following the little mischief of the little boy who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him.
