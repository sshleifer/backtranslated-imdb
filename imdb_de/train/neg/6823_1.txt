I should have trusted my instincts better: no expectations - no disappointments. Instead, I expected a similar masterpiece as Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing more than a cheap attempt to exploit the iconic success of his predecessor, and it fails - artistically - miserable. It seems as if a producer has collected leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi, hastily thrown it together, filmed everything in slow motion and, under the pseudonym Philip Glass, got pop entertainers to throw together haphazard banal background music that keeps repeating itself. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with skilful fast and slow movements, Powaqqatsi is a long sequence of secular images in slow motion (if you show them in quick view mode on your VCR, you'll see what I mean). But what disappointed me most was Philip Glass soundtrack. I still could not and do not believe that these commercial-sounding New Age-type drones, which a 14-year-old could easily have composed on a Casio calculator in one afternoon, came from the same composer who did so brilliantly emotional and perfectly synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all a big waste of time! My advice: forget about commerce! Instead, look again at Koyaanisqatsi!
