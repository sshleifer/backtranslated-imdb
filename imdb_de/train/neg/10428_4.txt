Has anyone else felt as cheated as me? The first hour was pretty solid, but the last one. Oh dear God. It seemed like it was predictable and cheesy. Not as grandiose and epic as the show's entire run. Most reviews have lit up, but I really can not understand why. I seriously had predicted this general end WAY, but then withdrawn because I thought, "No, that would never do, which is to paralyze far." I can hardly stand it. I feel so dissatisfied. I think I'm just going through the door to sell my season. Someone please. Change my opinion. I want to love that. So bad. Someone tells me why I'm wrong. Great show. Terrible end.
