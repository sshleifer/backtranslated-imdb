The cast includes some of New Zealand's better actors, many of whom I've seen in fabulous roles. However, this movie makes me deeply ashamed to just be from the same country as you. The fake American accents are the first clue that things are going awry in a spectacular way. As noted in another report, the luxury cruise ship is actually an old car ferry adorned with some of the multicolor flags stolen from a used car lot. Most of the cast seems to come from the (great) long-running New Zealand Shortland Street. It's as if this movie was made at a Christmas party on Shortland Street, the result of too many gins and possibly some salmonella. Imagine, "Under Siege" meets "The Love Boat", staged by your local elementary school and run by an autistic person, and you have the idea. <br /> <br /> If you're an actor, I suggest you watch this movie. as a study on how you can destroy your caregiver.
