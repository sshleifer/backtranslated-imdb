Forgive me for the obvious, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. Of course, there are extremes within these two broad categories. Movies like The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars can easily be classified in the good category. At the other end of the spectrum, there are films that do not deserve to be mentioned by name. Occasionally someone produces a really sad movie. A film that should be highlighted as a demonstration of how awful a movie can be. A movie that is more than bad. One such movie is Maiden Voyage. In short, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship being abducted by a band of vicious criminals who demand ransom from an equally evil, scheming shipowner. Of course, on board is an invariably American hero, complete with chiselled jaw and sculpted chest that will save the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that explores new depths. Everything about it is bad. The acting, the directing and the so-called action are breathtakingly bad. In short, it's an insult to the intelligence of an unfortunate onlooker. Even an American viewer would be angry about his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's so bad. <br /> <br /> I'll resist the temptation to make a list of things that annoyed me about this movie. His stupidly stupid conclusion, however, should be a fitting example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine being a bad hijacker and standing in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. You are accompanied by the hero holding a ticking bomb. The hero throws the bomb at you and dives overboard. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I would throw the bomb into the sea as much as possible. Not this guy. He watches our hero swim away and then tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate results (for him). Enough said. Such a downfall would deserve a mention on the Darwin Awards website and could also be an appropriate end to the life of the production team.
