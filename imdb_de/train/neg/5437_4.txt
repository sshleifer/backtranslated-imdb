The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is based on the novel by Michael Chabon and is about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer with two friends. The year is 1983, and young Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Art contradicts his father's lifestyle and plans to become a stockbroker. The visual film, with painful attempts to create beautiful, hip indie films, feels like the director - whose previous effort Dodgeball was hilarious when it comes to advertising - desperately seeks indie credibility by creating aspects other indie films, but with stars like Mena sprayed Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like so many of the star-studded premieres at Sundance this year, it felt like a studio-sponsored vanity project that would help the director collect some indie credibility - and that failed in that regard as an independent film.
