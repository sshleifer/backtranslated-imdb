Surprisingly, the film has something redeeming when it approaches its end. For the other part, this movie is really bad and lame, with a small budget, insultingly bad script and all that goes with it. <br /> <br /> It's stupid that all the money runs around the city. Christian circles with whom they never seem to have enough money for a decent movie. I'm not a religious one, so I do not care about that, but filming is a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and to make people more interested and curious about, for example, reading the Bible. In this regard, these films always seem to be a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> The low budget really hurts the movie and brings it down. It makes the movie ridiculous with its effects and gives the entire movie just a camping B-movie feel. <br /> <br /> But what hurts the movie more is writing. What's happening in this movie just insults the intelligence, and then I do not complain or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The course of the movie is so unlikely and the people in this movie are doing so unlikely things that they offend the viewers. <br /> <br /> I also hated that the movie was sometimes like a soap opera. It seemed to me that they found it hard to make this film a feature film, and they added some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up. At times I just could not care less. <br /> <br /> Even so, it has to be said that the movie gets more stable and stable toward the end as its story focuses on the basics. Still, it remains predictable, but it could not be prevented that this movie is a wreck, and when it comes to these kinds of movies, there are far worse movies, though I do not think this movie will convince them new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10
