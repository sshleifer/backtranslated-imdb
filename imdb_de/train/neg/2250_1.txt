Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into an overnight star. The Star of Esther rises as John gets downed with drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John does the self-destructive 160-MPH Crackup on a Desert Highway. The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can not take her seriously as an aspiring star if she * already * is a star. The first time she sings in a back alley, she looks like an established vocalist slumbering for the night, not an unknown effort trying to start her singing career. She is too safe, too professional. Her apartment looks like a page from Apartment Living, not like a hole in the wall where a real singer lives. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson cares about the selfish -control rockstar role like ... well, like a singer who's trying to be an actor but does not have much acting talent. The direction is lukewarm, the story is slow and boring. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is not the acting or the lame direction or the slow story. It's the hair! After staring at Kristofferson and Streisand's terrible 70s hairstyles for more than two hours, your eyes hurt.
