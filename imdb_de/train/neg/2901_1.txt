The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life about the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket employees are working hard and trying to get people to watch this extremely gruesome movie. I have no words, no idea where to start to describe the really horrible movie I sat in last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films made me believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialogue, but like other posters, I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about the cast. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was designed, the family was this cookie cutter Waltons family and the movie was so often before me that I'm shocked that someone thought it was an original idea I do not believe everything, what you read on the IMDb, as the first comments were clearly written by people who sat in another theater and saw a good movie.
