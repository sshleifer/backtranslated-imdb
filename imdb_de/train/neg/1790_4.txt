This was at first a "sweet" movie, then it became too juicy and presented mediocre songs at best. <br /> <br /> There is too much talk with King James speaking English is easy to interpret Can you imagine today's young people trying to listen to this movie? Forget it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good lines here and is personable as "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") contributed in addition to her good looks and her beautiful long red hair too. <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie with a good ending, and I can not knock that. Maybe this is worth a rental, for historical reasons or if you're a big Crosby fan, but overall it's not that much.
