During a sleepless night, I went through the channels and found the embarrassment of a movie. What did you think? <br /> <br /> If this is the life of "Remote Control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, it's no wonder she has not gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> And why did David Keith take this? Role? It is pathetic! Anyway, I filmed the movie in the end, so I did not get much of the story. But that must have been the best. This nerdy college kid brings this domina-ish girl home ... this scene is straight out of the comic books - or the cheap porn movies. She calls the mother anal hitchhikers and kisses the father "Oh, I did not expect tongue!" Great lines! <br /> <br /> Then I had to see how it ended. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, this hell hell has a damn past behind it, so the SWAT team is up. And yes ... they surround you! And YES YES! The boy is blowing out her brain !!!! AHAHHAHAHA !! <br /> <br /> This is a TV that you must have seen. <br /> <br />
