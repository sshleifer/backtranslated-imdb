I could call a lot of funny movies. There are comedies that are supposed to be and are funny. Some films, such as a Gymkata, try to be serious, but in the end they are fun. The Ladies Man is a movie that desperately tries to be funny, but could not be any less funny when it comes to a man who got a lot of chicks amidst the rubble of an atomic holocaust. It is anti-funny. <br /> <br /> I do not think I laughed more than a giggle about anything in this movie. It's just not funny. It's boring, stupid, crazy, annoying, insanely bad, but not funny. I'm not particularly interested in Tim Meadows or this SNL character, but I expected something better than that. <br /> <br /> The film lacks logic or common sense. It's as if the scriptwriter had a bag over his head while writing, and he could not see which buttons he was banging. They tell the "origin" of the Ladies Man, but do not contain any motivation for his bizarre fascination, as if they were still the seventies. The film tries to bring humor out of a man who seems to enjoy pornography shortly after he tries to hang himself. This is comedy? I like to think of myself as very ingenious about humor (spending a lot of time writing comedy), but maybe I'm just not smart enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, as funny as Tucker in "Mad about Mary," is outrageously bad here. I asked him in my head to shut up. <br /> <br /> In the end I knocked on my chair, mumbled under my breath and if the movie had been running longer, I would probably have attempted suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie I've ever come closer to. <br /> <br />
