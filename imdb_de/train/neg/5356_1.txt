I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. It reminds me of a C-grade porn movie with a big difference: no porn. <br /> <br /> The story and the dialogue have to be completely reworked. Maybe the bad drama would not have noticed that way. At least the tempo should have been raised. <br /> <br /> Although I accept that this has a low budget and the director has done visually good work when he has few resources, he should have spent more time for the story or better, bring it someone to write it. Many of the action scenes were simply pointless. <br /> <br /> It was a complete waste of time.
