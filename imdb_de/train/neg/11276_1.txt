I'm not going to waste my time writing a little bit about every aspect of this movie being indescribably bad. This has been done very often in detail. The "conspiracy" began as a boring cockney gangster with long gangrupts and quickly became a complete mess. Anyone who pretends to be able to see a hidden masterpiece in this terrible mess is joking. It's been 7 or 8 years since I saw him in the cinema during his one-week run before he was drafted. Still, he remains aware that he is by far the most terrifying film I've ever seen. I'm just making those comments, and the only reason I've seen the movie is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie is in there the second "heavy" appeared in the pub scene. It was his hands pointing a Zippo lighter on Rhys Ifan's face in the bar in 'Russia' (it was actually shot in the former Butlins vacation camp on Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience - he recently worked for an extras agency and this was his first part. After watching the movie, it seemed like nobody needed actor experience in it. <br /> <br /> I remember that there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was only a few days after the release. I've never heard of another movie that was so unpopular and vanished so quickly - and rightfully so. If you plan to rent this movie on DVD, I would advise you to put your two pound coins in a fire instead, until they are burning hot, and then put them in your eye sockets. This will probably be less painful than watching the movie.
