As we all know, Hollywood loves to change historical events for our enjoyment, and 44 minutes is one of those Hollywood movies. For example, the bank robbers never went to the bank when they started shooting at the LAPD, but in the movie we see they go to the bank twice! Another example is the number of LAPD officers shot dead at the end of the movie. This is far from the truth! But, of course, Hollywood must have a goddamn end to add more blood and courage. Some events have been combined and many of the leading actors have played different characters, but Hollywood has always done that, so why complain? I think the only sad part is that for a few hours I saw documentaries about shooting North Hollywood on TLC, which were far better than this!
