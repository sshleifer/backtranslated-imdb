"It had to be you" is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas. This picture is about Charlie Hudson, a former police officer who became an author. When Charlie's fiance leaves the city, he stays with the entire wedding planning. He spends a week in a chic hotel and meets Anna Penn, a teacher who also happens to get married. The two quickly become friends and set about planning their own weddings together. Then the plot gets boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie breaks off any romantic comedy ever made, and just lets you wait for the movie to finish, so you can do something different. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give really mediocre performances, which makes this movie even more exhausting.
