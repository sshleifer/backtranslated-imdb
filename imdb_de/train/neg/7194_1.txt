In line with Disney's well-known practice of theft .. I mean .. to buy out and bastard familiar features, this live-action version of the venerable cartoon classic has become one of the worst revivals in a bad year. I grew up with the original cartoon. Every episode of the original animated series will make you laugh more than the entire movie. Not present is Penny's cool computer book. Also not present is the gag with the self-destructive commands that are always detonating for the boss. New are an easy-to-understand gadget cabriolet (the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car) and an element of a typical, unrealistic Hollywood romance. Do not fill the coffers to pay for Disney managers and even their _ex_executives - do not see this movie. <br /> <br />
