Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and damn big thumbs) who tramples across the country and finally finds her real place among a group of peyote-enlightened cowgirls on a ranch interested in preserving the Whooping crane. Rain (bow) Phoenix is ​​her lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, thumbs or not. Gus Van Sant has directed and adapted the book by Tom Robbins, but his satire has no primary goal and simply runs across the map, like Sissy (maybe that was his goal, but for an audience that's not necessary). The notorious Kassenflop was not as much obscured as it was ignored, and one can understand the reason for it: it's a series of sketches in search of an action, and the performances, the direction and the cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a sting who poses next to the highway and tries to get a ride. Writer Buck Henry (who did not write that, but perhaps should have) does the safest job of the doctor working on one of those thumbs. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
