I would give it 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot was poorly developed, for example, the incidents were too short and too short. therefore, the moral was not clearly worked out. I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have a hard time dealing with his role. I could see the need to include Western elements in the show, but there are certain parts that also need Chinese elements! The villain, for example. His physical appearance was like a robot, not something outside Chinese culture. The last and the worst mistakes were the wrong and distorted facts that were placed on the show. Others point out that this is a "children's show" and there is no need for such high standards. However, there are other Disney shows like Mu Lan that were much better in terms of developing and presenting the story. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think Disney movies should be better researched and better planned. A good show is not enough, just with a series of martial arts moves.
