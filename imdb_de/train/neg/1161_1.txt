As a member of the cast, I was a member of the band at all basketball games. I want to let the world know after we got into the movie that we have not been allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. This was because the producers and the director broke the contract with the University of Oregon, where he was shot. Seems that the sign U of O was shown. During the shooting we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff. Mr. Nicholson was quite memorable because he was one of the worst men I've ever met. A time for a young 20-year-old. Certainly not what life on campus really looked like in the late '60s and early' 70s, though Hollywood may think so. Trombonist from Oregon
