My girlfriend chose this one; As a South African born and raised African American, I found the plot and premise of this movie completely untrustworthy. Believing that class and racial bias could be so easily and conveniently suspended would come only from someone unfamiliar with Ante Bellum South. Totally absurd !!! I wonder how she gets a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell (who's better from the South) to participate in this crap
