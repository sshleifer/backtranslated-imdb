With all the excessive force in this movie, it could have been NC-17. But the spasm could have been pg-13, and there were a lot of bad words when the mother had the unfriendly boyfriend. There was a lot of character development that allowed the movie to be viewed better. After the boy was revived as a scarecrow, there was one mindless hour and ten minutes of killing people. The violence was overly exaggerated, and I think the body count was over twelve, which is a big number for movies like this one. Almost every character in the movie is stabbed or gets chopped off, but the teacher who called him "White Trash" and "Hoodlum" (though the character is anything but a Hoodlum, not even close by, I know hoods and I'm in the classroom, they're sitting there throwing things at the teacher, the teacher deserves a crueler death than any of the other characters, but only stabbed in the back, there were two exciting scenes in the movie, but they did not Long enough to be scary, as I said, the killings were excessive, and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the storyline get chopped off, and if the Gore was fun, it would have been nc-17 Two children describe a corpse they find in the corn fields, they describe it as more restless than it actually was, and they told the policeman that maggots were crawling around in the boys' intestines Not even been cut open, so there were no maggots in his stomach, although I would have liked to see that. The drama was pathetic, characters were losers and the scarecrow could do many gymnastics stunts. I suggest renting this movie for the Death Scenes, I will not see him again soon, but I enjoyed the excessive violence. Also, do not worry about the sequel, I've been watching for five minutes and was bored to death, that sounds good, but it's not. The original scarecrow actually interested me.
