It is very unfortunate when a movie like this is shot. Much work and money has been invested in a movie that is amateur at best. <br /> <br /> Editing goes away, there are obvious mistakes that could easily be corrected in a second shot, and the soundtrack is uninspired. With this video, so much more could have been done. I think that time or videotape came to an end. <br /> <br /> Hand pictures have a pronounced lay feeling.
