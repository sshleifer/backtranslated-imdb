That was a horrible movie. Basically, Jane March was a half-Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something terrible to American forces in South Korea. She becomes a maid for an American military family. They all regard her as a Korean, though she looks whiter (I think the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asian, not at all Korean) and the teenage girl's household starts to hate her and sleeps with her. The portrayal of Korea and the US military in Korea is completely crazy. Of course, the scriptwriter and the director were obviously white men who had never spent a day in Korea before this film and had no intention of giving any real insight into Korean life for Korean or American GIs, and instead just trying to fulfill it Their pathetic Asiaphile fantasies, regardless of how unbelievable they made the film. Anyone who has ever been to Korea knows that it is rubbish. In the end, the North Korean Honhyol spy girl is killed in an obvious way "paid for her sins". Very bad movie with TV feeling.
