Although this movie was supposed to be a joke for critics, it's still a terrible movie. If you get involved in such a thing, you make it at least a good joke ..... First of all, Jeroen Krabbé is the Gerard Depardieu of the poor man. Of course I hate Gerard Depardieu, although he was very funny in the "Iron Mask" three musketeers one. Otherwise, he is poison at the box office and Jeroen Krabbé is worse than that. The cash poison of the poor man ... that's actually not fair for the economically disenfranchised. If the fourth man is to be a kind of criticism of the bourgeoisie ... what can I say? it's not Let's just hypothetically say: If it was to be, it was not sharp enough. Satire is a tricky thing ... if it's not sharp enough, the viewer is joking about the joke ... I think that's what happened. The story just ends up as a bunch of nasty disgusting characters that do nothing that someone would care about, and not in an interesting satire style. <br /> <br /> [Possible Spoiler Warning] <br /> <br /> Really, the cemetery blow that Jeroen Krabbé's character is so hard to reach .... are you even interested in that? is that funny? Since Mr. Voerhoven is supposed to be a good filmmaker, I will give him the doubt from the perspective and assume that it was a misanthropic joke that went out of control ... Because he is the worst actor and every character he played is a more presumptuous one bourgeois donkey was ... except that he is incompetent with it. It will be like a funny cartoon. Do you think Mr Voerhoven did it on purpose? and Jeroen Krabbé is also the joke? I just do not see it ... So you understand the dilemma I'm facing here, right? It's the worst movie ever, because he's supposed to be a good director. So there is a kind of Dupery. I knew 'Patch Adams' was terrible without seeing it. Do not be fooled by the deceptively seductive packaging of "The 4th Man" or the reputation of Mr. Voerhoven as a good director, and so on.
