I think that my favorite part of this film, which illustrates the sheer futility, stupidity and bafflement of the process, is the climax of the film. DOCTOR TED NELSON and his unmarried friend, the sheriff, finally stopped the Melting Man on a staircase in an electricity plant on a staircase. Keep in mind that Nelson almost searched for the MM for the entire movie and that at that point the MM had killed and eaten several people (including his boss), and Nelson is well aware that MM is violent and crazy about humans Flesh and blood. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff turned his gun on MM, which is that, and I give the movie and Rick Baker props the most disgusting and scary object in human form we've ever seen. And he calls DOCTOR TED NELSON a very important question: "WHAT WE DO NOW?!?!?" <br /> <br /> The camera switches to DOCTOR TED NELSON, and it's obvious that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently, Ted was so interested in the problem of finding the Melting Man, he never thought to take any restraints, a lasso, a straitjacket or a net or a reassurance arrow or a New Age band from Vangelis to soothe the savage beast , <br /> <br /> So the sheriff panics and shoots, the Melting Man goes insane, and it's fun. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this explains why NASA has been fooling around with the Space Shuttle program in sub-lunar space over the last 30 years, and does not return to the Moon or Mars, as everyone knows he does wanted to do. I do not know. Anyway, that's kind of lousy, lazy writing and a direction that undermines every aspect of this movie. It's hard to say how good the actors actually are, because the film is a complete contempt for their characters. <br /> <br /> Two more incredibly painful sequences are bringing the stupidity of the process up: There's one scene that's the lumpiest one around, an old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove to be torn apart by the melting man. This scene is a nadir in the cinema of the 70s. I can guarantee that you have never seen a more senseless and irritating setup with odd-looking people throughout your life. And the melting man 's attack on the lady who lives in the house where she keeps a horse peeing on the walls resists any attempt to process it (BTW, I think the famous film director Jonathon Demme has in this scene takes a walk redneck husband first entering the house and never comes out again) The only thing that keeps the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that, as I said, her horse obviously pees on it. And we're forced to watch their hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any SANE movie director would hold. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning should beat the shit of IMM's director and photographer. I remember him from an old Columbo episode where he looked MUCH better than here - no idea of ​​a leading man, but solid and unobtrusive. But no one could be as unappetizing in real life as his director makes him look here. <br /> <br /> Everyone else is a little better than the old couple (and shut up, I know they were laughing, but I'm not laughing!), but not much. <br /> <br /> This definitely falls into the category "So bad that you can not look away" from cinema disasters. Still, I'd take another look at it before I look at many other abortions of the 70s and 80s ("Track of The Moonbeast" and "It Lives By Night"), and MST's account of it is so much fun when you get a chance have a look at the MST version.
