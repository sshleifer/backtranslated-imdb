There are many good things about the new BSG: There are, for example, the multiple Cylon roles for Model 8 and 6, which the two actresses played brilliantly. On board the Galactica there is the old feeling of industrial design ("My ship is not networked, over my corpse!"). Even all space battles, the special effects (even if the experienced science fiction observer recognizes the cartoony nature of all this) The darkness of the characters, their essentially flawed nature. <br /> <br /> This makes it all the more bitter that the end was so childish. <br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, the scenes in space, the Cylon attack and everything that was very good. But the mushy end? I always watch movies and shows with hidden timers today, so I never know how much time is left until the end. For me it was a special kind of torture to experience the end again and again. Every time I thought, oh, that's the last scene, the last shot, I got another one. Every crazy character has its complete end! That was not really necessary. <br /> <br /> What really highlighted the student's amateurism: the young Roslin scenes. Why is it important for us to know that she has lost her sisters and her father in a terrible accident and has a one-night stand with a former student / student? What's in the story? Where was the connection? Well, I'm all for a more European style approach and random acts in movies and shows, and all that, but that was just ridiculous. This did not bring anything meaningful into the story. <br /> <br /> Also, I saw the "Last Frakkin special", in which Ron revealed his own ignorance of the plot: he could not come to a good end for the story, so ... he just did not do it ! It's never about the characters like they did the last episode. The whole idea of ​​"this was thousands of years ago," the matter of mitochondrial Eve, was also used in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and believe me, there are many BSG observers who know this particular H2G2 story. Speaking of Hera, now there is a story that did NOT work well. Instead, we get Roslin from her former student, who is 20 years younger. Do not get me wrong, I'm all for older women with younger men. The more power for her. But that ... just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> All in all, writing this series is as flawed as their characters would have intended. That's even true of the last episode. I hope that Lost and 24 will do better with their finals in the series.
