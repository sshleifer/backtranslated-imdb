Let's see, here are the "highlights" of The Brain Machine: 15 shots of a pool and a house; 15 shots of a nondescript office building; 5 countdowns by a threadbare technician; 7 close-ups of a threatening guard; and a plethora of technical questions that show us that this is a high-tech experiment. Several posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the publication date stated on the DVD box of 1977. That's easy to explain. This dog simply sat on the shelf for five years unpublished until somebody dusted it off, thinking it was a perfect match for the Watergate mistrust of the government. When I saw The Brain Machine now, my only wonder is that it was even released!
