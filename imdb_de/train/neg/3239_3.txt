Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... To be honest, I've been disappointed with this whole series altogether ("He never dies," "Mermaid in a manhole" and "flower of the flesh") Blood " are the exceptions ... and even those are by no means great ...), but "Devil's Experiment" is just a blow, there's nothing realistic here except the climate-conscious (or depending on how you look at it) eyeball piercing The victim does not seem to really care about what's going on, and it hardly moans or whimpers while being exposed to "hideous" (often sometimes "weird") tortures. "Flower of Flesh and Blood" is one more violent and bloodier portrayal of fake "snuff" material, but this film also falls off on the level of realism, I greet the Japanese for having crossed the line, and they have come a long way in the last two decades to wear the crown in "extreme" filmmaking, but "Devil's Experiment" does not last. It's worth taking a look if you're a tough guy, if for no other reason, to see what the hustle and bustle is all about, but I can only give this movie a most generous 3/10, and that is just for the eye through the eye scene ...
