Power Rangers, the terrible children's show from the 1990s, still bothers young kids with their complete cheesiness and terrible attitudes. <br /> <br /> This show was not entertainment children how to fight to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> The toys were another demonstration of how to promote a violent television program and such. <br /> <br /> I've never been able to figure out what the purpose of this totally ridiculous show was. <br /> <br /> As such, it remains one of the worst kids shows ever.
