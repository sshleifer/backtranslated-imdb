It's really as bad as a movie. My buddy rented it because he's an idiot. But I also have to be an idiot because I've watched the whole damned thing! The actors were akin to high school drama freaks who believe there are places to participate. The only place they'll go is back to the waiting tables at Luby's. All I could think about when I saw this "jewel" was how it was actually done. I mean, some "scriptwriters" actually thought that this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. Then a jerk with money believed so much in the script that he decided, with the naive error, that he would expect to make some money. Performers were cast, film locations explored, make-up artists hired, computer animators brought from the Al Collins Graphic Design School, and this bastard took shape. There was obviously a ton of things I hated about this move, but the only thing that made me crazy was the overuse of music. Every single minute of this strip was scored. There was not a single break in the music. And sometimes it was higher mixed than the dialogue, not that you missed an important plot point or something. <br /> <br /> After it was over, we decided to look at Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980s VW diesel rabbit and then changing to a BMW 740il. They could not get two other opposing films in terms of quality.
