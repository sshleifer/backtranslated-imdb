For the most part, real-world effects are not possible in the real world, but in the world of Hollywood remakes, this is not only possible, but also necessary. The Haunting received the computer treatment from a top-notch cinematographer-Turner director who had once made a promise (Jan de Bont-Speed), but has since produced a number of large household garbage (Twister, Speed ​​2). > <br /> actors are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it. Liam Neeson and Cathrine Zeta-Jones pretend that they are somewhere else than in this movie. Lili Taylor tries to add something to the process, but whatever that may be, is unknown because the script feels like half of it is missing. Events just happen, good and bad spirits appear without rhyme or reason and then the story ends with a very unsatisfactory non-event ending the last 90 minutes of insanity. <br /> <br /> There is really no reason not even to see this impact because we all know that now everything can be brought to the screen. Why not just see effects in the service of a good story, rather than just for its own sake?
