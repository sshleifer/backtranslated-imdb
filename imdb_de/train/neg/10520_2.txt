Angels, who have become a bit icky, have been banished from Heaven and now live in a British forest, seducing and hacking teens. Talk about high concept. On the positive side, this little mom gives us Tom Savini, but with his playing time limited to two minutes, his five-minute presence seems a bit long. The angels run through the forest naked for the most part of the movie, but although they could have the body of an angel, their faces look like Joan Rivers on a bad day. Mediocre drama and amateur gore effects do not help, and the night scenes are a fatal reminder of Paris Hilton's most famous movie. So bad that it is really bad.
