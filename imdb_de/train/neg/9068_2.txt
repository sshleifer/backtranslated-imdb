Nominated for the Oscar "the worst script of all time" in my opinion. There is no decent story, reliable acting, very bad humor. By all means, if you have little self esteem, please do not waste your time watching this movie. Although you can see that the actors can act, it gets dull after watching. Precious Braincells are killed while you look at this crap ... <br /> <br /> I warned you: <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THE FILM
