This is one of the worst written movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new - but it's a cartoon, so who cares if it's cute and funny? <br /> <br /> I'm not as deep as the characterizations, or I'm here all day (except to say there are none, the characters change their personality whenever appropriate for the plot) but whoever wrote the script and visual orientation should deny access to paper and pencil. Thumbs down? I agree to keep my fingers crossed. <br /> <br /> "Narrowing down an object / prop The close-ups of the characters are brief The character gives a knowing look that the audience can not even understand remotely Repeat this several times with different objects / props. "<br /> <br />" Let the characters attract attention as the huge boulders float around, bumping into each other and usually bumping into destruction anywhere that could kill them any moment - but they must stop and go Fear for breath when they see a harmless-looking, almost pastoral green rock in the distance. "<br /> <br /> The whole is a long series of events, actions, and behaviors that serve only the convenience of the writer not to make him think or even try to write the story properly. <br /> <br /> This is Plan 9 of CG Cartoons, except that it does not have an Ed Wood peg to make it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: spend your cartoon budget on Pixar movies.
