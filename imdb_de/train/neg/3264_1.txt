This crazy, homophobic thing was dated in 1976. It seems particularly mean now, full of gay stereotypes and characters more laughable than with. Redd Foxx is setting his standard, Michael Warren at least trying to bring mankind to a one - dimensional figure, and Pearl - Pearl, what did you think -? Pearl Bailey deserves a lot better.
