I'm a big fan of the comic series, but this movie fell far short of my expectations. I expected a Heavy Metal 2000 to feel somehow ... slow movements, bad dialogues, lots of blood ... but that was worse than anything I could imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there. The characters do not have the energy or the spirit that caught my attention in the comic series. The movie covers only a small part of the comic, and the part used is slower and more boring than later parts. The focus of the film is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall presentation of the comic book. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, it could be amazing. Unfortunately, it was not so, so there is another horrible movie that few will see and love even less. My copy will surely gather dust for years until I finally throw it away.
