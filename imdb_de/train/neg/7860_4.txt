Martin Weisz, the director of the solid "Rohtenburg", will take the heat off Wes Craven for another shabby "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The reminder of the legendary original, which had an incredible plot and a dog with flashback, is erased forever by this technically more sophisticated remake (in the name only). A group of National Guards (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants. Gradually, the soldiers are picked up on the weekend. That's it. There's hardcore violence and a pretty brutal rape scene, but there's nothing else to get worked up about. The "heroes" of the film are the usual clich√©s and mutants, far from Craven's original "family". They are mostly similar to Brian Thompson of "Cobra", paired with some creatures that Stan Winston had left from the "Wrong Turn" shoot. Much of the action takes place in caves, including The Descent, and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. A ridiculous aspect is that Wes and Jonathan Craven have added a sympathetic mutant who, like Leatherface in Hooper's original "chainsaw", buzzes around his cave. Weisz is blamed for this boring debacle, but he's not really to blame because he's doing his best to keep up the tension and bring some freshness out of the invented situations. Unfortunately not a fan.
