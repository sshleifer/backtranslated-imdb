The only thing that did not make this movie a complete disaster was some interesting, stylish accents. <br /> <br /> (Moderate Spoiler Alert) The Death of Comic is a slightly derived scene from a scene in Twilight Zone: The Movie that delivers death by cartoon. Nevertheless, this was handled very nicely, especially when the ink bleed and the ink was sucked out. In addition, there is another good scene with a demon motorcycle. <br /> <br /> I was glad that I had bought the DVD cheaply in a shop that came out of the sale because it was pretty awful. I bought "Soul Survivors" at the same time and both films were similarly annoying with the constant realization that you saw a dream. However, if "Soul Survivors" has nothing to do or makes sense, it has at least a few stylish notes referred to above. Interestingly, with the DVD you can go there the 8 'nightmares' where something really happens, and this is the only way to watch it. The scripting between the creative Gore moments is rather unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points.
