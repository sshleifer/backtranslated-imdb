This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I hired it as a joke, expecting to get a giggle from the first scenes, and let me just say that I've never laughed so much in my life. The first scene where ninjas happen to jump out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the hilarious silly action film moments of my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but rather a movie that is fun (and actually means nothing) of the action genre. I did not see the first two, but given the complexity of the plot, I do not think I missed too much. If you want to watch a movie that works well with a six-pack or other herbal remedy, I insist that you borrow this movie and sit back and watch a 100-year rise in the cinema thrown in the trash and crapped by Carnosours becomes
