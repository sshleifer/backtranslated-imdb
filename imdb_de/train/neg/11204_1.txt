:: POTENTIAL SPOILERS :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie was awful. A Catholic / superstitious / suspense thriller is already doing well from earlier films. <br /> <br /> The dubious priest. Sex and the priesthood. Politics and religion. Church hypocrisy conspiracy involving the Church. The beginning of a new evil age. All kinds of dark magical voodoo battles between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Pretty stupid and lame with a feeble action that is sufficient. The story revolves around two concepts: absolution, better known as the Sacrament of Anointing the Sick - the last rights a person can claim to cleanse their sins while on the verge of death; And excommunication, the act of keeping a person away from the church. Basically, an excommunicated person can not receive absolution. So comes the Sin Eater, and I leave it at that. Throw all the dopy things I've already listed, and you have "The Order." <br /> <br /> I found the sex scene where the priest was entangled with pictures of a picture of the Virgin Mary that was rather offensive to Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger (I paraphrase): "I am the Redeemer and sinner of sins, I live on without loving, blah blah blah". > <br /> I gave this movie a 1 because it's not only crappy and unoriginal, but also because it managed to hurt a whole belief in the process. If you want to see something better, I recommend "The Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
