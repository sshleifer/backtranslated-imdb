The Broadway musical "A Chorus Line" is probably the best musical in the theater. It is about the experiences of people who live for the dance; the joys they experience and the sacrifices they bring. Each dancer advocates part of the Broadway chorus, but what comes out is stories of how their lives have led them to find dance as relaxation. <br /> <br /> However, the movie version does not capture the passion or beauty of the stage show and is arguably the worst filming of a Broadway musical, as it is lifeless and has no desire to dance. What ever. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was made when Sir Richard Attenborough got the job of the director whose direction was just the right touch and speed for "Gandhi". Why would someone in the right mind ask an epic director to conduct a musical in a fairly tight location? <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the next problem. "A Chorus Line" takes place on stage in a theater, with no real sets and limited costume changes. It's the least noticeable Broadway musical, and its simplicity was its fame. However, that does not translate well to the film, and nobody really thought it would be that way. For this reason, the film should have taken us into the lives of these dancers and should have left the theater and hearing process. The singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even offered flashbacks for their first ballet, jazz or tap class. Heck, they could have danced down Broadway in their vivid imagination. However, not a single piece of imagination was involved in the making of this film, as Attenborough's utter indifference to the dance and show itself in its lackadaisical direction is evident. Many scenes are downright awkward, as the dancers tell them story to the director (Michael Douglas), whether he wants to hear them or not. Douglas' character is moody when he chooses who he has a sympathetic ear and whom he has no patience. <br /> <br /> While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play, some heretical changes were made. The beautiful "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love" - ​​a breathtaking level number that brought the dancers back to their youth - has been removed and replaced with the terrible "surprise", a bad song for which it was nominated Adding Oscar insult to injury, "Surprise" simply tells the same story as "Hello, love", but without the joke or the pathos. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie unless you want to do a lesson in what NOT to do when broadcasting a Broadway show in the movie. If you want to watch a movie version of this show, the closest is "All That Jazz" by Bob Fosse. While Fosses daughter plays in "A Chorus Line", he is the Fosse, who should have been included as a director. He would have known what he should do with this material, which deserves far more respect than this sad effort.
