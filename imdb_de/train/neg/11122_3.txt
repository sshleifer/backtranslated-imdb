I say so much - This director is all about RAW images ... things that most of us are not ready to face. Images of sex, suicide, murder, and people who "relieve themselves" constantly bombard the viewer, so I wonder if the director was trying to convey the concept of relief or liberation. Although I do not think I could ever see this movie again, I will say that the director has a good eye. There were some really nice shots and "visual moments" in the movie (the fans, the wire fish in the hair), but the story made me need more (strictly at the moment we wondered what the hell we did Just see? "). <br /> <br /> Note: If you have a tendency to choke or easily vomit, you will not see this movie.
