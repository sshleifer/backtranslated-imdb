Admirable funny, if mean, comedy drama about a strange young man hoping to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. Robert Altman's quasi-comedy with eccentric characters is so full of crazies that it loses weight early on. Some of the cinematographs are impressive, Shelley Duvall is an absolute sting on her debut as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman sees every inch of glamor puss as Bud Cort's vision of a "mother bird" (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining that role )!). At the top is Bud Cort - once again after "Harold & Maude" - a true original; Not as daunting as, say, Michael J. Pollard, manages to be Cort, geeky, crazy and unobtrusive, a hard act that can prevail. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's dropouts. He can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else, but make him flare with some misguided inspiration, and he goes downstairs. ** from ****
