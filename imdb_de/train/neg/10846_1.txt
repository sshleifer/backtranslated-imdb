Not since Caligula did I consider switching off the movie halfway ... but then I was only 15 minutes into this movie when I thought about it. Unfortunately, I did it all the way. Make sure you do not. <br /> <br /> It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or bloody or scary or scary or sexual. It's like that's not one of those things, but it wants to be all so desperate. Instead, it's boring, banal, ordinary, predictable, and invariably poorly performed (recorded on video, special effects for high school, no sense of basic visual storytelling, barely audible dialogue ... but not that it's worth listening to) /> <br /> This film is a testament to the argument that even direct sellers need to cut a line somewhere in the sand.
