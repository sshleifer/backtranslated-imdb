Holy Cow, what a piece of this movie. I could not say how these filmmakers made a 250-word book into a movie. I think they did not know either! I can not remember farting or belching in the book, right? <br /> <br /> They took this classic classic, adding fart, belching and sexual inuindo and prostituting it to a KAKA joke. This should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood producers think. I have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by the toilet humor (if you even think that's funny), I do NOT want the kids that I know they think it is. <Br /> <br /> Do not bring your kids, do not rent the DVD. I hope the ghost comes from Doctor Suess Ghost and follows the people who made this movie.
