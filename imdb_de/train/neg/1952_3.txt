Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the first, most important, and most disturbing thing in this attempt to rethink Scooby-Doo and society. Shaggy's voice is squeaky and does not sound the way he's ever been. The previous incarnations of the Scooby show. They have also changed the outfit and the classic way of walking compared to the original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the bad guy is about, but it certainly does not follow the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. I like it, but it's not a real Scooby Doo-type animation. But the strange animation that was used for other WB shows grew with me; This could also be the case. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy voice. The right is enough to really enjoy the show. Besides, I do not try to be an inflexible, fussy fan. Develop or die, as the saying goes. We'll see what happens after two more episodes - until then I've formed a much firmer view.
