I saw this rolled up vignette pile tonight at a preview show, and I was immediately overwhelmed at how bad it was. <br /> <br /> At first the movie showed its gaping blind spots. There are no black or gay New Yorkers in love? Or who knows the falling in love white people? I know that it's not the love crash of anvil-tastic inclusiveness, but you can not pretend that you have a New York cinema without those fairly common members of society. Besides, you know that the people who produced this ish thought Crash deserved this Oscars, so where are all? <br /> <br /> Possibly worse than the bizarre and idiosyncratic socio-economic ignorance were the offensive offensive chapters. This movie was about the most different ways to be the worst. Bad drama, bad writing, bad governance - all encompass all sorts of genres that affect rich white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants. <br /> <br /> But thank God they finally brought together the powerhouses Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson for this jumper reunion. And, by the way, Uma avoided a bullet; Ethan Hawke looks devastated. This, of course, is a matter of appearance, adding an incredibly scary atmosphere to his fearsome scene over the poor, loveable Maggie Q. The least popular scene for the end of the film questionnaire, but it must be the Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby play because the taste just is not right, which makes me sad because I really like these two actors. I do not consider myself slightly insulted, but all I could do was puke like a 50-year-old aunt and look around with disgust. <br /> <br /> A close second place in this incredibly close contest of terrible things is Shia LaBeouf's numb depiction of what it means for a former Disney Channel star to take action against Julie Christie. I do not mean the opposite, I mean against it. Against is the only explanation. I now realize that the early sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight. TO MARK. Please remember, when your brain goes through the ear shortly after the opening points, which is an allusion to the first New York Real World. This film is embarrassing, strangely old-fashioned, inarticulate, ineffective, overbearing, and ultimately completely disconnected from any real idea of ​​New York. <br /> <br /> (The additional star is for the Cloris Leachman / Eli Wallach sequence, as it's actually pretty cute, but it's just a bright spot in hours that feels like hours of pointless, masturbatory torment.)
