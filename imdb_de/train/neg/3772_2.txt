I just saw Dick Tracy and thought it was awful. The pictures in the background of the cities looked terrible. The mob characters looked too funny. Warren Beatty did not do a terrible job as Dick Tracy, but it was definitely not one of his better performances. Madonna should just stay singing. Glenne Headly did a good job in this movie. I gave this movie a 2/10, just because of the incredible acting of Al Pacino. It was not a high mark in his career, but he still did a good job.
