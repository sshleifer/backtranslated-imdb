Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who has great potential under the guidance of a reputable agent. Obviously, the person who has led her into this travesty is not a person who cares about her career. I sat in the theater, surrounded by teenagers who had gone off in droves to find another movie that I wondered who thought this movie would appeal to anyone. It was badly written, the casting director could only spend a minute or two of effort on the characters and the director obviously did not care.
