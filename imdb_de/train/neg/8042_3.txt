The secret is ... this movie is blowing. Sorry, but it's just like that. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad reef I KNOW WHAT YOU WANTED THE LAST SUMMER and SCREAM, Beth joins Dorie Barton is admirably played, several to friends on a spring break journey. The group rents a fancy house and tries to spend a nice holiday. Then the deaths begin. First one and then another of the friends are murdered, leading to a sad and banal climax with predictable results. <br /> <br /> One note, Dorie Barton is the poor man's Reese Witherspoon? She looks like Reese, behaves like Reese and could fit in a police roster for Reese. Maybe they occupied her that way? Still, decent cinematography and fair play could not quite make up for bad dialogue and terrible writing.
