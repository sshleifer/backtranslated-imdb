This is the first non-zombie subgenre review for which the movie was made. Dinocroc is generally a good movie, but unfortunately still an obvious B-movie. The dinocroc itself looked great, but I thought the movie itself would have needed a bit more weight than action and violence, because when crocodiles are shown or in combat, there is not much going on unless crocodile is shown and The crocodile kills or runs off in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot, which is a plus, and the acting was above average and the most amazing thing was that the crocodile looked fleshy and not like a comic cough * Curse of the comodo cough. I enjoyed this movie enough to be happy that there will be a sequel that is more than what I can say about some films in general. A total of 3/6 stars and a watch worth.
