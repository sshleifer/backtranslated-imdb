Yeah, in this movie I feel like a horror when I realized that I paid for it and spent more than an hour of my life looking at it. The bald guy just gives me the impression of being a psycho-junkie actor, and the girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me, if you appreciate how much time you have to avoid this movie. I understand that money has to be made for a film and some films do not have the money. I always support independent films if this deserves support, but movies like these are a bad name for this type of movie. I am still traumatized. I will not trust a beautiful cover anymore.
