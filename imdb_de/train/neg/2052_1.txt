This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great movie. Nothing new or original is added, except Perry's setbacks, which are of marginal interest. It lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. Also painfully missing is the sharp Quincy Jones soundtrack, which has much added to the original film. I can not understand high ratings at all. It is pretty bad. Why is someone wasting time or money trying to crap, and why did I waste time looking at him?
