... and by no means as pure, logical and understandable as in this wretched sum of tired Hollywood clichés. <br /> <br /> I am 27 years old and spend 16 years living with my life struggling with delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. For logical reasons, like the main character in the film, I was successful because I kept thinking about it in order to keep the deception from reality and to know what was really going on and what was not. By the way, in the end, I was really successful with drugs, but I certainly missed the madness because, before taking medications, I knew the difference between what was real and what was not. <br /> <br /> Well, I feel justified in telling you that this movie is total cheating. Not only does it cheat on the story of the main character (who was bisexual to his wife - which is really important here) - but mostly shows a calming, tamed view of schizophrenia - which totally misses the point. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a mental structure, not a disease. A schizophrenist is not a "normal man with a disease," but someone who sees and feels things differently than most people from the start: for him, things like time, space, and people's personality are not fixed things. He feels that he can be bent, that he can change, mutate and maybe even disappear. To deal with this, a schizophrenist has a rich, very resourceful inner world that "normal" people do not expect - but he is trapped in it because he has no relationship with most people, and his world is getting poorer and poorer until he finishes is in an empty, deceptive dead end. <br /> <br /> This is very different from what is shown in this ridiculous "healing", ripping film. It should be terribly scary. Other people than the main character should seem strange, funny and absurd, as in Lynch's "Eraserhead". There should be * really * impressive, funny, gross hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is all about. It's not about * details *. <br /> <br /> I mean, look at "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", read P.K. Dick's "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik", check out "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City" or play "American McGee's Alice" on the PC, and you might have a vague idea of ​​how it is . Do not look at the "feel-good movie" of the month, with banal situations, cleared-up characters and visuals and stupid tricks. "The Cell" is the most accurate film about the mind of a schizophrenic, his visions and his inner consistency - it's violent, weird, confusing and very, very scary. Once again, schizophrenia is not about details, it's not a decent, tame trick you've played. It jumps in your face and does not let you go: walls are falling apart, people are turning into strange, hostile creatures, you feel like you're going back in time, you're not sure if you're who you are, everything feels. .. strange, unnatural. Believe me, that is much more than what is portrayed in this soap-like melodrama
