I visited one of my relatives some time ago, and we passed a theater, so we thought we would go to the movie. What a mistake! This movie is terrible in every department. I had never heard of the movie before, and literally not everyone. No wonder, that's as high as it gets. It's a comedy, it is said. Well, the only thing that's funny is the director's ability to make such a movie. If you get so close to Christmas, you should say how to cook a turkey in almost one and a half hours - or how long it was when I went out. At the end of the movie, you'll feel like you've been poisoned with food on a sick turkey, and you're regretting wasting your time with such a dribble. Who knows why such things are done. Some people went out of the theater before the movie was over, and I blame myself for not leaving much earlier. It really annoys me that you pay good money to see something decent, and all you see is a bad television movie that should be shown at 2am. In fact, it's so bad, daytime TV should not show it. What else can you say? Probably not enough bad words could do him justice.
