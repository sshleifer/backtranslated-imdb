Here are a few comments that speak about the plethora of clich√©s in this film - and I agree, both in terms of characters and dialogue. <br /> <br /> I had read about Elizabeth Berkly's terrible story about performance in the equally horrible "showgirls" I've never seen before - and her performance here, though not terrible, hardly meets the standards of Lifetime. There was no trace of depth in her character, but then it probably should not have been. In this case, the movie would be completely out of whack, as none of the characters, performers or performers had a hint of depth or charisma - no trace. <br /> <br /> The treatment of Liz's first complaint by the Headmaster after her Tutee had kissed her in the hall was ridiculous. Her husband's first reaction and advice was also (Forrest Gump, who had attacked Jenny's friend in his car, offered a more realistic, smarter action and, hell, he was mentally challenged). <br /> <br /> The grubby, unsightly lawyer (Apology for the dismissal) The father of the lying student actually did something worthy of praise: it was both ridiculous and utterly annoying, not an easy task. Her lawyer was more of an insensitive nerd who was not unknown in the job. <br /> <br /> Finally (and frankly, I enjoyed this part very much), the police were such a collection of insensitive fools that they would rather rely on Barney Fife without Andy to prosecute all and all To investigate in your community. I know that most real cops fall a little short of the sharpness, intelligence, and empathy of most of the characters in the Law and Order series and the like - but this level seems to be a staple on "lifetime." <br /> <br /> Finally I found a kind of "story in a story" that fascinates on Josch's use because he is the "victim" of his teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than its overall performance in the main story. This was an achievement, for example from "F" to "F-minus". <br /> <br /> This lame situation would have to be solved - in real life - in about 15 minutes after a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities, with husband. But then the invented drama would not have been possible and would have left an empty film in the camera. <br /> <br /> But the writers here who have proved their end could make things worse. When the situation was finally "resolved" and "corrected", it was done in about 45 seconds, without realizing what actions could be taken in any "real world" for the offender and his parents, or if they were. Maybe you would to find a way to salvation. <br /> <br /> This is a 2 * presentation; the second "*" because it has a mild "fascination".
