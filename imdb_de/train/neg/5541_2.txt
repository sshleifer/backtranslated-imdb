Since the acquaintance of the cinema-loving universe with a guy named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" has been automatically linked to blood-soaked horror images and non-stop game sequences. It is safe to say that his "Night of the Living Dead" shaped the zombie movie as we know it now. In the early years of cinema, however, the premise of revived corpses was only used in slow, almost actionless psychological thrillers. Jacques Tourneurs "I've gone with a zombie" is a perfect example and "White Zombie" with Bela Lugosi. This "rebellion of the zombies" could have been another example, but unfortunately it's a failure across the board and easily one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Terrible spectacle, a very poorly written script and a complete lack of atmosphere and excitement! The movie lasts only 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is completely wasteful for stupid love story intrigues and not exciting monologues. The backdrop in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor could have certainly led to a more convincing story, but all we ever see are interior shots. The lead actress (Dorothy Stone, textbook blond with curly hair and ugly nose) irritated me enormously and I always hoped that an enthusiastic undead would suddenly emerge from nowhere to devour her. Bad luck again? If you manage to fight through 60 sleepless minutes, you will be rewarded with a pretty decent final. However, this is still far too little to rate this film positively, let alone a recommendation. Avoid! You should only see this type of movie if you have already seen everything else.
