I love the episode where Jim becomes a Greenman. It is great! When Jim throws that little man through the window, his expression is priceless. Then, when he starts addressing the priest on behalf of his wife, only to find out she has become the Pee-Woman? Great writing and great casting together with great acting make this a must. I'm trying to find a specific photo from this episode. I would like to use it as my avatar in a message board because I think the Greenman is weird. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as Greenman? Can someone point me in the right direction to find such a photo?
