Best of the Best 4 is better than 3, but just barely. Basically, I say that because Part 4 does not contradict Part 1/2 (as it does) (ie, it's not an indication that Tommy Lee has siblings) plot of the story, and especially Sven Ole-Thorsen's role as Boris. Apart from that and a few fight scenes, the movie is nothing special. The limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the plane inflating scene). Part 4 also does not really have a moral or says something like Part 3, there are a few more well-known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in Part 4, but unfortunately nothing like the beginning of the series (and even those characters have very small roles). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Best of the Best seems to be the best of Rhee Show, and to be honest, he can not wear a movie. <br /> <br /> saw on tape, rating: 4
