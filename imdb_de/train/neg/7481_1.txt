Someone should tell Goldie Hawn that her career as a teenage Gamin ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies released in years, a definite disaster in which the two protagonists indulge in a frenetic display of their trademark tics to make up for a bad script and a bad score to lead. This thing should have been smothered at birth. <br /> <br /> I hope John Cleese has paid a lot for his name being linked to this catastrophe. He is the only performer who came more or less unharmed by this stinking mess. His only mistake was the failure to recognize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture.
