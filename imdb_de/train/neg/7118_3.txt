I could not say if "The Screaming Skull" was trying to be a Hitchcock rip-off or a modernized Edgar Allen Poe tribute. Nowadays, someone would have cut it a bit and presented it as one of those TV anthology episodes from the old "Tales From The Dark Side" ... but only after a major overhaul. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is, there seems to be a nice, nasty little story trying to get out of the rubble of this movie, and the actors are apparently doing the best they can, both with their talents also with the material they have to work with. But the director did not know how to stage a dramatic scene. the special effects just did not work; the script telegraphed his worn plot points so clearly that a shell could have seen them coming; and the soundtrack continued to play German "Oompah Band" music if it wanted to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> You tried. They really tried very hard. However, this is only as a historical piece of interest. I suppose a very young person who has not yet seen much tension or horror could get a load of "The Screaming Skull", but someone who is young would probably not get most of it subtext or motivation to act. ("Mummy, why is this nice man trying to scare the twisted stranger cat lady?")
