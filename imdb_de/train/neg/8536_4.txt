This is a typical Steele-Roman production in which two people who have undergone a tragedy come together in spite of adversity. I would not call that a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how to end ALL. If you do not want to know much about the plot, read on. Gilbert's character Ophelia is a woman from France who lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert has to stop making films where she has to have an accent, because she, otherwise a good actress, can not make an accent realistic. Brad Johnson, another great actor, is Matt recovering from a rather unpleasant divorce. He is gentle, persuasive and captivating in this role. <br /> <br /> The two meet at the beach through their daughter Pip. Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked to the child about art. Everyone becomes friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two main roles is not great, even though the talent of these two people does not matter in my opinion question. They did the best they could with a predictable storyline and a script that borders on stereotypes. Two people meet, tragedy, greater tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they come together. I wish there was more than that, but there it is in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> I wanted rash entertainment, and I heard it. In terms of the genre of romantic films, this film is unthinkable. "A secret affair" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book), as are some of Steele's earlier books that have been turned into a movie.
