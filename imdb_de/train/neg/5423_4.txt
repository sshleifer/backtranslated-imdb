I have been using IMDb for a few years, but have never written reviews. However, this film has so disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I could not stay silent any longer. <br /> <br /> Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins) so disturbed by the noise nuisance that as Vigilante's "The Rectifier" he takes on a different ego and all the cars he finds with a car alarm destroyed. <br /> <br /> Name of the movie to be a misunderstanding. Although one or two cases are addressed or mentioned by other noise sources, the only real focus of our protagonists is on car alarms. Alarm systems, alarm systems, alarm systems. There is really no other focus. If the film tries to tie up other examples of noise pollution to the problem of vehicle alarms, it just seems as if it is paying tribute to the actions of Robbins' character. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are all disturbed by the noise. Nobody likes the sound of alarm systems. Of course we all have the inner urge to turn a baseball bat into a screeching vehicle, and this movie takes advantage of that fact, and pretty much that fact alone, to sell that movie. I say "quite a bit" because there is also a blatant sexual relationship (including a completely unnecessary threesome) that is obviously thrown to those moviegoers who need such things to enjoy a movie. Honestly, it's a feast for the eyes. <br /> <br /> Robbins character, very short in the movie, becomes totally incomprehensible. It seems less that he decides not to endure the noise and that he has begun to lose his mind by focusing on the noise. The first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from an angry, frantic guy into this little man's hero, The Rectifier. The transformation does not take place. He simply renames himself. <br /> <br /> I could go on for a while. Annoying, general social commenting occasionally adds to the movie's presumptuousness, and the complacent grin that never leaves Robbins face does not help either. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think it's obvious what this movie is supposed to be, as it's pretty crowded, but in my opinion, it's failing in a big way. Only one man thinks, cheers.
