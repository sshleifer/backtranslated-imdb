This apology for a movie is about nothing! Rachel Griffiths needed the money. The film must have been made on a very small budget, as the lighting was not available. I took an oath when I see Pete Postlesumthing or once again. I would be happy to know if there was 1) a plot or 2) a script. My biggest regret is that I wasted my time watching this garbage.
