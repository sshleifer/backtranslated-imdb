I'm sorry, but that may have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just can not stand it anymore. The only interesting scene in the entire film is the opening scene in which Michael kills his sister Judith with his Halloween mask. The most amazing moment in the entire movie is when his parents remove the mask to see how their son killed their daughter. The movie goes down from there and is only recorded in the last fifteen minutes, but then it is too late, we have lost the audience all interest in the story. There is hardly any character development, and people always rave about Laurie being an extraordinary heroine when she really does not have much to offer. I am sorry that I can not agree with everyone who is scared in this movie. But if you want a great horror movie, check out The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are the two best horror movies ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can not believe that Roger Ebert got four stars because there's no way this movie deserves such a high rating.
