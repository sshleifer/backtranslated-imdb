I was so disappointed with this show. After listening to all the reunion and reading about how it was a "groundbreaking show" and all sorts of wild promises when it came to quality, I tried to look at it. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment !! Acting was much forced and exaggerated. The story made very little sense. For any reference to the vaunted "Looking into the Life of Teenagers," I could only see a stupid attempt that was as realistic as a reality show. <br /> <br /> Some are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it is really not that good. When you beat the drums about the quality in this show, the attention is focused only on how bad it was done.
