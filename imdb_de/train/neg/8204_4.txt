An unoriginal, all-too-predictable, and uninspired, easy-to-recycle science-fiction formula we've all seen a hundred times before - a group of scientists isolated against something unknown, and everywhere (surprise, surprise)) Antarctica! <br /> <br /> The film features James Spader and an almost nameless cast (with the exception of Carl Lewis, who is not actually bad for a non-actor) - the ho-hum performances do little to make the unimaginative To revive dialogue of the script. To make things worse, the tempo of the movie is slow, there is almost no subplot and the few action sequences are stereotyped and not so exciting. It's no wonder that this thing went straight to DVD. It's a miracle that Spader - at times an outstanding actor honored for "Sex, Lies and Videotape" with the Cannes Best Actor Award, has done an outstanding job in the innovative science-fiction film "Stargate" in this dull project. Or maybe not, looking at his career, because it seems that he has invested his talents in more failures than hits. <br /> <br /> The most notable thing about 'Alien Hunter' is how they've managed to stuff so many elements from so many great science fiction films, and yet things have turned out so listless and invented , There are huge borrowed pieces from "The Thing" (both Howard Hawks' original and John Carpenter's outstanding 1982 remake), "Contact" and "Outbreak"; a few notes on "Alien", CE3K "," The Andromeda Strain "," Kubricks 2001 "(ie the" Alien Black Box ") and" Mission To Mars "(ie the mystery message), and even a small shot" Sneakers "and" A Remarkable Mind "(although no science-fiction movies, they have a" cryptology "connection.) Damn it, there are even corn fields and the Antarctic, as well as the 'X Files Movie' glowing, translucent spaceship at the end looks just like something snapped out of a 'The Abyss' dump. <br /> <br /> Everything was done earlier and made much better, though I have to admit it there were a few light surprises towards the end, I could say a little bit more about the storyline, but there is absolutely no need, you already know more than half of this film without ever having seen it (5 out of 10)
