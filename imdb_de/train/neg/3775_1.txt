As other viewers have mentioned, this movie was an interesting experiment in photography. The colors are weirdly fat. I think the director got carried away with his "artistic vision" of the look of the film, instead of urgently looking for the content. Despite their outstanding ensemble, the performances are dull and the story almost incoherent. Madonna was probably cast only as a stunt to get pre-release press. A good thing, since her performance here gave her album "I'm Breathless" some credibility, which was a stratospheric hit (mainly due to the inclusion of the dance hit "Vogue" - which is neither in, still has the least relationship to this film). I think most of the money from this movie came from links to Madonna's "I'm Breathless" album. <br /> <br /> If you look at it at home, for final titles, then you will think, "There are two hours from my life that I would like to have again." Save yourself the wasted time - do not worry about it.
