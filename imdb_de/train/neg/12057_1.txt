Charles Bronson continued his break-up of the 1980's with his possibly worst movie of the decade, if not at all. In it, he plays a detective who does everything he can to locate a pimp who has kidnapped an Asian woman and is currently selling it to the highest bidder. It is a shameful attempt and is probably the most depressing movie ever made. Many people consider the sequel to Death Wish to be Bronson's worst movie. The Death Wish sequels were not great movies, but in most cases they were competent and very good to see. Kinjite, however, is a completely boring thriller interrupted by common racism and child abuse. It is truly a reliable film that is compounded by the fact that it tries to preach a "law and justice" mentality that is too exaggerated to really say anything. In fact, the movie begins with minor sex being interrupted and Bronson raped the pedophile anal with a dildo. The Chicago theater in which I saw this snapped only after the clumsiness of this scene, only to gasp at the clumsiness of the pimp raping the girl in this movie. It has no other purpose than exploiting it, and really, the film was not written well enough to go beyond the exploitation level and deliver something that would work. Bronson seems to be more in things, but that's far too repulsive to save. I'd like to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever, but this effort is ultimately his worst. The action sequences are also bad. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 (Awful)
