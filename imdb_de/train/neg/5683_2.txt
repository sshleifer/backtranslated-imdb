At the beginning of the movie, I felt it was a movie about another Jason's on Friday, September 13th. And it's ... quarrel that the movie starts interesting. But as time goes by, it's just a pointless movie about a muted, supernatural, silent serial killer. I mean, he goes under the guy's bed without making any sound no one sees. He should be blind after a failed execution, but he goes and kills people as he used to. I'm tired of it. Everything is the same for me. <br /> <br /> In other words - unreal. Too many mistakes and confusing information. <br /> <br /> The scene with the tide woman looked impressive at first glance.
