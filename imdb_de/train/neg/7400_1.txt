I've seen some pretty bad movies, and that's at the top. No plot to talk about, it's like one of those bad coma episodes in a soap opera. I just wanted to chuck that little girl, because, let's just say, she's really suspicious throughout the movie. The monsters that were running around with something bling were funny. I also saw a bit of "Silent Hill" there. And I read that this was done by a Finnish metal band, Lordi. No wonder it did not make much sense. It seems to be a vehicle to promote the band and nothing else. The FX are very good, the look of the movie, the monsters and even the acting are good too. But the story and the telling of it are just not there.
