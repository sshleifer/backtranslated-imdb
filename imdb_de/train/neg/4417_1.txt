I am a Catholic who was taught in church elementary schools by nuns who were taught by Jesuit priests at high schools and colleges. I'm still a practicing Catholic, but in the eyes of the church I would not be considered a "good Catholic" because I do not believe in certain things or use certain behaviors just because the church tells me. <br /> <br /> So back to the movie ... it's bad because two people are killed by this nun, who is supposed to serve as satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead. There is no comedy in it, and satire is not made good by the exaggerated acting of Diane Keaton. I have never seen the piece, but if it was very different from these films, it may be fine. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the gun might be a fake, and the first shot was a plan of the female lead role of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary's emotional and intellectual faith. But it turns out that the bullets were real and the story has a tragedy ... the tragedy of the loss of life (except the two former students ... the life of the deceased babies, the life of the student mother), the tragedy of Dogmatic authority over the love of man, the tragedy of organized religion replaces the true belief in God. This is what is wrong with today's Islam and Judaism and yesterday's Christianity.
