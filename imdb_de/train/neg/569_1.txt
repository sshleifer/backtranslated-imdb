Thank you for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie is shitty on so many levels that it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRES were fun, but this renewed retreading made me yawn. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (poor man's Kevin Bacon) drives a surfboard in Mexico through a hidden compartment containing his vampire killing gear Bandera's guitar case in DESPERADO. He picks up some lame "hunters" (including an annoyingly feminine infected girl who takes pills to avoid becoming a vampire), and they set about stopping a female vampire who is not given a backstory and we could care less about their or their search (walk in the sunlight by stealing the black cross and performing a ritual to make this possible). If you have seen the first VAMPIRES, you have already seen this and done much better. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter has been responsible for many bad movies lately. Honestly, I think he has his best times behind him and can not do another horror classic. The only decent movie he has shot since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is utter crap, to the incredibly cheap-looking and backward GHOSTS OF MARS ... and now this waste of celluloid. Where are more greats like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING? <br /> <br /> Carpenter, Wallace proves he can not write with paper out of a paper bag -This script is packed with yawns, groans, and recycled gags from the original. Did I mention that I hated every character in the movie? There was not a single memorable character in the entire movie. How did this happen? This movie has nothing to recommend. Not even the DVD presentation is good; The menu looks terrible. <br /> <br /> In comparison, JASON X: "FRITAY THE 13th IN SPACE" was a masterpiece. So you're going to do a sequel and re-release a franchise, ladies, and germs, and create an exciting DVD menu.
