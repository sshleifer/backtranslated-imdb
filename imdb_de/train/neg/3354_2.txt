In my opinion, if you choose to make a very good movie, try to do it better than the original. or at least give it a new point of view. Now, Robert Wise's 1963 report on Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is still worth the price of entry. Now fast forward to 1999 and to re-make. I shook my head and asked why? The drama is made of wood, history is unrecognizable and it seems to be the whole point of replacing the subtle horror of the original with so many special effects that computers can produce. I had heard that this update was bad. But I could not believe it was that bad considering the source material. I was wrong. After seeing this and telling my wife how horrible it was, she said. "Well, they got your money!" She's right, do not let her get yours. If it is not profitable to make lousy recoveries, they may stop producing them or reach a higher standard that will not offend the public
