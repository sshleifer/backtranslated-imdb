I have seen my share of Woody Allen's films, and although they are not always great, you can usually be sure that you will be entertained. The last really good ones were probably Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then, the ones I've seen have been inconsistent but observable. So when I was invited to the new Woody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda, of which I did not even know it was released, I happily went along. I did not really hear that much and hoped that I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> What I got was definitely the worst Woody Allen movie I've ever seen. The premise is overrated, the cast is awful, the script is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes said nothing and were still stretched out. I'm assuming to fill in what would otherwise have been a 15-minute short film. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the concept behind this film - two directors are discussing how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and obviously the film shows us that by playing out both scenarios. The problem is that none of these "two films" is good at all. The comedy is not funny and the tragedy is not very tragic. It looks as though Allen had found a good idea, but then the steam was out, or the time to actually complete the movie. <br /> <br /> The general level of acting is also particularly bad - Will Ferrell is the only one who puts something on the table, and it's basically a Woody Allen impression. In the past, good actors like Chloe Sevigny are just annoying, and the worst is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a pity because her character can be found in almost every scene!). <br /> <br /> To be fair to the actors, the script they work with is missing, if not at all. Definitely away from the Allen we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
