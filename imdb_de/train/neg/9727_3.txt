Another of my explorations into the bargain basket, this movie has brought me exactly what I expected - a load of trashy horror complete with shrieking ladies. <br /> <br /> It all started so well - I liked the little intro with the "newsreel" about the young couple who was exposed to a nuclear bomb, and was completely lost until the first person who caught fire. . <br /> <br /> From then on, the film fell into complete stupidity and was sometimes almost embarrassing to see. If it turned out that the heroine had the same condition as the main character (the ability to light one's own farts without the help of a match), it was almost as if someone had thrown in the idea at the last moment ("that.") his! "You can almost hear her say ...) As for the almost psychic connection between the main character and the nuclear plant, well ... <br /> <br /> The movie did act cheap - if you have more than Â£ 1, Pay 50 for it, you are already done.
