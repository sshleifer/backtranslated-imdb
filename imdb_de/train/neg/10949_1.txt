I go to the cinema to talk. There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this movie. From beginning to end, there is no rest from the gray, dragging reality of this woman's life. It is a step without changing the mood. I stayed until the very end because I was convinced that things had to get better. They do not do it, and I do not think I was the only one, as the many groans in the cinema prove, when the movie ended mercifully. Honestly, depicting social depravity is not a crime, but drilling your audience to moan is not the way to gain the sympathy of the public. A terrible movie.
