A solid comedy entertainment with musical interludes creates a fast pace that leads at breakneck speed through a maze of humorous and cool complications. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong group of scary villains. The script includes all the popular mystery movie props, sliding panels, secret passages, thunder and lightning, and poisoned blazes. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre rely on fierce slander and obvious melodrama of the gas time. Kay Kyser and his band provided great entertainment to people in the 1940s who wanted to forget the horrors of World War II.
