The Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous. I loved Honey, I shrunk the kids when I was little. It was an original story and had such an exciting story! The sets were so fantastic and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other's company. Well darling, I blew the boy up, was pretty dumb, so I wanted to go back to the story everyone loved. <br /> <br /> Basically, Adam is a bit more grown-up now and the mother goes on vacation to leave her husbands with their children. But when Wayne's favorite article is threatened with garbage, he wants to downsize and keep it, but he and his brother get in the way. But if, after forgetting, the women forgot to give their son some medicine, they would also get into the machine and leave the children alone in the house! <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid, but as I said it was just a family movie that I think might be fun. The original treasure, I've shrunk the children, is the best, I think anyone could agree with that. The third movie was not that bad, I would recommend this movie at least about Honey, I had the movie "Kid blast", it was at least a little more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
