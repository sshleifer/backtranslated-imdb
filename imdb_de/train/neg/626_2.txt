The spirit of a murdered geek high school animates a scarecrow, which avenges itself on all. <br /> <br /> This movie really annoyed me. It has a great-looking monster, some good low budget effects, some atmosphere, but it manages to short the good stuff with bad ones. Halfway I started to move forward and walked through the chapters on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The problems with this film are numerous. At first, the cast looks about thirty, and yet they're supposed to be in high school. They believe nothing from the beginning as a result. The scarecrow, though it looks good, is not much beyond that. He says silly deposits and moves in a way that's more funny than scary. Is this a comedy or a horror movie? It's a problem that goes beyond the one-line lines of much of the dialogue and is set up. It seems to be more of a clich√© than a deeply felt horror film. I suppose the movie was made for a very close audience, horror fans who want to make fun of the genre instead of embracing it. Despite the good-looking monster, this is a movie to avoid. Even if you find it in the bar for less than $ 5, you pay too much. <br /> <br /> Avoid it.
