Unlike "The Adventures of the Buckaroo Banzai" or "Big Trouble in Little China" or "Conan the Barbarian", these are terrible films that have a certain coolness and a self-deprecating humor that makes them cult sensations The Golden Child is just bad. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is not impracticable, and there are some fun moments. But here Eddy Murphy's "Flip Stance" drifts every sense of suspense or danger in the story. And the special effects are stupid enough to do more damage to this tension. The "mystical secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are more darned than forced. <br /> <br /> Without the feeling that something is at stake or the characters are in real danger, why should we care? <br /> <br /> Who should watch this movie: <br /> <br /> - big fans of Eddy Murphy who can not help <br /> <br /> - I can not think of it All the others <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
