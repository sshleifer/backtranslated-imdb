Gossip columnist Sheila Graham, based on a novel by former friend and groupie of F. Scott Fitzgerald, wrote this trashy story. Gregory Peck continues in shameless excess as a powerful drunk or damned alcoholic; at odds with the gentle and quiet genuine Scott Fitzgerald. Later in his life, the acclaimed author focused on Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing time. In reality, he lived a quiet life and effectively combated his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet known. Fitzgerald was not particularly proud to recycle his flapper stories to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (at the university). He lived in a small apartment and drove Chevrolet second-hand. His life was 180 degrees different than in this movie. <br /> <br /> Virtually Every Twentieth-Century Fox Movie Filmed Under Daryll F. Zanuck's Guidance Virtually every film made by Henry King was an outstanding work. Beloved Infidel was the exception.
