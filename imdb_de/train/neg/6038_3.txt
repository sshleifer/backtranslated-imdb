I had no expectations but to be entertained for 90 minutes, and that's what I was. <br /> <br /> Of course it is without a fight, of course some dialogues were not perfect, of course "special effects" were a bit hokey. That's why I liked the movie so much. It fits perfectly with this genre of a horror classic of the 70s. <br /> <br /> The talent has to start from the beginning, which is what the actors and the crew are all about. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to another movie from these producers and directors.
