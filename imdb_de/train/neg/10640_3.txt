From the uninspired title to the flat-act performances, Curdled is a thoroughly unremarkable film. The film has won some fans by the fact that the name of Quentin Tarantino is associated with it, and the stupid and inappropriate reference to the Rodriguez / Tarantino film "From Dusk to Dawn". However, these things do not make a great movie and this is more than obvious throughout the "Curdled". The film suffers from too obvious a lack of ideas and tries to mask it with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are distracting. The Mexican music score that accompanies many of the film's sequences is obviously cool, but it gets annoying very quickly. Apart from the fact that the main character is Mexican, it does not match the tone of the movie. The plot of the film is usually unusual and follows a gorhound who, due to her obsession with cruel murders, accepts a job at a company that clears up murder scenes. It sounds boring and it is. William Baldwin is the only "name" on the cast list, and even he makes no impression. He has not got anything to do with the movie, and apart from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look threatening, he's pretty much wasted. Angela Jones or better said; The taxi driver of Pulp Fiction takes on the lead role as a murderous young woman, and it is always clear that her role in Pulp Fiction has given her the role and not her acting skills. She may have been good enough in her small role in Tarantino's masterpiece, but she does not have the talent to lead a movie on her own. For most of the film, it looks lost and inappropriate, and if it did not have its Latino accent; She would not convince the audience that she is a nutcase on every level. Curdled is a 100% certified garbage. Films like these often win praise for inventions or black comedies. However, this fails at all levels. Whether you are a Tarantino fan, a William Baldwin fan, a horror fan or just a movie fan. That's one to miss.
