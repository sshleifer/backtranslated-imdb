Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman, this show is not a compliment. The character is not even nearly likable and it's not a situation where you think, "Oh, she's such a shit, I love her", "just" she's such a shit. "This character is just a simple old self-righteous, mean, b * tch.Sarah seems to have a hard time wearing this show because she's the only half-funny one.The mood, the dialogue is all so damn boring and dry, as if it were so Listen, like you Grandpa continues to talk about the marbles he collected as a kid. <br /> <br /> The Sarah Silverman program is so incredibly boring that I thought about switching channels to old reruns from Married With Children See, it's funny because the characters are so "immoral" and "rude." I'm sorry, but I do not find a show full of dry wit and cheesy stories about a mad, bitter, angry, bitter life of the loser with their annoying like hellish sister and gay n Friends who sound like Keanu Reeves and have a cold somewhere I can not stand this show, although Sarah Silverman is generally like "I love her because she is such a great character," as in School Of Rock, and the most of them get up. I think this show is boring with characters who think they are mean and do things to get shocked. The constant Pube, diarrhea and hit in general for laughing. The Sarah Silverman program tries to be funny and fails, it needs either a laugh track or better writers. Someone compared it to South Park, but it's not even close The opinions on the Sarah Silverman program do not turn into an annoying troll, which means you will not see who I am and constantly shit things like "Shit that show" and "Why is not it canceled?" is like the Sarah Silverman program if you enjoy it.
