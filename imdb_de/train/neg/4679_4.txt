What a horrible movie. Do not get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but apart from a few interesting bits and pieces, the movie is mostly shot by hysterical submariners who scream, cry, sweat, and generally freak out when things go wrong <br /> Suppose this with simple hints to make sure the audience still understands what's going on (the scene where Denzel Washington tells a radio operator how he needs to be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing else as a joke) and you have a muted thriller that is not worthy of acting. <br /> <br /> Let's just hope that the real US Navy is not in the hands of such a script! <br /> <br />
