If I made a film thermometer, this movie would be the absolute zero. Out of ten stars I would rate it as follows: <br /> <br /> Content: zero stars Video quality: zero stars Sound quality: zero stars Effect: zero stars <br /> <br /> It's as if students came one afternoon with a camera together, did an action and made a movie. Every artistic value is so lacking that I would rather watch children run around in high school than watch this movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is something to be said for the abysmal depths. The "Shootout" in the stairwell is one of the funniest scenes ever to be wrecked. First and foremost, the combatants simply move on each other with plastic pistols and move their arms back and forth to simulate the recoil. The couple actually "decouples" the non-existent bullets. No squibs, no sparks, no blanks, armed only with spray guns. If you want to see two adult men playing "actors", turn it one day ... after cleaning the refrigerator, combing the rug, polishing all the door knobs, raking the gravel, fixing the books on the shelf, etc. ,
