Wenders is a recurring disappointment since he played a major role in "Paris Texas". <br/> <br/> The land of abundance is no exception. Considering the fact that I had counted on an average mediocre movie even before I got started, Wender's ambitions always seem to outnumber him. Now it is mature that his films are cumbersome and bombastic. <br /> <br /> I was not sure if I was watching a comedy mocking Central America or a thriller. The result of Diehl's character is completely predictable. Wender's effort to overlay many scenes with some rock songs is also very annoying. He obscured the holes in his screenplay and directing by mixing up the scenes. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many people will find this film important and resonant, but honestly, this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Wenders indicated that he was a part of it The production of 'Paris Texas' had great help from Sam Sheppard on the screenplay. Yeah, that was Wenders' best and he should understand that he needs a good script writer. His films from the last 15 years were a total mess.
