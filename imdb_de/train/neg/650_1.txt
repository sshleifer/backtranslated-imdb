Why Hollywood needs to film movies as brilliant as their flower (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes), but it's even worse why Hollywood needs it, the horror movies that were not brilliant at the beginning To remodel (Prom Night, The Amityville Horror) Similar to their originals, these remakes do not create any atmosphere, character or real fear. Prom Night is so flat and uninteresting that it's hard to look at it, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> It is a badly traded, massively uninteresting and ultimately boring excursion that fails at everything it should. It's clear that Hollywood horror is dead. Even The Hills Have Eyes and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre have managed to stylishly ruin their franchise with a bucket of blood and a decent conspiracy. Prom Night is practically bloodless and I will not even mention how bad the conspiracy is. His inability to seal the killers makes this horror movie the least exciting horror movie since ... the original. <br /> <br /> One of the most notorious slasher movies of the 1980s returns to terrorize movie viewers with this remake of how dreadful high school dances really are. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has survived a terrible tragedy, but now is the time to leave the past behind and celebrate her prom in style. <br /> <br /> When the big night finally comes, Donna and her best friends are getting ready to enjoy their last big high school blowout by living it and partying until dawn. But while Donna is ready to look past her nightmares for a better future, the man she believed escaped forever has returned for a final dance. An obsessed killer is at large, and he will kill anyone who tries to stop him from reaching his only Donna. Who will survive to see the graduation day, and what will Donna do when she is forced to confront her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis play a major role in the Slasher remake, with teens and teenagers nervously looking over their shoulders as they walk onto the dance floor. A conspiracy that will probably keep you from seeing this. Witch, if you ask me is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without much work, McCormick playfully tries to mitigate tensions from the most banal situations. At some point, a girl rests in a floor lamp (a lamp!) And McCormick tries to pump her into a frightening moment. Desperate times really require desperate measures. Since the last IKEA catalog there have not been so many recordings of cabinets. <br /> <br /> In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there is likely to be a crazy, scary movie of the commercialization of glamor and the sinister obsession of society with youthful beauty. This is not the movie. <br /> <br /> My final judgment? Avoid at all costs. Nobody will enjoy Prom Night, it's even a disappointment for those who are usually interested in hack job remakes. Considering his absolute lack of blood or fear. A night you'll be in a hurry to forget.
