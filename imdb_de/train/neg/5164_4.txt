The basic plot in this movie is not bad. A lady makes it big and returns to her alma mater to be worshiped. Despite good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film is a mess. The blame for me being either on Joan Crawford or the director or both is their terrible performance. Instead of being a real person, she makes a wonderful imitation of a deer in the spotlight. In other words, she stares into space and has a "golly I'm so stunned" expression. After a few minutes it was really annoying for me. This is certainly not the only Crawford movie I dislike for their performance because it has done more than just playing too much - in movies like JOHNNY GUITAR or many later movies like BERSERK! My advice is to try another Crawford movie - they were certainly better.
