I can not say that I have so much experience in Misty Mundae-Flicks after only seeing a handful, but it's obvious that this was just a trifle, and although it was quite remarkable that the filmmakers had a Tomb Raider It's not in a garage because it's completely obvious that's what they've done. The movie is only forty-five minutes long, and that's definitely a good thing, since there's not much plot left to extend it. It has something to do with a nasty Nazi scientist (who looks so evil as a porn star who could play a Nazi scientist), a mummy who is clearly a man wrapped in toilet paper, and Misty - the movie version of Tomb Raider, who holds her top far less than Angelina Jolie in the big budget version. I have to say that despite its inadequacies, this film could have been better. It has Misty Mundae for starters, and even better than that, if you ask me is the fact that it also plays the even hotter Darian Caine. The couple can engage in all the lesbian sex you would expect from a Seduction Cinema movie, and this is at the expense of the non-existent conspiracy, although that's not really a bad thing. Obviously, this is a garbage movie - but the fact that it's short is his credit, and if you have some lesbian sex, you could make it worse.
