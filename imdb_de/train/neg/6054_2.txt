I am not sure if Carpenter is trying to ask questions about abortion and the really stubborn and obvious point that a woman may get an abortion if Satan is the father. Ron Perlman is ridiculous. The baby looks really stupid, basically a crab with a baby head. You can see the material on the Satan costume pretty well. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of history and 55 minutes of boredom. Very very bad. And the end is just ridiculous. Does the devil, after learning that his baby is dead, destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge, bloody, bloody, bloody uproar? NO! He simply lowers his head and pouts out of the room. Awful.
