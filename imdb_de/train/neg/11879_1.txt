My wife and I rented this movie because some people had parallels with Office Space. Blockbuster and IMDB even had a "recommended" option if they liked Office Space. <br /> <br /> I've probably seen Office Space 15 or 20 times now. I love it. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Funny, humorous characters that remind me of people I've worked with over the years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office space" in that both are films. Here the similarity ends. We probably played the first 50 minutes of HT to use the doubt, hoping to * pray * that it would get better. Did not do it We could not take it anymore and stopped the tape. Thank god it was a free rental. I would have been upset if we had actually paid for it. We should be reimbursed if we have to go through it. Now that we have not seen the end, it may miraculously come together and redeem themselves. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Haiku Tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it was ever produced. The movie is so funny that it's painful. Just send the damned letters !!! The premise is asinine. The jokes are terrible. We came as far as the scene "Printer does not work" and had to stop. We could not stand it anymore. This film is an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Office Space ... Do not waste your time with this crap. 0/10
