Include some unrealistic movie spoilers. <br /> <br /> This film disappointed from the experiences of real life from the beginning. I am currently stationed as Iraqi Infantryman in Iraq on my second voyage. This movie has nothing close to what would happen in real life. To name just a few, from the very beginning: the bomb car, the EOD elements that roll solo unaccompanied, the sergeant of the EOD staff sneaking away from VBC, and had all the time rolled into ACUs 2-dollar Hajji copy, the sniper -Scene. The list would continue, but it is not necessary to list the erroneous events with a time span of 2 minutes before other things were faulty. and the point was made. <br /> <br /> This film is intended for people and critics who have no understanding or experience with operations or the military. <br /> <br /> People with a military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed by the inaccuracy.
