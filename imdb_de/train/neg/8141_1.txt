If you see how it lives at night, wonder who in the world sheds light on this crap. A newly married couple goes spelunking on honeymoon, is attacked by bats and the husband runs around in his pajamas and attacks various people. And where exactly are they? They are in the desert, then skiing, then they are in a small town that looks like they have mountains nearby. The city is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against wobbly doctor boys. The ski clinic is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the woman looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. There are no dramatic tensions and the end will fill you with anger. Special effects and make-up guru Stan Winston provided the effects of this film. I think you have to start somewhere.
