It is impossible for me to look objectively at this film. Not that I did not try, but I sit down and I look into the old VHS and I look at the opening ... and suddenly I'm five years old again, clutching my own Care Bear and watching The Movie with open eyes and an eager heart. <br /> <br /> I can objectively recognize that this movie is a BIZARRE combination of cuddly baby merchandising mascots and creepy prepubescent kids with evil forces who have a thin story with uninteresting animation. But my inner five-year-old says, "Yay, Care Bears!" Every time I think about it. So - I would only recommend this film (reluctantly, reluctantly) to those who saw it in its early teens and can claim the incredible power of nostalgia while seeing it (like me) or the graciously cynical Gen-X / Y-he's intentionally looking for the wonderful bad / stranger (a category this movie ... definitely belongs to). For those who are really looking for a compelling movie or a healthy family entertainment, you may want to keep looking.
