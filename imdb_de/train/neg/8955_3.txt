As for the movie, it's an OK science fiction movie. It contains many cool things and some quality scenes. That said, it's not that good, and some things are quite farfetched ... <br /> <br /> When you call this cube movie, it's total and total bullshit! T. This is the actual definition of milking a great and imaginative original movie ... The whole feeling can be transferred to the core of the first, but the introduction of people / androids as part of the "team" behind the cube itself is a bit boring ... <br /> <br /> I gave this 3 *** because of the backstabbing of the original. This should be kept sterile in so many parts of the film that there is no place or time to mention them all ... <br /> <br /> Watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but not recommended for fans of the series ...
