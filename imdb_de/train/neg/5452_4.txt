As far as movies are concerned, that's nice enough. Entertaining characters, good dialogue, interesting story. I would have really liked it if I had not been greatly irritated, while I see in total disrespect that it is the city in which it is located. <br /> <br/> Glasgow. In scotland. Nevertheless, every character is English (except for Sean's girlfriend, who is Dutch). Scottish accents can only be heard in fleeting jobs and roles. As a Scottish woman (and as a spectator who likes her real-life films more like a real life), I really do not think it would hurt to use one of the myriad of talented Scottish actors ... or at least English, who have a decent one accent could throw together! The futile attempt to use the word "wee" a few times only helped to promote the insult.
