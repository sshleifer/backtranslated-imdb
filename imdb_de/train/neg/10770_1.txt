Could contain possible spoilers (Not that something new in this movie is or even slightly surprised in this regard). <br /> <br /> Why does Disney feel the need to forget everything they've ever done? Sure, it's cheaper for them, but after a while, you would not believe that the overall quality and the way people think of them will subside. House Of Villains is a despicable display of crossovers that make absolutely no sense. Some signs of total disregard for earlier films in this regard are: The voices do not even match remotely and Iago is angry again (since when?!) I know these films are aimed directly at children, but there was a time everything was possible to enjoy Disney movies. Even the musical number of the movie (which had been Disney's specialty for years) stank. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, not even the youngest people. All I can do is that if more of these same-caliber movies are released, it's only a matter of time before a small animation studio outperforms Disney in overall quality.
