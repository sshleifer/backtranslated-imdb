I have never heard of this film until it was played as part of a Robert Mitchum retrospective at the National Film Theater in London. Nearly 60 years on the cast list, seven names - with the exception of Mitchum - were the best names in the public domain. Charles McGraw, not long gone from The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and probably better known as the daughter of theater set designer Norman, Walter Brennan, who needed no introduction, the sadistic orderly in The Lost Weekend, Frank Faylen and Robert Preston, the much nicer little town man in It's A Wonderful Life, is still a decade away from Harold Hill at The Music Man. Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter form the numbers. Unfortunately, most of them wereted their time. I searched in vain for "signature" scenes, since Robert Wise was the megaphone. By that time, he had made around half a dozen films and still had to find a style. The story is our old friend, the war from afar, and Mitchum must have thought that it was hardly a cut above the Hopalong Cassidy Waters where he'd cut his teeth. There are no new twists - if you do not count the incredible scene when Mitchum accused Preston of sleeping with Thaxter to get information about her father's plans to move his cattle. That's perfectly true, but how did Mitchum know? We have not seen or heard anything that suggests how he discovered it. All in all, not much to say.
