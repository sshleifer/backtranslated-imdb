A documentarist, like any other filmmaker, has a compelling story to convey. Will Pascoe fails completely in this effort and screwed together uninspired excerpts of Chomsky's wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The footage is amateurish and recorded in videos. Pascoe's only effort to put the fragments together into a whole is to periodically throw a vague title on the screen: "9-11," "Activism," "Truth." <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <Compare this to documentaries like "The Corporation" or "The Fog of War," which create a narrative drawing material from interviews, footage, and footage. In the end, everyone delivers a clever and insightful message cleverly and intelligently. <br /> <br /> The only saving graces of the film are Chomsky's nonchalant transmission of the historical dogma and the fact that the runtime is only 74 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of the more interesting sites was that Chomsky shared his experiences with National Public Radio. He describes conservative media as accommodating opinions, while NPR's liberal dogma straitjacket dramatically restricts his interviewees and allowed messages. Another media market that you should be skeptical about. <br /> <br /> This documentation is only for Noam Chomsky completeists.
