If you did not know better, you would believe the Christian moral majority in their sermon witness to the sins of the boys, their search for Satan, and the fact that hell is crowded with Advanced Dungeons and Dragons fans. None of these articles carries a grain of truth, People. This work only gives the Southern Baptists the opportunity to breathe, while the film continues to spread its erroneous and disturbing views of a creative and original game system. Tom Hanks does an outstanding job for this work, but even that was not enough to save it. It is crap. It is under crap. It is ignorance that produces ignorance, and as such it evaluates NOTHING from ... the Fiend.
