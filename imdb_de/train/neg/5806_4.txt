Nowhere near the original. It's a pretty accurate copy that does not bring anything new to the story. But the direction is very bad. Basinger is weak - without good direction. Compared to McQueen Baldwin is just a second division. I just saw it out of curiosity because I was a big fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Almost a B-movie with first-class acting and directing. I was not even disappointed, I just do not know what they wanted to try. This remake does not try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute, and in fact it lacks really good actors of its time. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad Xerox copy of a wonderful photo. <br /> This is a complete waste of time. Save 2 hours or look at the original (again :)))
