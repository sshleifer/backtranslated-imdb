Anna lives with her family in a new housing estate outside the city. She has been with her husband Sebastiaan for years and they do not talk that much anymore. During a working visit abroad, a colleague commits suicide. Anna is deeply impressed by her death, although she barely knew her. Nobody seems to know why she took her own life. For the first time, Anna realizes that one can be a stranger to loved ones. Anna does not mention the incident at home and watches her husband and child. Guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly considers her own life. And she wonders how she got away from the people closest to her. <br /> <br /> (This is my translation of the DVD cover text overview.)
