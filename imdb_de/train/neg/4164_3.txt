<br /> <br /> What is left of planet Earth is overshadowed by a few poor and starving survivors. They have to eat insects or insects or whatever, after a poison war or something like that has almost completely wiped out human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people on earth who are still able to live in comfort, we will call him the All Knowing Big Boss. He has the great task of preventing some secret spore seeds from being blown up. It seems that the omniscient Big Boss is the last person on Earth who knows that these spurs even exist. The spores are far removed from any living soul and are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /> <br /> The All Knowing Big Boss wants the secret spores to stay in their secret protected containers. Therefore, he plans to send a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all protection systems and the secret location. Sending people to the place of the secret spurs does not keep them secret any longer. By sending people to deactivate all protection systems, the spores can easily be released into the air. How about leaving sleeping dogs ?! <br /> <br /> The only pleasant feature of ENCRYPT is the radiant and elegant Vivian Wu. As the unobtrusive members of the macho action team slack off with mechanically predictable timing, the inclusion of Vivian Wu's charm makes the plot idea that her old employer wants her so much acceptable. It is an object of love, an object of desire - a very credible concept! <br /> <br /> Fans of Vivian Wu may want to see an outstanding B-movie she's seen a few years ago called DINNER. DINNER RUSH is strongly recommended. ENCRYPT is not.
