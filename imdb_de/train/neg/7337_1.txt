Painful. Painful is the only word that describes this dreadful rendering of such a fun and interesting Shakespearean game. I tried it, but was terribly disappointed and could not bear to see it again. For the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this phrase was from Viel Ado, I feel sorry for you and your bored brain. May your allegations against young viewers be lifted without retaliation. Please do not even make the annoying, disgusting apology for the performance of a famous Shakespeare drama. You will be forced to induce vomiting, and you will need a dresser near the TV to help you decide to shit yourself because of unwanted bowel movements.
