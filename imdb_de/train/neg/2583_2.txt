Another American pie movie was slammed in our throat and this is the worst of them all. It did not deserve the name American Pie. They should have stopped at "The Wedding". <br /> <br /> This movie feels like a stupid porn movie titled American Pie. When I saw that, I felt like watching another show. It does not look like American Pie at all. It has a different sense of humor and is much rude and has a lot more sex scenes than the other American pie movies. Actually, I do not recommend any of the "American Pie Presents" movies. Just stay with the beautiful, original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
