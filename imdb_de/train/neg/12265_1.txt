The special effects of this film, especially for their time, are ridiculous and so overemphasized that you can not deny their terrible existence. <br /> <br /> Acting redefines the term "terrible overacting". in the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Divoff simply redefine "bad". <br /> <br /> *** spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The charm in this thing movie can be found in two things: First, the excellent casting of Carel "Lurch" Struycken as a mysterious psychic Gaunt, who senses where and when people will die and is always there. <br /> <br /> The second is original finds, combining SF Westerns is obviously original, if awful, but other finds are more original, like the shooter Zack Stone, who is able to relieve the pain of people feel he's shooting (though his acting is too short here). > <br /> Overal ... do not see this movie, unless you love this old brutal Carel Struycken, as any Dutchman should do with self-esteem.
