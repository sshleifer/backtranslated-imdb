Okay, you have: Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (Backbone of England) She was killed in the first scene - that's right, people; This show has no backbone! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Ol 'Colonel Cricket of The First War and now the magnificent Lord of the Manor. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley as enchanted Lady of the Manor, 20 years younger than the Colonel and 20 years after her own flowering, but still glamorous (Brit way, not mine), enough to have a toyboy by the side to have. It's alright, they have the full knowledge and approval of Col. Cricket (the guy even comes for Christmas!) Nevertheless, she is considerate enough for the Colonel to be the Toy Boy at her age (what a girl!) Accept. <br /> David McCallum like the toyboy, as senselessly glamorous as his squeeze. Pilcher could not find a cover for him in the story, so she gave him a quiet job at the circus. <br /> <br /> and finally: <br/> <br/> Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, Reverend Headmistress of the Venerable Girls' College, serves tea at her office with a dash of profound, poignant advice for living in the outside world just before her graduation. Her best advice: "I was only once in Nancherrow (the country domicile of England) I found it very beautiful, but somehow not part of the real world." Well, we can not say they did not warn us. <br /> <br /> Ah, Susan - it was time your character ran the show. They do not write it like that anymore. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So - with a cast and such an attitude you have the innovations of "Brideshead Revisited" right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took on these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all, acting is one of the oldest temporary jobs there is (you name another!). <br /> <br /> First warning sign: lots of backlighting. They avoid it by photographing outdoors - "Hey, it's just sunlight!" Second warning sign: Leading Lady is crying a lot. If she does not cry, her eyes are wet. This is the law of romance novels: "Leading Lady" is "tauni√§ugig". <br /> <br /> Leading Lady is now referred to as LL. <br /> <br /> Third Warning Sign: LL actually has stars in her eyes when in love. Nevertheless, I give Emily Mortimer an award just because she has to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder if they used contacts.) And finally, fourth warning sign: no screen is a female figure "Woman" She is either "Miss" or "Lady". <br /> <br /> When all was said and done, I still could not tell who was following why. I could not even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: All go through the Second World War without anything happening. <br /> <br /> OK, in the end, LL realizes that she has lost her parents in Japanese prison camps and baby sis is coming home catatonic. In the meantime (there is always a "split time"), a young man who had a crush on LL (when I do not know) had come home from a hard war zone and was found by Lady of the Manor on the street (must be a few ) Road, if YOU will find him there.) Both war victims are washed away for recreation in Nancherrow (Someone must be "driven" somewhere in these love stories!) <br /> <br /> Great drama.
