This can not be Mandy Schafer's last movie. Someone, do something! :-( Argh. <br /> <br /> What a bit of life this could have been, the direction is over, do not blame the cast, they are fine Even the winemaker is younger brother was pretty well done, and he only got into the movie in the middle of the movie, and please, please, Mandy in a few more movies! She is too beautiful to her career at such a young age to bury, hh .... <br /> <br /> Two specific criticisms, if anybody cares (apparently nobody liked this movie very much): First, the way Traci showed up just in the right melodramatic moment to see Whatever she should see, and was never seen for that, that was very annoying Hollywood: Please do not give the rogue any perfect timing luck that ends up exactly when the climax is reached It's stupid Use this lame plot- No more if your script is not good enough to stand up without it n, do not produce it. <br /> <br /> Second, Carmen would not have fallen for the wrong trick Traci pulled. She had already fingered Traci. More bad writing / directing there. <br /> <br /> I could continue to ruin this movie, but grace forbids it. Actually, I did not hate it as much as the others seem. There simply was no reason to make it, unless it was a pure vehicle to show off the beautiful Mandy. Oh, and whoever did not think she was sexy ... the character was not very well written, but how can you say she was not sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses, and I do not think it is me. <br /> <br /> MORE MANDY. (Not to be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - although I would like to see her again too ;-) <br /> <br /> P.S. Did I mention that I hope Mandy makes me more movies? <: - D
