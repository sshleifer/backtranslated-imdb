The obsession of ET with Dannielynn Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention, she will most likely become psychotic, depressed, or worse. Think of Princess Diana and how she longed for privacy. Now poor, little, rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be left alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became a recluse and said, "I want to be alone." How much does ET make this little girl? ET has nothing better to report? I bet there are many people who really do not care what color their birthday cake and their balloons had. Incidentally, I have never heard that Anna Nichole ever won any of these trials for the will and heresy. Who pays for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard and little Dannielynn? Could it be ET?
