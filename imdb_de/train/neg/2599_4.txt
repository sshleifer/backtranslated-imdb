I got the DVD very cheap and I'm a total Drewbie, and that 's probably the only constellation that this movie could interest anyone, lots of really cute scenes of her, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, a whole bunch of sexy outfits, etc She never shows the friendly charm we know from her younger films. The film itself is pretty average or below average and looks more like a TV set than a movie. There is no real horror or tension, and the dialogues are often cheesy. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is probably the end because I honestly do not understand it. But maybe there is nothing to understand anyway. But at least you do not get the end you expect, and it comes much sooner than you expected. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this movie is for Drewbies only.
