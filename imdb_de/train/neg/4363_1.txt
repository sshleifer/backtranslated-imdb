It is difficult to find positive results in this film. It seems like the producer has to make a buck without much effort. Therefore, we are shown in detail by Galaxy, which is the lame excuse for a movie in history. The police girls looked extremely sexy in their small uniforms. More action shots of the two bulls and much less of Galaxy would have been the way to go. Of course, this would increase the budget, so they decided to fill the place with this miserable repetition. Ms. Albright looks very sexy and her acting is first class. Mrs. Stabs, of whom I had heard of, but had not seen her on screen before, also looked very desirable, but lacked in acting talent. Apart from Ms. Albright, that's real garbage.
