Given the people involved, it's hard to understand why this movie should be so messy and boring. Author David Ward wrote the amazing movie "The Sting" two years later, Jane Fonda had just won an Oscar for Klute, and Donald Sutherland had done a great job in films such as "Klute" and "Start the Revolution Without" me and Kelly's heroes. Plotwise, the movie is a capricious tale, with a small group of limping outsiders planning a big raid. At the same time, the film aims to be a hip satire, a series of comedy sketches that would make the NBC television show "Saturday Night" two years later so good. The bad result is that the storyline makes the comedy bits awkward and forced, and the disconnected comedy bits destroy any kind of suspense the robbery could have. It's literally a movie that keeps on hitting itself, just as the cars in the cars of the teardown scenes meet. <br /> <br /> The only real interest for me was watching Jane Fonda. Her "Iris Caine" should be a light-hearted version of her dramatic prostitute figure "Bree Daniels" in "Klute". But you do not believe her for a moment. It's always Jane Fonda pretending to be a prostitute we watch. It's such a terrible performance as her performance in "Klute" was great. It would be a good lesson for drama teachers to do the two films together to show how the same actress in the same role can be grand or pathetic. As a result, actors are only as good as their authors and directors.
