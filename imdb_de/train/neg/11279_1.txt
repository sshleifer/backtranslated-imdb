Words really can not describe how bad this movie is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least it had some nice punches and occasionally a good chop, which stroked you here and there to keep you from nodding. That's just ridiculous! Terrible script, bad director, terrible drama and you know what? I can not recommend anything other than the fact that it is not too long. If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment, book with the dentist and get worked in the root canal - much more comfortable and cheaper (assuming you need it!). By the way, I have to enter 10 lines of text to complete this review - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM. IT IS TERRIBLE!
