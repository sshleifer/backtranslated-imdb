I'm not saying that because the production values ​​were so low, but because it was terribly filmed. This shot of the girl washing her hair in the stream? Did we really have to sit there for an oversized recording and watch her do it in the same place for 5 minutes? It was awful, the lighting was just bad. They could hardly see anything and when the characters spoke, they could barely hear what they were saying. Did I watch the whole movie? Of course, I did not skip most of it, and I do not want anyone to say that I have to look at it first to judge it. This movie was made so bad and executed that it's just terrible even by independent and low budget standards. Terrible movie ... do not waste time with it, unless you want a good laugh, but even then, not because of the "witty" lines of the actors, but because of the laborious production.
