REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (2 out of 5 stars) No, this is not a long lost ancestor to the classic George A. Romero zombie flicks. This is a 1936 low-budget potboiler that was probably very cool for the audience at the time ... but it seems routine these days. In fact, there is a pretty good scene at the beginning of a soldier firing his pistol into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers ... and a close-up of bullets penetrating the bare chest of one of them. The effect looks hopelessly unreal, but in 1936 I'm sure the audience was gasping for breath. The story refers to the search for the mystery of mind control ... supposedly to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a means for a character to win the woman he loves. The movie is barely an hour long, but moves at a snail's pace, so it seems boring, believe me! There really is not much to recommend ... You may be amused by the fake studio recordings of the star who "wades" through a "swamp". The end is interesting ... so I would say that the movie is worth seeing at least once. You'll probably see it as an added feature for some cheap "4 Movies on 1 DVD" compilation at Wal-Mart for five dollars. Hey, it's worth the money ...
