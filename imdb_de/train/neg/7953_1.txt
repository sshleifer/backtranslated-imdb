While acting and directing could be argued for some merit - the plot is a very poor wannabe Vietnam movie whose country name was simply changed. <br /> <br /> At least for a movie that has credibility. Try and have a degree of accuracy in equipment, weapons and tactics. Do not consider the gross misrepresentation of the behavior of the troops as a norm. <br /> <br /> Apart from its limited use as a stupid propaganda by the South African Defense Army, it serves little purpose - definitely not an entertainment value. <Br /> <br /> Up and coming filmmakers - that's the way to make war films. Research and be proud of your product.
