A decent sequel, but not the stamp of the original. A murderous scriptwriter (Judd Nelson) approaches new identities to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthlessly killed, but the movie seems to be very funny. Every humor is not funny. The overall project seems to have the quality of a quickie, and at times Nelson is far surpassed. This movie is about a script that was rewritten before the screen was called. This could have happened with this script.
