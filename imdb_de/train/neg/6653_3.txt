I've just watched this movie, and I have to say it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can not act at all. She read her lines very naturally and had a very natural facial expression throughout the film. Rosanna Munter, who played Petra, is natural. She played her role with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we've seen it many times. She separates, he finds another, she gets jealous, he separates with the other girl and they end up together again. There were no surprises, it was known that Eve would split up and that Adam "connected" with Petra. The only thing that nobody saw coming was that Petra invited Adam to follow Eve at the party. She became quite serious, which is a side of Petra that the audience had not previously seen in the movie, and told him to get Eva's heart back, which was really sweet. There's no such thing as Rosanna Munter. It's not a single actor giving a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I do not recommend it!
