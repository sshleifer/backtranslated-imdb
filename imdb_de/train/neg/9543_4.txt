Let's face it - if you've rented a STDVD sequel to a forgotten gem from the '80s and expected it to be better than the ones mentioned above, then you're an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has filled so easily. Films like these do not need spoilers because YOU already know them. <br /> <br /> The plot for this film is as follows: Nerd meets girl; Girl likes nerd; Nerd likes girls; The nerd accidentally enters the computer of the Top Secret Government. Nerd and girl go to another country; Nerds and girls are ultimately persecuted by government indictments in the other country. Nerd and Girl meet an important old man who dies at an important point in the movie; Nerd and girl are captured; the computer of the top-secret government goes crazy; Nerd is hired to defeat Top Secret Government Computer; The nerd beats the Top Secret computer by using the same old Top Secret computer from the first Wargames movie. Nerd saves the day; Nerd is laid. <br /> <br /> The end. <br /> <br /> Drama, script, effects, score and cinematography are what you would expect - B grade. Some familiar faces are here, and if you're not a big fan of Colm Feore, you should avoid this. Granted, the movie does not make you crazy enough to eat your own toes when you see it. So, if you like cheap-looking STDVD sequels, you're at home doing a "masterpiece" that he could not even make a 5-second cameo. But can you blame him?
