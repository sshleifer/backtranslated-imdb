Christ. It's a sequel to one of the smartest movies ever, it has at least the decency to omit the songs (a reprise of the unbearable "Tomorrow"), but it continues the tradition of being evil and not funny. This time, Annie and her friends travel to London and become involved in Joan Collins' plan to blow up Buckingham Palace or something. The film has a bizarrely sykophantic attitude towards its figure of the same name, which does not agree with her irritation: every time the little guy "Leapin 'lizards!" I could feel my teeth grinding into powder. The film contains bleakly photographed, muddy and clumsy and has only one memorable line ("Unhide me, you stupid genius!") And the fact that it is not the original that is recommended.
