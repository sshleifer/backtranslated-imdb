The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than boys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the action is given. Jersey Girl goes to New York to become a songwriter. And after initial frustration of being out of luck, you hear some girls celebrating the $ 300 they earned last night. She gets an audition at the bar where she works and surprise! The place is completely full of "two-year-olds" bursting at the sight of babes dancing. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad and some characters are sympathetic, especially Cammie (the "fashion coordinator" part was cute) and the bouncer, but let's be honest, the drama was terrible and utterly ridiculous from the start , Violet and her father looked too ridiculous throughout the movie. And jamming Violet on the keyboard with the breakdancer! <br /> <br /> For the first time I remembered how the production could be so terrible. For a brief moment in this movie, Hollywood was able to stand on its feet and show a new low point without much public outcry, without saying, "You have been warned!" Instead, it appears that COYOTE UGLY intends to kiss all the world's major weaknesses. Advertising babes in a bar, but with a thin paper, "Follow Your Dream" story disappoints every male teenager you've targeted. <br /> <br /> And finally the music. There was absolutely no interruption of the music I found in this movie, especially when needed (the hospital scene). Each scene felt like a short music video that you wish it would stop until the bar opened. The highlight, however, was an ultimate laugh: an 80s-like song that you would expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on stage and moan with Violet. Heck, I personally thought Bon Jovi would jump out with the long hair and jam! <br /> <br /> Apart from some really smart camera work with the coyote girls dancing (especially the wet scene) and a couple of nice clich√©s, COYOTE UGLY is something to be embarrassed about. Whether you saw it or made it, it looked like nothing but time murder. Or waste it depending on how you look at it.
