I've given up trying to figure out which version I'm watching. The copyright at the end points to the year 1983. And though this is not the most important part of my objection to this film, I'll say I'm watching a movie that was apparently filmed in the Age of Aquarius (including long-haired hippie chicks and vile suits) but with a 1980s synth sound Years is unsettling. Very disturbing. <br /> <br /> My main objection here is HOW THE FILMMAKERS BURY CAN LIVE CUTE AS A BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN. How dare you. Seriously, she's all adorable and all that, but in the two movies I've seen her - in that Crapfest and the otherwise acclaimed Legend of Hell House - they're killing her. <Br /> <br /> I would like to make the film industry aware of this. Pamela Franklin seems to have withdrawn from the business, but if she ever decides to do another movie and a corrupt cur of a director tries to kill her, I'll ask him if he should step outside. <br /> <br /> NO ONE BEATS UP PAMELA FRANKLIN AND WALK THROUGH YOU. I AM QUITE Cross. THE FURY WAS UNLEASHED. <br /> <br /> You could make things worse for B-Movie fans looking for a crapfest. On the positive side, this is not a film that involves Satanism in a peripheral and prudent manner - this movie is a hardcore satanic film. Wall-to-wall Satanic ceremonies, Baphomets, hallucinations, a ridiculous Rat Attack - what else could one expect. <br /> <br /> This excellent material is almost ruined by the confusing synth-soundtrack grafted into the 1980s, which is as out of line with a movie as possible. The soundtrack reminded me of something you would hear in the equalizer. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> They also got Pamela Franklin to crush her charming English accent, which was also quite rude, if not a cruel cruelty (to the onlooker), as you might find in the Universal Declaration of human rights. I say we have the right to hear Pamela Franklin speak in her own voice. Who is with me? I could forgive everything else about this movie if they do not abuse Pamela Franklin. And so I throw the fight down, gentlemen - EVERYONE WHO MEASURES WITH PAMELA FRANKLIN WITH YOU. <br /> <br /> ALSO IN A FICTIONAL CONTEXT. <br /> <br /> Hello, SIRS.
