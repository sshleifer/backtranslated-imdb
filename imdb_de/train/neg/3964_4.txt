With all the hype around this movie, I was open to what I would ultimately think. And although it is sometimes a bit slow, the first 90% of the movie is pretty good, with more than a few "old times" that make you nervous and unsafe. In my opinion, cinematography is excellent in many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, is at its peak. The end of the film and the dissolution are what MILES APART seems to be out of his body. The plot completely falls in the face with an illogical conclusion and the answer I was looking for most - what really happened to Emma? - was not explained! The reasons for the negative energy were ridiculous at best, and in the end I felt very cheated. What could have been a great horror movie was ultimately hounded to a terrible end.
