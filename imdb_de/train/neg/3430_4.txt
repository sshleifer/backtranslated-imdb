A bloody maniac with cannibalistic tendencies rapes a woman. He was shot dead by two policemen and then resurrected from the grave for a kind of satanic ritual of rituals marked by evil heresy. The hunt for women is continued by this zombie demon. The sacrificed baby returns from the grave and wants the madman dead again, but only with the help of the police will this be true ... <br /> <br /> A bloody 65-minute mess ... Horny zombies, Dolls-babies, S & M, corrupt and twisted policemen, repent heretics seeking refuge from Jesus Christ, and three text screens at the end of the film that explain what happened to the surviving policeman (yes, we should know !) ... Two decent undressing shots can not save the situation. I've seen the worst horror movies, but it was pretty bad too. Recommended only for die-hard fans of the genre.
