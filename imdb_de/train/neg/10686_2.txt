Please help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! The summary of the film is: The First Lady murdered her husband for cheating on her. That's it. Uncovered by anyone but Cuba and Angie, she designs and implements a huge conspiracy of assassinations nobody knows about ... and which is completely free. <br /> <br /> Some special points are especially funny: When you stand in the front Cuba deflects the assassin's bullet. She enters the back of the president's head. <br /> <br /> Cuba and Angie watch the movie from a news camera, and they see ... a hint. They do everything they can to protect the film and believe that they are the only ones who have a copy of this very public movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba is talking to a member of the President's staff. The PSM notes that there was no conspiracy. Cuba claims that more than one person was involved. The PSM then says the plot includes the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA. Gosh, I wonder if the PSM is involved. <br/> <br /> Ms. Archer, the First Lady, is a terrible artist. Cuba can not make a picture and says: "You are too close ... step back ... look from a different perspective, look from my perspective." Can someone miss this hint?
