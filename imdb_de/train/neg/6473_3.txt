As a child, the first part ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was full of great characters, songs and a funny family movie. After about a week I saw this movie for the first time. I think this movie was like most sequels and did not surpass the original. I think I might feel that way because I had high expectations and grew up. It is not a bad movie though. <br /> <br /> It starts when Ariel gave birth to a beautiful child, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (Eurselas' sister) and build a large wall around their house on the sea. As Melody grows up, she wonders outside the walls where she can not go. Anger is noticeable as Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give a movie, so you have to see it to find out. I liked that the voices are the same and again wonderful vocals. I think that this is a good family movie, but overall!
