Having seen the 2004 Canadian / Icelandic / British production of "Beowulf & Grendel", which I thought was brilliant and stunning, I approached this - the first of three recent Beowulf films to be released this year Concerns. As soon as I heard "Viking" and saw the horned helmets, I groaned. These were the Swedes and Danes from the time of migration, not the Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to demolish your helmet and persuade you). Then there is the Hrolfgar Palace, which looks like a location for a film about Greece or Rome and not for Denmark from the 6th century. The swords and armor look like props from previous films from different historical eras. I've spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in the "Kingdom of Heaven," and one character even wore a Windlass Steelcraft's Reproduction Movie Sword from "Beowulf & Grendel"! Apart from the basic plot of the original epic, the writing was bleak and the acting completely wooden and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a crossbow for a secret weapon, complete with a riflescope and exploding bullets that looked like something had been bought by Iraqi insurgents. The monster with special effects and its mother were so prone to steroids that Beowulf could never tear off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thanks to the gods for the bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I will not.
