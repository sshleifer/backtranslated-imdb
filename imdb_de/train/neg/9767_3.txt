I think if you're interested in the '60s, then you're bound to spend about 80 minutes of your life observing this barely observable train wreck. The achievements of this curiosity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on the values ​​of the sixties, as well as a number of relatively well-known actors caught in early (and embarrassing) footage. It's as if Laugh-In's producers decide to write a full-length film that covers all the highlights (and more) of the problems between the flower children and the farm, and then put them in the hands of some hippies and gave them a $ 10,000 budget to complete it. Hardly a classic, but in its own way it captures how strangely that time was, the stupidity, the over-idealism and the constipation of the establishment. Of course not for everyone.
