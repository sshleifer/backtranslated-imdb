"Happy Go Lovely" has only two things to offer. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British version (Excelsior Films) of an M-G-M musical with second-tier stars. I could imagine that Vera-Ellen took on this role and said that she could eventually make her a great musical star. But I am sorry to say that Mrs Ellen's chance has not paid off. <br /> <br /> With a horrible Scottish number opening and stumbling through a dreadful dialogue to the next boring sound, this movie seems very cumbersome to be sloppy. The predictable, erroneous identity plot is very thin and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is far superior in his role as a producer) and Bobby Howes (who is completely wasted in a non-role) the rest of the cast is completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> The choreography is boring, but Mrs. Ellen gives everything. She was never as famous as most other music stars (and was not supposed to be, as she could not sing and even had a "dance dance" in some of her pictures.) But when she danced, it was just so adorable. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that this movie, which could have made her a star, did not give her the tools she needed to shine. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
