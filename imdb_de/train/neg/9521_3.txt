This movie has been playing a lot on HBO or Cinemax lately. The reason is that they assume that people would be interested in comparing it to the capsule of the same name by Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks. The only reason is the attractive Matt Lattanzi. Tasty Although I have to say that Matt was more than a little long time to play a high schooler. If he was a woman, they would have let him play the MOTHER of a high school! (Is it just me, or does his daughter look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh yes, the plot - who cares? Typical teen high jinx played by adults.
