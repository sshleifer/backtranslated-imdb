This is the kind of film that shows just how close French cinema is when it comes to making thrillers. The director's desire to "sound American" is so blatant that you will not be deceived a minute, unless you have not seen a serial killer movie "Peeping Tom" ever since. <br /> <br /> Two male cops (or one and a half, more like you'll see), terrible murders, a plot that's more complicated than complex. Charles Berling has no luck with the genre (See the astonishingly stupid "l'inconnu de Strasbourg" a few years ago.) The scenes with his pregnant wife, which are supposed to be a counterpart to the otherwise so tranquil atmosphere of the rest of the plot, belong Filmed to the worst ever. Add a hot love scene between them and a bloody autopsy to get a PG 12 and attract the huge youthful crowd. A violent and absurd conclusion, followed by a silent epilogue that could make a beautiful commercial for the CÃ´te d'azur. It's really the silence of the lame.
