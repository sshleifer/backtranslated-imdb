It was not remarkable enough to be really terrible, it was just incredibly lame. The story was not half bad, but the execution was just horrible. <br /> <br /> First of all, it was too fast for us to be emotionally involved in what was going on. It was just a bad pace. The dialogue was so incredibly sparkling, just flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And the characters, all cheerful, made Deadpool boring. How the hell are you making Deadpool boring? He was not even funny. He was not crazy. He was just an annoying guy with a few swords he did not even know how to use properly. <br /> <br /> Gambit was boring. And since when did he have a telein energy to levitate the cards and fly around or super power to jump hundreds of feet into the air? And what was wrong with all the stupid helicopter movements? I mean, we know they are mutants, but they still exist in the realm of physics. A round Bo rod is not a helicopter blade, you can not fly by whirling Super Duper fast. Which Gambit could not do anyway. Not Deadpool, especially when used as a substitute for real battle choreography. <br /> <br /> And this movie proves that wire work should only be used by combat coordinators who know that they work with WTH and know better than to use it in everyone. Single. Shot. as a substitute for real fight choreography. <br /> <br /> Three of the most physical fighters in Marvel comics (Logan, Creed and Wilson) and some of the worst fighting choreographies I've seen in recent movies. It was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged and left it to the special effect guys. <br /> <br /> And then you had the outbreak with all those mutants who did nothing. Even mutants who have been shown in their cells to have powers (nice to see a Quicksilver nod) did everything when they came out. Only Emma, ​​really lame for this movie - Frost and Cyclops - have done something. <br /> <br /> And since when was Logan so pretty? And the stupid: "The bullet takes his memory." Do not you think Xavier and the X-Men noticed the big frayed bullet holes in his Adamantium skull when they X-rayed him in X1? Liev Schrieber I'm sorry, he has indeed brought a good Sabretooth, if you consider the script. He made one of Marvel's simpler supervillain real. But he could not save the movie from his own epic lameness. <br /> <br /> Seriously, that was "Daredevil" -Lust. Decent story, good actor, absolutely terrible execution.
