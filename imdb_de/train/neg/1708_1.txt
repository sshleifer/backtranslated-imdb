OK, I really do not have a lot to say about this movie, apart from that: I've seen more than 4000 movies in my life, of which more than 2300 were horror movies. Although I have some difficulty deciding which is the best (unlike my favorite, which I can say is George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD), I can tell you without any hesitation that Todd Sheets ZOMBIE BLOODBATH The Absolute is The Worst Horror Movie I've Ever Seen. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything positive about this film. The acting, the dialogue, the direction, the make-up, the music ... Every aspect of this film is just so far below the acceptable range that it occurs to me that it was ever even released. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a horror or zombie movie executor, please pay attention to my warning and DO NOT waste your time with this garbage. It's no pleasure to see that. You will not even get a laugh from the total incompetence shown in the exhibition ... trust me. You're welcome.
