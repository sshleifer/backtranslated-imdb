I have already made a few reviews on IMDb and this movie is unique in that I have never seen the whole movie before. It was so dumb and listless that I just could not stand it - though I tried. In other words, the better your movie is, the less you see in the movie. Think about it - the producers and the young Frankenstein were great movies and he was not there at all. BUT, movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls are full of mel and are pretty stupid movies (yes, I do not like space balls - but that's not the place to talk about it). > Secondly, apart from cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I can not imagine a less funny topic than homelessness. This is just a comedy breaker. Think about it, folks. The FUNNIEST (?) Scene in the movie leaves Mel with Leslie Ann Warren in a dumpster whoopee !! And how is that funny?
