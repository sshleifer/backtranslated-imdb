What starts out as a gentle country yarn, unofficial and easily edible romantic stories change with tempo, as Edward Norton's initially charming Harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things turn to the scary, while the film gradually becomes a southern romance to a modern wilderness is changing west. <br /> <br /> An amiable rancher (Norton) moves into the city and enchants a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood), who apparently rescues her from her death with her bad-tempered father with a whirlwind romance. But it's beginning to become clear that this cowboy has more than he seems. Edward Norton? a real chameleon actor (with changing facial hair) playing a country hump, with a somewhat bleak accent, but perhaps because he's just trying to play the role without worrying about the accent. He certainly makes it easy to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about Harlan. However, with too many small changes, this means that we never know exactly where Harlan comes from, and what seemed to be good performance from Norton is beginning to get confused. Evan Rachel Wood is sympathetic, without really having much to do but hit Norton's eyelids. Down in the Valley turns out to be a bit of an uneven story because of its tempo change and never To really make clear the protagonist's motives, the audience's sympathy for the characters remains uncertain. Should we like this drifter or not? Even after a dramatic change, it remains unclear. This ambiguity is to the detriment of the movie, as if the author could not decide what kind of story she wanted to tell, and opted for something like a Hotch potch. If the movie stayed one way or the other, it might have been a solid movie, but leaving it what we have is a bit of a mess. Fans of the old-fashioned romance will enjoy a part of the film, but are deterred by the dark tone. Complete fans of Norton (or fans of the lush landscape of the San Fernando Valley) miss out on this.
