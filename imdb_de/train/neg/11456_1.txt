This is one of those films that makes you think: would Hulk "The Real American" Hogan have done the same? Honestly, I do not believe and he would have been right. I am Italian, I can not be proud of my country for many reasons, but I would not have ridden for another team (for example the French). In addition, the protagonist falls in love with the end of the film not in a British girl, but in a compatriot. Why row against Yale? When it comes to acting, all players act very badly. And then I hated the atmosphere of the "Dead Poets Society". In fact, I hate another movie.
