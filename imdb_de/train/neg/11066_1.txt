Before I saw Dahmer, I thought that no movie could be worse than Freddy Got Fingered. I was wrong. In summary, "Dahmer" is a story about a gay serial killer that almost does not kill, and almost exclusively consists of Dahmer's encounters with gays before they were killed. There is no conspiracy, and there is no use in telling us something about "Dahmer". All you learn about Dahmer when you watch this movie is that he liked to have sex with men. Terrible acting, terrible directing, terrible writing, terrible things ... If you have to decide to watch "Dammers" and throw up projectile for three hours, go with the vomiting ... it will be less painful .....
