Really a horrible movie. It is expected, however. Obviously a low budget: nothing so innovative, an actress (if you can call that what she calls a "drama"), who always has nude roles in a shower scene, a man in a reptile suit modeled almost like a predator Cabin in the woods etc. But there are some redeeming points. Although the story is not new, there are a few parts that are not so upset. For one, the black does not die when attacked (the first time) and he is not even one of the first to die. But that is insignificant. More importantly, there is a very interesting twist on Kats experiments and Wes & Steve that I did not see coming. When Steve Kat said he knew what she was doing, I believed what he said and what Kat answered. But when the creature revealed who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised by the novelty of the revelation. It may be that I have no experience with the genre or that it is a really clever twist. In any case, the movie is pretty bad and does not watch if there's something better ... unless you're in the mood for a cheap scifi movie.
