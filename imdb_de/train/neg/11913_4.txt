A good idea, poorly implemented. While this could sum up to 99% of the SciFi channel's films, this is really true. I love movies that are slowly revealing a good backstory, and I like action movies and I like all the main cast, so that could have been great. Despite the good acting, this film fails due to Bill Platts bad writing and governing. <br /> <br /> Another review has brought the good point that you need to know where you are going to get there. This movie does not work. It's so random that you know the words "second draft" are not in Bill Platts vocabulary. There is a scene that is completely unnecessary and can be removed without anyone noticing. This scene starts and ends with driving, so you can switch from one car scene to another and never miss the pointless scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> This film also had a strange habit of explaining some details as you explain others, some to the point where you can guess the entire "plot" in advance. It was also a habit to stop a fight early, probably because they could not afford it. There are also some ridiculously bad scenes revealing the "conspiracy" on a computer and the last fight with "toxic glue" (seriously, what is that *)?). If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, check out this movie because it is fine. She succeeds a few times in pulling herself out of her "Roswell" person and providing for a good, hard chick (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he has played in everything he's ever done since he played Q in ST: TNG, so it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> Overall, I rated this movie 4/10.
