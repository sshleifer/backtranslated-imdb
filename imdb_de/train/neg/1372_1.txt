I saw that on TV. I'm glad I did not go to the cinema to see it or spend the money on the rental. The film is absolutely predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner to the meandering electric cables. The action is really weak and incredible - the avalanche expert is struck by a 20-foot wave of bone-breaking avalanche (with current footage) and just has to get up and shake. The avalanche thunders at a million miles an hour and stops at the roadside. <br /> <br /> Part of the actual avalanche material is impressive and shows its devastating power. But the contract between the real avalanche and the staged makes this movie even flickerier. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, do not bother with this movie.
