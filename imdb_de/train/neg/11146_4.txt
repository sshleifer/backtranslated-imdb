No not true. It's not really a good movie, but it's not as bad as I imagined. I really did not feel like getting rid of my rent money, and sometimes that's all you can ask for. The plot is fine, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty. The direction is passable, but the effects are terrible, especially the werewolf effects, which are a big problem in a werewolf movie. There was a lot of nudity, which is a pretty good thing for me, but it was not so hot. All in all, it's a pretty average direct video, not the worst movie I've ever seen. If you get bored with a genre fan, drop by. I would even see it again. <br /> <br /> Bonus fact for horror freaks, Kane Hodder (in some of Jason Vorhees) plays the werewolf.
