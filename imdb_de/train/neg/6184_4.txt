A mindless film about a handsome, but mindless couple who decides to live their dream and take people on dive trips. The pair makes the wrong customer choice almost immediately and gets mixed up with some of the people trying to retrieve the items that fall to the bottom of the ocean during the opening credits sequence. A great view directly onto a video film could have been so much better if he was not so keen to look good in the first place. Performances are workable and the plot is not actually bad, or would the directors and producers not have been redirected to action that we see many well-formed people in bathing suits (or I guess the reason for the "unrated") "moniker a few fugitive nudes Breasts.) The film never creates tension and does not go beyond the level of a memorable television movie, so if you're ready to see it, do not squint your eyes, as the feast of the eyes is pleasant, but we need to stop the producers from doing so Making films that are excuses for a paid vacation.
