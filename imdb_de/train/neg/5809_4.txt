I can not understand why filmmakers make this film new. <br /> <br /> The 1972 movie with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was a great actor and Baldwin is just an inadequate actor. He has no passion in his game. Also the action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It's almost boring, though filming was more difficult in 1972 than it was in 1994. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how Baldwin is from Mexico. I think that's a mistake in the story. <br /> <br /> So I think that there was no need to make them new, or if they decided to make a classic new, they must choose a great actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
