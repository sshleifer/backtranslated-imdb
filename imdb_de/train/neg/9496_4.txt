A little romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about the loving relationship that grows between a handsome hippie (Kay Lenz) and a real estate agent in Los Angeles in his golden years (William Holden, surprisingly gracious in this tanned arrangement). The script is easy, but not without pensive passages. Nevertheless, the scenario is now so middle clich√© that most of the picture appears pueril. It may have worked much better with other leads: Holden and Lenz do not go well together (their stature is so small that they seem to surprise them) that their intimate scenes are less exciting than uncomfortable. Dated, blurry-romantic and mostly unthinkable. ** from ****
