"Shinobi" is one of those films that believes the mere scrapping of a character automatically brings an impression of gravity or emotion into the story. In order for the audience to really care about the people dying, you need to develop the characters. Otherwise, you have only a series of arbitrary acts of violence. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONES of characters that all die. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you do not bother to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least do that to make them plausibly die, right? Nope. Here we have a war between two Ninja clans, and neither side really knows why they are fighting each other. They kill themselves because the Emperor says so. But even as it becomes apparent that the Emperor wants to see ALL of them dead, they still refuse to give up their mindless missions. That's no stubbornness ... that's just stupid. <br /> <br /> Fine, good! There is no character development, and the plot does not provide reasonable grounds for the fight. At least they die in cool action scenes, right? NO again! In fact, many fights are not even fights: super-ninjas, who have spent so much time and effort on the film, die suddenly (and in my opinion lame). I'm talking about things like "Lalala, I'm going down and I- * neck is cut *." THE END for this character. Even in the middle of the movie, I threw up my hands in frustration for ridicule.
