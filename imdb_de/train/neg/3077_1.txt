Hobgoblins ... what a concept. Rick Sloan was a master in this movie. He had the brilliance to produce a movie with actors who could not act. He also decided to write a script based on a bad acid trip that went seriously wrong. If you put it together, you'll get a movie that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and vacuum cleaners. This movie was very painful. The pain is approximately equal to the pain caused by cutting out the genitals with a spoon and then covering the entire wound with salt and hydrochloric acid.
