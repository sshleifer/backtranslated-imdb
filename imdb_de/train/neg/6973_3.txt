I never knew this movie existed until I found an old VHS copy of it hidden deep in my dusty horror cabinet. The title on the box was "Insect" and the illustrations on the back made it clear that it was another insignificant and badly produced horror movie of the 80s. Of course they can certainly be fun as long as you do not expect an intelligent scenario and you will not be irritated when you see a huge amount of gaudy makeup effects. Almost every aspect that makes a horror film worth seeing is inferior here in "Blue Monkey"! The plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal, the plays are painful to watch and there is a total lack of tension. Following the ever-popular trend of "big bug" movies, "Blue Monkey" deals with a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital. The manufacturers could not move out of the actual origin of this gigantic oversized Critters! All we know is that it does not come from outer space and it's originally crawled out of a tropical plant. Besides, there is absolutely no explanation of where this new insect type suddenly comes from! As I said, do not hope for an intelligent script. The first half of the movie is entertaining enough, with some nice bleeding and the introduction of a pair of jumbled characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!), But the second half (when the entire hospital is quarantined) is terribly boring. It's also nearing the end that "Blue Monkey" is beginning to exaggerate older (and better) movies. As they neared the climax, they apparently also had the budget, as the lighting gets very bad and the guy in the monster suit is not so well camouflaged anymore. "Blue Monkey" is worth a look if you are really bored or really want to see every 80's horror movie. Fans of B-Cinema can recognize John Vernon ("Killer Klowns from Outer Space", "Curtains") in the small and meaningless role of Roger, who is responsible for the clinic.
