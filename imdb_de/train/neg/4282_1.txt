I just can not understand why all these relics from the time of Ceausescu do not want to let go. You can clearly see how frustrated they were during the Commie censorship, which forbade them to show so many things in their films, and now they imagine they do not know what a great artistic-farty freedom provide people with defecation, urination, vomiting. cuss and any other conceivable abomination. THIS IS NO CINEMA, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! This is just a visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, David Lynch, Forman and Neorealism and other filmmakers who could work with an ugly aesthetic. These people dominated their jobs - well, not you! Do us a favor, all you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other outdated classic cars, and leave us alone! It's time to see some Romanian movies on screen, enough with your immature terribilisms! They are not directors, they are ILLITERATE !!!
