I recently caught a part of GEORGE 2 on TV, but I did not see it through to the end. Just awful! I can not even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not the George and Ursula of the first movie, which was bad enough. There's a lot of scrambling, but the direction and the editing were as meager and choppy as if you saw outtakes or deleted scenes. Having the monkey's original voice was not nearly enough to warm me up. GEORGE 2 is probably the worst sequel I've ever seen, and that says something. Jeez, due to the 10-line rule of IMDb I have to keep typing, if I do not have to say anything else about this krapulastic TV sequel. Disney, shame your head.
