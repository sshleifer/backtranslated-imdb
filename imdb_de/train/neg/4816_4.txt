I imagine the young people involved in the creation of "Necromancy" (aka "The Witching" and a few other titles) felt a little bit weird when they were on set of a horror movie with the man, who was with John Houseman in the production of a proletarian play ("The Cradle Will Rock"); scared people to think that aliens would invade ("The War of the Worlds"); and directing and starring in the biggest movie ever ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Welles starred in a third-rate movie about a satanic cult. <br /> <br /> There is basically nothing creative about this movie. A lot of nudity, but the background music is always very distracting. Even if the film was not very predictable, it was still not worth seeing. How deep had Welles sunk? Fortunately, for the last thirteen years of his life, he has been documenting the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about the Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940s) and has moderated the documentary "The Man Who Sees Tomorrow" (on Nostradamus). I recommend the two, but not these. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also with Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
