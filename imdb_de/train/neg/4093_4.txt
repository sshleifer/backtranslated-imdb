The plot and the characters are ridiculous and hardly qualify as "plot" and "character". The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, blurry and blurry. The fact that Fulci filled the whole movie with fog does not help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely bizarre and full of sex and violence. The inconsistencies are quite entertaining, one of the main characters says he has no friends, but he attacks the new man in a minute of screen time and has a whole bunch of women by his side. He shows his antisocial tendencies by arbitrarily placing an arrow in a poor guy who only cares about his own affairs! Images of blood or blood flow receive more attention than the characters, but what do you want from Fulci? , Maybe it ruined his career, but it was not really stupid than zombie. Is it worth a rental if you like bloody Italian films or are desperate for sword and magic or something bizarre? How do you sleep through someone being sucked into a pit 2 meters from your head and crying for help?
