The robber, imprisoned near Yuma, frees his chain gang and heads for the retired sheriff who is responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden gold reserve hidden thanks to the scriptwriter). The attempt to bring the Western genre up to date with violence and brutality in the style of the 1970s is not in the same league as in some of the new Western Westerns that appeared in the late 1960s. It is incredibly simple and angular, with the female characters just standing around as punching bags and possible rape victims. When the former sheriff is back in office, Charlton Heston gives one of his laziest, least inspired performances (he has a good time reading a letter and fumbling for his glasses). James Coburn, as a half-crazy hybrid, is pretty much geared up for autopilots, but Coburn has a way to turn even the hoarist dialogues and situations into something spiky and confusing. It's his whole show. * 1/2 of ****
