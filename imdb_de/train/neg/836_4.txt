A dedicated fan of TLK movies, with the first being a milestone and the second likely to be the best successor Disney has produced, along with this movie is nothing more than a Timon / Pumbaa screw in the TLK atmosphere. Although it is not bad, it does not add anything. Basically, this movie is a big joke ... and that's all that saves it. Make a real TLK3, Disney! The potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
