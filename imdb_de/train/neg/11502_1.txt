This movie is painfully slow and has no plot. It conveys the life of a group of dismissed boaters. One of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job. There may be some social commentary, but it is confused because no one is painted in a very sympathetic light. I do not understand why it had a 7.8 when I decided to look at it. I watched the whole boring thing and built expectations for a huge payout. No luck. The IMDb rating has always been so good for my liking. Everything over 6.5 was worth to be seen. <br /> <br /> And my wife says Javier Barem does not even look good in this movie. He is not my type, so my approval does not mean much. <br /> <br /> sigh. I give a 1.
