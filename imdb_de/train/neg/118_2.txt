This is supposed to be a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He was based on his life, but changed things to fit the characters who are detectives. These detectives date beautiful models and have no problem with it. Sounds more like a Millionaire Playboy filmmaker than a detective, right? The entire film was written by Peter and shows how little contact there was with real people. You should write what you know, and he actually did. And the audience remains bored and confused and jealous. This is a curiosity for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after the shoot. But Patti Hanson, who would marry Keith Richards in real life, was also a model like Stratten, but is much better and has a richer role. In fact, Stratten's part seemed forced; added. She does not have much to do with the story, which is quite complicated at first. All in all, every character in this movie is a person few people can identify with, unless you're a Manhattan millionaire and have beautiful supermodels. For the rest of us, it's an irritating snore party. That happens when you are out of touch. You entertain your few friends with inner jokes and endure the rest.
