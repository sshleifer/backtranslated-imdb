I noted with some amusement that at the end of the Detroit PD is thanked for their participation. The police chief even has a talking line that plays itself (and boy, you can say he can not act). The reason for the amusement is that in this film the police shoot first and ask questions later. Not the kind of PR, I would think a police would want it. Apart from that, this is your standard movie for cops and robbers, who was disguised for the 70s with a racial point of view. Alex Rocco gets a thankless role as police chief who gets stuck, and is saddled by a mentally ill woman. He makes up for it by staying at the local department store. Hari Rhodes is his nimble partner who has a groovy wardrobe and chases after suspects in the trench coat. The film continues until the penultimate firefight, which makes absolutely no sense (why take over people who are guilty only of a robbery, a whole police?). Not only do we see a shootout, but since there are four bad guys, we see four. Then there is a twist that lets one guess what would have really happened, but all I had to do was think how stupid it was. When I saw that director Arthur Marks was also behind Braindead "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown", I should not have been surprised.
