"Hak Hap" or "Black Mask" (in English) was a disappointment. I was told that it was a kind of "Japanese version of the Matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The movie was either badly dubbed or the soundtrack did not fare well with the movie. Another thing is that the dialogue was pretty bad. The English version of this film has been given very little thought, and he only addresses the "senseless plot". No movie I would see again.
