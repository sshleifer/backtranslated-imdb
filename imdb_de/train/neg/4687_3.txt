SPOILERS (although nobody was in the first two minutes of the movie) <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is really good at it as the friendly, lonely, emotionally disturbed loser Sy. He makes a very human, even sympathetic psycho, and really disappears in the figure - no trifle for such a recognizable performer. <br /> <br /> Too bad that the rest of the movie is such a waste. The supporting performances (and the performers) would not seem inappropriate for a soft-core porn (it does not help that every character, but Sy consists of 100% cardboard). At times, the director actually seems to thwart the tension: from the first moment we know a) that Sy is a total blast, b) that he survives and c) he is attacked by the police at the police end. All we have to think about is why and why, and the answers are not very interesting. <br /> <br /> The plot is cumbersome and invented and contains some nonsensical moments (for example: the husband scolds his wife for her expensive taste, even though she appears to be spending her spare time in the discount store.) About two-thirds of the way Sy, something so stupidly stupid that one wonders how much he really cares about his great revenge, and the final clich√©d explanation of his psychosis, straight from "Peeping Tom," is a terrible copout. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is the absolute worst, it's not overwritten or awkward or unbelievable or bad in any other way, which may be considered fun even for bad movie lovers, but instead each line is awfully functional - it is as if the director gave a story to a newspaper author and said, "Hey, I need an editable script - in an hour." Honestly I scream. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a throwback to the suburban thrillers of the 80's and 90's ("The Hand That Cradles the Cradle", for example) and though it's certainly uncomfortable, it's never really scary , Sometimes Sys fetishism makes you uncomfortable, but that alone is not enough to get the movie going. In the end, the lack of craftsmanship goes down from everyone involved except Robin Williams. 3 out of 10.
