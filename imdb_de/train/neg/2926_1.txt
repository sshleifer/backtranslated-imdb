It seems that there is a curse when it comes to gay cinema. Happy endings are not very common. Excluding beautiful things, gay movies tend to end in broken relationships or premature death. And some, like Come Undone, just end ... period. <br /> <br /> The creators of this horrible piece of nonsense have one or two things to learn to know the plot, the direction and the schedule. I was a bit confused within the first ten minutes of this movie, and more so after the first glimpse of Jeremie Elkaim's character, who had a small psychological session. It seems that this film has been assembled randomly, without any attempt at continuity or consistency. There is no real way to tell if you are looking at the gift or a kind of ethereal flashback. I could only take so much before it really became unsightly. Stephen Holden of the New York Times called this film "... shimmeringly beautiful and absolutely real". Well, it seems that Stephen has been investing in beer glasses before looking, as this is far from being pretty. Because of the praise that this film received, I expected something worth seeing. Unfortunately, the film has reached its title. And at the end of the movie (which offered no solution at all, I could add) it's obvious that the authors, the director and the movie all have Come Undone.
