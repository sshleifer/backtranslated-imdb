This movie was made with really bad taste. The script was really bad. I'm really sad for the late Gregory Peck, who took the title role of this B-movie adaptation of one of the greatest generals in history. The film was politically incorrect and absolutely insensitive to the others who had fought against the Japanese during the Second World War. There was a scene where I almost vomited. He showed Macarthur in a bunker on the island of Corregidor, as he spoke with the troops like a seasoned politician a wounded one-legged Filipino soldier. The bleeding and dying soldier manages to sit up straight at the sight of the general and says, "No dad, no mom, no uncle Sam" and Macarthur keeps his little nonsense that the Americans would never leave the Philippines. The scene ends with the soldier being strengthened by Macarthur's words and gives him a smart greeting. I mean, if there was a more condescending scene depicting the US as the great white savior of the world, please tell me, because she's taking the cake. It turned out that Filipinos are girls in need, who have no honor and have to rely on the big Americans. The contributions of members of USAFFE (United States Armed Forces of the Far East) were obvious and intentionally overshadowed. These are Filipino volunteers who were integrated into the US military during World War II and along with the Americans fighting the Americans, Japanese who walked side by side with Americans on the death march of Bataan and defended the island of Corregidor died, by launching a guerilla offensive after Macarthur left for Australia with his famous "I'm coming back" speech. My late grandfather, a World War II Filipino veteran and USAFFE soldier, was one of many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for their homeland. I think that this film does not honor them and the thousands of others that Macarthur has landed for the preparation of the intelligence services for his famous return to Leyte Bay.
