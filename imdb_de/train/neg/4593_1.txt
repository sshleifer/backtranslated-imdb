As a physics student, I became aware of many idiotic professors and other so-called experts in the field. As I study, I am learning more and more about real physical experiments and about the people who are doing the right things. <br /> <br /> Then my friends tell me about this "physics movie" wants to see. Not knowing anything about it, I'm excited and hope the information is well presented. <br /> <br /> I did REAL quantum mechanics; That was not it. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with the assumption that everything that happens to a subatomic particle can and will come to you if you only open your eyes. Let us think about it for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies consist of about 10 ^ 30 such subatomic particles. That's one billion billion billions of particles! The "more mysterious" quantum effects of only two particles can have a 50% chance of canceling each other out. Adding more and more particles to the mix will make it nearly impossible to get a large net quantum result. To tell us that this is a valid assumption and there is no reason behind it ... it is stupid. My friend, also in physics, and I counted 3 facts in the course of this film. But they were presented in the most misleading way I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not say that much for the neural part of the film because I did not have any medical training. It seemed he might have had a bit more truth than he remembered my days in biology, but I can not say it. At least that movie had a redeeming quality: the dancing peptides (or whatever) they were actually scene. The priceless action that drives this movie does not ruin it, but the main character goes to a wedding where she sees all kinds of personalities being "driven" by her peptides *, and then the movie goes to the dance floor where we put together be between dancing people, sometimes surrounded by CG peptides, and a completely CG scene with dancing peptides. At the time, the movie was trying to tell us how we are "addicted to emotions," so we're going to treat that hit song "Addicted to Love" with the full song. <br /> <br /> This scene was redeeming because anyone who could go THAT scene and still take this movie seriously ... Well, they are the ones who have to "open their eyes".
