I love memoirs of a geisha, so I read the book twice. It's one of the best books I read last year. I was looking forward to the movie and feared that reading the book would ruin the viewing enjoyment of the movie. I did not expect the movie to be that bad. Part of the best part of the book was omitted from the film and the characters were weak, with Hatsumomo (Li Gong) being the worst. If I did not read the book, this movie would be a bit confusing and inexplicable. The plot outline of the film states, "Nitta Sayuri reveals how she went beyond fishing ..." Did anyone see how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri? Forget the movie and read the book.
