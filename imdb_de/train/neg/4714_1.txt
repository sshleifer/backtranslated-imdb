I really want to nullify this piece of GARBAGE. Unfortunately, there are none. So I had to forgive a 1 just to warn you how stupid and horrible this cheater of a well-known cartoon really is! The characters look like they were drawn by preschool children, no, wait, I've seen preschool kids do it better! I prefer "Adversity of Flapjack" to this horrible excuse for a cartoon! I'll probably say what others said, two words: RIP OFF !! Do you remember this episode of Dexter's Lab as they raced with go-karts on this volcano? Yes, Mister Fellows even paid for this idea and failed! They even demolished Shadow Lugia in this one episode in which Pokemon was parodied (he even made money with this franchise!) This one character is a cheap rip-off of Mandark from Dexter's Lab! Mr. Fellows must be sued for legal offenses because of this bitch !! Everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who like the Johnny (RIP-OFF) test are just lying to you. Do yourself a favor, change the channel when this rip-off tries to embarrass your screen!
