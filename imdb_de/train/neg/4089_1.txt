Attention: This review contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Notice, I said "almost". This is nothing but many random scenes that are strung together in a loose attempt at a story. The protagonists (NEVER call them "heroes") shoot innocent bystanders for their food and steal it for similar reasons. There is also a lot of homoeroticism, which was a departure for me. (SPOILER: It seems that the villainy (who is just topless and not naked, as other reviews claim) is killed prematurely, but miraculously recovers and tortures another 70 minutes of torture. Abuse occurred multiple times in this cinematic abomination If you are in an MST3K mood, you may find this watchable, but for the most part, you may forget it - borrow the original Conan DVD instead.
