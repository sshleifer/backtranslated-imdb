THE. WORST. MOVIE. JE. MADE. <br /> <br /> After seeing this supposedly gay movie, I guessed someone had rolled a half-blind neo-Nazi into a brain and made him make the worst gay movie of all time. I had to stop the movie and call a friend to come here just to complain to someone when I stopped the film from shock, disbelief and indignation at such a stupid thing the horrible writing and acting and illogical and stupid act, it's just one badly made movie. A dog with a Handycam tied to the tail could be warmed up better. After reading the few positive reviews that this movie has here, I suspect the author must have half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says that this film can even be considered something other than a joke is a liar or is being paid heavily to say it.
