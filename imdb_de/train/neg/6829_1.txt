I have written at least half a dozen scathing reviews of this vile little movie and none is being published. So I think somebody at imdb.com really likes this horrible movie. The idea that a bunch of oilmen can revive a military tank that has been stationed in the desert for over a decade and turn it into a fighting machine is ridiculous. Such is the action and the direction. Pass it on.
