If this movie was written in a direction and produced with the intention of creating a classic of the bad movie, it could (I say) have been a hit. Have you ever seen a movie that was so terribly horrible that it fascinates about its mistakes? Well, that's it. Each actor should be nominated for the worst acting award. It would be difficult to find another movie with such a production budget that has so little value. The whole, from the first scenes, contradicts the logic. The dialogue is absolutely incredible and illogical. The same applies to the behavior and general history of the film. What's really amazing is that some buffoons in a boardroom have actually decided to spend money on this piece of garbage. Impressive.
