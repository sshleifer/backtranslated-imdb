WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS LIGHT SPOILERS <br /> <br /> There is a parallel universe in which Gone In 60 Seconds is a dark, edgy, controversial independent film. Unfortunately, Gone ... is a conspicuous, vacant testosterone moron festival starring Nicolas Cage. <br /> <br /> For reasons that are not worth getting into, he and his large number of cronies have four days to steal fifty expensive cars, only one of which has an alarm. This crew consists of the guy with the funny-shaped ears, who is rumored to be the new Superman; a man who ran electricity in The X-Files; a former professional footballer and two black men. <br/> <br /> Their enemies are policemen, rival car thieves and bilborough crackers. His Manchester accent is adequately flattened for American viewers, accustomed to this sort of habit, and has been broadening things since Daphne in Frasier. There is also Angelina Jolie, who gets no character; besides being a vessel for the sexual desires of men. She and Cage are said to be old flames, which is strange as they never approach a normal conversation throughout the 135-meter film's runtime. <br /> <br /> In fact, the characterization is so bad that it always is Everyone has a "moment" played by a violin in the background to emphasize the "emotion". It's not a spoiler that reveals that Vinnie Jones (who recreates his famous "handball" maneuver by Paul Gasgoine and is quite threatening in silence) only gets one line; Not because his inability to speak is an integral part of the plot, but because it is a witty summary of the dubious morality of the film after it appeared dumb. Allegedly. After fighting his way through London's "not-quite-drama-but-it-do-do-do" day, Cage jokes, "I always thought you were from Long Island." My ribs were, as you might imagine, well tickled. <br /> <br /> In fact, humor is the least developed aspect, from the tactless comedy cop to the two black characters. Here's the biggest aspect of Hollywood; Why can not a black man appear in a big movie without constantly being aware of his skin tone and endlessly referring to it? The younger man, who, like the older one, is always having Jive conversations, announces, "We blacks do not like the cold ... we are tropical people". Then he expresses the urge to smoke a joint and observe roots. Of course he parodies the image of the blacks, but how weird is that? His older colleague can not speak without referring to himself and thus to his color in the third person. "My black ass" this, "my black ass" that. Does anyone know black people who actually speak like that? Did not think so. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the movie is played almost continuously and with increasing volume some of the tracks - especially Apollo 440's "Do not Stop The Rock" - are so loud that they are actually more audible than the sound effects and the dialogue. The surround sound system separates the two so much that they sound like two different films running together. No background music concept, it's the tonal equivalent of trying to watch a movie while someone in the back of the cinema has their music turned up. "Keep the music quiet, young man!" <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie in the world and in many ways I liked it. It's just predictable, lazy and funny, with minimal construction effort. Apparently, the expectations for the box office for this film are very low. After the garbage was force-fed for several years, it seems that the general public is aware of this fact.
