Flame in, flame out. This seems to be Gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature that can take it and hand it out with equal abandonment. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster movies, but I've decided to watch all of Mill Creek / Treeline Films' fifty movie DVD sci-fi collection. It's a great value at about twenty-five dollars, fifty cents a movie, it's really an investment in time to see some of the stupid offers of a nuclear strike, and he's not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes it out with Tokyo and sets the United Nations on the move to try to come up with a plan to save the planet. You arrive at 'Plan Z', the hope of the world, and if you do not know it, there is a scene showing a huge shed called 'Z-Plan' building. That was a nice gesture. <br /> <br /> Until the mid-1960s, this country was still not entirely politically correct. In one of the American military scenes in the Alaskan air defense sector, General Arnold has asked a sergeant to make coffee. I guess there were no private people nearby. <br /> <br /> But good old Gammera was a good sight. He walked on two legs and sought the flaming throwing routine when he was challenged. So it surprised me that Plan Z managed to catch the turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden spaceship and take him to Mars to save the world. All-around high five for the American and Russian team, which carried out the rescue. Now we come back to the Cold War. <br /> <br /> Like Godzilla, Gammera has produced at least a dozen or so films but has pretty much seen this movie. Much of my interest in flying, flaming turtles satisfies my interest. Especially since the DVD pack, which I mentioned earlier, "Attack of the Monsters" has recorded with a guest appearance of the Big G. It took everything I had to go through to the end of both films; It was such a relief to get to the last frame in this picture, which says, "Gammera, Sayonara!"
