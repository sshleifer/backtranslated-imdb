I hate to be the one who rains in a parade (even a little one like this one), but from the first scene you could say that this movie would be absolutely crappy. It's really a shame because I really like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was curious how they would mix together in a movie, but to my dismay they did not even have a scene together !! I think I have to repeat that again - the two main actors (standing next to the billboards and DVD covers) did not have a scene together !!!! They did not talk to each other and were never on screen at the same time. Summarize this bad apology for a movie. Wrong advertising. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, every character in the film was unrealistic and inhumane. The scenarios were far-fetched, the plot was crap, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried to be funny (and played a poor Tim out of the office), nobody was sympathetic, and worst of all, some of the characters were annoying that it was me almost put you off because I could not stand watching or listening. <br /> <br /> This low budget stinker was an epic bust. Even Danny Dyer could not bring in a bit of humor and charm, but bless it, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> How anyone would classify this film as a "ten stars" is a mystery to me. Ten stars serious? Come on ... I will not even give ten of the sizes ten stars, because ten stars indicate that a movie was perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, which meant that it was almost completely dark. <br /> <br /> Look at it if you want, but if you've seen a lot of movies and seen a lot of great movies, your review will probably be similar to mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
