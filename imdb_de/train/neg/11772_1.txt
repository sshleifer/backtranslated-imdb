I'll be short ... This movie is an embarrassment to anyone but his cameraman. The fact that it is a critique of the sex tourism industry seems to be valid until we are "treated" by a boring dance scene. It's ridiculous that no one but the most passionate fan of BAD horror will get anything out. And for the love of God, please stop saying that this movie is a story of lost innocence or even of female empowerment, because it's clearly not (foolish lesbian kids, what the hell?). This was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh Festival (which I've seen anyway), someone broke even half of the movie, probably because he could not take it anymore. This may sound like a supercritical song, but I really can not find salvation in this movie unless you consider it a pure comedy. In short, this movie is best viewed on a cocktail of A-medications.
