I really wanted Julian Po very much. I think Slater is undervalued as an actor and that many of the supportive players here are better than they can be shown in this movie. I realize that this is based on a short story that I did not read. So I do not know if what I see as a flaw of the movie was made in the story or imposed by the director / screenwriter. The premise is wonderful, and I loved the voiceover, the confessional that the opening speech beats. But then...? Nothing! Some of the clich√©d local characters ask Julian Pointblank for his intention to commit suicide. It could be argued that he does not answer because it is none of their business. But Julian is the one who expressed his intentions in public with only slight pressure. Then neither Julian nor the director / writer seems to be anything beyond the sparse initial information about Julian's life, despite the fact that the Julian character keeps a journal for God's sake. He says he was an accountant. He says his family moved as a father because of his job. So what? There are various interactions with the locals that seem to illuminate Julian's purpose. But none of them goes anywhere, for Julian seems to regard all those stupid natives as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the last (and only) sensible one among them. This could work as an allegory if Julian Po had certain qualities or something that could come close to wisdom. Nearest he can reveal something about himself, in the scene in which he deliberately humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. And what this scene reveals is nothing that could lead Julian to empathy. I can only see the Julian character as selfish, petty and totally condescending. Somehow the director's attitude fits this half-baked, invented film. And poor Michael Parks, an actor who once promised so much, has no business here.
