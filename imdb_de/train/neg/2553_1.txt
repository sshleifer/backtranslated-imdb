Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else can I say? Kate Jackson absolutely must have directed. Maybe she should go back to acting ... the second thought that she was a bad actress. Who would invest money to produce something bad? I like anti-Christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the strange fear, but this is just bad bad. Acting stars was worse than what you find in a soap opera. The special effects, if you can call them that, are ridiculous. It would not surprise me if you play the scenes in slow motion and see the tubes from which the blood comes out. We had to turn off the disc after only 30 minutes. These so-called films should destroy original prints, destroy all floppy disks and tapes, and all those involved in producing the film must repay money to the people who rent the film. Then these people are never allowed to shoot, steer or film anything other than their own films.
