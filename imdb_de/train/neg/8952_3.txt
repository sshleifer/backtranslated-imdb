Having heard of George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece for my entire life, I'm now 37 years old, but after never reading the book, I'm totally confused about what I just saw. <br /> <br /> I'm very familiar with the terms of the novel, as I'm sure most are, but only by hearsay and quotes. Without this limited knowledge, this film would have been a complete mystery, and even so I'm still not better informed about the story of 1984 than I was before I saw it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side. .. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton deliver great performances, and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully bleak and desolate. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film. Now for the downsides, and there are a lot ... <br /> <br /> There is a war, at least as far as the propaganda goes, but why and with whom? Nothing is explained. There are some familiar names (Eurasia etc) but they do not mean anything without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what does he do? Where does he comes from? where does he work? Why is he changing the news? Why is not he at the front? Why does not he eat the food in the canteen? What's that drink he drinks throughout the movie? Why is he so weak and sick? Why is not he brainwashed like everyone else? What's the deal with his mother and sister? What happened to his father? A little background story would have been nice, no scrubbing. This is essential for those who have not read the book. Without them, this is just a confusing and hard-to-follow art-house movie in which you constantly think about what's actually going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack has been decoupled and badly edited and the constant chatter from The Big Brother screens are flooding the dialogue in places, making it even harder to figure out what's going on. I accept that this could have been an artistic decision, but it is still very annoying. <br /> <br /> I also know that this has already been mentioned, but why all the nudity? It just seemed completely unfounded and felt like it had been thrown in there to compensate for the lack of plot coverage. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can not hold myself as Hollywood thinks it would have to explain the lines of the story these days for word. We are not all brainwashed, but this is a few steps too far away. I can only imagine that it is based entirely on the fact that you have read the book. If this film is really the "literal translation" I've seen many people say, it would be hard to understand why 1984 is celebrated. The classic is it. <br /> <br /> It is undeniable that it was light years ahead and predicted pretty much every change in our society so far (maybe this was some sort of bible for the forces that be?), but many science fiction writers have done the same, leaving no gaping holes in the storyline. <br /> <br /> I think I have to do what I should have done from the beginning, and buy a copy of the book if it makes sense to me. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointed with something I've been waiting for for years.
