Before I saw this movie, I would have said that I loved everything Kathy Bates did. Now it's all minus one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his acting. Someone should have told him that "poor" is not synonymous with dirty, neither ignorant nor clich√©d. Ditto for Randy Quaid's stereotyping. The only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas, who is not a strong actor to carry this mess. If you enjoy the land, you will enjoy the scenery. That's the best I can give. <br /> <br /> I'm a serious fan of independent and whimsical movies, but that's just awful.
