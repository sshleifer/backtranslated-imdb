How did this crap stay on TV for so long? It is terrible. I want to shoot someone. It's so wrong that it's actually worse than a science fiction movie of the 1940s. I'd rather have a stroke than watch that nonsense. I remember how I saw it when it first came out. I thought, hey that might be interesting, then I found out how absolutely, insane, ridiculously stupid it really was. It was so bad that I actually pulled out my pocket knife and put my hand to the table. <br /> <br /> Please people, stop seeing these and all other reality shows, they are the garbage that bothers the networks and cancel the quality programming, which requires some consideration.
