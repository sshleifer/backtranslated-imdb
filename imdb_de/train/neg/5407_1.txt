If you want to see a real "quality movie", you can access the Eden Formula. This wondrous movie must have cost $ 50 each. It has paper-thin writing, pathetic sets, lighting and camerawork, and a stop-motion, a paper mache monster that's absolutely ridiculous (it looks like they sometimes have a guy in a rubber suit and / or a hand puppet for) the camera uses monsters - but they were all terrible). <br /> <br /> The actors all speak as if they have never seen them and read a teleprompter. The special effects are far beyond lousy. And the only sad thing is they've dropped the really funny original title 'Tyranasaurus Wrecks', which sums up exactly what you get for the entire 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This happens when you scratch the bottom of the computer barrel so hard that you break through to the underlying raw material. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed every minute.
