This rather formulaic film about swords and flying fists is a decent early account of John Woo's talents. The cinematography is excellent and some of the swordwork is really remarkable. Unfortunately, the film is under the load of a boring story and an incredibly low budget (check out some of the fight scenes if you doubt me). Nevertheless, it is worth seeing, especially if you catch mailboxes.
