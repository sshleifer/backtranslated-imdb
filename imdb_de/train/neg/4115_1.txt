"Power Play" starts interesting, but goes downhill quickly. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small role. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" has no redemptive value or interest. "Power Play" will have more earthquakes in a few days than California in a year. The earthquake scene in the mall is so incredible and completely unimaginable. And all the action scenes look like a bunch of third students doing a play. It's awful, just terrible. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If "Power Play" was made in the 60s or 70s, it would be considered a bad movie of the "B" class. The fact that "Power Play" was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there something like a movie of the "D" class? If this is the case, "Power Play" throws the shape.
