Wowwwwww, about an hour ago I finally finished this horrible movie !!! I wanted to switch it off in the first ten minutes, but I figured I'd give it a shot because it was just better. Or at least have some redeeming qualities, as I at least thought it would be a movie that makes you think, or like a really smart movie, or very well filmed or something ... Needless to say, that was not the case and me wasted about an hour and a half of my life. I will not even go into why it's horrible because it's a waste of my time to explain that this may "contain spoilers" ... IMDb, you should calm down on the spoiler business and more make sure that people take care of it. Rate the movies and comments are not paid to write good reviews or somehow get involved in the movie or something else. I thought it would be fun after this horrible movie to see how bad the review would be and I was very shocked to see the pretty high ratings ... All reviews with about 7-10 stars must be clear something COMPLETE DIFFERENT acting movie ... I'm still a big IMDb fan, but think this review process seriously, as this movie should not be rated higher than maaaybbbeee's like a 3.
