Warning: It contains spoilers. When a movie starts with a sex scene, it's a bad movie. (see, for example, 300). This confirms the above lemma. The second scene forms the center of all actions. The fact that we know the end makes the movie boring. Moreover, other actions are revealed when the story goes back and forth several times. And that made me more frustrated. To compensate for the resulting lack of tension, we learn more and more about how unbalanced the characters are. And oh yes, they have a lot to show. Andy (P.Hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, more ?, he cheats on his wife, more ?, he wants to rob his father, more ?, his wife cheats on his brother more ?, he does not regret his complicity to death his mother, more ?, he is a serial killer, more? etc etc is not enough space to write here ... I wonder how he could have a top job. And why his wife did not leave him before. On the other hand, I enjoy the performances of the actor Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Again, PSH saves what's left of my $ 7 spent on this absurdity. Why absurdity? Because it does not make sense, why should I care about the despicable characters? Another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic (at least pleasant) character. <br /> <br /> It is also a lot of sentimentality, for example, we should take care of the case of the widowed father without knowing anything about the life of the parents before the crime.
