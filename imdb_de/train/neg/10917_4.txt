I'm a fan of Columbo, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very poor. The original conspiracy plot was obvious and could have been suspected years before today's detective shows. But it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and "modern" electronics and, of course, the obligatory suburban humor that attracted modern art for sale. The high-tech house is a Jetson's or Disney's version of Tomorrowland, and it's fun to think of writers who invent these "way-out gizmos" of Columbo episodes. Nevertheless, we should be grateful for Cable TV that these episodes are aired.
