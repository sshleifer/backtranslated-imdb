I loved "Paris, Je T'aime" and eagerly awaited this movie. I admit that I came up with high expectations, but I was very disappointed for a number of reasons. A reissue of "Paris" in New York I expected the same structure. What I liked about 'Paris' was the dissolution of the neighborhoods. They have a sense of the style of each director and the story he wanted to tell. In 'NY' there is no clear separation of stories. At various points in the movie, characters from different stories are merging into each other, which confuses me, who I am watching, and what was going on. The change in direction was obvious, but confusing, as there was no flow. <br /> <br /> Another thing I loved about the Parisian movie was the different attitude of love. It was not all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, unfulfilled love, a lonely middle-aged woman who longed for love, etc., and explored so many layers of the complexity of love between people. "NY" just seemed to go for a nervous, exaggerated sexuality. There were some redeemable short films (the older couple who spent a lifetime together, Julie Christie's short), but overall, the movie 'NY' did not trigger any emotions for me. I did not associate with any of the characters as with 'Paris'. I remember seeing 'Paris' and deep sorrow, loneliness, yearning, hope, wonder ... he just had so much soul. For me there was no soul in the "NY" movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I would have been if I had gone into Paris without "Paris" in mind, a comparison that might have produced this film a more favorable answer, but as a self-titled repeat of 'Paris, Je T'aime 'I was very disappointed.
