Actually, I wanted to see this movie in the theater. It was actually sold out. Instead, I went to Solaris, the worst movie ever, released in 2002. Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a tough, strained "street pharmacist", freaks out when he sees one child is shot, so he decides to go clean and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). It seems to be going pretty well until Jack skips the city with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). This happened very late in the movie. If they had not shown this in the preview, this might have been an interesting twist. But they did, so it is not. <br /> <br /> Actually, there is not a single interesting thing about this movie; everything is given away in the preview. If you've even just previewed, you've seen the entire movie. Maybe you just want to think hard to fill in the gaps. Go to the website, download the preview and save â‚¬ 3.99. There is not a single surprise or twist in the movie, other than how awful the soundtrack is. <br /> <br /> I hope the one responsible for writing the soundtrack was fired. Twice. Most of it is what music would look like if the only songs that could be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets, and (I could destroy the fabric of the space-time continuum with such a disturbing concept) had less Talent and musical skills. <br /> <br /> The drama is bad at best, the script is at best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at best 67% Styrofoam and 33% Ziploc bags. You know things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was in The Pest!) Trumps the rest of the cast with his acting skills.
