It should be a parody of the LOTR trilogy. But that was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Bad drama, bad script, all bad. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I do not doubt for a second that there are people who like this sense of humor, but there were better parodies in films by acclaimed directors like Mel Brooks or the Zucker Brothers. I work in a movie theater and in the DVD shop, and the success of this movie was similar in both areas: in the movies, it was a nice (but not great) success in the first two weeks, but then when the reviews were read those who saw it were not so good, the movie fell off very fast. It was good for a short while on DVD sales, but nobody asked for it afterwards. For the past ten years, The Ring Thing and Torque have been the two worst movies I've ever seen. I can not decide which was the worse, but I am glad that there are so many good movies, so I do not have to think too much about this question.
