Forget Plan 9, this is the ultimate fiasco, a costume drama, inappropriate direction, script, drama, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allende's not so much better novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and the other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons, are really trying to overcome such a horrible screenplay. There are many mistakes (such as since when is snowing in Xmas in Chile?) And very cruel with tons of this evil called "magical realism". This is the worst movie ever. It's totally shit !!!
