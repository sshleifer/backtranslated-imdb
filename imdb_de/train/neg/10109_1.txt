BTK killer, Green River killer, zodiac killer; The man constantly puts out absolute garbage and the irony is, he loves his crap. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a Ulli Lommel movie before, but I was so amazed at how everyone thought his stuff was so horrible. As in the films I said at the beginning, six are not even the same size! After reading the comments, I was curious how bad this guy really is. He is the worst out there. <br /> <br /> The credits did not end when the wretched movie started, and I quickly realized that the sound was playing incredibly poorly. The processing is by far the worst. This movie made no sense and I could not endure it unbearably, as it would not end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie. I could not stand it anymore. I wasted 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK THIS CRAP!
