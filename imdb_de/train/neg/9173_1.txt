I have never seen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> It's possible to record a video game and make a decent movie out of it. <br /> <br /> Error 1: absolutely no connection to any of the characters. In this movie, you do not associate with the characters because ... you do not get a chance. <br /> <br /> The only character who is sympathetic or even interesting is the Deck Hand: Salish, as played by Clint Howard. Apart from this unique character, the result of the film is meaningless, since all characters were lifeless from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Mistake 2: The worst shooting combat scene ever. I love shootings. I love it when the heroes open up to the badguys and the clean house. Sometimes I even like to see a Badguy clean house. But this shootout was strange. I think the best way to describe it is "apathetic". I've seen people shoot more emotion and emotion while playing the VIDEO GAME. In this movie, it looked and felt like the "Actors" were just shooting through everything that moved without emotion. <br /> <br /> Why? Where is the garbage talking? Where is the growl of anger between the shots? It should be about children who were caught in a serious robbery ... but also real soldiers who act professionally and ruthlessly, show their humanity Monster I recommend Sam Ramis Evil Dead series. DO NOT see the disaster that is the House of the Dead. I hope they burn the master and all copies of this movie.
