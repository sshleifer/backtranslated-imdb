This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone has ever made. This is a typical 80s movie in which a man destroys the entire army alone. "First Blood Pt.2" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's "Commando", but there you killed Arnold the terrorist, while here you showed a certain nation as the bad guys. This film is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. It was the pinnacle of the Cold War, but I'm tired of seeing Communists or the Nazis as enemies. There are so many American films that have this one thing in common. Why can not there be a movie that shows Americans as enemies? Who will believe that a single soldier will destroy the entire army? Do you really think that such a thing really happened? As it stands, an average, brainwashed American viewer would surely be.
