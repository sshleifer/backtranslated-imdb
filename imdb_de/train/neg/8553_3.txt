This is actually a pretty bad movie. The ideology is not as perverted as in the films that Collins later made. My biggest concerns over the movie, however, are that it's implausible and frankly boring. The whole concept of a former SAS man, who for no particular reason is going to terrorists, is not very convincing and one can not wonder why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later become quite ignorant) fall for it. The film begins with a rather powerful scene, but then winds for a long time towards the grand finale. All in all, I think, who dares to win, could have been an interesting 45-minute episode of The Professionals, but the story does not contain a feature film. Although the film was reasonably successful at the time, this film ushered in the end of his career, which in the 1980s mainly made cheap and dubious lucky soldiers or army films. Too bad, because he is a pretty versatile actor, but at the end of the day, Martin Shaw has chosen his roles more carefully and his career is still successful.
