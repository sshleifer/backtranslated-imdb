This movie . , , I dont know. I will never know why they assume such an irresistible character as Pippi Longstocking and the uniquely charming Tami Erin would work. I'll never know why they spend money on the art genre and some not too bad special effects, so they do not work properly. Why the sets and costumes are sometimes in one period and sometimes bizarrely not, why did they commission SUCH bad songs, why does the script make no sense at all (not even on a stupid kids movie level)? , , , What did you think ?? Nothing about this movie is as it should be. Every single part is dubbed (and always bad), every sound effect is a bit wrong, every cut is in the wrong place, every performance is somehow bad. She manages to create a decent atmosphere despite all the problems, but NEVER captures the magic of Astrid Lindgren's creation.
