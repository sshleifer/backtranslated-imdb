Max had the V-8, Trace (Wheels of Fires Last and Only Hero) has a jet engine on the back of his car that allows him to make unintentional humorous faces as he shoots through the semi-desolate desert landscape. Let's surprise you when Mad Max 2 (also known as The Road Warrior) is dissected and put together as a new movie, even though it's filmed with bad actors and lousy stunts. Why is WoF in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? Simple was the Road Warrior! Actually, all questions can be answered: So it was in the Road Warrior! Aside from the mutant actors from the original 1960's The Time Machine movie, who make a cameo to give the audience some non-vehicular action that they can chew on for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Typically 80s fashion, all cars that are driven by bad guys who are pushed or slightly pushed explode in a huge explosion. Inevitably, all the chases happen near suitable cliff sides, and cars will inevitably fall off them. Along with this wild ride of the 80s, the general rampant misogyny is recorded in this style of cheap film. In general, I waited for Trace's rocket car to accelerate and shoot flames, so there was another shot that brought his face up, as if it should be hard, which proves to be stubborn. Badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this movie a real sinker. The unintentional humor value even manages to look thin. <br /> <br /> Council: Nights of Terror by Bruno Mattei is superior. And that says a lot for itself! This makes Texas Gladiators 2020 a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire. A bad Road Warrior offshoot that does not have nearly enough cheese to make the movie worth seeing. <br /> <br />
