Debbie Reynolds toe taps, tangos and yes, they make their way through this common thriller, which has a distinct 30's atmosphere. Two ladies brought together when their sons commit a murder attempt to start their lives by running a tap dance school for the smaller ones in Hollywood. The problem is, one of them is plagued by neurosis. Can you imagine that ten years ago, when Robert Aldrich staged Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette would never have given Joan so much time to compete with her stuff, and I can not imagine Bette playing Davis in the other role and her heart pounding. This is a pure piece of macabre, written by a downcast Henry Farrell (whose idea of ​​a good "shock" is to stage the mass murder of a group of rabbits). No ounce of honest fun in the whole lukewarm package. * 1/2 of ****
