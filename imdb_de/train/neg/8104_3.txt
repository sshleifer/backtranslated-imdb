Yes, a cheap shot, I know, but this film is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of "deepness" (political turmoil, love / lust) can be arbitrarily combined with great criticism (see also "American Beauty") , Kaufman's films and unsubstantiated sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialogue sequences (in one scene I counted three different "generic" European accents influenced by the actors), and the depiction of the state may run amok, but it does not connect them offered with the coherent meditation Kundera. and in his more than three hours he almost completely succeeds in embellishing the missing fourth piece of the triangle loving triangle, which lies at the heart of the action, and thus sacrifices the central mechanism of the novel to depict the emotional spectrum of power relationships that exist in love affairs receive. It also does not even contain the screen for Tomas Sohn used in the novel to illustrate some of the political issues that Kundera made in the novel. In combination with the excessive soundtrack, these mistakes make the three hours of the film unbearably difficult, yet content-wise.
