This was shown on the bio channel and was as informative as a kids comic! I gave him 2 out of 10 for his attention to detail, because he usually had a sense of the 70s and the three ladies who played the original three angels looked like them and the makeup was good br /> This should be a biography on the biochannel, but it was all free, which is usually seen in one of her biographies. No interviews with surviving performers, crewmembers, production team members, etc., or their friends, families, and biographers. In fact, I now know as much about the program as I did before watching this movie based on the (supposedly) biographical book. As far as learning something that nobody knew about the program and was not widely known, that never happened.
