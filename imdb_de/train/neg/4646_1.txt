Spinal Tap was funny, because if you knew something about Heavy Metal, you could see jokes everywhere. If you know something about porn, you'll be cold on this mock documentation. Everything in him sounds wrong. <br /> <br /> Spinal Tap was funny because it experienced a familiar world and put it down over the table. This movie is definitely not funny because it depicts a picture of how porn is made that has no relation to the real world. <br /> <br /> The acting here is uniformly horrible, but that would not matter much at the core idea. The movie was good. But it is not.
