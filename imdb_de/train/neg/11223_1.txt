I saw the movie and was dismayed to say that the movie does not communicate with me as an audience. The language would shame the street loafers. <br /> <br /> The plot; A father who does not force his son to marry seems far-fetched. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a grandmother asking her grandchild to mess up with an enemy would only attract the attention of the weak. <br /> <br /> ... and I was waiting the whole movie to laugh at a movie and laugh I've done my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie does not even have a first look is worth. <br /> <br /> I hope it saves YOUR time!
