This movie was alright, but it undoubtedly defeats the claim that homosexuals are born that way, especially when a woman escapes from an unhappy marriage and simply embraces another woman. It almost seems like Kate's gender preferences are turned on and off like a switch, so this movie looks a little simple. <br /> <br /> It was also unfortunate for films trying to push an agenda These characters in the film who had questions or disapproval of the gay lifestyle were referred to as "bigots". And there was no happy medium. They were either Kate's friends and relatives who totally hugged her or they totally avoided her. This is not typical for interactions between gay and non-gay relatives and friends. It's usually a mix of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect, without taking into account the choices they make. Unfortunately, the film did not show any of these interactions. For a film trying to portray tolerance and acceptance, this seemed like a very intolerant movie to me! Then after all these years Kate decides that she wants to be with Mac and that everything is a good thing - is it really about being gay? Come on!
