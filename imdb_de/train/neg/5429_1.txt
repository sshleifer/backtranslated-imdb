The movie starts with a nice song. Looks like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan in a suspicious way, but suddenly we're forced to make a comedy. Their scenes are quite funny and then boring. There is a bored intermediary in which Tanushrees brother is killed. Towards the end of the film, the film tries to get serious with the villain who kidnaps our heroes, but here it gets even stupid from HERA PHERI and wait, there's also a long chase in Payal's house <br /> <br /> The Film is so boring that he lets you fall asleep <br /> <br /> The direction of Priyan is very bad music (pritam) is routine except the first song <br /> <br /> The cinematography is bad, the Movie has a cheap look. Rajpal Yadav is good in his first scene where he pays his rent and I was glad that the actor is not loud and exaggerated like other movies. But no, he becomes his usual self and usually gets irritating if Tusshar should not speak in a movie. His delivery is awful. Sharman is the saving grace. He is the only actor who acts very well in this film Comicfilm as an adult, but not very impressive. Tanushree is bad as always. Arbaaz Khan has less headroom and is common. Payal is a non-actress. Murli Sharma is terrible
