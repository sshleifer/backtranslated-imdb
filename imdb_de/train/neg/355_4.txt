"Just Cause" is one of those films that really puzzles you, why it was planned so much when it came out - nothing special, but competent enough and with the outstanding support of Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third, and everything gets more and more stupid, until you have a killer with a flashlight on his forehead, who runs the risk that Sean Connery's wife (a commonly used and unconvincing Kate Capshaw) and a child (a very young Scarlet Johannsen) have fallen into disrepute) in the hut of a gator of alligators. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie that is probably best seen on an airplane, and then only once.
