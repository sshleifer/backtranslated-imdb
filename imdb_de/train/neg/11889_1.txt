Very funny to see "Beretta's Island" as a kind of natural trash movie. It's like an answer to Jess Franko's kind of B-movie. Bodybuilder strikes back (face to face!) On pushers. The very very stupid blow! Action: Incredibly poorly directed shooting scenes look even better than melee.Chasing scenes are ridiculous.Saving beauty scenes are incredibly stupid.Erotic scenes are very unexceptional. Do not miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke at the beginning of the film and a list of relatives of Franco Columbu at the end. Special Attraction: Bare Breasts.Almust forgotten - Franco can sing!
