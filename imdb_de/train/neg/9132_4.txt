The diabolical conspiracy of Dr. Fu Manchu with Peter Sellers in a parody of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice at the end of Sellers career. The plot was very simple, and if you hit the right path you could have handled it well, but it was done poorly. One reason why this movie was not so good was bad dialogue, cheap laughter, choppy direction, and an awkward feeling that the film was a bit incomplete. <br /> <br /> Acting, on the other hand, was really the only thing that sustained my interest during this messed-up picture. I found Sellers in a brilliant depiction of diabolical manchu, with occasional lines to remember. For example, there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused, which stooge is which, in which he says, "Ah, you all look the same to me." I hate to admit that, but I laughed out loud with this line. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, a handful of strong supporting actors caught my eye with Helen Mirren as underhand policeman David Tomilson's Sir Roger Avery (also his last movie, no way to end his career) and Sid Ceasar (the Al Capone's relative who works for the FBI, presented quite bizarre). These characters also let me watch. <br /> <br /> The sets were nice too. Oriental designs and English society were portrayed with elegance in 1933 in this dud-of-a-picture. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I recommend you watch the movie as Peter Sellers or Sid Caesar fan. Otherwise, you should rather chew aluminum foil.
