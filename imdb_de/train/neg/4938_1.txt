Cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap I've ever wasted looking at my time. This show based on the Geico spots is less entertaining than a 30 second Geico ad. The make-up was, to say the least, only half finished, you can hardly imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after he went to the dentist. This show could have potential for a funny series if they could get the cast from the commercials, which in itself makes for a lousy show. If the authors of the Geico ads were the same, this might have had a chance, instead the pilot lacked a good story. I give this show a 1 in 10, I would like to put a zero of 10, but that was not an option. I pray for a quick death to this show, I would give less than 5 episodes before she dies a deserved death.
