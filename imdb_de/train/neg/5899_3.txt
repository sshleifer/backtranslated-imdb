In everything that has it all, Miike and his work have done everything. I sat through this strip tonight. I figured if it's half as good as Ringu, as I suspected from those comments, it's worth my time. <br /> <br /> No such luck. <br /> <br /> I'm all looking for the next great director (or writer), but I do not think Miike is the one. I do not have a NYU Masters of Fine Arts, but I know so much: A horror movie has to go up and down. It also has to give the viewer more credibility than in this movie. <br /> <br /> The pace of this movie made me shake my head. Some scenes at the end were so torn that I went to the refrigerator and stayed there while Kou Shibasaki seemed to be staring at the camera for a few minutes, eyes wide open and mouth open. A famous director once said, and I paraphrase, a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and making her turn it. Kou is not a good actress to do this work. She stares at the undead girl paralyzed for more scenes than I would like to remember. And she's not the only one who embodies a deer in the spotlight; other performers seem to feel the need to mimic this inefficiency. The script gives them little room to spend too much time. <br /> <br /> I like asian cinema. Hong Kong action film from the last 30 years, Korean horror like "Phone" and "coma", Ang Lee's work, some trashy but funny Filipino films with free sex and fighting and others. I could have done without Chakushin Ari.
