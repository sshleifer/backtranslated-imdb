I wonder who, how and, above all, the decision to call Richard Attenborough to direct Broadway's unique sensation for many years. He is an Oscar-winning director. Yes, he won for Ghandi, you idiot! Jeremy Irons is an Academy Award winning actor. Do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. "Really?" "Oh what a nice war" have you forgotten? To answer your question, yes! The movie is a disappointment, clear and simple. No ounce of live energy survived the heavy handedness of the process. Each character danced beautifully, they were charming, but their projection was theatrical. I did not feel anything. But when I saw it on stage, I felt everything. The film should have been cast with stars, unknown newcomers, but stars with fascinating unforgettable faces, even the most invisible of the group. Great actors who could dance wonderfully. Well, Michael Douglas was there. Yes, I forgot that I am completely wrong and you are absolutely right. Nothing like a Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas musical.
