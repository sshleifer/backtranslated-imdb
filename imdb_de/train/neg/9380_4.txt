The last few weeks in the life of a dead vagabond woman are told in flashbacks. Like the vagabond, the film wanders aimlessly and rather senselessly. Mona, the lazy, sullen and drug addicted title character, is not sympathetic and Bonnaire does her little to make it interesting. Although there is a presumptuous dialogue trying to explain why Mona chose this miserable lifestyle, her motives are never really clear. The episodic character of the movie, which includes some random characters, gets boring after a while and makes it appear much longer than its runtime. It is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not attract more attention from men.
