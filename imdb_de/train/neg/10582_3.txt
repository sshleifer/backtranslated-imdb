At first, I was convinced that this is a TV movie that is worth no primetime. But after a few minutes of dumb reverence, I noticed that the towering stunts and the C-movie acting had at least a weird value. This movie would have been a 1 if my wife and I had not laughed so much when we saw this when we wondered that the actors could have a clear face. It was like a less funny spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed so much that I actually bought the big hit DVD), with even worse acting. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena, not Jim, after all the hugs and high-fives. A few drops of rum and coke will definitely make it easier.
