I wanted to hit the TV. It was torture to watch. I hated it. Never watch this movie. The terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I usually like him, but not in this case. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most irritating movie in the world. The comedian he is jealous of is disgusting. The only fun part is the rocker with the black teeth that all girls get. It was so irritating that I wanted to hit the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS FILM IF YOU WANT ANYONE TO ANYONE. If you like Adam Sandler at all, do not buy him. It will only make you hate him. Do yourself a favor, if you see him in the store, hide him to risk all to buy him. It's a $ 1.99 waste I paid for it.
