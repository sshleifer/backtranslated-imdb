This show had pretty good stories, but bad dialogues. The main character was particularly annoying. It's obvious why this show was canceled, even though, like most UPN shows, I never knew it existed until it took place in syndicated reruns. <br /> <br /> Most of the plots seemed copied from other shows and movies, which made me think that the producers did not have an original idea in mind. <br /> <br /> I have not commented enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. The special effect was not bad for a 2001 show. <br /> <br /> The dwarf was a nice character.
