"Little Man", now on DVD, is a flop of the Wayans Brothers. It's the story of a little criminal played by Marlon Wayans hiding a diamond in a lady's handbag. He and his partner Tracy Morgan are cooking up the brilliant plan to dress Marlon as a baby and plant him with the lady. Then he goes through all sorts of "Home Alone" or "Child's Play" like chaos to get the jewel back and treat him like a baby. I was surprised how low the humor in this movie was. The jokes have been made in other places so often that they are not cute or funny. I almost think the movie might have been funnier if they had not used CGI and the little actor who had pasted Marlon's face. Looking at the deleted scenes (minus CGI), this actor was funny in a mini-me-like way, but opted for a different route. A few cameos and Tracy Morgan make some funny scenes. Save your rental $ for Borat if you really want to laugh these days
