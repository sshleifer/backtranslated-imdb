I do not think any player in Hollywood history has existed for so long as David Niven has given most of the weak films he has had to wear with his incredible charm. He could trade, got an Oscar for it, but most of the material was as light as a layer of two-ply tissue paper. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is a typical example. It's a musical, and for the most part you'll remember Vera-Ellen's dance. You will remember that they are in Scott's costume while the movie plays in Edinburgh during their festival. However, if you can retrieve a single song from it, you must have a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is easy. Vera-Ellen is the American lead in a musical that is obviously being tested in Edinburgh outside the city. It starts in the chorus and runs one day late. She gets a greeting card from the chauffeur of a millionaire. Everyone now assumes that she is the main press of the millionaire. Doors open as they have never opened before. <br /> <br /> The millionaire is David Niven and he goes along with you and the different situations that arise from the mistake. Cesar Romero has some good moments here as a hectic producer of this musical. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, Happy Go Lovely is lighter and harmless fluff that David Niven did so much and got so tired of.
