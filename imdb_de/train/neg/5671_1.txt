If you like to see animals being skinned alive, their heads smashed, and my men crushed with throats, then this one is here for you! But if you are a bit normal and do not need to see any real pictures of animal cruelty, post them here. This film tries to shock the viewer, and he does. With the animal snuff at the beginning and the killing of babies in the movie (at least for a fake), it was enough for me to turn it off. I've seen movies like this before the show, slaughterhouse footage (BTK movie) should be shown, and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie. We're watching Gore and Horror because we know they're just make-up and special effects, so we should not go with it. Watch a movie and see how animals really get killed. It's not what we rented the movie for. If anything, a big warning sign should be attached to these types of garbage films so people will not be surprised. As a very hardcore horror fan this turned around here. The entire film and the crew must have their heads checked.
