Lorenzo Lamas plays a kind of CIA agent who captures an exotic beauty named Alexa, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to take action against her former employers. O.J Simpson is also on board to give the not-so-talented ensemble an air of theatrical credibility. I have to admit that I'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas or his films. He stinks. However, compared to O.J Simpson and Lamas companion Kinmont's wife, Lamas seems to ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I only saw the CIA because of renewed interest in the O.J Simpson study. You see, if your parents had cables and extra channels, you could not escape this movie. You could go to an Amish community in 1994, and some idiots would have it in their portable TV. The film itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be an intrigue, although the shock of O.J Simpson, who jumps and exchanges after fireballs, would be a liner that creates unwanted humor. And where were Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this camp a classic? <br /> <br /> * from 4- (bad)
