I am happy to see that most other people do not think much of this movie either. It has some big names in the cast, but that's it. There is nothing else to recommend, except to meet some pretty women who can make you in a thousand movies. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing more than unlikely, egoistic, chain-smoking, "hip" characters national film critics all seem to like .... and most audiences can not stand it. <br /> <br /> The accents in Oklahoma are so fake that they are ridiculous, the racist stereotypes of the South are from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
