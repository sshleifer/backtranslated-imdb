The movie was shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare, and even in the theater he failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the scriptwriter simply does not hold water. There was definitely something missing. In my opinion, people need to have a reason why they see it differently than the historical view of the past. The accuracy of the story is not what we are looking for in the conversation. <br /> <br /> The film simply lacks any substance. The only way to get this movie right was to make changes where it serves as a legend, not just a story. And a legend will contain certain elements that try to say something that people have forgotten over time, such as victims, nationalism, etc. This is called a central theme. <br /> <br /> The movie fails Answer, why should I see it anyway? <br /> <br /> At least some weird legendary flying elephants, a psychic king or the eccentric king like "The King and I" would have been lovely, something would have added a lot to the appeal of the movies. I think there was no other charm than a simple vanilla movie. <br /> <br /> As soon as you receive the call, history is the next thing we focus on. In marketing questions we call it "must". When they heard the title of the movie, people said, Oh, I have to see it. Well, where is the charm in Kingmaker? Why do not you just repeat the title and call it "How NOT to be a king?" and turn the old Siamese days into a black comedy in the style of "Dr. Strangelove". That would have been much more interesting. Narrative experiences of the weaknesses of the king from first-person nonsense would have made the movie extremely funny. <br /> <br /> Most of today's films have the "must" vocabulary, like Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they have no known characters, some other films like The Island itself resonated when asked in the ad: "Do you still believe that there is an island?". <br /> <br /> Or for the movie, entitled "How NOT to be a King," the question might be asked, "Do you still want to be a king?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
