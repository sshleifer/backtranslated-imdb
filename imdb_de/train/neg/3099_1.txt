This movie is not only bad, not stupid, it is repulsive. Something about Daphne, about the scary call girl, about the whole damn movie (and I use the word literally) emits a grotesque that would offend a brothel mistress. This movie makes my skin crawl, I regret that I have reproductive organs, and feel impure. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept. A creature that makes catastrophic fantasies, rather than the clich√© Worst Nightmare and the Exaggerated Twisted Wish, is a truly fascinating movie idea. <br /> <br /> Thinking: The reason why hobgoblins have to be killed before the day is that they are attracted to bright lights. Bright lights are not very visible during the day, so they could go somewhere. <br /> <br /> Count the hobgoblins: Four hobgoblins leave the movie studio, and at least nine of the damaging plush toys are killed in the course of the movie. <br /> <br /> Discussion Question: If you had a cold, demanding, unsightly girlfriend, would you join a military chunkhead in the garden tool fight? To explain.
