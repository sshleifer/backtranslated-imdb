So it starts with a beautiful old house in the countryside. There is a group of people being asked to come into this house and (not surprisingly) the janitors lock the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anyway, people laugh, joke, etc. This Dr. tell them a scary story about this woman and some kids. They get scared, they start to feel things. Oh no, a girl sees the ghost. Talking more, then comes that huge ghost and so on and so forth. This girl finds out that this ghost has killed little kids and that she needs to free her souls, yeah yeah, blah blah. She does, but oh no, she dies like her. And go to heaven while this evil spirit goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The script is terrible because a man's head is chopped off and Elanor (the one who rescues the children) says "Oh no." The drama is made of wood, the effects are crap and the set is a pair of rooms that are used over and over again. Basically, if you like to laugh at bad movies, look at it, but if you are looking for a fear, then definitely give this movie a problem. I was extremely disappointed when I saw that. A very big disappointment. My sister (who easily gets holy) got bored in this movie, it's horrible.
