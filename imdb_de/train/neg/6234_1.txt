Not even Goebbels could have dissuaded a propaganda stunt, as Gore did with all this fiction. This is a study of how numbers and statistics can be rotated to say whatever you have predicted to say so. The "scientists", according to Gore, have signed social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists for the validity of global warming. Would you say a meteorologist is an expert in neurosurgery? The geologists of fieldwork and data analysis involving geologists do not support Gore's alarmist claims on global warming. As one of those geologists who have worked in this area for the past 40 years, I have not seen any evidence of global warming. My analysis of this film and the Gores actions of the past few years has led me to conclude that global warming is its way of being important and relevant. No more and no less. Ask a simple question to any alarmist or "journalist" of global warming: They say global warming is a big problem. Tell me. What temperature should the earth have?
