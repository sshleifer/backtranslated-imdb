I would not call it terrible, but there is nothing gleaming in this movie, and it involves an incredibly unbelievable basic storyline. It starts well, but when the main hit is done, it's turned into a long subplot to a young girl that is not compelling, and some action scenes that are a theater of the absurd unrealistic. For example, at the airport there is a long shootout in which the lighting is stroboscopic. No explanation for that. How credible is it that an airport storage area will have lights that flash confusingly and are enough to give Snipes his incredible escape route? This is one of far too few action scenes interrupted by meaningless setups that simply can not break the belief. Plus, the whole premise seems to be that the US CIA team can shoot the place high, but get on the track by telling the British "national security." This gimmick is based on a clich√© too far from reality to be satisfying. <br /> <br /> There are much better action movies. Better formulated, better executed. This is sometimes entertaining, but there just is not enough meat on the bone and after a while it gets boring - something that should never happen in a good action movie.
