Impressive. I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but this one really takes the cake. It's the worst movie I've seen in the last decade - no exaggeration. <br /> <br /> As a veteran of the US Army of War in Afghanistan, it was almost impossible to finish this ridiculous movie, not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt To find "authenticity" somewhere in the movie. Not so much the smallest shred. It seemed like it had been written by an 8-year-old kid who got all his ideas about war (and soldier behavior) straight out of comics. The film was filmed in Honduras, which should be an indication, but even that can not fully explain the cruel production of this cliché-ridden garbage. I could try to list endless technical shortcomings, but it would take practically forever. Of the old shoulder parts of the unit, which were not seen or worn since World War II, and the name tags of the figure, such as "ColCollins" (worn by the figure "Colonel Collins"), which were actually written with the inverted mirror image "N" "The Russian alphabet (not the American alphabet) just goes on and on - the uniforms, the equipment, the plot, and above all, the behavior of the characters themselves - every single scene was just full of ridiculous mistakes, inaccuracies and absolutely pointless ones Clichés. <br /> <br /> Neither the plot itself nor the characters were that credible or believable, it was all extremely ridiculous, obviously a movie aimed primarily at pre-pubescent boys, and I doubt it Not that even they would find this film utterly absurd. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie has absolutely NO redeeming qualities n at all. It is a total waste of time. I would urge everyone who reads this to get past this garbage; It really is not worth wasting a single moment of your time.
