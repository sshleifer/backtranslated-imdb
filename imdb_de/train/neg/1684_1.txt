*** Spoiler *** Spoiler *** Spoiler *** Spoiler <br /> <br /> There are bad movies and there are movies that are so awful that they become tender in their inability to be funny. This is the case with Columbia Pictures 'The Grudge'. This cinematic cruelty began when an otherwise well-intentioned American saw a Japanese man made for the television movie "Ju-on" and was inspired to make the film in English. This started a virtual tsunami of bad decisions that went around the world until it was washed ashore in Orlando on October 21, 2004. <br /> <br /> The premise, and I use the word loose, refers to a house in Tokyo Skinny Momma Ghost, which looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, together with their ghastly buddy a chubby, wild but bad second grader. Is there anything more frightening than a scary 8-year-old Japanese boy? Certainly there is! Count Chocula comes to my mind. In this weird bunch, we have to add a mysterious black cat that I affectionately called Chim Chim. (Remember Speed ​​Racer?) As you suspected, they were murdered in this dwelling place of fate and now they want to kill anyone who enters the compound. You see, as a Japanese detective has said: When someone dies in a rage, his spirit revenges himself on anyone who steps on the property boundary, as defined by the district commissioner or something similar, I forget. <br /> <br /> The story begins innocently enough when the well-known Bill Pullman jumps from a balcony to his death. My guess is that Bill Pullman got this job because his kids begged him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Next, we endure the mildly interesting story of Nurse Yoko: "Oh, do not go in," screams the audience, but unfortunately she does not pay attention to the grim warnings and is predictably robbed like a magical lantern. After about 30 minutes we finally see the American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar may be a competent actress, but I had to think of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so much so that she distracted. It's the equivalent of having Jennifer Anniston in a movie about the adventures of six friends in New York. Try it anyway, you can not stop thinking about the other project that has made her famous. But I digress, Karen, the sister is hired as a replacement for the original caretaker who has disappeared at Spooks. <br /> <br /> She sniffs around, meets the ghosts, Comadame dies and some other thing happens. As I watched the blond vixen search for clues, I half expected to find the ghost and peel off his mask to show that it was the old Gower who owned the abandoned amusement park. "I would have got away with it if you had not interfered with children and your dog!" <br /> <br /> Director Takashi Shimizu, who wants to fight for the Ed Wood of Asia, made two unfortunate decisions regarding sound. First, he decides to use a soundtrack only if someone is to be killed. This is an excellent tool to wipe out any excitement, as the audience receives a two-minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder. Second, he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural sound that sounds like a gurgle. After the movie, I heard several people leave the theater and laugh. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar eventually becomes the only survivor. And of course we learn that the fire she burned down in the house was cleared in time for the compulsory next chapter. However, given the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want a sequel, but an apology. 'The Grudge' could easily be turned into a comedy, maybe it's valued for its storage value. This will be the biggest movie thriller since 'Godzilla Vs. Be Megalon '. I would suggest waiting until the movie comes to your local discount theater where he can get the public ridicule he so richly deserves.
