In this movie, the humanity of the animals could not be explored, and I had an empty feeling inside. [Spoiler ahead] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to give up the big buyout deal to help his furry friends. While Babe (the original) opposed the trend of big-budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of animals over their human counterparts, all the animals in this film were nothing more than comic caricatures that one likes to put into the flesh stuffed grinder (all the more, if you could understand their pointless chatter). Without Eddie Murphy's crazy behavior, this movie would be a flop.
