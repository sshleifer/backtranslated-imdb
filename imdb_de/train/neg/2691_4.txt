Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. He usually gives solid performances, as in The Straight Story and The Gray Fox. He's also doing quite well here, but the rest of the movie suffers from a low budget, bad writing, and so-so photography. The Miller Movie formula gives a 4th. Richard gets a 5.
