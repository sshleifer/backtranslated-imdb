In my literary class, we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is not like the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He did not know the name of the pilot. (3) His mother did not cheat on his father in a station wagon in the woods where anyone could see. (4) The man with whom the mother is cheating has no black hair, he has blonde. <br /> <br /> Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen-year-old can not beat his fist through a window. <br /> <br /> And for acting, the boy who played Brian was a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> But I think the scenery was impressive, though I doubt the director even read the book. <br /> <br /> This film is good if you have not read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, but if so, then start with a letter of complaint to the director.
