This is a typical chaos of the 70s. It's supposed to be a docudrama about a crew chasing Bigfoot through the Pacific Northwest. Each character is a stereotype, from the Native American to the cynical cowboy. Acting and narration are a complete joke. If you're hoping to see a lot of bigfoot material, then keep hoping. There will not be much, and what can you do in your garden with a cheap costume and a camcorder? It would look better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that I do not like the 70's low budget rate; I do. It's such a mess of bad actors, bad characters, lousy stories and no thrills that you simply can not enjoy. It does not fit into the category "so bad it's good" and you can not laugh at how bad it is without the help of illegal substances. It's mostly boring shots of people camping, hiking, riding and watching wildlife. There is a bigfoot attack that is completely stupid. Our friend Sasquatch allegedly throws stones at the campers from the top as they fire their rifles at him. At this point, you are strongly rooting for Bigfoot to drop some rocks on the head of the filmmaker and stop it.
