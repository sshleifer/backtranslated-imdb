This movie is funny and painful at the same time. The "Cinemagic" has almost brought me to seizure. Despite its importance, "Cinemagic" is not an innovative technical process. It was "developed" as a result of an accident and they used it because it obscures the fact that their "monsters" look so stupid. I do not think it's a coincidence that the author Sid is "Pink". <br /> <br /> This movie is good for a laugh if you are really looking for a movie that has been shot at $ 200,000 in 9 days. It is entertaining; At least I can say that. The bat / rat / spider is the highlight.
