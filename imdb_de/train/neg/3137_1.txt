Like many people, I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out in '97. It was, at best, a substandard film, defiantly not the "masterpiece" that all these "Titanic" fanboys like to do. First of all, DiCaprio is a terrible actor, no matter how you look at it. People like him because of his appearance. His acting abilities essentially consist in saying many cheesy lines and trying to be sexy. Secondly, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: Girl falls in love with a guy, ship she's on, and then a lot of shabby love pictures. Anyone with an IQ over 50 will realize that this is in no way awesome. It is not original either. In addition, the director felt the need to pull him out for more than three hours. I could compress it into a 1-hour block without losing the plot. In summary, Titanic is the most overrated film yet. Why it got so much attention and money is unclear to me.
