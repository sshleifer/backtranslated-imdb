This movie only rotates in circles, and the viewer does not know where he is. At first I thought ... mmmmm, it could be a bit of a cool movie, but it keeps on going and you do not know what's going on. The lead actress is a good actress and has played her part well, and the psycho guy is scary, but after a while you do not really care what happens, because this movie just keeps going on. It's a pity, that could have been much better. <br /> <br /> I would say that the female lead actor and the psycho guy will have a good career ahead of them, but will they remember this movie because he made them known or for the movie, that they regret ever having done.
