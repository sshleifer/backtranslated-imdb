Of the critical acclaim I expected more from this movie and from Tamara Jenkins. The story wormed on and seemed to have neither a point nor a conspiracy. And I find it hard to believe that a 14-year-old girl (mature for her age or no age) would be dumb enough to "end the loss of her virginity." Maybe I'm too young to be able to tell anything (in 1976 I was four years old), but I had no trouble connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love or Life is Beautiful, and I did not live for any of these attitudes. The cast is very good, but unfortunately the script did not allow them to thrill the audience. All in all, slums had its moments, but if you do not want to think about halter tops and tube socks, I would say you skip this one.
