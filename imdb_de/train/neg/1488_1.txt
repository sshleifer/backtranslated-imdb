I had to sign up for the IMDb just to comment on how awful this movie is ... My cats and a stringball have a better story than this one. Not the worst drama I've ever seen, but blowing out almost all of the cast within 5 minutes leaves something to be desired. There was not a single "scary" moment in the movie except when watching the movie "Halloween" on TV. Everywhere it seems to have been a good story, rolling the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was there was a bit of a loss, since I did not recognize them right away and their scene was over before I could have 'oh yeah 'There she is.' I am so glad that I saw this in a hotel and did not pay, because I would really tick if I had paid a dime for it. Usually I like or at least find a redemption factor in a movie, but this is an exception. It's so bad that it's not even amusing, so good, it's bad ... it's just bad.
