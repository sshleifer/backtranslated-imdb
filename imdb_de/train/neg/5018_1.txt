I rented this movie for Amber Benson only, although after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story. The first problem, however, was that there really was no story ... or indeed a story, but it made absolutely no sense. The second problem was that there was no attitude for these characters ... yes, I got them all to go to school together, but within the first 3 minutes of the movie, they realized that they had nothing else in common and did not like each other ... why did you meet again and again? Error number 3 ... the director was despite long pauses and short camera shots of the tension (especially in the typical suspense music) ... he was sadly wrong. It was painful to give time to a terrific actress like Amber Benson as she tried to bring this back to life ... my only hope is the money she has earned here, was put into producing her own movie.
