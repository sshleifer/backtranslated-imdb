What a disappointment! I hated the mummy, but this one was even worse! It was very exhausting and unbelievable and at some point I sighed and yawned all the time. I can not believe that people really liked this movie. The role of Nicholas Cage was not very convincing. The whole movie felt like a big tour of America's most wanted building. The never-ending flow of clues and combinations was also not very convincing. I stopped being aware about 30 minutes ago. What was meant for a happy evening became a total disappointment. What a downside ... I think I just watched too many movies to enjoy National Treasure.
