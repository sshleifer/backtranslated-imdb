<br /> <br /> Alien visitors not only look just like a furry, armpitted human woman, and besides strangers who can speak perfect English (with an Australian accent), EXCLUSIVELY refer to their stars with the same names that ours Earthly astronomers have given them! <br /> <br /> And all that is extraterrestrial knows how mean, evil, wasteful and destructive we are. And they are ready to tell us how bad that is. <br /> <br /> If you ever get the chance to see this movie, do not do that. Well, unless you are suffering from insomnia or the choice is in this movie or exploration without anesthesia. <br /> <br /> This film seeks to convey a moral, ecological aspect, but only yawns and prays that it will end soon.
