Incredibly confused, repulsive and ultimately ridiculous ("the horses, oh my god, the horses!") Thriller. It's scary at times, but it has one of the worst screenplays ever written for a horror movie. See how each one "magically" does exactly what the plot for the "resolution" needs in the last 10 minutes. Boring performances of the leads, a typically eccentric by Richard Lynch. The video broadcast is a real hacking job that halves scenes and makes the movie even harder to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
