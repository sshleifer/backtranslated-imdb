What a shame if a potentially captivating and refreshingly contained story manages to capture your interest in the beginning and then gradually let you down until you scratch your mysterious head as soon as it reaches its exaggerated conclusion. Unfortunately this happened to me at the end of WHITE NOISE. <br /> <br /> It was not Michael Keaton's fault. It was a pleasure to see him as the star of a brand new movie that might have looked a bit wrinkled but still delivered a strong and sincere performance. As a man whose wife has recently passed away, he is obsessed with her wandering spirit in the Hereafter (no new idea), who apparently contacts her through this funky electric fluffy business that you see on your TV screen when nothing is broadcast. <br /> The idea that ghosts communicate via the airwaves is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and there are many people who really believe in it, so I will not comment on it, I think about it or about it. Let me just say that I'm outrageous in disbelief when it comes to buying awesome movies like this, but I can not stand it if I do not understand what the hell was supposed to be where I was stranded left when the credits finally began to roll. A lot of static. <br /> <br /> There are occasionally films like these that have completely stunned me, but if a movie does not make sense to me, I tend to regard that as a filmmaker's fault, not my own (it might be because, I saw it while I was too tired to concentrate or anything). Well, for WHITE NOISE I was wide awake, bright-eyed and bushy - so guess who's to blame?
