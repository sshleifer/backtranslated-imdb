I wonder what the people who gave these 10 have seen in what I did not do. This movie is VERY hard to follow and / or stay in an action. If someone tells you that it's a comedy, do not be fooled, it's 98% odd drama and 2% comedy. All the actors deliver a great performance that can not be denied, but it seems they've lost something somewhere. I do not know if the original script was good and what needed editing or what. This had potential and instead it really was a flop. I really would like to have the one and a half hours that I invested in this movie, but the video store does not return on time. Save your money and see something else.
