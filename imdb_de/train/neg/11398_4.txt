I saw this movie first and foremost to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), whom I briefly met at a modeling fair in LA, in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of her, but thought she played her role very well. Since she is such a beautiful TV presenter and model, it was not surprising. I wondered why she was killed and what happened as a result. Maybe I just missed it. <br /> <br /> I was not sure what the genre of this movie was, and although I liked the actors, I felt like a college crowd. I tried to stay open, considering that horror was not my favorite genre, but I felt I'd outgrown the gags. In some places it seemed as if it should turn out which parts the evil professor had and how many other films had an unsatisfactory ending. <br /> <br /> Having written a few scripts I know that much of it is difficult and can be traced back to personal opinions, how many films you have seen and studied and with which you are in contact at any given time , <br /> <br /> In short, I found it interesting but not a satisfying plot and ended up for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) had finally returned through the portal and kicked everyone in the ass, that would be a satisfying ending and a higher rating.
