The only thing that kept me from vomiting after watching this movie was the fact that it's just an actor, not the freak show that usually appears in the TV series. This is also the main reason why fans of the TV series will not like the movie, but not the only reason. This movie has about as much entertainment as a root canal. It approaches the abysmal depths of bad filmmaking and gets worse. I will not waste time describing this film in more detail. Suffice to say that I regret the poor cameramen who had to suffer the first time by watching this camera.
