CQ was the worst movie I've seen this year. Almost every movie I see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say. This movie looked like it was being directed by a movie student for his intro. to the film class. His dad makes great movies. His sister made a good one. But brother Roman? NO! One critic had the audacity to compare this movie to Godard's Le MÃ©pris (contempt). While Coppola jr. Having taken the same idea, a movie about the movie, he was trying too hard to make himself European, artistic and funny, even though everything is really just kitsch. The lead actor wears the same expression throughout the film as if he has awe for the movie that revolves around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to end his role as an extravagant director. Depardieu is fine. The one scene that does not have any real movie parody humor is, surprisingly, not the B-movie scenes, but rather one that plays in Italy. A montage of shots of different characters in a very small car, driving around and picking up random people. This was the only thing that reminded me of the movie that I suspect was trying to fake. Or rip off. Or both. The documentary film starring in the camera and filming various objects was played, the ending was marked for "twisting" or artistic value. and not as it was intended. No wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re-edited or re-shot or whatever, which makes me wonder how bad it was before. I can not believe it could be worse. If you want to watch a good movie parody, check out the Austin Powers movies. All of them. The opening to the third is more entertaining and ingenious than this movie. Lil 'Romy, for the sake of the cinema, PLEASE go back to your cousin's music videos. Leave the godfather to godparents.
