Disney has not met a movie yet, to which he could make at least two sequels. And this was no exception to the people of Disney who told a faint story to get a quick reward. Although I did not pay to look at it, I feel cheaper looking at it. Ariel is now an adult and had a daughter. Nevertheless, the daughter must not go into the sea, because the sister of the deceased sea witch has an idle threat. So it starts again. <br /> <br /> The daughter is (of course) tricked and helps the sea witch. After a not so glorious fight, it is defeated and the mermaids and humans live in harmony. Yawning. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to see here. Go back to your life. "D-"
