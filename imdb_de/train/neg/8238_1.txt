This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. I could not stand the whole thing. I also think writers have to have a weird fetish for women peeing and shitting ... I mean, what was that? I can not believe this was even done, and I'm disgusted that #ing paid a Â£ 4 charge for the rent. The quality of image and sound is terrible, acting ... well, it does not exist. It was a bad excuse for a movie and the scenes of piss, crap and puke reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. Urhh ....... at all costs! The girls looked as if they had been picked up from the street and only had the part because they were ready to take off their tops ... While these girls have beautiful bodies, this does not make the fact that their yelling was terrible not convincing and painful for my ears. <br /> <br /> That was like (maybe worse) than an ammateur school production with no right direction and hey, it's not a sentence needed since it's all about a car? <br /> <br /> By no means buy people. I'm sorry if my first comment is terribly negative, but I could not say anything positive, and I'd like to think that maybe I could save someone else wasting their money the way I did.
