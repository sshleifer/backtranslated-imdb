I saw the change of goals ... twice ... and always the same feeling ... you see the Olsen twins doing the same movie ... they like to play different sports and then fall in love with guys .. OK now first of all, all little boys and girls do not play on such big goals ... 2. football does not play on time ... 3. When the game is over, the referee gives some overtime (a minute or more ) ... and the goal is so predictable ... I think this movie is bad because there is no knowledge in football. If it were done by European producers, it would be better ... and even the mane actors are not the right choice. They are suffering from lack of authenticity ... OK, they played full seasons in full house, but that does not make them big stars ... you have to show your talent. ... and that's exactly what the Olsen twins are missing
