I think Gunslinger was not as horrible as most of the films that Mystery Science Theater 3000 shows, but Westerns are not the strength of Roger Corman. After Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) has become a sheriff in an old West town after her husband's husband was murdered and must ward off bad guys, the movie is pretty predictable. John Ireland is the new man from Rose, who secretly works for the hairy Allison Hayes (yes, the 50-foot woman). Coming soon also the frequent Corman co-star Dick Miller as a postman (today, Miller plays in Joe Dante's films). <br /> <br /> I would like to say that you probably want to see the "MST3K" version to really enjoy this movie. They had a great time with it.
