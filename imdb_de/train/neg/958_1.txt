How did that become a blockbuster? Dear God, I do not know where to start, why this movie was too much. The movie was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the spectacle of some characters. The film was too bright, you should have done something with the lighting, z. make the environment darker. The make-up of certain great characters made this film look like a 1970 horror movie. That's 2006! People are not afraid of others who are heavily made up. Most horror scenes come from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies. Total rip-off! That's why I do not watch Tagalog movies. The only reason why so many people "screamed" when watching this movie is conformity. How often do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and improvise that the girl does not come out of the TV, but comes out of the window next door? No matter how you put it, it's still a rip off.
