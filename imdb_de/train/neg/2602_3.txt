Drew Barrymore keeps seeing his alter ego all over the city and it is slowly becoming a pain in the butt. After Dee has written a home by a hacker, her encounters with the "other Drew" become more common. Writer-Dude believes that it is his responsibility to pull the "real Drew" out of his stupor, and he does what he can to make her seduce her as soon as he has some spare time. Not very interesting and even less scary, but Drew is sexy as always, especially when she gives a finger to a group of rude construction workers ... yes Drew, that's hot! <br /> <br /> The best scene may be the scene where Drew stabs her real mom, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was your day?
