This is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror film fanatic and will rent any horror movie unless it's made for TV. If you look at the box, you say it's R for Gore and some language ... Where was the Gore? Was it your only good death scene where you really saw Gore? I could have overlooked whether there was a brief nudity or good dialogue. There was not even the remotest humorous or amusing line in this lame movie. Horror movies are sometimes fantastic because they are so stupid, but that was just sad.
