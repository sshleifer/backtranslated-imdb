Penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we almost take care of them. However, there are some real issues with the story, we see no real motivation for the evil brother's behavior and the timeline is messed up. Probably set in 1963, the music is late 60s / early 70s. The references and the dialogue are 70s / 80s. The potential for a powerful climax lends itself and Penn makes him disappear. But despite all these difficulties, it is worth the clock, but not great.
