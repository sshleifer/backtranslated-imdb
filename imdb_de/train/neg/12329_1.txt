In my time as a usher, "Private Lessons" played in the 4-plex where I worked. It was a sleeper hit that sold out Friday and Saturday for several weeks. I never got to see it, but I saw it was on cable last weekend. So I decided to give it a try. What I saw in the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and one that made me awfully uncomfortable to look at. <br /> <br /> The basic story is that a teenager yearns for his sexy maid (Sylvia) Kristel). She, too, seems attracted to the boy, though for more sinister reasons. So we get scenes in which the boy watched her undress and invited her to watch. And it goes from there. <br /> <br /> As a teenager, Eric Brown has to be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. His "frightened" reactions every time Sylvia takes off a garment or touches it are terrible. I did not laugh once during this garbage. <br /> <br /> And let us not begin with the subservience of the maid and chauffeur planning to extort money from the child. Let's just say, it's about faking a death, burying a body ... I could go on and on, but it gets more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes are the worst I have ever seen. Although Eric Brown was older than he looked, he actually looks like a baby. It seems he has no idea how to kiss a woman (if THAT was acting, perhaps I should reconsider my criticisms of Brown), and it came too close to child pornography to be erotic. I've never been turned off by a sex scene, though Miss Kristel with and without clothes is pretty pretty. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER WARNING ** I have to mention the last scene. For me it's just sick, but I can remember how the audience cheered when the movie was frozen and turned into credits. Our hero returns to school and flirts with one of the teachers. He asks her for dinner and she looks at him as if Tom Cruise had just asked her. She nods in agreement and he leaves and smiles triumphantly into the camera. GIVE ME A BREAK! Yes, I'm sure teachers everywhere risk everything for a simple looking teenage kid. <br /> <br /> I'll never understand what attraction this film had in 1982. Sure it was more than nudity, because there were many teen sex comedies with nudity bombarded at the box office. And to believe that the same teens who cheered this movie 22 years ago are now working their way up on corporate leaders and possibly helping them run this country. THAT is a scary thought.
