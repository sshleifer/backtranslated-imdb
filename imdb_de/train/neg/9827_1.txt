At first, this movie reminded me of the old films that I saw in religious education at school. That's not a good thing. Basically, it's just a preaching and presumptuous bastard, just like the terrible "Left Behind" series. I'm not offended by religious films ... but I'm offended if those religious films happen to be extremely horrible. I just want to be able to say nice things about a Christian movie, but it does not look like it will happen soon. I'll bet if you gave the Bible pump a decent budget, they could not find anything good. Just avoid this. Also, the fact that the "American Family Association" (basically Reverend Wildmoon's lack) shines through this movie on their website is another reason why I hate him. After looking at it, I went home and looked at my NC-17 from David Cronenberg, which was rated "Crash". Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Hahahahaha!
