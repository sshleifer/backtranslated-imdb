After seeing the hot Eliza Dushku in the pretty good Wrong Turn, I decided to take this piece instead of Return of the Living Dead. I have not seen it yet, but considering it's one of the critically acclaimed horror films, I can say I made the wrong choice. There's nothing to recommend, and I'm talking about the supposedly superior killer cut. It did not even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre in poor movies like I Know What You Last Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend. It just did not make sense, had no excitement, had little interesting acting or convincing writing. The release date has apparently been postponed for more than a year in a row, and the reason is obvious. The whole movie is created as a series of pointless scenes that are randomly put together without being meaningless. Instead, get a wrong move if you want to see Dushku. I would like to see a movie with her and the super hot Elisabeth Harnois - but I do not think this movie would have been visible either. Casey Affleck, who is so promising in Good Will Hunting, is terribly here - he seems to lack both intelligence and courage. That's enough for this one.
