In this film, old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman. He meets her in his restaurant. The younger woman, taboo, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks her. Her reaction to his invitation is quite strange. Should be funny. <br /> <br /> And that annoys me about this whole movie. That was not funny. The jokes and the script were terrible! The only joke I liked was the teeth of a waiter, but after a couple of times that too got boring. Amitabh has a little girlfriend named sexy. This was a strange relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was scary! I know that someone can be connected to a child, but this man has adult conversations with that child. It made no sense. Taboo's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to be hard on Amitabh, but we all know Paresh, he can not. So even the conversation at the end, when sitting around the table, should actually be funny. <br /> <br /> I only like movies that are really funny. I think I'll never see this movie again.
