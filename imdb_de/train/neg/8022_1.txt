I see that someone was already thinking of a similar analogy that resembled the first thing that came to mind after watching this movie. They said the ingredients were there, but there was no conspiracy. Apart from the sexual scenes that bordered on child pornography (which I think would have been more elaborate or more graphic than in nature), I would compare this movie to a recipe that was torn in half A list of ingredients , without instructions on how to put them together to form an end product: From the beginning there is a lack of character development and story development ... unfortunately we are often annoyed with action parts and us in this monotonous moron. Think "Ahh-ok ... finally will we learn a bit more about WHY this scene goes on ... or ... WHO that character is ... or maybe we'll finally meet and appreciate it. " this character more ... or understand and feel more with this relationship between the characters ... etc. "But no such luck! On the contrary, I was often tempted to just turn it off more than once, but kept it through as the Carrot was dangling just to find out which mini-plot was going to be in. Whatever mini-plot (and that badly presented) was just a trick, why I stuck with it to the end is a mystery. "Unlike usual, IFC has one better selection and they gave him 2-1 / 2 stars (another puzzle) .It's not that the characters are not sympathetic to some degree or that you can not identify with them or their humanity at all just so this could have been so much better with a bit more effort, I've noticed that this was filmed in Santa Cruz, and I wonder if it's a film school, I wish I had that better but honestly, that was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half.
