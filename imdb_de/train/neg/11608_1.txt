If this guy can make a movie, I can certainly do one too. <br /> <br /> If you hire me to do a movie for you, I promise you the following: <br /> <br /> 1) I will add more naked women. This movie had no. I think cheesy B-class horror movies are being lent just for their traditional exploitation of the female body. I do not want to abandon my viewers. <br /> <br /> 2) I refuse to make too many scenes in which the hero wakes up to find out that it's just a dream. I think HorrorVision had about four of those scenes. Considering that the movie was only an hour long, the ratio of dream length to movie length was quite high. And if I decide on a dream sequence, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants? <br /> <br /> 3) I'm not going to rip off any movies like Star Wars or The Matrix because I know my budget is small and I dont want to mask contempt for Hollywood movies on a big budget by adding satirical references to it she in mine. <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, a Palm pilot can only be so scary ... at least they made it a nasty rolly-polly monster before the screen was blown up or something. <br /> <br /> About qualities in your next horror production, count on me: Wanna-B-Movie Director Extraordinaire.
