This is a sad movie for sad people. I sat in the theater and tore my hair apart. I wanted to break the chairs in front of me as the movie broke one offending scene after another. And there were people laughing behind me, wondering what kind of films these people need to watch to really enjoy this horse. Nikkhil Advani has six stories without conspiracy and no interesting characters. The script is boring, probably he was drunk when he wrote this movie. None of these stories is firmly under control. Nothing new, nothing that could captivate the audience, and filled with dialogues that you've heard a million times. One of the stories is that this couple is unable to have sex because there is a catastrophe every time he wants it. I mean, seriously, is this story really necessary? It's not funny, not creative, it just proves that Advani has no sense of comedy. Another story (which was probably the only one I was interested in) is based on a man's infidelity and ends with a lame, ancient Sati-Savitri-Pati-Parmeshwar crap. I have no idea what Salmaan-Priyanka-Plot is all about. There was no problem in the plot to be an action. Can not take Karan Johar's film because she has to marry Salmaan? Why can not she marry him and still take the movie? or do Advani and Priyanaka just want to prove to the world that it's true that actresses can not be successful when they're married, or that they should not play in movies when they're married? Obviously, Advani can not produce the film with six actors alone. So he uses sponsors like The Times Group in full and shamelessly advertises for their Filmfare magazines. And also a jewelery brand, which the women in the movie absolutely love to love !! I come to IMDb to get the worst rating, and I'm shocked to see posts that praise the movie. It just shows the sad state of Bollywood and how the fans beat the stars. With such fans films like Salaam E Ishq will continue to be shot and possibly a hit.
