For a science-scare movie to work well, it must either be truly original or a very good retelling. This movie is neither. Sure, there is a pseudo-original twist because the guy kills people for a toxin, not a disease, but that's a very minor twist. There is the conspiracy of the government, the protagonist of the Crusader, who has personal experience ... <br /> <br /> And a real drawback of this film is that the contaminated man has no pathos. Although the character is written to be someone who should regret, he is not. Without pity, the movie is pointless. The other characters are such a cookie cutter that they are ridiculous. The negotiations are tortuous and annoying. And the saddest thing is that the movie is too shallow to be enjoyed as a dummy material at all. Make the movie in 45 minutes and maybe it's worth to look at it.
