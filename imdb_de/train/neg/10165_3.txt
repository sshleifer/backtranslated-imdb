San Francisco is a big city with great actors. In this case, the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city. They did not even get the most basic realistic details. So I would not recommend it to anyone because it's a San Francisco movie. You will not think, "Oh, I was there," you'll think "How did a two-story fire trap / smelly armpit turn into a quiet lobby?" Some of the leads used East Coast language styles and effects. It is detrimental, but the acting was always competent. <br /> <br /> The stories seemed, at least at the beginning, to have been shot in three different styles. The Chinatown story was the most effective and interesting. The plot is a weak scene for scene from classic Hong Kong action movies. The originals had much more excitement and emotional resonance, they were better framed and went better. But acting is fun and we see James Hong and other luminaries. <br /> <br /> The white boy's intro was pointless. I think the filmmakers did not know what to do with it, so they loosely structured it and reduced it. Father is a strange Berkeley Liberal attempt - really, folks, everybody knows it's not "groovy" to live in the ghetto - but its segments are the most humorous. They threw away some good opportunities. Educated and embittered on the West Coast, a yuppie jerk is a different kind of yuppie jerk than she is in New York. They are equally unbearable, but always distinguishable. That would have been interesting. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> The Hunter's Point Intro was the most disappointing. It was the remotest of the three and stylistically farthest from San Francisco. You saw how it was done and you saw that it was done better. Even the video game was better! <br /> <br /> Despite the generic non-locality and the aimless script, these characters have potential, the actors talent and something interesting pushes in the awkward direction ... about ten minutes before the end. Good concept got into the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, a minority is missing here, if you can guess which ones.
