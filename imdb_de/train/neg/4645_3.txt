Belmondo is a tough cop. He's following a big drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, usually a big villain - see "Sharky's Machine", but here he is clearly in sync, which is why he lacks his usual charisma). He goes to the most horrible places in Paris and Marseilles, asks for some names, gets some people together, gets the names, goes to more sketchy places, asks for more names, beats more people, etc. The whole movie is blow after beat Blow It seems that the people who made it had no other ambition than to create the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry". Belmondo, who was 50 years old, performs good stunts at first; Apart from that, "Le Marginal" is a violent, episodic, banal, flat and unforgettable movie. (* 1/2)
