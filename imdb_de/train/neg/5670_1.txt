The only reason why "The Norliss Tapes" has earned EVERY star is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the cast. Apart from Angie Baby in a "Police Woman" performance, there is nothing else to see here. <br /> <br /> THE SYNOPSIS: <br /> <br /> *** MINOR SPOILERS ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss is tapped to write a book about the supernatural. One day he mysteriously disappears after calling his publisher and suggesting that he has encountered something that has put him in mortal danger. The entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks about the "Norliss tapes" - a series of tapes that the author recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural. <br /> <br /> In the pilot, a wealthy sculptor dies - but not before he has bought an Egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him that the bullet gives him immortality after death. We soon discover that the ring itself does not grant immortality. Instead, the sculptor's corpse is only revived so he can escape from his tomb so he can walk around the city and dry pretty girls from all their blood. The last time you saw "Scooby Doo," the sculptor has his wife (Dickinson) attacked on a dark night. She flees and contacts Norliss through a mutual acquaintance to help him solve the mystery behind the eerie reappearance of her late husband on her estate. <br /> <br /> So is this guy a vampire? No. There is no vampire in this story, despite what you may have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he collects it. As? Do not know We only see him attacking, never collecting. Why? To fulfill the second part of his offer for immortality. It turns out that the revived sculptor can only live forever if he builds a life-size statue of a demon named Sargoth from a mixture of clay and human blood. Once it's done, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue and use it as its gateway to our world. <br /> <br /> THE FINAL ANALYSIS: <br /> <br /> "The Norliss Tapes" was not picked up as a series for a very good reason ... it was rubbish. As you can see from my synopsis, the story is a miserable, ill-conceived mess. The acting and the dialogue do not offer better. This is not even a contender for a "So Bad It's Good" award. Sometimes bad is just bad. <br /> <br /> After listening underground for years on the great merits of "The Norliss Tapes", I was very excited when I aired it on October 15, 2003 on Fox Movie Channel. I wish I had not adjusted to the case. <br /> <br /> After showing this moan for the first time two days ago, I can only assume that any applause you've heard from other IMDB reviewers so far is from those who came to see the show repeat on the basis of faint memories and the nostalgia of youth. Or maybe they are just loyal fans of Dan Curtis. In any case, they have offered you misleading reviews about "The Norliss Tapes". Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
