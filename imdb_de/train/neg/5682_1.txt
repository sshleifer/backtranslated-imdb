This movie is incredibly ridiculous. I love horror movies, but that's the worst thing I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of Gore, but most of the deaths in this movie are not shown. It just shows us the corpses, and the only death scenes they actually show in this movie are terrible. The graphics looks so obviously fake. The actors are terrible too. There is no real emotion from them. Not only did I waste my time watching this piece of film, but I also had to undergo movies of animals that were beaten at the beginning of the game. If I could rate this with -10, I would do that. Fuck this movie. It is crap. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it.
