Absolutely one of the worst movies ever. <br /> <br /> Low production scores, terrible story idea, bad script, lackluster drama ... and I can not even come up with an adjective that describes the poor so well Joan River is directing. I know there is a special place in hell for the people who financed this movie. The film is a train accident. <br /> <br /> (Terrible) x (infinity) = Rabbit test. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that it's not funny how bad it is.
