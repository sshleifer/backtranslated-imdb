I really wish I could cast a negative vote because I think I wasted only 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever made in the movie. The acting was just awful, I REALLLYYYY bad, the dialogue was worse, the script sounded like it was written ... I can not imagine anything bad. And the day "outside" and the night "inside" make you think that the events lasted several days. Terrible acted, directed, written, etc., etc. all the way down to the Gofer, how everyone gets the lunch. Stay away from all costs. If my only salvation is to keep me out of hell by doing a good deed, it's telling the world not to see that crap. This movie is the very reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.
