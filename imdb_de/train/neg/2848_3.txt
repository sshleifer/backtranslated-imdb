... so I thought I would write a few words to William McNamara. It's not a bad way to spend a few hours, if you want to see him in his tight quarters - it's obvious he was pumped up for that role and he looks pretty good in it - or less. There is an extended sequence in a cave where he has to undress to his panties. There is a nice piece in which he has to chase Miss Eleniak in the buff, only with her hands over the groin. William McNamara is of course a bit thin, but he has a nice, generous handful of prey. There is also a moment when he gets out of bed, if you interrupt the action just at the right moment, you can see the whole Enchilada. When you're ready and coming, half of the people who decide to watch a movie about Navy men on a "road trip." I just want to thank Dennis Hopper for his unfounded nudity. Can William McNamara act? Crap, if I know.
