They all know the story of "Hamlet". I do. <br /> <br /> Well, the phrase "to be or not to be" (not the language itself) has been knocked into the ground so often that it's not very interesting (in fact, it was not great) start with). In FACT, "Hamlet" is a good but overrated game. It's not even Shakespeare's best: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better, with "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" not too far behind. "Macbeth (knock your table out of the drawers, Puck will make it all right, OW!)" Not too bad either. There are many others who are better than those of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I will not really comment too much on the movie, rather I will analyze the extremely dreadful MST3K episode. <br /> <br /> Okay. , , Mike and the bots win a card game and select the movie. , , They ask for "Hamlet", Pearl sends them that, Yadda Yadda Yadda. , , and get ready for the most boring sci-fi episode of MST3K I've ever seen (admittedly I did not see any of the CC ones). <br /> <br /> While "Blood Waters of Dr. Z," this episode looks horrible, as it's not really a movie, but random, spliced ​​scenes (I remember Mike's line from "Future War" : "Maybe this is an anthology of short, mindless films"), the SOL crew a many got a lot of good cracks. I can not say the same thing here. <br /> <br /> The riffs fall off flat, the host segments (as usual) are mediocre at best and if the movie itself (which is not that bad) is really better (I mean, as a quality movie, not a warehouse, like "Prince of Space") as the MST3K version of it, you know that the show must be bad. I laughed (the last time I saw it a few months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times. I tried and tried and tried to talk - but I just could not. Just the occasional line, like "Hail Queen Dilbert's boss!" (And if that's the funniest line of the episode, well, uh) - and occasionally I mean every ten minutes or so - maybe I even bitch. The second time I tried to look at it, I did not even laugh at the few jokes I thought was funny and just gave up forty minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> The movie is not terrible; It's just a german version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough, and although the synchronization is not the best, that's not a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; THREE, THREE for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: WHY WHY WHY WHY, MST3K!
