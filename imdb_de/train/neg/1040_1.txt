I can not believe that this movie has reached such a high rating of 6! It's barely visible and incredibly boring, certainly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> In a no-budget way, Star Wars episodes I and II just reminded me that you see a totally creative train wreck. <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided at all costs. It's one of those "festival movies" that only pseudo-intellectuals like because they are so bad that people think it does "different," so good. <br /> <br /> Bad filmmaking is not "different" ", it's just bad filmmaking.
