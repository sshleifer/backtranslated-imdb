Filmed in a documentary, but you can tell the participants pretty well that they were trained. A recently divorced wannabe filmmaker (Myles Berkowitz) sees a chance to revive his love life while entering the movie business. He intends to make a documentary about finding love by filming twenty dates and the resulting effects. The comedy is spotty at best; the rest is misfortune after misfortune. Also present are Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and the enticing Elisabeth Wagner. In search of credibility, the collector Tia Carrere is persuaded to a cameo. This will suffice as a handbook, as you will NOT get a satisfactory date.
