I'm probably one of the few who read Stephen King's book on which this movie is based. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see the movie version of it. After watching the movie, I was totally disappointed. The only thing this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. Schwarzenegger's character is put on a gameshow in the book. The main goal is to survive. But he is not in an arena. He is free in the city and has to escape the villagers of the game show (I think you would call them) who are totally out of line with the movie characters. This premise built a lot of tension and suspension and ended with the climax. The movie was absolute garbage. There was no cinematic quality. I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he has dealt with this.
