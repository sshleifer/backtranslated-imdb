I saw the movie and was totally exhausted because the movie was stupid and boring. I thought Ram Gopal Varma would justify his work, but unfortunately he failed and the whole movie got spoiled and they spoiled "sholay". The cast and crew was bad. The whole theater slept while watching the movie. Amithab Bachan's acting is bad, I thought this movie will be the biggest hit of the year, but this movie will be the biggest flop of the year, for sure. nobody did justice to their work, including Ajay Devagan. This movie does not deserve an audience. I bet this movie will flop. <br /> <br /> "FINALLY THIS FILM SUCKS"
