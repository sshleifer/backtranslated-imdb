You would get that if you allowed a 10-year-old (manic American) to write the story of a moon journey. Absolute garbage without redeeming qualities Maybe it was a fascination in the 3D department. But as narrative and entertaining animation, it did not mean to waste an hour and a half. Save time and money and see BOLT <br /> Damn instead. Not enough lines, but I feel that in summary ... Well, I agree with a review above - this is like a Cold War propaganda story. Perhaps it would have been more interesting if the flies had made it, revealing the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies had died in the first minute. BTW - why were all the main character birds deformed? - no one had the full compliment of limbs!
