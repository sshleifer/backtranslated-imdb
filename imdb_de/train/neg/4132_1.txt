The feature of early 21st-century cinema challenges various evil creatures and villains. We have not seen such things since Godzilla v King Kong and so on. It always sounds great on paper when you splice, and in the haze of goodies, you have an inspired idea and see what it looks like before you like Beethoven's symphonies. Then you write it. Great ideas like all vampires are female. Ergo hot, seductively deadly, but in a sense I want to go under somehow. And all zombies are men. Well, that's what men are for a woman after being thrown on the right or being cheated on? So it looks good to actually do it. Then the rot begins. Most fight. It does not happen much. Another fight. Philosophical noodles and cod. Eureka, we figured out how to win. Another big fight and the end. Sounds good, right? If it were an indie company, it would be great. But this is Hollywood with the eye on the money: shine instead of what the fans want. It could have been wonderfully soaked.
