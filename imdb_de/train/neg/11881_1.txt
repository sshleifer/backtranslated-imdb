This movie is nothing like "Office Space" except in the premise. Office space was funny. I would not recommend this movie to anyone as I did not laugh once during the entire movie. Mr. Cornbluth's smug tirades quickly become more annoying than Jason Alexander's in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, you can rent a car for free or check it out at another house so you can leave it when needed.
