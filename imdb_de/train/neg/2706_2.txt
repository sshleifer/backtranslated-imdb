Yes, people are racist. People are racist even in college. That's a good point, and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times in countless films. What distinguishes Higher Learning from the pack is that it deals with racism in the most fist and in a predictable way, oh yes, it's also racism in school, how Frankenstein deals with most problems becomes brutal and brutal lazily way over the head again and again. Most of the characters are cartoon-style, one-dimensional cartoons (lesbian feminist, angry black man) that respond to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of defying stereotypes, this movie is overpopulated with them. Furious black men feel betrayed, feminists hate men, etc. (A feminist even holds a sign saying "Dead Men Do not Rape." See what I mean?) I do not want to reveal anything, but in this case, film If someone looks like an unpredictable loner or a rapist, he will probably behave the way you expect. The changes that the characters undergo seem to be obvious to everyone except the people in the movie. The big turn in the plot depends on whether the violent neo-Nazis are like violent neo-Nazis or not. I guess you just have to watch to see what happens. <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with this film is that it should be "gross" and "hard", but it makes Nazis the bad guys. I agree that Nazis are evil, but that's my point. Everyone thinks Nazis are bad; We are not breaking new ground here. Nazis have been portrayed as rogues since the 1930s. The film does not challenge views and does not make courageous statements. These are just issues that we all know in an awkward, school-wise way. Being anti-rape, anti-racism and anti-Nazi is not exactly a tough attitude in a controversial matter. Higher learning is predictable, cartoonish and in a word stupid. Avoid at all costs.
