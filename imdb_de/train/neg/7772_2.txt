This is a low film. It has no real conspiracy. We are never initiated into other motives than prosperity. The characters are among the worst actors ever shot. The threat seems to be supernatural but is controlled by these three older people. Why are they doing what they are doing? to scare other members of the group? I dont know. There is some fog from a fog machine rolling around the halls and everyone seems to be scared. Does it do something? I dont know. There is some nakedness for its own sake. I am always surprised to see it so old in films. In that sense, things have actually calmed down during this time. In any case, people are running around like chickens, ready for the ax. You have no plan; no resources; No nothing. There are about five silly highlights in the movie. Who are these people and "there" is a ghost or demon. What happened to the other people? I urge everyone to tell me with confidence. What a mess.
