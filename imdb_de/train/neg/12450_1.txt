The ten-minute story took two hours. If halfway, nothing was important, I should have left. But always hopeful I stayed. And stayed behind with guilt because he was wasting time. Acting was fine, but the plot is so transparent and weak. The script is as lame as it could be, but leaving the ten-minute plot does not leave room for good conversation.
