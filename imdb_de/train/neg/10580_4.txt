I saw this last week after I picked up the DVD cheaply. I have wanted to see it for ages and found the storyline very interesting. So my disappointment was great, to say the least. I thought the lead actor was very flat. That kind of part required a performance like Johny Depp's in The Ninth Gate (of which this is almost a complete rip-off), but I guess TV budgets are not always enough for that kind of acting. <br /> <br I also thought the direction was confused and boring, just a reminder that Carpenter has not made a decent movie since In the Mouth of Madness. As for the story, I was disappointed there too! There was no way I could live up to my expectations, I think, but I found the payout and explanation bad and the way he ended up getting the film anti-climactic was, to say the least, not one of the main causes of AICN, and you may find that he loves his cinema, but I would have liked a better result from such a good starting condition. I brought the DVD to the store the same day!
