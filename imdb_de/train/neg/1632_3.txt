An apparent vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), As a hot Charles Bronson, who wanders around to mop up the 'scum' that has overrun her parents or grandparents and impressed young guys with her karate skills. In a key scene, she intervenes to stop a rape, and an idiot policeman throws him in jail, so after a few cool shower scenes and an abusive seduction in the prison dam, she has to take the law into her own hands. I think there were many films like this? The script is stupider than usual, if you can believe that. Mani is exactly the type of showbiz who would co-produce her own role as Death Wish, and I find this guy sporadically adorable, but the film is a clumsy device. Competent actors would be wasted on the bastard roles here and would actively undermine the fantastic DA in mining incompetence and a judge who must be the producer's uncle.
