I was watching this movie tonight, forcing myself to stick to it, though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them, because the two main actors, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were their big movie stars Time and I wanted to see her in "something else", which surely was. Both gave excellent performances, but with disgusting characters. <br /> <br /> In fact, the entire movie is a shabby little town in Mexico, inhabited by almost uniformly disagreeable characters (the doctor is of course the big exception). , What Michèle Morgan ever sees in Philippe to fall in love with is never explained. <br /> <br /> This is supposedly based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think was that if Sartre's work is something like this film, it must be a very mediocre attempt to imitate Camus' masterful novel, The Plague, which dealt with a plague in North Africa. <br /> <br /> A well-functioning but uninteresting movie.
