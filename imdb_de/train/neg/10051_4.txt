I gave this 4 stars because there are many interesting topics that many have already mentioned. From domestic violence to sexuality to many taboos. Outside of the hustle and bustle, I would not call this horror as much as I would call it science fiction. <br /> <br /> It is dark, depressing and hopeless. Even though I do not mind a less than happy end, I'm really tired of the clich√© "human eyes," which is central to any movie. I know that today you can not get a degree in Liberal Arts without bowing to self-hatred as a member of the human race; Notice that the ALIENS who kill the humans are evil! If you read this and believe that humankind deserves death, just go out, find a lake, and swim until your arms are tired. That way you will not be around to direct the next movie or write the next book telling me that I deserve to die for life. It is stupid, not thoughtful and boring.
