If I make a list of the absolutely worst movies I've ever seen, this movie is always there. It has no redeeming qualities. It took a will to get through it all, and I would rather shed my own blood than get through it again. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with that? I tell you the story of my journey to see her in the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to a midnight show on a Saturday night. I, the only ones in the theater, were myself and a bunch of loud, boisterous, rather restless teens sitting somewhere behind me. Obviously, they had no good time on a Saturday night and had come to this "comedy" to laugh. Before the movie started, they laughed and joked during the previews and made loud comments from a great old time. It was annoying at the border. If they had continued their unbroken enthusiasm in the actual movie, I might have said something, but I felt tolerant and compassionate for their spirited fun, so I let go. And they calmed down when the movie started. <br /> <br /> Why am I telling you all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" by the impact it had not only on myself, but also on this crazy bunch. <br /> <br /> Not one person laughed in the theater during the entire movie. Not once. Not myself, not the boisterous kids. Absolute silence, apart from the soundtrack. And when the movie was over and the lights were on, we all slowly came out of the theater in gloomy silence. It could have been a funeral. <br /> <br /> This was the effect this "comedy" produced. No laughter, no enjoyment, but absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing, depressing movie and not a bit weird. Preachy, selfish, depressing, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I think Mel Brooks's "Blazing Saddles" is shortlisted for Funniest Movie Ever. I still have the impression that the same gentleman is probably responsible for the Least Funny Movie Ever. In short, if you feel too happy, give this movie a fuss. Otherwise, do not say I did not warn you.
