"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is a nonsense. The acting is terrible, the atmosphere is absent and the characters are uninteresting. The only scary thing about this piece of scum is that the majority of IMDb users gave it a 10. This is really terrible. No heap, no tension, no violence, nothing. Bruce Cambell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely wasted, the side cast is also terrible. Yes, some people especially like this image A mainstream society, but hardcore horror fans or gore-hounds will not like this crap. Personally, I hate horror comedies. I prefer serious horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" or "Last House on the Left" In my opinion, a real horror movie is scary, overly bloody and disturbing, with no stupid humor that usually ruins the whole concept. This movie is not scary, not bloody, is not even funny as a comedy Do not waste your precious time.
