The fact that I did not like the music is a very personal opinion, not the historical inaccuracies. I realize that this is an opera and not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especially if other people are mistaken. Abbu Abas was the mastermind of this staged operation and reorganized on board the shiph due to discoveries to rid 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, including Samir Kuntar, a hideous terrorist whose story you can find when you search Google for "klinghoffer samir kuntar "search. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even though he never entered Achile Lauro. Ben Laden never entered the planes that hit the WTC, did he? *** Possible Corruptors *** The film almost excuses the actions and reactions of the terrorists out of terror they might have lived, repeatedly stressed and exaggerated how much the Israelis did them to hurt them. However, they never represent the damage that the Palestinians have ever done to the Israelis. The film uses (rather scary !!!) images from the horror of Sabra and Chatila, and nothing is said that implies the general belief that Israel is responsible, without ever mentioning that it is a Syriac-Lebanese Army was who led the police massacre. <br /> <br /> Acting was generally very bad, but I think that's what opera singers can expect. <br /> <br /> In another note, I am shocked at how someone can excuse terrorists to kill a hostage because the hostage has tried to stir the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists, adding that the person should not be considered compassionate because it supports Zionism. Imagine how little pity his wife was and spit out the terrorists who shot her husband and dumped his body in the sea. I hope nobody in the world is as cruel as you (wink wink)
