The movie was a huge disappointment. Especially because it was headed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such gloomy standards. Bad screenplay (almost nonexistent) and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at most odd times killed the humor the movie could offer. Some scenes were funny, but it was probably only 5 minutes of the entire duration. The processing was pathetic. Dire! Overall, the film was disappointing, as the lack of history was all too obvious. In fact, very few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the break. <br /> <br /> You would not miss anything if you do not watch the movie. It is not worth spending valuable ticket money for this film. Wait until it appears on TV ...
