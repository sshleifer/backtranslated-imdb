This movie had good intentions and a good story to work with. The director and scriptwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a boring, boring filmstrip that made me feel like I was back in Mr. Hartford's 8th grade in social science - then at 67. <br /> <br /> What a Waste, please, please take this story with you and turn it into a real movie - history deserves it. <br /> <br /> Each time a scene had potential, we had only a few clich√©s combined with black and white material that they were likely to receive from the History Channel to show the action. Shameful. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this boring party. The other drama was unbelievably boring - it suited the movie well, and whoever played the captain set a new standard for cable delivery. <br /> <br /> However, if you are ready to face the numerous shortcomings of the movie and it's not about being impressed or entertained, but want to learn more about the USS Mason, it's worth it to see it ,
