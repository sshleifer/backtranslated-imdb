Stupid, often ridiculous game with the landing of a spaceship and the resulting devastation that causes Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the people in his orbit. In the "Terms of Endearment" of 1983, Shirley MacLaine's son-in-law showed so much depth and promise. Over the years, Daniels could not get a good, meaty role in the hands. Instead, he is in inhuman comedies like "Stupid and Dumber". <br /> <br /> As for this picture, it fails on topic. At least the television program produced a variety of situations. In the movie, we constantly have slapstick and people who turn into monsters while the government imprisons Martian-Martin. <br /> <br /> The role of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of the movie's failure. On television, Pamela Britton portrayed a small person involved in situations in which the Martian left her confused. In the movie version, a blonde bombshell like Brown, tries the romantic entanglement. <br /> <br /> TV star Ray Walston plays a small role as a government agent or is he really like that? <br /> <br A big disappointment for those who enjoyed the TV show so much.
