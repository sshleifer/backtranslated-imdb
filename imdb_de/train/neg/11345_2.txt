I mean the word "pedestrian". Apparently, the producers of the film forgot to let something interesting happen. Faith Domergue can do better. She's supposed to be the mysterious, vengeful cobra goddess torn by Marshall Thompson's love (there's an idea, is not there?). Instead, she's an ordinary 1950s housewife, and the only flat expression she wears during the movie makes me think they shot everything in the early morning before Faith drank her coffee. As for the rest of the cast, they are all so seriously "all-American" that the result is ridiculous. This will be more productive in Val Lewton's The Cat People. I think "Cult of the Cobra" really should be called "cult of the contractual obligation". Why else would so many otherwise talented people go on a sleep walk through a slow, predictable outage like this one?
