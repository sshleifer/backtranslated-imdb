Years ago I saw The Godfather and it impressed me, the atmosphere of the film was first class, the acting was unforgettable and the action a classic. I recently bought the trilogy, and after watching Part 1 again, I looked intently at Part 2 ... I was so glad to spot early in Part 2 that this was a fitting sequel to the great godfather movie, again everything was just perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG! I wish I had stopped at II. The plot was not good, it seemed to me a story, just to have a story, the characters were weak, especially the daughter. Pacino's protégé was a faint figure who would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then there are scenes like Corleone, with all the costumes of the Catholic Church in full choir, the murderer riding on horseback into the sunset, the invisible helicopter machine firing the meeting (where the 'goodies' get off and everyone else is shot ), Daughter and first cousin, roll the pieces of pasta over a board, the pathetic shooting on the steps .... orange juice for diabetes (a man with his intelligence and cunning is not ready for an emergency?) ... NO, it was not good and with the best will in the world I will not be able to see it again. But I will see 1 & 2 many times over the years.
