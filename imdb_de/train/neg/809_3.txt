I expected something from "K-911", I mean, it looked like a sweet movie I could get into. I always loved the dog comedy. But it looked like it was James Movie, not Jerry Lee. The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really had no chemistry at the beginning. Not to mention that James seemed to have a totally sexist view in the film, although the author did not go in that direction. James really annoyed me for more than half of the movie. The dogs were the real stars and that's pretty sad that they threw the actors out the window. <br /> <br /> I am glad that not only I at IMDb think that this was a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully James will realize that it was his brother Jim who was talented, not an insult, but not everyone can be his star sibling. Do not you wish that Ashlee Simpson would take the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
