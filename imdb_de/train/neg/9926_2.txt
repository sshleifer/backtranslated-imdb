I just watched the 30th Anniversary Edition of Blazing Saddles, one of my favorites of all time !! The TV pilot from Black Beard stunk. The plot was not there and the drama was not good. It was obviously an attempt to capitalize on the success of Blazing Saddles, and there have been TV programs that have managed to get big movies, but that would never have worked. Considering that television did not even make the farting sounds for so long when the movie was broadcast, it's unimaginable that you thought you could put a show on TV with the "N" word. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing many familiar faces !!! There have been quite a few actors / actresses that I've recognized over the years from other shows. I had to write down all the names and do a few searches. That was fun. I argued with my mother if Steve Landesberg came from Barney Miller or Mash. I have won! :)
