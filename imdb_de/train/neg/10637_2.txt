I'm sorry that I bought this series. I expected more action, a more objective image and more consistency. This is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm or romance, it's just boredom. I think the actors work pretty weak, too. O'Donnell may seem charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this image he lacks any charm. Probably, as he gets older, he loses his childish charm, but does not gain the charm of an adult. No wonder it has not been shown in many countries and is sold at 40% of the recommended price in the UK and has not even been published in the Netherlands.
