I'll tell you what happened. Some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows on TV. Do we really need a big screen recovery? Did you ask the fans? I wonder how all fans would feel when they make a remake of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland who would take out all the music and make a drama out of it. Do you think that would appeal to them? This movie does not have the same feel as the original. Sure, the original was a bit cheesy at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice. They got into trouble because they were always prepared to get into trouble. Their main goal was to help the people who came through the city. For the people who made this film, it was all important, they might never have seen the original idea. My big question is, what are you going to ruin next?
