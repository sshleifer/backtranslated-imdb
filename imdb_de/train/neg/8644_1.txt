This is a complete hoax ... <br /> <br /> The film was clearly filmed in the northwest Indian state of Rajasthan. Take a look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; The entire script is Hindi - language, which is used in India. The ride is through typical Jaipur roads. Also the palace is located in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The filmmakers in their (about the movie) DVD Bonus seem to give the impression that they have risked their lives in Kabul and the surrounding area. Almost all of her action scenes are filmed in India. The scene in which a group sings by the fire is so fake that they did not even consider changing it to Afgani's folk song. You have just recorded the Rajasthani folk song. How do I know that because I have traveled extensively in this area. They are just on the tape to make the subject big. I challenge the filmmakers to deny it.
