It was Jon Pertwee who said, "It's very difficult to be funny, but very easy to be stupid." If that's the case, PASTY FACES is "very easy". David Baker (as director / screenwriter) and his cast seem to have the impression that the comedy steals scenes and style from superior Britcoms like LOCK STICK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping fast up and down voice very loud. Alan McCaffrey suffers particularly from this kind of OTT performance, but not enough to ruin the movie because there is not enough film to ruin. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts, especially in the script. I could not understand why it ended like that. It just seemed very abrupt and stupid. Oh, and other glaring mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the US and a green card to work there. This movie makes you think you could get off a plane and begin a new life in America without permission - that you are still being paid to donate blood in America. People I know in America and who donate blood tell me that I have paid the donations that were discontinued a few years ago. You can also buy any kind of weapon in a gun shop. As far as I know, the gun laws in America are different from state to state, but no arms shops sell antitank weapons over the counter. So we have a very mistaken view of America from a very unreal and oh so unsteady film. Maybe this is revenge for BRAVEHEART, a very Hollywood view of the Scots? Maybe, but that does not stop PASTY FACES from being a crap comedy
