The name of Nick Stahl, the young cast and the attractive cover of the VHS let me buy and watch this movie, expecting to see a good teen slash movie. What a crap! The clich√©d script, the dialogues and the performances are terrible, terrible, very bad, terrible, terrible? In summary, a complete waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, just an absolutely boring story with shameful plot points. The film opens with six characters, usually three couples, together like a group of friends, but in fact very unpleasant persons who seem to be enemies and play a ridiculous, meaningless game called "taboo", each of them playing yes or No writes certain taboo issues. That's it: no previous development of the characters, the viewer does not know who he is, his motives and his relationship. Then there is an ellipse one year later, and the same group is gathered in a New Year's Eve party and insulted in a very dirty way. But the plot and the phrases are so ridiculous, predictable, mediocre and unbelievable that they do not deserve an extra line in my review. Just a note: Do not waste time and money on this garbage. You will certainly regret it. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo? Jogando Com o Assassino" ("Taboo? Playing with the Murderer")
