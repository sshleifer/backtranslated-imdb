I saw this movie for a project about love. Tell Nicolas Cage to find out what it feels like to be his character and then read the lines he says again. My life can not go on ... I accidentally cut my hand ... my brother was nearby. Obviously his fault. And since when have Happy Endings included the nice guy who cares mum sad and alone. No closure, bad script and insufficient extension for minor characters. Save yourself unless you want a good laugh. The costumes were made appropriately and the extras did an excellent job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie, but stay a bit more genre-specific. I can not recommend this movie to anyone I know because it is not an intellectual movie. It is not a chick movie. It is not a strict romantic. And I can not show children because of the sex and the following questions. All in all, just not a good strip.
