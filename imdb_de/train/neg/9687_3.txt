This is a stunning movie. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sexual relations between men and women is lessened by a number of men and women who can only be described as a collection of strange bullets and outsiders. Greenaway admits his inspiration for Fellini's film "8 1/2", but although Fellini is a titan of world cinema, Greenaway is not. <br /> <br /> He has neither the ease of the Maestro nor the ability to convey feelings and emotions with skillful clarity. <br /> <br /> He is presumptuous, the film is divided into chapters with a written introduction to each as if the viewer has to be guided into the movie, with the exception that the written messages only get screened for few seconds, not long enough to be read by the audience, with the result that they are largely ignored. <br /> <br /> For women, only two can be considered spectators: Palmira, played by Polly Walker and Giaconda by Natacha Amal. The rest seeps away with vulgarity. Both women and men withdraw from the harsh light of reality into the muted shadows of fantasy. Greenaway obviously wants to point out that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. The women themselves are depressing as they render their services for money. The relationships between men and women are embedded in a commercial transaction. <br /> <br /> There is no feeling of joy or happiness or love in the movie, in fact there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant: <br /> <br /> The suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son, Philip and Storey Emmental, played by John Standing and Matthew Delamere. The callous disdain of the two men that Giaconda carries her child actually gets pregnant twice, the first fetus is broken off and the second time she is sent to a destination that the men have selected from a logbook. Both men have sex with a woman who has no legs (half the woman in the title). The beast between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, with a pig called Hortense. Father and son share women. Women enjoy being sexually beaten. The father sleeps with the corpse of his dead wife. Fortunately, none of these scenes are shown sexually, just hinted. <br /> <br /> The implied humiliation of women is so no wonder the film was booed at its premiere in Cannes. Even more extraordinary is that the actresses of the film defend themselves against him and show once again that the naivety of women has no limits and that women get exploited by men. <br /> <br /> Greenway's style of direction is pretentious; it is a triumph of style over substance, a portrayal of film as art, accompanied by the renunciation of common sense. Greenaway seeks to achieve the grandeur of surrealism, but manages only to demonstrate the banality of human relationships.
