I have tried to see this show several times but for a show called "That 70s Show" I do not find much, apart from a few haircuts and occasional hints on disco that actually create the 70s - the decade in which I grew up am. From the episodes I've seen, most plots and jokes could be put in any period. Take away the novelty (supposed) of the 70s and the show is neither interesting nor funny. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a show that will enhance the experience of America's youth In the 1970's, in my humble opinion, you can not do "The Wonder Years" better.
