The box for "To Die For" has tricked me - a shirtless shirtless and the promise of some laughs and sex. There were many of Thomas Arklie (Simon) who is good for the eyes, but no laughter and little sexiness. <br /> <br /> The couple, Mark and Simon, are said to have been together for several years, but none of the characters are interesting enough to care, making it hard to imagine caring for each other. The mistake seems to be in the script, not in the performances. Both actors do the best they can. <br /> <br /> The end is juicy and untouched (well, not completely untouched, I felt relief that it was over). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie about gay relationships and AIDS that is funny, "Parting Glances" is much better.
