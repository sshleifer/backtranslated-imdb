I will be honest. The only reason I've seen this on TV is that it's in the IMDb 100. And now I wonder if the one and a half hours of my life were really worth another review on the same list. <Br /> <br /> Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who is in a fierce battle with the Universal Soldiers after the main computer has drawn a "HAL" to defend themselves. And yes, after all the obligatory explosions, shootings and car chases, he is the last one. Combined with terrible drama and a bit boring setup, it ensures that it only fits into the notorious list. <br /> <br /> Only for idiots like me who want to see this complete list. 10.2.
