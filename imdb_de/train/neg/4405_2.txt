All I can say is that before the movie I had no clue who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what her life story was ... and I must confess that the movie was barely of any help to reach that data ... and even it I could not persuade myself to research anything by typing a few words on the Google website. All I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain was great with her mute countenance. She played really well and showed a deep depression status, as it really is. After all, based on The film's script has happened in Turkey and Tehran as well as in Afghanistan. But trust me, I'm familiar with the area, it was about an Arabian desert in Morocco. Turks and Persians are completely different in face and culture even in a language that is not Arabic. <br /> <br /> I suppose for a film like this - documentary - a thorough research into all these little elements is mandatory.
