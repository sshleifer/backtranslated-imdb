If you really want to waste two hours of your life, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Watch the TV programs. 2) Find the movie "Men in White". 3) When 'Men in White' lights up, sit and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's it. After two hours of bad puns, terrible (and not so funny) movie references, and something of the possibly lowest production levels ever made in recent history, you've wasted two hours of your life wondering why /> <br /> Why did I do that? I was stupid enough to believe that this movie could actually be good. It was not. <br /> <br /> However, if you are old enough to remember Power Rangers, you may spot familiar faces during the movie. To lower production costs, Saban (who also manufactures Power Rangers) decided to sprinkle old monster costumes out of every popular sticky toy spawn franchise in the movie. I've spotted a lot of old monsters from episodes that I saw as a kid, so you could say it has a certain nostalgia value. <br /> <br /> But if you want to see the actual performance Ranger Monster, have a look at the Power Rangers themselves. It is much better than this piece of rubbish. (And that says something!)
