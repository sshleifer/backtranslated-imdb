Rajkumar Santoshi undoubtedly has directed the biggest movies and biggest cinema hits of Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie misses all expectations as this movie features two great actors, Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, and when you have these two actors in the same movie you need to make a Magnum opus. <br /> <br /> In the later part of the movie, you can see that Amitabh Bachchan's voice was deprived of another person who was due to his illness. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie did not have the right character development and the cinematography was not good and one thing Bollywood should learn is that they should only use visual effects when needed and when they are used should be on a high budget. The script had so many shortcomings that it apologizes to viewers to take their phone calls instead of watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The new commissioner shakes her leg well, but could not act Well, but where the movie loses big time is the storyline script and the movie Matography. <br /> <br /> A talented actor like Bhoomika Chawla was wasted in both the movie and Sushant Singh. <br /> <br /> But every director in his career makes a bad movie. <br /> <br /> So just watch if you're a fan of multi-rigid-flop movies.
