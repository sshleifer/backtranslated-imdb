You already know how painful it is to watch this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst movies should ever include one of the most beautiful cars. Why the cars should not only be victims of violations, but also the only true actors and performers. So how on earth can you, Porsche, Lamborghini or whatever, enable these people to get in touch with your cars and ruin your reputation for which you're taking millions. It is painful for those who love cars. It's painful for those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want my money back !!!
