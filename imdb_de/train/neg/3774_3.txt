This movie is stale and misses the target. Compared to the '89 Batman, it is a long way off that he tries to coppy. This woman singer, what her name can not, can not act, and we see why her movie bearer died. Notice how this film died at the box office. Even on TV nobody sees this movie. My uncle and father were expecting Batman, and the movie's impression is more like cop rock. Not worth renting 3/10
