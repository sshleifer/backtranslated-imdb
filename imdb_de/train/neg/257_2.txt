I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I enjoy 99% of all the movies I see. <br /> <br /> And I got out of this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I admit, it may have something to do with the two white middle aged women in the back of the theater laughing at everything ("Oh no, Jamie knocks on a door!) HEE HEE HEE! "), But .. that was just incredibly annoying. There could be no permanent camera shot and no camera shot from a conventional angle ... everything had to be in-your-face, loud and annoying. <br /> <br /> The villain tried to be smooth Malkovich-like, but at this time it is just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. Of all the characters, too many lines you've seen, too many you've heard before, and too many "hard guy" lines ... and I do not mind, really, as long as it's a bit of originality to. In fact, the entire cast was just shitty. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx, and I think he's really funny and I thought he was funny in this movie ... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure anything else. <br /> <br /> This film needed less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotion, more emotion and more Jamie Foxx. I gave it a 2.
