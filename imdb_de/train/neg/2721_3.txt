I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi in the 50s, but that's not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the film was a natural vehicle for a classic teen bopper sci-fi movie, the director was too keen to wear the movie. It's clear he worked without money, because the whole movie is filled with bloated dialogues that go on forever. I've never seen so much time for killing in a movie. <br /> <br /> There are probably less than 60 seconds of "blob footage" in the entire movie, and most of the rest are engaged in a lot of poorly written dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but, Heavens, how could the casting have believed that someone in his right mind would believe her as a teenager?
