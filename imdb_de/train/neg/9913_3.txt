This is one of the cheap TV movies where the characters have lost their meaning. The premise of the story, the kidnapping of a son by the boy's father, is very good. But history seems to be believing. If the mother is advised not to do anything that you know well, she will do it. It is a bit far-fetched and does not deserve a visit.
