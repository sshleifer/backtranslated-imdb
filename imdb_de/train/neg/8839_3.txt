Nice try and good ideas (redemption of the prostitutes, people helping each other, ...), but a bad result ... The director obviously tried to imitate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung by imitating an ambience that depicted The only problem is that this Vietnam has long since disappeared and "The Duff of the Green Papaya" had a historical background ... trying to create this kind of ambience (muted sounds and the slow pace of life) to project. ..) in modern days leaves a sense of forgery. It also quickly creates a feeling of boredom and the result becomes too obvious. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang because there Harvey Keitel, ex-Marine in the film, was probably stationed during the war ... But nobody or only speaks in South Vietnam very few with the actor's clip "Northern Accent" ... seriously odd even for a poor Vietnamese speaker. <br /> <br /> An old poet with leprosy ... very doubtful (no illness for people of his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write Vietnamese poetry in detail, ... even more dubious ... <br / > <br />
