Take a look at the movie's website, it took more time than writing the script for this movie. It could not be more. Original story? Original? You must have found the script hidden between the Old Testament or face legal consequences for this piece of horn-tooting. High-end special effects? Come on, I could do it better with an Atari 7600 and a pot of earwax. Stylish cinematography? Oh yes, the funniest home video look in the US is still a classic. I'm sure there was not much money available for this title so the SFs are not really good, sometimes a bit bad or just weird, but it's the story that makes this movie a waste of time and money. 4 stories that were rolled into one and all mindless pieces of sight before and after completion.
