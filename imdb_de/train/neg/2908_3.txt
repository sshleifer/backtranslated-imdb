Based on one of Gabriel Marquez's books and possibly brilliant literature, this movie adaptation is really shitty as it's more like a fight against sleep than looking forward to cinematographic treats. The story is about an old couple whose son has died leading a life of poverty and whose main character is a rooster who hopefully will someday bring some money for an upcoming cockfight. I'm not in the mood to inject more words about this useless, overbearing piece, only that you can see Salma Hayek here, but only sit in front of your screen for 90 minutes? No gracias .....
