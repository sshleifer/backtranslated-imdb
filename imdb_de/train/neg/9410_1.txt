As long as you can stand it! If you like to see people waking up, getting up, getting dressed, showering, preparing dinners, watching each other, having sex in the dark, then going back to bed to sleep ... if you have sticky apartments, narrow bedrooms and kitchens, long minutes Silence ... If you feel bored for two hours and want to feel the thrill of "true intimate false art", then you will like it. If you do not, just try to watch a good movie, there are thousands. "As long as you are here", but do we want to stay? This German film received the Torino Gay Film Festival award: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision as the festival presented many talented films. Maybe to be nice to a German, as he is not often awarded? Well, "The Lives of Others" did it ... but this one is excellent but not gay. So maybe it's a question of fashion. Germans are they "in" again? No matter what? Or maybe just for the eyes of some directors?
