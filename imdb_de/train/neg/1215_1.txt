I do not often give star ratings, but the computer does not let me make negative numbers. <br /> <br /> The opening titles show us that we are already in deep water. Although it is a low budget movie, 17 producers are counted. No. No. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, Kenneth's abusive husband joins his family in an upscale condominium. The house is a pigsty. His wife Della (Kim Basinger) has the kids running amok all day. <br /> <br /> OK. We are already in deep water. Ms. Basinger was 55 years old when the movie came out. Are these your children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. Della drives to the mall, a long scene that could have been cut. To obscure the idea of ​​eeeeeeevil-male aggression, which is furious in the universe, she drives footballers in full uniform who play in streaming rain on Christmas Eve. For sure. For a bonus she sees a vehicle to which a slaughtered deer is bound. <br /> <br /> However, we get suspense in the driving scenes. It is raining and the traffic is bad. First, we see Della driving and smoking at the same time. Later, Della tries to drive at the same time and talk on her mobile. Then she turns around and looks for the overloaded back seat for the charger for the phone. <br /> <br /> She wanders through the mall and sees an old college friend trying to buy things, but her credit card is declined - gosh, maybe her husband is grumpy because he's broke, but that Script is too complicated for you to follow him a lot she runs from the most ridiculous gang in the history of the movies. A white boy (Lukas Hass, as his career goes down the toilet), a black, an Asian and a Spanish. Imagine a company of Up with people who went bad, and you have the idea. <br /> <br /> Although they have a weapon, they give them the attitude. A mall cop comes to investigate the riot. They shoot him in the head and fire more than once. The parking lot is as crowded as it can be, and no one notices. <br /> <br /> Della flees in her car and instead of opting for a police station or a well-lit secure area, she drives to a construction site where she kills all four Bad Boys one at a time with the tools (literally) at hand , <br /> <br /> BIG spoiler ahead. <br /> <br /> She drives home. The car kicks out and she walks through the pouring rain. Check the children, go downstairs, and when their husband asks cheerfully what she got in the mall, he shows him the gun and shoots up close. <br /> <br /> The experience with the four punks should actually result in personal empowerment for Della. Instead, we know that their children are likely to spend Christmas in foster homes or in a group at home because the state will pick them up while they respond to a murder case. The four punks can be classified in self-defense as a legitimate manslaughter. The man, different story. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw this on cable. If I had seen it in a theater (did it get a release?), I would have been angry. I'm just sad how talents like Mrs Basinger and Mr Haas are wasting themselves on trash. <br /> <br /> A very good thing. This was written and directed by Susan Montford.
