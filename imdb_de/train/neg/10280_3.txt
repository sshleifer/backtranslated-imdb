Did HeidiJean really see this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Boring, bland and completely without imagination and heart. I watched this movie over and over again and wondered who the hell was thinking that Carly Pope could star in this movie! The woman has no recognizable personality and shows a completely weak performance. As always, Baransky was great and the only thing that interested him. Probably their involvement was the only reason why this project was green from the start. Maybe I'm expecting too much for a Lifetime movie that was played 15 days before Christmas, but I figured it would be a pretty cute little movie with another director and a new JJ with an actress who at least could arouse sympathy could be .
