"Black Angel" is a minor event. June Vincent tries as a woman to rescue her husband from the electric chair after being found guilty of an old acquaintance. Dan Duryea (husband of the murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Lorre has an ungrateful role as a suspect. This movie Noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer without achieving anything special. It's nice enough, but then it does not make sense at some point, and solving the puzzle triggers one of those big reactions, "give me a break." This end alone could have completely submerged the movie, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either. Vincent is a weak heroine and Duryea has never been good at playing good boys. I love movie noirs, but that was a real disappointment.
