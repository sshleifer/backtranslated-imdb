This is the craziest movie I have ever seen, but in all fairness it is worth seeing and pretty funny. I do not think the filmmakers thought it was typical Hollywood blockbuster quality. It's just a stupid movie about a serial killer who is doused with toxic waste and causes a reaction with him and the snow (there in the middle of winter). Then he turns into a killer snowman, enough to make you laugh. This movie is really stupid, but funny. The murders are hilarious. I would not advise you to buy it (like me - the cover looked good!), But if it's on TV one evening and you're ready to laugh, then keep it up.
