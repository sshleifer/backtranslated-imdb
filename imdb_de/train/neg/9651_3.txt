The movie is a total crap. We have two good performers who are a mishap and a meathead of an actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience. The story is a crap. The characters are poorly sketched. Non-existent storytelling. No editing of which one could speak. Ajay Devgan as a rock star ... that's a dream of its own. The film moves with it until decadence. The whole charade over Arjun, who brings his manna to London, made him touch his girlfriend and did not let him play in Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process). Salman Khan's exaggerated acting or faking is too painful to watch. I remember seeing some good movies from this producer Vipul Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems all the good directors fall victim to box office mania. That's what the media idiots in Mumbai created. This is another crap movie in the Wanted series with an idiot actor like Salman Khan, who has no place in a Good Hindi Cinema. He is good for Indian cinema, as is Titanic for the Winter Cruise Business. On the positive side, I like it when Asin Bharatnatyam dances when she switches to the Western dance style when the teacher is not looking.
