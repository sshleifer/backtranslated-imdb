I can not believe I wasted my time on this movie. I could not even call it a movie. It was so bad and nothing to recommend. <br /> <br /> I like low-budget movies and crazy movies, but these had bored me to death. Badly done and bad acting ruined it with curiosity. One has to wonder what these people thought when they spent money on the production of this film. I wonder what I thought to see it to the end. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. How did you publish this? Was there an audience that likes this kind of movie? It has to be because you can find this in almost every video store. But why? <br /> <br /> deserves to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, this is for you.
