Pathetic attempt to use science to justify the religion / philosophy of the new age. The two have nothing to do with each other, and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just wrong. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas of Eastern religions that reality is an illusion. As? In the subatomic world, you can never definitively predict the location of the particles at any given time. You can only state the probability that it is exactly in one place. The observation also seems to influence the event. Solid particles can pass barriers. All this is accurate so far. But then they say that this means that if you sincerely believe that you could walk through a wall, you could actually do it. This is completely Poppycock. Instead, the theory claims that you can walk through a wall at our level, but this is purely coincidental and has nothing to do with belief. Besides, you would always have to walk in the wall for eternity to have the slightest chance of going through the wall. The odds are astronomical against it. <br /> <br /> This is just one example of how they misrepresent science. Much more annoying, however, is the story of an unfortunate photographer played by Marlee Maitlan. About halfway through the picture, it becomes so confused that it becomes incomprehensible. To do something with negative thoughts that lead to addiction and self-hatred. It may be true, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Also, string theory is the hot news in physics these days. Rather than wasting your time with this muck, renting The Elegant Universe, an amazing series for NOVA on PBS, will give you a history of physics from Newton and Gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in just 3 hours Offers episodes. Quantum mechanics is quite well explained there, if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation.
