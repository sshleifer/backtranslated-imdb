The action sounded as if she had promised. To be honest, I have not seen the whole movie. After about an hour in the movie, I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth it until its completion? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from another species without rejecting it. Not even the premise that he was being prosecuted by secret government agencies for a human / wolf transplant. That was because the film was written badly, the acting had no emotions and I did not understand the different dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes. As he ran into the zoo with a dog pack and left them at the entrance to the zoo gate, the phrase "If you can not run with the big dogs, do not leave the porch" ran through my bored thoughts. Save the time and skip this movie. I can assure you, if you dare to look at it, you sit there with your chin open, wondering why anyone is wasting money, time, energy, and effort to make this insulting outrage over American cinema.
