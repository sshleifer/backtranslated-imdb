I'm not going to say this movie is awful because I've seen worse, but it's not even halfway decent. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I could not really figure out what was going on and where things were going. When the movie was over, I scratched my head. I checked all the way to the end of the credits to see if they had something behind them that could sort things out, but as soon as the credits ended, that was it. I felt as though I was being shot by one during the entire movie weak plot point pushed to the next, with little or no transition between the two. <br /> <br /> Character development is very flat. I could not figure out when someone was angry or had a grudge against someone. I could not say if half of the characters were just drunk, stoned or mentally handicapped, or they only had one bad actor to portray them. This movie seems to be based on stereotypes (it's hard to avoid using them when making a movie about a singer in a rock band) that should facilitate character development, as has been illustrated in many other films. Suffering from a maltreated Child or the tests of a heroin addict trying to get in. Stereotypes are easy to figure out, which would explain why so many bad movies tend to use stereotypical characters. The film, on the other hand, uses stereotypical characters left and right, but tries to keep it as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem of the characters is that they seem to have been rejected without explanation. I think that's fine, because the characters' development took so little time that I really did not have a chance to know any of them, so I never really missed any of them. <br /> <br /> And last but not least was Sadie's singing. It is terrible. The music she supports is not a laureate, but she usually drowns out the screams released by Sadie's vocal chords. I swear there's a point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought I would have to turn it off during this howl-a-thon. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is confusing. Characters are poorly developed, Georgian acting is made of wood and stiff, Sadie's character is drawn from one bad situation to another without background story or explanation. The music was unbearable and I can not imagine any good reasons to watch this movie if you are not thirsty for cinematic pain.
