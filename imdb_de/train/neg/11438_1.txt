If there ever was a worse comedy than Gray Matters, I know nothing about it. The "funny" premise of the Jewish comedy in New York is that siblings Sam and Gray get mixed up with a couple and decide to arrange Sam with a girlfriend, only to find that Gray is equally attracted to their destination - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently just a surprise to her. There is a profoundly insulting wedding sequence, a deeply embarrassing "drunken act" by Moynahan and Graham, and an idea that would embarrass forests everywhere because of their woodiness of Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek shows a complete inability to make a comedy and wants to cut it out of her CV. Molly Shannon plays the homely friend with rude insouciance. Only Alan Cumming appears on credit, but is seriously underemployed and has no job to work with. The whole catastrophe is punished by Gray's bizarre staging culminating in the penultimate scene in which she wears a comedy hat and coat, though the scene plays in a lesbian bar. It's amazing that this movie was ever released. It has no salvation function and should be avoided at all costs.
