I had some time to kill before I saw football. I saw how this movie was offered in the scifi channel. After looking at it, I thought I had come across my version when I entered the Bataan death march, when my consciousness was beaten into the beating by the Terrible movie that demolished the Mummy series and Jurassic Park. It was so bad that I thought that the opening credits were the highlight of the movie, and then it went into such a catastrophic descent that the recent decline in the stock market seemed like a hiccup. The acting was so bad that I hoped that one and all would end up buried. The leadership of Casper Van Dien made me yearn for Steven Seagal's high-profile acting in "On Deadly Ground," as his lines were so wooden that Woody Woodpecker thought of making a cameo on his shoulder. I also noticed that his emotional range was so low that I felt my kitten was more expressive when it came to eating popcorn. The direction was so disgusting that I looked longingly at my nephew's Play-3 recital, which had more pace and better visibility, and the fact that this movie seems to have been put together according to the considerations of the above-mentioned film series is a hommage The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and the producers were eco-friendly by recycling cheap special effects from class Z horror strips. What Robert Wagner, Tom Bosley, and Geoffrey Lewis have done in these films is a mystery to me, and they should see litigation against their agents for misrepresentation because they link them to such a movie thief. My warning to all is to watch this movie at your own risk, as this movie may cause the IQ to diminish on prolonged viewing. At an IMDb I noticed that sometimes salaries for movies are published. I was wondering if it was a possibility for actors to return salaries for their poor performance in such films. Be careful and avoid at all costs.
