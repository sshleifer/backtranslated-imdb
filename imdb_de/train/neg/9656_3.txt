This film has the stench made for television. However, it started with great intentions, great-looking sets and authentic props and costumes. The film quickly turned into horrible, cheesy dialogues and plummeted melodramatically from the television. The characters were so juicy that I sometimes thought they were about to melt into a pulpy puddle, and the action was so muddled and badly cut that it looked like the soldiers were just standing there and shooting at each other in turns. The Germans were so unrealistically portrayed that it was painful to watch. The only thing the German officers talked about was how wonderful the Americans are. Please take my word for it. I'm a big fan of the war genre and this movie is crap. Nevertheless, this DVD offers an excellent extra feature that covers letters from the First World War and thus does not make this rental a waste of time.
