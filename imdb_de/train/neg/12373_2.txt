The script is so ridiculous ... that in turn makes the lines of the actors sound stiff and unrealistic and unbelievable. There are repetitions of phrases - "my sweet little goddaughter" and minor variations of this line that comes to my mind ... and it's just a sloppy dialogue with the soap opera. <br /> <br /> Worse, the music is so WRONG! In addition, the bluesy main theme is terribly hilarious and completely wrong. And it usually feels overused, because the instrumentation, texture, and arrangement of the theme never change, even if the emotional context of the scene does. <br /> <br /> As soon as it appears, it stands out as the main actor from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The music is crazy, and it's like the author writes music for a soap or a sitcom - a Canadian sitcom of the 80s - and that makes you feel like we are always close to throwing on a commercial. <br /> <br /> This is so miscast, there is a lot of over-updating and it is a true expanse that so many of these characters use only one type of NY accent - a strong Bronx accent. I do not know if it's a matter of the actors' limited ability to know only a * NY accent - or if it's the director's ability to notice such a blatant anomaly. In the end, it's the amateur script with its leaden Lines that make this whole "movie" ... blow. When a foundation is shaky and unstable, it is impossible to build on without its flaws being exponentially more harmful and less flattering.
