You know, I went to "The Hills have eyes 2" to like it. I really enjoyed the original and the remake was pretty entertaining. They obviously had more money than Wes Craven had the second time for special effects. Although I still prefer the original movie, the remake was well done and it was a kind of guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for every horror fan. <br /> <br /> What brings us to "The Hills have eyes 2". Man, where do I start? The act or the absence of one is paper thin. We are not breaking new ground here. The military has decided to oversee the area and all these people appear missing. So what do we do now? Let's send the National Guard to investigate. In true Hollywood fashion, we must make them the stupidest and worst soldiers ever seen. I have never seen this premise. To make a long story short: They have the mutants who kill the idiot soldiers all at once graphically. Once again Nicotero's special effects are great, but the killings, no matter how graphic, become boring and predictable. Honestly, it seemed to me that this movie was made just to get a quick buck. It was bloody and graphic, but I thought it was predictable, boring and not scary at all. For me it would have been nice if this movie contained an original thought. Wes Craven and his son had the writing assignments in common, and he was involved in many of my favorite horror movies, but unfortunately that's not part of it.
