This is one of the most irritating, nonsensical films I have ever had. Each time it looks like it's going to be okay, more sepia flashbacks come out, followed by paranoid idiocy masquerading as a social commentary. The main character Maddox is a manipulative rebel, who apparently lives without a parent or responsibility in a villa. The minor castes are all much more sympathetic and interesting, but unfortunately never developed. We never really understand that the John Stanton character allegedly led Maddox to commit the rebellion. At some point I thought, "Aha! Maddox is just crazy and secretly rewrites all these messages from the escaped patient patient Stanton, but of course that is not the case, and the whole movie turns out to be pointless, both from Maddox's perspective and From the perspective of the beholder, where is Ferris Bueller when we need him?
