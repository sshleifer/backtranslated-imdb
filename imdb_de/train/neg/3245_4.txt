David Mamet's film debut was hailed by many as a true thinker movie, a film that challenges everyone and everything. I have recently seen it for the first time and could not understand what was so great about it. <br /> <br /> The film is about a psychologist named Margaret, who is also a bestselling author. Margaret is disillusioned with her job and her inability to really help someone. She tries to correct this by helping to settle the gambling debts of her patients against a shark named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, who is the only reason to watch this movie). She discovers that Mike is actually a professional shop steward when she almost falls victim to a scam he pulls right after his meeting. Fascinated, she returns to him and asks him to show her how competitors work (she plans to use this as the subject of a new psychology book). Then she falls in love with him and accompanies him on a long conversation that he and his colleagues have set up. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go into details, but at the end of the film, this is revealed The events of the entire movie were a sophisticated scam by Mike and his friends, who betrayed Margaret of $ 80,000. <br /> <br /> At first, the big turn towards the end was very predictable. Each scene in which the scammers operated became apparent through the set design and the strange line readings. Not only that, but the audience (and the main character) know they are cheaters. Is it really such a big surprise to find out that Margaret herself was cheated? Apart from that, Margaret is said to be an intelligent psychologist who knows how to read people, but she's too easily deceived - and remembers that she knows Mike is a comrade-in-arms. <br /> <br Secondly, we believe that Margaret was betrayed from the beginning, but for the Con to finally work, she had to do some things that the cheaters had impossible predicted. First, she had to decide to pay her patient's debts so she could meet the cheaters. If she had not done that, the whole scam would have failed. All I have to say is that it is quite unreasonable to assume that a psychologist will make it his business to pay the gambling debts of a patient. Not only that, but what is the likelihood that the scammers would be in the right place at night when they decided to show up? Were they just in this bar every night, hoping she would see her visit? Another thing that could not be foreseen was that Margaret had to return to see Mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his craft. What are the chances? And yet the whole con is based on this premise. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had is the end. Margaret discovers that she has been cheated and decides to take revenge on Mike. At first, Mamet lets us believe that she's going to cheat the con, but that comes through, so the ultimate ending is that she knocked Mike down in an airport baggage area. Somehow, it just felt like a clumsy and incompetent way to end a movie about artists doing their job. Not only that, but she did not even take back the money he had stolen from her. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, you feel empty and unfulfilled. And if you predicted, as I did, that Margaret would be betrayed, you will find that revelation equally unsatisfactory.
