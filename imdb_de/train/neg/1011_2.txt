LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - Hold on. Justin Timberlake? And he is the star? I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE. In fact, I knew better. But in a moment of absolute weakness, I rented this STV. If you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in a STV, you know that this is one of two things: an indie or a dog. As in the sat-on-a-shelf. What that did And for a good reason. The conspiracy itself includes a troop of corrupt killer cops Ã  la MAGNUM FORCE, and "journalist" Timberlake is the only one brave enough to expose them. He is focused on his efforts - or maybe I should say it for his terrible acting. I turned it off when one of the bad guys was shot through my forehead and still had the foresight to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing. Just awful. The real clue to how bad this strip is is Freeman on the cover and throughout the movie, who wears a recalcitrant beard and looks like a hobo. They only know that the director was not in control. Freeman slumbers clearly.
