While "Santa Claus conquers the Martians" usually as one of the worst movies ever made, this 1959 film produced in Mexico is so bad that "SCCM" looks like "It's a wonderful life". You have to wonder what the people who made this movie thought. perhaps they considered it an allegory of the Third World over capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. Close . , They were just not very good. The same production company has made an even more disturbing version of "Little Red Riding Hood", in which the obsession of the wolf with our heroine has unmistakable hints of pedophilia. (Perhaps this was the inspiration for "Freeway.") Back to "Santa Claus": Instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas is in a satellite in geosynchronous Earth orbit (shadow of "MST3K"); Instead of elves, his toys are made by children from around the world. and he had a sophisticated spy gear to check which kids are naughty and nice. The result is like an Orwellian space welding shop. It's enough to turn off Christmas forever. These and other inexpensive Mexican children's films were dubbed in English in the early 1960s and widely used in the US. No wonder the sixties became a turbulent time in American history. The baby boomers who had to endure these "family" movies as children would be too revolutionary.
