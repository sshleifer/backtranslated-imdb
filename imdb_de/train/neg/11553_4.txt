Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after being directed by "Apocalypse Now" that made him completely unable to make a good movie? <br /> <br /> One has to wonder what the director of "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" thought as he filmed this limp film. There is Kathleen Turner a star vehicle that plays a woman who travels back in time and revives her youth because she knows what adult life has taught her, and Turner, the soldier who she is, does what It can not be saved by anyone. <br /> <br /> It does not even have a style, and given its director, one would expect that there would be nothing else if it had not otherwise. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
