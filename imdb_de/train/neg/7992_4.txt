I remember watching this movie on TV a long time ago. I remember the premise of the movie that a bunch of hotel inmates were being attacked by human ants. What I did not remember was, HOW IT WAS WHAT IT WAS! <br /> <br /> I did not watch this movie on TV until late at night. I'm sure it must have been a mistake, because movies like these usually disappear and are never to be found again! Suzanne Somers (at the peak of her career as Chrissy in Three's Company) plays a vacationer at Lakewood Manor. Construction workers build an outdoor swimming pool and accidentally disturb an ant nest. Or should I say, * MAN-EATING ANTS 'NEST * !! One of the workers is actually attacked by the ants. One minute after the other, he takes her out of his clothes one after the other and in the next minute he is covered with it. The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt. <br /> <br /> If you think this is quite far-fetched, you should see Myrna Loy, who plays a wheelchair user, who is flown by helicopter from the Manor! I could almost imagine her reluctant to think she was being kicked out of the movie! The last scenes show Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third man sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs seated blowing straws and covered with ants. <br /> <br /> That's basically the movie. There really is no "disaster" appeal or "big-star" drawing for the movie. At this time, it should be a large-format television event. Well, it's lucky if it's unloaded on your local TV station in a 4:00 am time slot. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Suzanne Somers at her best, then watch an episode of Three's Company. If you want to help Myrna Loy to do something to put bread on the table and pay the bills, then watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
