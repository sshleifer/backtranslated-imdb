This movie was worth five hits on my "Hurter Card". I saw this when I was stationed in Virginia in the mid-1970s. I saw it alone, so I was not distracted while I saw it. It sucked. It was the most ridiculous total waste of celluloid I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know that others who reviewed this movie thought it was great. I offer you the following: If it was so great, what was it for the box office? End of the discussion.
