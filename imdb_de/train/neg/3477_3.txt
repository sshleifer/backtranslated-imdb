Not as bad as you heard. There are actually some funny parts and Affleck and Applegate have pretty good chemistry. Especially Applegate is appealing and sympathetic as Afflecks love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are outstanding professionals. They are pretty good in almost everything. In the end, Surviving is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced. The attempts of dark humor seem grumpy. Affleck strives to be amiably spastic and overwhelmed, but seems disturbed. The caricature of his character is relieved in relation to Gandolfini's and O'Hara's more subdued, credible performances. Even with the relaxed standards of vacation movies, you never buy yourself into Affleck's establishment, which "leases" that family for Christmas. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes bordering on the surreal in their strangeness. The Xmas pre-evening scene full of incest humor (a son discovered when looking at nude, provocative images of his mother) that is not only funny or believable, but also disturbing. <br /> <br /> The colors in this movie are muddy, almost noiric. The house where most of the movie takes place seems gradual and cheap. <br/> <br/> "Surviving" is the fourth installment of a series of payers (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl and this) for Affleck. It remains to be seen how sustainable the damage will be.
