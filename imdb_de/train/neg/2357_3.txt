Let's hope this is the last nightmare. This is the epitome of a good cause that has gone bad. Okay, there is still some fun, but only in the most common sense. Rachel Talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise, had worked and even produced on the production staff. I do not know what she thought, but this debacle contains the human video game boy and a guest appearance by Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I had an idea of ​​what she was thinking as she wrote / led this disappointing piece of garbage. She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an overglorified popcorn movie, rather than having any resemblance to the horror, with the artificial use of a 3D end. Are not these glasses chic? And you can keep it! It's the equivalent of just spending $ 9.00 to make me rich. Here are 10 cents. Well, do not you feel so special? Sorry, but for me, I just did not feel so special. <br /> <br /> And Freddy had another facelift. I think this was the worst. The fine art that was his "look" in the earlier films was replaced by an obviously cheaper, less detailed prosthetics. He looks ... less like the burnt offering that he is meant to be, and more like a skin condition. Turning the makeup of the lead role into a series is about the same as changing the lead actor. But wait! They did that and did that. So I think that it does not matter. But it was important to me. Freddy is no longer scary. He's just ... another low-renting monster like the goblin. <br /> <br /> It's more ... a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises. Enigmatic with what one can only hope for, the authors thought that they were funny one-liners and a clever drummer (unfortunately, both views were lacking). <br /> <br /> There's nothing more to say than grabbing the popcorn and laughing, because there was no fearsome or exciting moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> It rates a 3.2 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
