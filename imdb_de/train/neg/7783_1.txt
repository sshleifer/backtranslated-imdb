Hey HULU.com is playing the Elvira Late Night horror show on their website and this movie is under the name Monsteroid. It's great fun to comment on Elvira's Crappy movie. Have fun with bad movies. Anyway, this movie really has little value except to see how bad the 70s were for horror movies. Bad Effects, Bad Dialog and just bad movie production. Avoid this if you do not want to laugh about it. While you're at HULU, check out the other movies that are right now. There are 10 episodes and some pretty decent movies with good plots and good production. You can see many of them in 480p as long as you have a good speed connection.
