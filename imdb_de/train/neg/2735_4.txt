I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I've ever seen (though my eye-giver handed me a handkerchief in anticipation of the Brendan-Fraser moment ... * sigh *). It was nice to see Cox outside the perpetually fragile "Coxism State" he is in nowadays, if only for brief moments. I also enjoyed trying to insert the episodes by the hair length (or size at JD) of the character and youthfulness of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach might be on the way to a very Chevy Chase / or is that Matthew Perry? Prat case-induced chemical slide (already confirmed on Conan). A small side note, the song (now stuck in my head) from the janitor-induced dance montage was "Diner" by Martin Sexton.
