Alexandre Aja's remake of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the highlights of 2006. It was not just a remake of a classic horror movie, it was damn good too. Almost a year later we will be treated to the continuation of this remake. While the original Scripter Wes Craven has returned as a producer and co-script, this movie simply does not rise to the level set by the original and remake. A group of military trainees pass by in the desert to meet some scientists and get advised of the first movie (at least the remaining ones and some new ones) in the mutated family. There is much to do here. What annoys me about this film is the complete lack of characterization. The viewer does not care what happens to these people because we did not get into them. Even the mutants had one last characterization and nothing this time. Gore sake for Gore is pointless. There has to be a reason for it to be interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what about rape scenes in movies lately? Here we get one for no real reason. I hope this is a series of hills that are no longer visited.
