Again, Disney manages to make a children's film that completely ignores his background. The only thing that's common with this and the original gadget cartoons are the names. The most blatant mistakes are the characters - Penny has no book, Brain has been reduced from a figure to a chic prop, Dr. Claw is a show-off rather than a bad guy, and so on, but there's more. The horrors begin in the first few minutes of the movie - calling a gadget called John Brown, does not help identify him as a classic Inspector gadget. And right at the beginning, we see Disney's blatant attempt to make each story into a love affair between a man and a woman - they introduce Brenda, which only serves to make this movie Disney-compatible. Add to this the fact that the "claw" featured in this film and the classic "Dr. Claw" are almost diagonally opposite each other and you will find that this will in no way match the original plot. What would help would be a better act to replace them - but as you suspected, Disney failed as well. The whole movie is just a gadget, stupid with fools and looking for Brenda. To make the injury even more offensive, Disney introduced the "new" gadget mobile - it does not look, works or does not think like the old gadget mobile, it's just the canonical figure "Comic Relief". Disney has obviously realized that the gadget cartoons are a comedy, so they've turned the movie into a comedy as well, but they have removed all neat, ongoing gags (like the order paper that explodes in the chief's face) and gadget them replaced, who is an idiot Gadgetmobile is a wise ass and "Claw" shows up. Someone should tell Disney that "children's film" does not imply a "complete lack of brain use". Gadget should be for children from 10 to 12 years ... not for children from 10 to 12 months who like this movie. Whatever this movie should be, it is NOT, do NOT repeat the actual Inspector gadget. Because I love the old gadget, I hate that.
