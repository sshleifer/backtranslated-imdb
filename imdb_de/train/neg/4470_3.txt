This is a comedy, but especially bad taste and nothing that causes a smile in the movie. The film is about a couple looking for a child and the people who are in such a situation will wince in the face of the portrayals being portrayed. For example, scenes in a fertility clinic are not the least bit funny and frankly embarrassing. The male lead, who plays a construction worker and works in his hard hat, is a bad excuse for rejecting Village People. The female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than she is. Both leads are unsightly, unappealing and absolutely unconvincing. There are several ridiculous and completely inconspicuous scenes in the film, for example with a low-cost airline that has no sense of humor. The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is a note for Shirley Maclaine, who is a class above everything else in the picture, and a grade for half decent (albeit old) music.
