For my life I can not figure out why someone would make such a movie. The plot is tired, the acting is tense, the language is consistently evil and sometimes the excessive use of the "F" word seems like a lack of dialogue. that's what the American public wants to hear. Gossett was particularly nauseous and seemed to enjoy his role. Forget this c__p, rent 'shrek' and laugh well.
