I read all the reviews here after seeing this piece of cinematic garbage, and it took at least two pages to find out that someone else did not think that this horrendously unusual montage was the culmination in the '70s or even in any way of humor was another era! If this is not the least funny set of sketches * Comedy * I've ever seen, it will work until it comes. Half of the skits had already been done by Acty like Monty Python and Woody Allen (and infinitely better) ... If I were to say that a nice animation that takes about 90 seconds would be the highlight of this movie, it would still be the climax Do not get close to how insane and wasteful this waste of 75 minutes is. Spectacular comedy? Only in the world where seeds really mean seeds. Skatological humor? Only in a world where feces are actually feces. Forerunner Jokes Only when we mean that this is a manual on how NOT to do a comedy. Tits and butt and the weird beaver. Nice ... if you're a pubescent boy who has at least one hand free and has not figured out that Playboy exists. Take a break because it was in the early 70s? Under no circumstance. Ten years ago there had been a sketch comedy. The only way I could even forgive this movie is if it was at gunpoint. Retro? Barely. Sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be up to date in some circles (and that could have been funny), but it is really sad. What kept me running for 75 minutes? The sheer belief that they could have saved a really funny sketch for the end. I gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to patients with insomnia or coma ... or maybe people who suffer from Lockjaw ... their jaws would eventually open in disbelief.
