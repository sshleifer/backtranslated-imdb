When this piece was first shown by the BBC over 30 years ago, it would have been a different story back then. Therefore, some people would have found it quite scary and might have been impressed with the special effects? <br /> <br /> If you look at it today, it does not seem to be that scary. Even the special effects leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Can a train really drive a RED LIGHT into a dark tunnel? I do not think so ... but if you look at this game again, you will notice that the first train that enters the tunnel storms right through the RED LIGHT! (Maybe that was in the time of Dickens)? <br /> <br /> You'll also notice that the walkway leading to the Signal Box is very steep and in poor condition. Surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails so the Signalman could get on or off the cut. (I can not help but notice such things) <br /> <br /> I'm not going to do anything about acting, both Denholm Elliott (signalman) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler) have shown wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what's going on ...... I mean, was the spirit of the traveler or what ??? Does anyone really understand this rather confusing story? (well, maybe I'm the only one who does not) ??? <br /> <br /> Conclusion ..... <br /> <br /> The game has a wonderful atmosphere and is great character. It suffers not to be so scary these days, and in some places a little, if not very confusing, and has some rather unusual signaling practices ... <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading my review.
