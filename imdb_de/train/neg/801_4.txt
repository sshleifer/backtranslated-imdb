Despite its stereotypes, virtually "no-name" occupation and an obviously low budget, I thought this movie was okay; much better than I expected. At first I was skeptical - the idea of ​​a computer virus that can infect people seemed a bit ridiculous. But in the end, I found that the film handled the concept well (though some scenes were a bit clichéd). <br /> <br /> The cast was pretty good and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously. I can not help but think that Janine Turner looks a bit like Geena Davis. Maybe it's just her face or the make-up, the hair and the clothes she had in this movie, but she was always annoying me. <br /> <br /> It is not a must. or a great movie of any standard, "Fatal Error" is an entertaining movie that will keep you watching until the end.
