I love science fiction, am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and appreciate digital animations. I thought a movie combining those three would at least be fun. I could not have been more wrong: the story (or lack of it) was completely unimaginative and lacked in imagination - while imagination is usually the biggest part of any science fiction story. The dialogue and the acting are even worse than in an average porn movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives the term "bad performance" a new meaning. Bad drama would not have been such a big problem if only the "director" Bilal had not taken himself so seriously; All lines sound as if they are poetic, Bilal really believes that he has made a work of art here. Well, there is no art or poetry in this piece of rubbish, just pretension! This man should really stick to comics, because he fails as a director in all possible ways. Worst of all is the terrible digital animation, which is so ugly that watching this movie is actually a physically painful experience. The graphics look so spotty that they even make the werewolves in 'Van Helsing' look like live actors! And since half of the characters are CGI-animated, it's a problem that the CGI effects look so fake. If the Egyptian gods actually exist, then Bilal is a dead guy, as they will undoubtedly take cruel revenge on him for the ridiculous way he portrays them in this catastrophically evil movie.
