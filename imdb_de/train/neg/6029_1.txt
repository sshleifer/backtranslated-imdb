If you're wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the UN, Israel and international affairs come from, look no further. <br /> <br /> This is not a supernatural Hollywood movie loosely based on some biblical spot. Instead, this film was produced by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious agenda. As a film, the end result sometimes looks more like clips from a television program (complete with family prayers and light breaking through church windows while harps play). <br /> <br /> For mainstream viewers, this may be the case Hard to believe, but many people literally believe in this stuff, as shown in the movie. And that maybe makes the movie important. You probably will not find a more concise account of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So if you look at it, consider it as a social / cultural document. If you know the media, you do not have to be warned about the inconspicuous attempts at propaganda and film manipulation.
