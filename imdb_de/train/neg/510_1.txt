This is certainly one of the worst movies ever made and released by a major Hollywood studio. The plot is just stupid. The dialogue is written in clich√©s. You can therefore complete many sentences in the script. Acting is ridiculously bad, especially that of Rod Cameron. The "choreography" is stupid and completely un-sensual. One can only pity the reviewer who considered 23-year-old Yvonne as a dance; It's just a very bad choreography. The ballet scene at the beginning of the film is especially ridiculous. If you like bad movies and like to laugh about the turkeys of Hollywood, this is for you. I bought the colorized version on VHS, which makes the movie even worse. When Yvonne is heavily disguised, she always looks like a clown. And she is the best part of this movie. What a way to start a career.
