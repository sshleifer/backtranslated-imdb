... but I'm not one of them. Caro Diario was seen at least two-thirds of the time, but the boring and selfish third part of this movie gave us a taste of what to expect in this exceptionally self-indulgent chaos. Moretti says he feels a need to shoot this film, but he does not want it, while the viewer feels he should stick to it, but he does not want it. A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but that's not the movie. At one point Moretti and his friends are standing in front of the headquarters of the Communist Party and discussing the interviews they are preparing with the party leaders, but it is characteristic of this film that we never see any of it. Between Moretti's political desires lie the events that led to the birth of his son, and the subsequent shots of the child with the baby and later with the infant Pietro (the film pulls us through several years and more than one legislature). We always expect a final order or convincing arguments, but they never come. I doubt I would have the patience to ever get through a movie by Nanni Moretti again. He manages to make one hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity.
