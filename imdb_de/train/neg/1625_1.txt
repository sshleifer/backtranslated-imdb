When I was at school, I made a movie about a couple who roamed and talked in the trees, and when I came out, I realized that this was not just an aesthetic strategy, but a clich√© of Canadian cinema: soaked lyrics, with empty, metaphorical charged stitches at the social commentary. Whatever the flaws of my own movie, I feel much better after seeing this ... this ... thing. On the one hand, it took me 20 minutes, not 85, and it had more content: every pointless business here is relentless for four, five, six minutes. The male lead role is just unbelievable, an eyebrow-banging, noisy crawl that has fallen victim to the dramatic improvisations between the philosophical insights of the U of T-Pub, and it's given plenty of room to make us approach it to hate. Granted, if it were not such a hole, the third act would make even less sense as a couple of snarky dudes emerge to provide distant and unhelpful echoes of 'exploitation scores'; However, it does not make it easier to see the crawling in the cage in close-up until the magazine is exhausted. I take back what I said about AUTUMN BORN, which at least had the courage to be struck by its own failed craze: this film crater is and remains the worst Canadian film of all time. At least I really hope so.
