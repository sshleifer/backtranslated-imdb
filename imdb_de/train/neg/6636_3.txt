Some of the worst, least natural-looking performances I've ever seen. Which may not be surprising given the awkward, lame dialogue given to the one-note characters. Add cheap production values ​​and you have a movie that does not look like it's on TV. You do not expect much from a lifetime movie, especially from such an old movie, but that's almost unbelievably bad. <br /> <br /> As for the storyline, this is a terrible, clichéd romance that Harlequin herself is considering. It's possible to guess what the rest of the movie will look like by simply looking at the first few scenes. Surprise, the only female figure to get a focus, and the mysterious stranger eventually falls in love.
