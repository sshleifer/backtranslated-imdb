In the beginning I was happy to hear about a new superman movie, but I think that will be great, but it was not. <br /> <br /> is a bad copy of Richard Donner's work does not do anything else, even played by Kevin Spice. <br /> <br /> The evil plan is the same as the first movie by Donner who is forced a lot. <br /> <br /> the script is predictable and simple (all that Luthor finds in a museum or an old lady). <br /> <br /> The story is the wrong thing, it has to be the Kevin Smith script and it could be better. <br /> <br /> I just hope for a sequel without Brian Singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy. <br /> <br />
