This documentary is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence, in which Brian Flemming may not deliberately mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most important mistake is one of the earliest: his claims regarding the invalidity of Paul's statement about Jesus Christ ignore important facts such as: ** The existence of some formulated creeds in Paul's epistles. These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were formulated in a few years after the death and resurrection of Christ in statements of faith. ** The testimonies of early Christians can not simply be thrown as fancy. There were actually many people who claimed to be the Messiah at this time, but only ONE of them remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been absurd for anyone to have actually believed that Christ was the Messiah and would die for that belief if they knew he was not risen. ** Even if the Gospels are dated more liberally, we are still talking about accounts of Jesus written in the lives of other eyewitnesses, pointing out inaccuracies in these gospels. There are indications that the Gospels were written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I mean by that is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and selfish piece of work, using various arguments and evidence for his anti-Christian point of view. Do not be fooled by a bad investigation.
