There is no tension in this series! When an episode ends, the drama is so bad, the effects are so bad, and the script is so horrible that the last thing you think about is how Batman and Robin will save the day. No, in fact, the last thing you think about is watching the next episode! This show is so boring that I can not see how it was ever made, let alone released on DVD! Obviously, the effects are not equal to contemporary Batman films, but even the script is awful. I'm not sure if there's a disconnected babbling about a bad professor and a jet cannon or something like that because it's too horrible to follow. Check out the 60s version, the 90s version, or even Batman Begins, just about this version!
