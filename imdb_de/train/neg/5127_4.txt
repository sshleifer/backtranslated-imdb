This movie had no big stars, but it had a very good cast with outstanding side actors AND Gene Tierney before turning into a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia, and Cederic Hardwicke, expect more from the movie than it actually delivered. I suspect most of this is due to a second-rate script, as director Henry Hathaway was a competent and established man at the top. <br /> <br /> The film is set in East Africa during the Second World War. - just before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies, while subversive Nazi elements are trying to cause trouble among the locals. One of the white men in the movie is a double dealer - for the destruction of the British Empire! But the dear Tierney, who plays the daughter of a Sultan (!), Wants to save the day for the good old Britain. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers have long since done away with the Empire and the 1930s and 40s saw a plethora of pro-empire films. Nowadays, the idea of ​​seeing the lucky black natives die for queen and country seems ridiculous with altered sentiments - and it would be hard to anchor for both sides! In his day, this propaganda piece was nevertheless effective to support the British - although the film today suffers from a lengthy script and a silly casting. The one bright moment in the movie is the last showdown between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Too bad, after such a strong scene the movie just seemed to talk and talk - he lost some of his punch.
