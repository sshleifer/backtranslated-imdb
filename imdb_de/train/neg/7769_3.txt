A true head scratcher of a movie by Bill Rebane, who apparently deteriorated in his profession in the 1980s. Three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to enter a final contest where the final participant will receive $ 1 million, provided he or she makes it. Some guests have a series of lurid pranks, while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances, namely, shit at the hotel bar. Most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts, including an opening number that is a mix of American bandstand and geriatric aerobics with hookers. If there was a hesitation that white people can not dance, the last nail hammered in that coffin. Pay special attention to the nipple slip. It takes about forty-five minutes for Bill Rebane to throw darts with a variety of plot turns, and everything he encounters becomes the inspiration for the next scene that causes this incoherent confusion. It's a game until it's not a game. The three old coots are in full control until they do not. The hotel is occupied by a supernatural force until it becomes a prop. They are dead until they are not. Even the narrator at the end answers that he does not know what the hell happened. I can not tell anyone why Rebane did this here. The acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner. Most actors probably went back to their day job at Stuckey's. I give a few points for the scene in which the Yuppie Wide opens the cupboard and there is a skeleton in the skull. Let's see that blowing with the wind does that! This Chilling Classics collection really becomes a curse of mine. Bane, get it! Like Rebane! I hate myself.
