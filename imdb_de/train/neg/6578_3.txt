Unconscious, unpretentious hybrid of "Cruel Intentions" and "Wild Things", but it's not nearly as good as these garbage minicans. The point is that acting sheriff Artie (Taye Diggs) will be called in to investigate an almost lethal drug overdose on a posh upper-class university, but to keep it down. If he digs deeper, he believes that it is much more than it seems at first sight. We follow Alicia, the girl who was also overdosed with flashbacks. After about 90 minutes, if the film were initially greeted, the film would have worn it. This movie brings absolutely nothing new on the table. But it's the only movie that Miss Swain has topless so far, so the grade is just higher. <br /> <br /> My degree: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dominique Swain becomes topless (fixing a bug from "Happy Campers"); another girl is topless <br /> <br /> anti-eye sweets: more men than girls
