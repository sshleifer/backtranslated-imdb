Normally, I'm a pretty generous critic, but in the case of this movie, I have to say it was unbelievably bad. I am amazed at how positive most reviews seem to be. <br /> <br /> There were some great shots, but it's too bad they were wasted on that hole in a movie. It might have worked if "Daggers" was a pure action movie and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between the couples, whatever is between Mei and her men seems to be more lust than love, and the dialogue is mostly dumb. This may only be a problem with the translation, but especially the frequent use of the word "flirt" reminded me of the 8th grade, not for ever over head and foot together, worth for all time to be worthy of love; I also felt that we were hit over the head with the wind metaphor. The audience is given very little about the characters that are really involved, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. I wanted a remote control to fast forward, I was sitting on my seat ready to snore, but mostly I just twitched a lot. <br /> <br /> ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Well the icing on the cake. Or rather add insult to injury. The end was really one of the most horrible, ridiculous I've ever seen. The boys have their stag fight and scream, scream and hack. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Randomly. Oh, and then suddenly Mei (dagger in the heart) emerges from the weeds. Then she throws a dagger, which apparently takes about 5 minutes to reach its target, and even slows the middle screen to hit a tiny drop of blood. Wow cool. <br /> <br /> Well, then Mei finally dies, I think, because she threw the dagger that was in her chest and was bleeding to death. Jin sings, sobs, holds her body, the screen goes blank. I and the people around me giggle. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Optically breathtaking, but ultimately a failure.
