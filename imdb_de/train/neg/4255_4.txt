The film begins with a beautiful woman in a ragged white dress running through a stereotypical Eastern European city. we know that she is being followed by something, because she always looks behind her. and soon we see her being chased by a mysterious man in a black trenchcoat. then we realize that the man is actually the vampire hunter and he is after her. but look, is that her reflection in the shop window ??? No, it's just her identical twin vampire! but unfortunately both get it. <br /> <br /> After this ingenious and amazingly funny return to the old hammer movies of the 60s and 70s (in the credits the twins are listed as twins of evil, which of course is the case). the name of the last installment in Hammer's karnstein trilogy), the plot dies pretty much. <br /> <br /> The small plot is Dracula (who conveniently changes his appearance every time he is born again.) I have to rent the same Dracula that goes to a morgue and the doctors recognize it that he is undead and think ... wow, what an opportunity, maybe I just ignore all the movies that say drinking vampire blood makes you a vampire and use the blood of the vampire to get a cure Obviously, this is a mistake and everyone is becoming a vampire. <br /> <br /> A new concept, but painfully badly dismissed, the film always prepares wonderful situations and refuses Something to do with them, for example. <br /> <br /> For example, the medical students try to bring the Drac back to life by bringing him to a blood-filled bathtub in a remote, rundown country villa us is scary enough to be the focus of the movie, but are we staying there? No, because they decide to take the vampire to an abandoned swimming pool. Sigh. This movie has a real problem with "homages", as I mentioned before the opening scene got out of the hammer, and this house scene would have been perfect for a hammy movie, but the movie quickly turns into a medical horror. <br /> <br /> The other problem is that they introduce so many characters that it's almost impossible to regret any of them. There are the medical students and their wheelchair-led professor "friend". All medical students are arrogant, boring, money-hungry and stupid. How they even made it to medicine, amazes me at all, unless the medical school had to achieve their muscle-stressed large / large breast rate. And then there's the vampire hunter, who stays mysterious through the movie. Hey, I can respect that, but it would be nice if they did not set it up like the movie was talking about him. then you have random priests, policemen and science types. So many people are introduced and then quickly forgotten until they need that person to either save the day or jump for a cheap fear that it gets boring quickly. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a lazy movie. no real scares, just a few predictable jump scares. The structure for this is so thought-out that it is funny. For example the bathtub full of blood. it is so obvious that drac will emerge from the murky blood. and yet we have to wait far too long to get to the inevitable fear of jumping. Then he kills one of the dumber and bigger physicians. We all know that she will become one of the undead. but what are the others doing? bury her in a shallow grave near the house. Sigh, so you know who's gonna jump on you when the cops show up in the house .......... <br /> <br /> Well. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone I get the hint that it's impossible to make a spooky vampire movie and just be atmospheric, and then we end up with a whole movie that's as good as the opening scene
