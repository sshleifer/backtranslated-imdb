I was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary about what it was like to be in Puerto Rico. When I heard that it was Rosie Perez, I wondered if she might know what it's like to be a Puerto Rican. As far as I knew ... she was a Nuyorican. Well, I sat anxiously with my popcorn and watched. After ten minutes, I realized that my initial concern was right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge of what it's like to be a Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is more of a first hand, a very personal account of what it's like to be a Nuyorican ... and everything that goes with it. She has (like most Nuyoricans I know) a diluted, partial and sometimes twisted image of history. (How could they not live here?) Yes, everyone is proud. As they should be! But many do not know the peculiarities of REAL culture, history, political background or language. Everything became very clear when she participated in the Vieques edition. Regardless of my personal attitude, this is about this topic. At least I know what the fight is for. There she is arrested for something she knew little about ... and only participated because it was a "Puerto Rican cause". For those of you who are not from Puerto Rico, please consider this as part of the journey of a woman who discovers and accepts herself. Do not take that as a gospel ... many of them are not even true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actress; no historian This film is not and should not be the basis for their information for other Nuyoricans. Instead, it's just a step toward more information, learning and debate about reality. Not just the one who comes out of the eyes of this woman.
