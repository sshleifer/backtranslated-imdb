Run away from this movie. Even for B-movie standards, this movie is awful. It is also insidious in its topic. The main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for everything are cool and admirable. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a movie that speaks much better for the disenfranchised than this movie. See him instead. <br /> <br /> No normal kid would do what Trent does. State Troopers do not work like this movie, etc. When you watch this movie, you realize why writers use the Hooker-with-a-Heart-of-Gold clich√©. Mija is a totally unsympathetic whore, who had a terrible life. However, she is such a terrible person that the audience can not identify with. Usually there is one thing for which a movie can be recommended. In this case there are none. It's such a ridiculous movie that it insults the person trying to identify with the main characters. The acting is appropriate for B-Movie standards and the direction is neither new nor interesting.
