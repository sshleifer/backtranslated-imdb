I vaguely remember Ben from my sci-fi fandom days of the 60s. I ran several interviews and bios of obscure actors / actresses, notably Ben, the actress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played The Young Savages with Angela in 1961. Ben was one of the people at an inconspicuous sci-fi conference in Chicago, around 1970, when I talked to him about his "career" and his life. All this was published in a long forgotten fanzine of the day. I wish I still had copies of these interviews, but time is advancing, and one of those people would not remember me so many years later. Ben was a really nice guy who could make a living (The downsides of those days did not pay their guest, unless they were big stars, of course, and even then the pay was a few hundred dollars at the most!). Good to know that Ben is still alive and kicking! How about a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! Ugly, now uglier!
