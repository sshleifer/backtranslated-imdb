I like to remember Bo Derek's glamor and the attention of the British press (especially the cheery Sun & News of the World) - all after their small role in "10" with Dudley Moore. Understandably, much of her photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and perfectly shaped, jumping breasts were tormented. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, acting is her strength! I think they should create one of the triple-disc collections you always find in Orca's DVD cases, Tarzan the Ape-Man and Bolero. All of these films could be nominated for "So bad are they great". <br /> <br /> It would be a guilty "must" of me! If you've ever read your press or commentary, Ms. Derek, please do not be offended - you've always had a soft spot for you, and there are more important things to worry about in the world than your acting skills. A lot of love.x
