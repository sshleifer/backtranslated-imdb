Slashers ..... If you like horror, it's definitely one you can see, otherwise, do not bother. It is quite obvious that this film has an extremely low budget. For example, it looks like the entire movie has been filmed. Somewhere in a warehouse, and on numerous occasions you'll see the microphone boom shadow and the shadow of the camera men. Trust me that you do not have to look for it. Also, try to ignore the cheesy actors if you call them that. Some people choose a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze because they have 3 killer at large and who will end up live live, get rich. Now, there is something about this movie that keeps you watching, and rarely is it found today with a cheap budget horror. For example, if I saw it, I thought I would not mind trying this game! especially for $ 12 million. I would definitely recommend you to look at it and get your own opinion.
