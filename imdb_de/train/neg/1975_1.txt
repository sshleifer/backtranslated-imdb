To be honest, I have not seen so many Western movies yet, but I have seen enough to know what a good one is. This is by far the worst Western on the planet today. First black people in the Wild West? Come on! Who would have thought that this could be a cool movie from the wall that everyone would love was a bit, no, totally retarded! Second, during this time, women, especially black women, were not inclined to carry or use weapons, the Asian chick who speaks perfect English? If the scenery is western, you are not right in Asia. After all, the evil gay girl was too much, the movie was just crap from the start. Now do not get me wrong. I'm neither racist nor white, so do not let that tell you off, but this movie is the movie's worst portrayal of blacks I've ever seen!
