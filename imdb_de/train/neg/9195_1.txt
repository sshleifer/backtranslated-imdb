Laced up and drugged as a kidney stone made its happy way through my twisted urinary tract, and there was nothing better than fainting the painkillers. I caught this movie via cable. I do not want anyone to think that I've paid to see or rent it in a movie theater, right? the sky is denied! ?? that I saw it STRAIGHT. <br /> <br /> After playing this sensationally gruesome videogame, eagerly pacing the damn rooms and the terrible passageways of The House, fighting Chariot (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041) and fighting other impossible guards, my curiosity was aroused as the game would be transferred to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> It does not. <br /> <br /> The banal plot revolves around a group of "crazy kids" ?? a la Scooby Doo? Are you visiting a remote island for an earth-shaking rave? Whatever it is. (They joke today with their hula-hoops and their miniskirts and their pat boone ??) After bribing a boat captain thousands in cash to get them there (a stupidity calling for their own network of rhetoric), they find that "Rave" "leaving. <br /> <br /> Passing Mention is made of a" house ", presumably the title house of the dead, but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor spaces and other venues that are separate from any haunted residence A fallen video camera acts as a flashback filling, showing the island in the throats of a 'party ?! Is that it? Oh, this' rave' thing is just a 'party'? In the grand tradition, 'used cars' as a "used car" or "shell shock" as a "post-traumatic stress disorder," is the word "party" now too square for you when you take drugs, silicone-implanted, metrosexual Jagoffs? <br /> <br /> Man he has drive that the party was disbanded by wild zombies. Intelligent thought stops here. <br /> <br /> I do not think the pins called scriptwriters and directors understand the myth behind the zombie re-animation. Zombies can not die? You are already UN-DEAD. They do not bleed, they do not know pain. If their bodies are not completely destroyed, they will continue to be animated. At least that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me. <br /> <br /> Meaning that a shot of 45 in their "hearts" will not stop them, nor a machete the torso. And a shotgun in the chest will certainly NOT produce any blood. At least in the logic of the video game, the shooter pumps so many rounds into each monster that it's completely decimated, leaving a lazy porridge that can not re-animate itself. <br /> <br /> However, every actor Slash model gets your Matrix Cameroon moment, killing zombies on all fronts with single balls and karate chicks to the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the stormtroopers of "Return Of The Jedi" who are knocked out when Ewoks stumble upon them. <br /> <br /> I think the author of the film, Mark Altman, wrote the not-too-shabby "Free Enterprise", feeling compelled to insert a reference by Captain Kirk in the figure of Jurgen Prochnow, who Milk money needed to appear in this aromatic manure pig. There's also a hint of Prochnow's Primo role in the great "The Boat," as one of the unskilled B-actor mentions he "looks like a submarine captain." I wonder how many of the target audiences of the angular pigs in this film have picked up ANY on the vile references to other films, as Prochnow says, "Say hello to my little friend," who predicts his machine-gun moment. <Br / <br /> A demographic target group that does not have the resources to understand the Sisyphean futility of the video game concept (ie the game ends when you die? You can not win) is just a slasher movie for the spiritless and mindless Accordingly, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual couple of attractive whites. <br /> <br /> Better use of the tight but abused budget of this movie might have been to send the cast through Acting School, though Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job, as did her right breast and those Slomo running scenes: priceless, especially the final scene in which Ona did so she seems to have been stabbed, but she looked like she was eating ice cream too fast. <br /> <br /> Trying to do a little more structurally with my time I pulled out my Digitally-Restored, 35th Anniversary, Special Edition, widescreen Anamorphic DVD from "Manos: The Hands Of Fate". Ah yes! ?? The drugs were reasonably brain-numbing - now there were some quality films. <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
