This movie is so annoying. The main character looks like he's 35, and I saw some crisp beanstalks with more balls than this guy. The changes of action are so predictable that it is not even worth paying attention to the humor factor. <br /> <br /> Also, some of the worst dialogues I've heard for three years: "Let's find a small animal to torture" br /> Uhh ..... I can not go on, do not watch this dump, it was made in 8 days. <br /> <br /> The only highlight is the drunk guy who calls the main character a fag for drawing pictures. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, not to be outdone
