My original review of this movie was simply the word I wrote 2000 times. Although this was a very accurate review, I thought my review should be a bit more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I will start with the leading actress; Her expression does not even change in this film, it shows no fear, no luck or no depression. Her body language skills are almost like rocking left and right, looking like Jack does not know her. She is an emotionless shell that I believe has had too much Botox. However, her poor facial expression during the film is surpassed by the deplorable love affair with the lead actor, who appears to emerge from nowhere and finds her on a beach and falls in love within a few hours of the meeting. The lead actor, whose hair demanded more attention than he was, was mediocre at best and did not give me a single feeling as if he really was in danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing that surpasses the hideous acting is the direction, action and inaccuracies in the plot. I've seen tampon ads with more structure than this movie. This is not a development in character, they just seem to say and do things that I could never believe a real person would do. <br /> <br /> This movie would not have been bad if it had deliberately tried to crap snakes on the plane, but it was so hard to be a serious action movie that I could not even laugh. I think I have a brain tumor now because I saw this movie and thought about how I could use that budget and the CG team to do something superior. If I bought this on DVD, I would smash the DVD to pieces, burn and then dissolve in hydrochloric acid. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!
