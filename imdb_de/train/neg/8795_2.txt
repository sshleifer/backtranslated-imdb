I have seen virtually no redeeming qualities in this film. The only thing I saw was Quentin Tarantino's seemingly insane obsession. There were some attractive women in this movie and maybe that's a decent quality. All in all, however, I found this film surrealistic and ridiculous. The hand-film production, coupled with slow motion and other gadgets, I found awkward and dizzy, even pathological. All in all, the music was horrible and it repeated itself to the utmost, reminding me of the psychological warfare of the US military against various misunderstandings unresolved in its content and "conclusions". A depressing film (not a true _film_, a term I reserve for true art) that has given me a bad feeling. I do not think that the various people who are trying to turn this into a "romantic comedy", although there are certainly isolated elements of this film that refuse any connection with this genre in terms of content, form and inference, despite the seemingly overwhelming positive assessments of the IMDb and other rating sources.
