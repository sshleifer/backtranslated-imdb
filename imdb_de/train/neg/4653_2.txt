A vampire's henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar hookah hooker in this extremely low horror comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments about this movie. I'll make it a mass hallucination, but it's still disturbing. The only redeeming factor (and I'm extremely generous here) could be the grandfather, who is the only half sympathetic character in all this chaos. Do not waste your money or your time. Here's a piece of advice: If Troma releases it on DVD but does NOT do it herself, it's probably crap. <br /> <br /> Troma DVD Extras: Comment with Omar and Kirk; second commentary with occupied scenes and crew members; bloopers; Troma interactivity; Radiation Marsch; Clip of "Terror Firmer"; Trailer; Trailer for "The Rowdy Girls", "Catgirls Teenage in Heat", "Cannible: The Musical" and "Toxic Avenger 4". <br /> <br /> My degree: D
