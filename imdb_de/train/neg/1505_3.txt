A pretty common, dirty Italo-Western story with clich√©s and logic, some mediocre actors, dirty settings, lots of punch matches and people who are dead on a massive scale. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my German version, this German DVD release is called "Adios Companeros" and Macho Callaghan has to fight Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their gang killed his (he's the only survivor). But then Butch Cassidy and Ironhead argue because they have argued and the gang is split. And Ironhead fights everyone, because he's the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway. Yes, that's it, no prudence in the plot, hehe. <br /> <br /> A small role of Klaus Kinski as Reverend Cotton is remarkable (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene he tries to separate two fighting men by hitting them and saying "I said, love!" and in another scene he wins a horseshoe throwing competition and makes a madness - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> Also noteworthy is that JOE d'AMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi did the cinematography - I love this master of incompetent exploitation thrash, so for me it was an "aahhh".
