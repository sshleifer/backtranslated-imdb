I always wrote this series as an absolute stink party because Jim Belushi was involved. But then one day a tragic event happened. After a White Sox game came to an end, I found that the remote was somehow on the other side of the room. Now I could just have gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote, or even to the TV to turn the channel. But why not just get up and walk across the country to watch TV in another state? "Nuts," I said. So I decided to just lie down on the couch and take everything Fate had in store for me. What Fate had in store was an episode of this series that I remember very well, except that once again I had made a very comprehensive, general judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence, without my views being affected by anything I was perfectly right to be supported and again! This show is a total quark! Belushi offers the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn. The women are physically attractive, but also Stepford, to give the viewer every feeling. There is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running to the local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending each copy of this mutt to hell. <br /> <br /> Except ... <br /> <br /> Except for the wonderful comic barns of Larry Joe Campbell, America's biggest comic actor. This guy plays the brother-in-law of Belushi, Andy, and he's gold. How good is he really? As well as being funny, his job is to make Belushi look good. It's like trying to make the warts look good. But Campbell manages it in style. Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in the comic book buffoonery so that he can win it every year. Without Larry Joe, this show would be made up of a slightly empty Courtney Thorne-Smith, who is pecking Belushi over the head with a pan as he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the bottom of his cage. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell as Comedic Bacon, because it enhances the taste of everything he's in!
