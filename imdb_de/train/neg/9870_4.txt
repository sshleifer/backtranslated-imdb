I had several issues with the movie: <br /> <br /> (1) The script - especially Kim Basinger's voice: films are not books; You should * show * the action * instead of communicating *, * tell us what's going on. Occasionally I find a movie with a voice that works, but here it seemed like a lazy way to write the script. In fact, it sounded to me as if she were practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice. (2) I felt no feelings in the relationship between Jessie and brother Thomas and also felt Alex Carter's acting was pretty bad. This is a major mistake for me to define the characters of Jessie and Thomas - without any connection between them it seemed to me that she just wanted a stud and wanted to be sex-robbed for him. If done right, the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story. <br /> <br /> (3) With the book, I understood Jessie's mid-life crisis. In the movie, it seemed like a kind of boredom. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I did not find the movie as bad as turning off the TV. , , although that thought occurred to me.
