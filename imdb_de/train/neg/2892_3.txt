Ursula Andress's bare body is one of the things that makes you believe in God. The other two women (especially the ones the girl plays) also have great bodies. So why is the higher grade I can give a movie with such quality and quantity of nudity, only 3 out of 10 points? To get to Ursula's unbelievable body, we have to move through a movie that's otherwise not funny and boring (keep in mind that I looked at the 101-minute full version, not the 78-minute US, probably much fades out the foreign material). In the typical Italian comedy tradition, most characters are exaggerated caricatures (army freak, "Latin American lover", constant drunk, naive maid) who are not funny, but simply overacted. The last word: Look at this, but keep your finger on the fast-forward button, you'll need it. (*)
