The first five minutes of this movie showed potential. Then it went straight from a potentially decent to an illegitimate comedy. The best part is that, thanks to Joey Kern, I could not stop thinking about supertroopers. I would recommend to watch this movie because you have learned how not to make a movie. There are so many scenes in this movie that you just have to stop wondering if the entire crew and crew have stopped taking care of them at some point. What fascinates me most about this film is that it recorded $ 22 million at the box office and cost only about $ 1.5 million. Congratulations to Lion's Gate for making it.
