As a fan of Billy Bob Thornton and the variety of his abilities, I noticed this movie and was surprised that I had not heard of it. <br /> <br /> I was in two years more than usual on the way it was filmed in 2000, and when there are more than 2 1/2 years later was released, is the first clue that all was not well with the production. <br /> <br /> Now Patrick Swayze can not serve sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough ability to make up for the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is someone you'd like to see, even when you see she looks dry. <br /> <br /> As I am curious, I have reviewed the production information of this site. An impressive $ 600 per screen was achieved on its opening weekend, and it was over $ 400 every year after the theater ran in that month last year. Total gross was $ 261,000. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty benign, and even using the normally interesting locale of Reno is just as boring as the rest of the action. <br /> <br /> Something is composed of several SNL bits, not one too big and the overall presentation even worse. <br /> <br /> However, the cost of this production had to be significant - even if all for less than usual worked fees - which was the quality of filming one thing that made it a little tolerable Opus and Billy Bob's presence (though understandably laconic compared to his usual work. <br /> <br /> which he portrayed in "Sling Blade," "Bandits" and "Bad Santa" totally different characters, and you know, that he has realized this work s under standard long before the spectators had the opportunity to confirm this a star for him here, and because the production was better than the typical "Lifetime." - strips.
