I tried. I really did. I thought if I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance, I could enjoy his movie. I knew after seeing O FANTASMA I felt sick and almost disgusted, but some of the reviews were pretty good and voted for it, so I said, "What the hell, at least you did not pay $ 10 at the hotel quad Do it. "<br /> <br /> Sometimes it's better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without the prior anesthetic to relieve the horror of so much pain. I often wonder if it would be better to return to my childhood and ask my former tyrants to let me have them. On other occasions, I often think that the world is really flat, and that if I sail far enough away, not only will I get away from it, but I'll be clearer too, and some evil Lovecraftian thing will snap me with its 9000 Tentacles and squeeze the life - and a few chips from the year 1995, which still linger in my esophagus - out of me. <br /> <br /> Is there a reason for Odete? I would not say ... only that your creator might have thought that writing a story focused on her madness (one that makes Alex Forrest look like Strawberry Shortcake) not only looks spooky, but completely sick anger. She first decides to leave her current boyfriend (in screeching hysteria) for wanting a child and he thinks they are too young. Later, she shelters a gay man's funeral, and - to achieve this - to get closer to him, she pretends to be pregnant, while becoming ill in the life of the mother and lover of the dead man pasted. Oh, of course, she screams like a banshee and throws herself not one, but three good times on his grave. And there is this ridiculous thing that she is gradually becoming "Pedro", which sums up some weak tea explanations where love knows no gender. Or something. <br /> <br /> I'd say she's as crazy as a tin of cashew nuts, unsalted. But on the other hand also the director. And me, to dare. At least the men look good. Apart from that ... not much to see here.
