Why see that? There is only one reason and that is for the size of John Saxon. I love his acting. My favorite appearances are Nightmare On Elm Street 1,3 and 7 as Nancy's cop, Black Christmas as a cop and From Dusk Till Dawn as a cop again. When I rummaged in my local mall video store, I came across the movie Zombie Death House and quickly threw it back, but before continuing I noticed that John Saxon was not just an actor in this movie, but the first Time I ever heard of a director. This intrigued me (even the cheap price tag of $ 9.00) and me and I had to have it. When I got home, I realized that this movie did not do justice to Saxon's other work, not even his acting, which might have been confused by the extra control pressure. But not only did he suck the other actors, too. It seemed like they were all pulled out of a recent porn shoot and told the guys that you really needed to act. The movie even looks like in the 80s. I can not recommend this movie in good faith to a casual viewer, but if you're an obsessed 80s fan who missed out on the culture that came from when he was born too late, or was a fan of crap movies , then this movie is meant. Even if you dig John Saxon like me.
