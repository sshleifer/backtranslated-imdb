(Rating: 21 by The Movie Snob.) (For details on our rating system, see our What-To-See-Next blog.) <br /> <br /> Here's a movie that puzzles you in your own face clinging to an attempt to get rid of boredom on the screen. <br /> <br /> You will not wrestle with your hands, roll your eyes or sigh your popcorn. In fact not. For a movie with * this * mean, it's enough to just scratch your own face. <br /> <br /> When you start scratching your own face, you have to start! - start at the bottom. You need your upper part with its practical tear ducts, intact for the third truly jerking, which can bring you to its knees if you have not been away from the theater by then. <br /> <br /> In a season celebrating Joe Six-Pack and Hockey Moms as the new gold standard for leadership and overseas diplomacy, it's a movie that welcomes boredom as an a thing anyone could do. * Watching * is a much more dangerous undertaking. <br /> <br /> Here's our story ... <br /> <br /> Sidney Young, the London publisher of a fourth celebrity / entertainment magazine, is about to see his magazine go down. He needs a miracle, and what he gets is a call from New York City, USA. <br /> <br /> The publisher of Sharp magazine Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) says, "Come on, work for me!" With his own staff running the fax machine in the background from his apartment / office , "Yes" is a breeze. Soon Sidney is at work in New York City, doing all the wrong things. His interviews are to ask Broadway music directors if they are (1) Jewish and (2) gay. <br /> <br /> He kills the pet dog of Sohpie Maes, the industry's hottest movie star, as she leaves him in the magazine's offices during a business lunch. <br /> <br /> This is a point of evil happiness for all, because Sidney believes, among other things, that he falls in love with Maes, before he awakens to the haze character. Worst of all, he's completely alienating Alison Olsen (played by Winsome) Scripting Confusion by Kristen Dunst), a colleague who is to show him the ropes of the magazine * and * The Big Apple. (Of course, we've been in a movie before, so we know how this relationship will end, so we need intact lacrimal passages for the third act of the movie.) <br /> <br /> The problem with The Thing is that the script never rings, except for the only tear leader in whom True Love predominates. <br /> <br /> The publisher Harding is said to be an A-son - bitch, who just wants to upset the whole job. However, the script is never firmly anchored on one or the other side of this dichotomy, and Bridges has to spin and waft in the wind. <br /> <br /> Alison Olsen is supposed to despise Sidney Young, but whenever he comes to her (as he always does), he insists on engaging him in conversation rather than trying to establish his existence discourage. <br /> <br /> The "comedy" early scenes is built around a piglet that destroys an animal's expensive hotel room and then down the elevator to urinate on a celebrity's expensive high heels during a cocktail reception. <br /> <br /> The hot star Maes confesses that she is attracted to Young because he is "wounded". "The character never shows us why he's wounded." This is yet another episode of the film's mortally wounded script, which, with an hour and fifty minutes, feels this Thing longer (and more deadly) than Napoleon's withdrawal from Moscow, it's uninspiring not funny, not refundable and not even rentable
