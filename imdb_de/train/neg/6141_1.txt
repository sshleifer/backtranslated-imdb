One evening, I waited for my friends to return to the apartment, and "Gymkata" was there; I have seen far too much. It's really funny and really awful. Think about it this way-if you had an idea for something bad in your job and then done it in such a horrible way, how long would you stay that way? Not as long as this movie. It's obviously a must.
