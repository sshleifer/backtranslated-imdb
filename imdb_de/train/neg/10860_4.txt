This was a disappointing movie for me. It came to me about a set called "Classic Film Noir" given by someone who knows that I usually like movies made in this style (I insist that Noir is a style and not a genre ). I do not think it's a noir movie. Today, there seems to be a tendency to label and market every black-and-white B film from 1947 to 1955 as Noir, and the label does not always fit. There is a persecuted male protagonist, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the film's actions take place indoors. These are just the only Noir elements I could see. There is no pervasive paranoia or reason to sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale. I do not want to spoil this movie for potential viewers. However, I would like to hear what other connoisseurs of Film Noir have to say about it.
