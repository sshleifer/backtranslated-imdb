<br /> <br /> After completing my contemplation of "Trance" or "The Eternal" or whatever the producers call this movie, I wondered, "Out of all the bad movies I've seen could not have seen at least one that was entertaining? "Even if a movie in terms of acting, directing, writing or whatever you did not do well, it can at least be fun and therefore worthwhile. But this film is not only of inestimable artistic value, it is incredibly boring. With such a thinness it moves awfully slowly and with little dramatic tension. At least the deaths of the characters could be cool and / or bloody in an attempt to talk to the eyebrows, but the creators of this filth also failed in this department. <br /> <br /> What did this movie do? Pretty much nothing, unless you get entertainment when you see that Christopher Walken, who is able to be brilliant, puts so little effort into his spectacle that he falls into the self-parody mode (Why did he decide to make this movie anyway?) br /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10, because, God help us, actually were made worse movies.
