It could have been a wonderful story based on the old breeds of cat people, but it was not. <br /> <br /> This work could have been exactly that; wonderful and full of mythological hints that inspired my fascination. The main characters (Charles Brady, played by Brian Krause, and his mother Mary, played by Alice Krige) were flat, had no personality depth and were neither sympathetic nor drawing. Not even Girl Amick (who played Tanya Robertson) fits this description. <br /> <br /> However, if you're adapting a Stephen King novel for television, as I have often said, you have to take into account the fact that his books are not written for television and his script talent is lacking Fire and the depth that he shows as a writer. <br /> <br /> This is another mock attempt to write the spell of Stephen King, whether it's his novels or an original script. Simply cut and paste on the small screen. His novels are completely finished and all you end up with is a nice movie. no less, but certainly not more. His screenplays are hit and miss. Unfortunately, this translation of the script was a miss. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, movie. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 1.0 / 10th of ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend :.
