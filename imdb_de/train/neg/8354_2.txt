Every film in which Brooke Shields plays a Fonda is both an anomaly and a horror. Shields are actually only bad because she is young, inexperienced and clearly not well managed by her co-star. Peter Fonda is bad because he is bad. I liked him in Ulees Gold years later, but sir, he's terrible here. Not that anyone else is good. There is not a single performance (outside of Henry Fonda's adorable cameo) that is even passable. I have never seen a movie with so many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the chief villain, it is clear that this is due to bad dialogues and instructions, as he has done a good job in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing ham. The writing is just damn bad, and you can not blame the actors for the awful things they have to say. But they say it so bad! The cut and the direction are worse than pedestrians. The recordings are kept for dramatic reasons too long or interrupted before the effect of the scene can be realized. This picture was much worse than I imagined and would have been completely forgotten (and probably never made) without the participation of some famous names. A ray of hope: The cinematography in the Grand Canyon is exquisite and captures the beauty of the area so that even large-scale Imax productions are not so well-done. And finally: Either this is a bad version of Paper Moon with a loveable pair of dad-daughter types, or it's a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a much bigger romantic relationship between a forty-year-old and a 13-year-old. It suggests more of the latter than the former and is therefore quite disturbing.
