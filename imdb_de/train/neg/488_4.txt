A terrible movie! There must have been some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They took the story of the first famous painter from the Renaissance and disfigured it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they have cleared the facts; If the story were good, that would be fine. But it's just bizarre - the true story of this artist would have made for a far better movie. Why did you then deal with this tidy script? I suspect there were not enough naked people in the factual version. In the end, it quickly ended with a summary of the artist's life - we could have saved a few hours if they preferred the rest of the movie with equal brevity.
