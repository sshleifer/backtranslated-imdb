Now I had the best intentions when I saw this one here. I like some of Tony Scott's work, and a friend of mine told me that it's a great movie, even though I've heard something different from other people. That was just hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was all too much. Let me explain a bit more. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley has been over the top and not in a good way. The people who played well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their screen time simply could not save the movie. <br /> <br /> There were a few scenes that jumped in their originality, but somehow it felt like they had been written by someone other than the lead author. A certain tune was used about four times, which really started after the second time. I am firmly convinced that you do not use the same melody more than once. <br /> <br /> Also the editing went really well, because the cutting speed is quite high. Oh, and the repeated echo of some Keira lines just sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second, third, fourth, and so on. <br /> <br /> Basically, my opinion is, if you want to watch an action movie that's fast and "weird," and you would not be interested in everything I've mentioned above, it might be you like . <br /> <br /> (By the way, I'm not a fan of Keira Knightley.)
