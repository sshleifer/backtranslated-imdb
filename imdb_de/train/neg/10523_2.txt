In the first forty minutes, Empire really does shape itself: it seems to be a strong, self-confident and relatively unknown gangster strip. At the time I did not know why, I thought it was good - but now I do it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this movie is that it is totally uncomfortable. I do not mind making movies with psychos and things to prove a point - take Jackie Brown, for example - but they're all so terribly flat, but that's obviously meant for entertainment. You literally feel a knot in your stomach. Another big problem is the protagonist. He is complacent, arrogant and yet - ironically enough - not so bad. He does not seem to be close enough to be a drug killer. The fact is, this movie is overbearing at the end of the day. Not smooth, not smart, just boring and meaningless - this colossal chaos should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * from ***** (1 of 5)
