All of David Prior's films are horrible in every way: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother is usually cast as a male lead). However, they all have an incredible entertainment value because of their unintended fun. The plot of almost every David Prior "movie" (as I like to call it) is essentially the same. Male American commando blow up communist villains. Unlike other cold-war days like Red Dawn, Prior's films are actually funny because of their exaggerated assumptions and their acting. The best thing about Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or was the other guy?) Is summoned by General Mitchell to a top-secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the film is then delivered, something to the effect "This is my roommate, I trained him well". WHAT. You trained your roommate? And apparently this will be their solution to avoid the displacement. <br /> <br /> If you find these gems on a video that's used everywhere, BUY them. They are all funny and even funnier after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends for a true MST3K experience. So far my friends and I have found Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout". But the one I recommend most about them is the final sanction with the freaky-looking Robert Z'dar.
