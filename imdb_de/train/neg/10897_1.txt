This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life !! It was stupid that there was no conspiracy and the special effects were ridiculous !! And I have never seen such bad action in my life! The only good thing about the movie were all the hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what these people thought when they made this movie !! I did not even want to end it, because you get to that point in the movie, where the boys all lie in bed and touch each other. I mean, it was like a kind of sick and twisted child porn! I would advise anyone who has heard about this movie to just forget it and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed!! The whole movie was in my opinion a complete waste of time.
