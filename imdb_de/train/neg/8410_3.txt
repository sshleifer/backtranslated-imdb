This movie is all Flash and not soul. The actors put a lot of passion into the numbers, but these numbers were often unrelated to the movie and felt like independent music videos. No effort has been made to make the numbers sound like they are right in front of you, each one sounding like a studio, essentially sucking all their lives off the songs. Offstage, the performances were anything but boring and unrealized, especially Hudson, who plays essentially the same angry, "strong" (she's stubborn and selfish) black woman we've seen before. Her character had absolutely no depth and none of the other female traces. I think the movie wants us to believe that Hudson's character has difficulty because of her weight, but it's really her own refusal to do the best for the team, which gets her into trouble and makes the end of the movie completely meaningless. The Hudson Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, she produced a sense of emotion (though it often went wrong, but that was the director's fault), but when she was only acting, she did nothing to work out an already signed character. Eddie Murphy's character is the only one with a bow, and he has done a good job, but still is not an Oscar. The only actor who really made a difference was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it. There is nothing here to get involved in, no drama, no heart or even laughter. The placement of the music numbers was so bad that sometimes the movie seemed to make fun of musicals instead of being one; The number in which Hudson argues with the other girls is so lengthy, if it were even longer it might suit a Family Guy sketch. The movie has no idea what it's about, and the last few minutes have offended me. It's a big, boring waste of time, and really the worst movie I've seen in 2006, and nothing last year was really great.
