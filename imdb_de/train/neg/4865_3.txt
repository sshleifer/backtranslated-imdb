I just did not enjoy this movie. But then I loved Babe, a pig in town, and I was pampered by animal films that are exceptionally well made in every way. The animals were not sympathetic. They were all irritating, especially Chris Rock's guinea pig, but what could I expect, Chris Rock? I think I smiled a few times with some nice lines, but that's about it.
