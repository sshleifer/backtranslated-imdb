One of the worst movies I have ever seen. My only thought was, "How do I get my money back from Hollywood Video?" That's not worth four dollars. I think it was an attempt to demolish the Mexicans or Vin Diesel's films, but it failed to miserably do that. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, I was sorry that the actors could not find them to do anything better with their time. The story was ridiculous. We exclaimed the lines to the actors, it was so predictable. The leading actress's Mexican accent was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
