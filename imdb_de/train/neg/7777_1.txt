This could be a sweet movie for kids. My grandson once looked at it. He looked at it a second time as I watched something with him. <br /> <br /> When the little bear gets lost on the ice castle and he is in the water, he tries to get to a piece of ice and says "Come back, stupid ass, fool". <br /> <br /> I do not want my 3 year old grandson to watch movies with words like these. <br /> <br /> That's the reason for kids. Should be kid friendly. I would expect that. Rated by Warner brothers and G, I would assume that there are no swear words in it. The words do not even fit into the movie in most places as they will be added later. And the movie takes off in many parts.
