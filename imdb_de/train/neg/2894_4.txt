I admit that the problem I have with the much acclaimed Ealing films I've seen so far could be mine. To my taste, they are either black and excitingly funny or so light that they seem unsatisfactory as a comedy or story. It's a confident way of saying that I liked "The man in a white suit," but I found it hard to get through the short run. <br /> <br /> Textile worker Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) may be meek, but he is persistently trying to invent a string that can not be broken or made dirty. For his latest experiment, he uses a factory lab to defend himself against material and human limitations. The latter are the Mill Chiefs, who do not know what he's up to, then they'll figure it out and decide even more to stop him. <br /> <br /> <br/> "It's small heads like yours that stand in the way of progress," Sidney complains, practicing in the mirror what he's trying to say for the man. <br /> <br /> A problem with "Man in the White Suit" is that Sidney's vision of progress is terribly small, even more than that of the bosses or the workers who annoy his work. My problem is more basic: "White Suit" is not funny for a comedy. It's a pretty serious script that too often tries to rip its feeble humor attempts out of spits, double acts, triple takes, and dizzying takes. <br /> <br /> The best joke is the sound of the machine Sidney sets off and goes "Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop" endlessly, bringing strange glances from each visitor until either Sidney pulls out his miracle or blow it up. Like any other stray humorist who works well in this movie, he's been ajar for too long. <br /> <br /> I have never seen Guinness in a movie that is less vulnerable, even though he looks incredibly young and serious (though unbelievable) actually in his mid 30s). He seems so bloodless, even more so than the waxed general he played in "Doctor Zhivago." He is the same cold fish, whether he ignores the sad affections of the fraudulent mill girl, who offers him to save his life if he loses his job (pan-face Vida Hope as Bertha) or the rather sultry charms of the young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), his only ally in his fight against "shabbiness and filth," as she says, which makes these words sound so incredibly sexy. Only Greenwood could. <br /> <br /> Assist players to make White Suit work just as well as it does. Ernest Thesinger from "Bride Of Frankenstein" plays a uniquely unpleasant industrial captain who looks like Nosferatu and laughs like a death rattle. Howard Marion-Crawford as another factory manager is just as memorable as a blinking doctor in Lawrence Of Arabia. Then there is the undeniable charm of Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals the moments in front of the camera among all the others. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes are played so straightforward that you can not think of director Alexander Mackendrick had previously worked on a comedy (his previous comedy show "Whiskey Galore" unfortunately can not reverse this impression) , In Roger MacDougall's game, the notion of scientific progress is classified as a potential disaster, but the boring Sidney is not presented in anything but the most unassuming light of the lights. Ealing comedies are reminded that they capture the human side of the comedy. The Ealings I have seen so far, however, never seem to do so and only work if they are aggressive against our own sympathies. "Kind Hearts And Coronets" and "The Ladykillers" (again Mackendrick, go figure) are classics that way. "White Suit," on the other hand, is a meaningless ramble that falls apart when it should stick together, just like this unfortunate suit.
