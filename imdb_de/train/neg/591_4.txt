I was really disappointed in this movie. It started off really well and created a great atmosphere and excitement, but when it was finally time to reveal the "monster" ... it turned out to be just a psycho with skin problems ... once again. Whoop-de-do. Another crazy movie ... as if we did not have enough of it yet. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the "creep" is really exciting to watch and the way it moves, and the strange sounds make it pretty scary, but I'm tired of borrowing such a movie, just to discover that the monster is a human, albeit a twisted, demented, crazy. When I saw all the treacherous rats early, I was hoping for some crazy rat-monster hybrid thing ... it was such a disappointment when the Creeper was revealed. <br /> <br /> This does not make sense of some of the stuff in this movie. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why the hell does the creep kill the guard? What's the point, apart from a big Hupschild that reads, "Hi, I'm a PSYCHO, and I live here!"? It's stupid and just seems to happen to stop Franka Potente's character from getting help. <br /> <br /> What the hell did he eat down there? I had the impression that it was effectively walled in, and only the unexpected opening in that section of the tunnel let him loose ... did he chew rats all the time, and if so, why are they so attached to him? Why is he so damn hard to kill? He is skinny, malnourished, and not exactly at peak performance ... but he seems to continue despite injuries similar to those eradicating the non-psychic characters in the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD commentary says we should empathize with Creep, but I just find it despicable. It's an effective movie, but it's wasted so much that I get sick.
