Film school intellectuals can slobber what they want about the important (imagined) meaning of this film, but it's just that: intellectual drooling. This movie is bankrupt creatively, and a mistake is the endless selfish wanking as a substance. Yes. <br /> <br /> Obviously Godard was not a Stones fan. Too bad, because that could have been great. He arrests the birth of this timeless song and decides instead to cover up the music with a man reading from a True Detective magazine or something. <br /> <br /> Then there are the endless shots that look like 1960s librarians spraying cars on the cars. And then there's the seemingly never-ending "interview" in which the actress was brilliantly asked to answer yes to all really deep and intellectual questions. There's a guy in a purple suit who reads more crap out of a book, and that lasts about 20 minutes. And black panthers or something in a junkyard. <br /> <br /> It sounds almost fascinating? Well, that's not it. <br /> <br /> But for unwashed film school hipsters who do not care about the lost possibilities of full access to the Stones, bring sympathy to the devil into the world and would rather hear some of it. The English guy reads instead, while looking at the cover of Nudie Mag, this movie is a real winner! <br /> <br /> More specifically ... maybe Godard is just beating.
