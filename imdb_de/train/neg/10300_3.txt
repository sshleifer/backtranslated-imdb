I'm a fan of Arty movies, but unfortunately I have to report this movie as presumptuous dizzy. The experience is torturously slow to develop a non-existent conspiracy based on a promising premise. Even after bad movies, I feel like I am learning or enjoying something, but there was nothing to appreciate. The premise was not uninteresting, but the movie starts and ends there. The acting was fine, although the characters were extremely boring. For the protagonist to aim for such a courageous goal, she is mighty empty. Pity. I usually enjoy movies that are not formulated, but the lack of a formula should not be confused with zero content.
