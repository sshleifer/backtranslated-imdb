This movie was like a bad indie with A-list talent. The plot was stupid until the end. It was very reminiscent of something that had come out in the eighties for the home video market. I would have given it one, but there were brief moments when you could see that the actors were really exhausting to make this worthwhile. I think the worst part was the underwater scene that was being held off the dock. The underwater light did not seem to come from anyone, and if someone we were worried about nearly ran out of air, this air tank would somehow appear. I would avoid that, unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Nice day.
