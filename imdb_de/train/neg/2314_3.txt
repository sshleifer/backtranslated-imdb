Plot Synopsis: When his wife, a news reporter, is kidnapped and replaced by an android pair, Secret Secret Agent Eric Phillips tracks her and discovers a gunmaker's plan to found an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders /> <br /> Me I had not expected much when I saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's low-priced sci-fi / action hybrid "Cyber ​​Tracker" for the first time. This movie was nothing special, not to mention a blatant rip-off of "The Terminator" and "RoboCop". This sequel is the same as before, with a full action sequence that opens the movie. There are many explosions, fierce shots and a huge body count as well as some martial arts moves courtesy of the movie's star Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The whole movie looks like a series of action scenes lined up with minimal action. On the show side, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant.
