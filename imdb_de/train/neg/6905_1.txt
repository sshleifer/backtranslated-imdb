The clich√©d Polynesian men drink, fight and make a stream of sexist, stupid and idiotic comments. Real Polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped cardboard figures. The supposedly Samoan girl did not look Samoan or did not look like a white woman having sex with someone on a whim. With weak water stories you can not say anything about acting - even the most brilliant actors can do nothing with this script. It is sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a movie without a good scene and only two or three "jokes". What a waste of kiwi taxpayers 'taxpayers' money, what a missed opportunity to make a great movie about a vibrant community. It is better not to make films if they are so bad and mindless.
