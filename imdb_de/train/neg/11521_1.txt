This movie is really one of the worst pieces of garbage. It's really surprising that something so terrible could be made. But if you can stand the thought-provoking storyline, character development, and direction, you might get a kick out of the soundtrack that is so abhorrent that it's funny. The movie starts terribly and quickly becomes unsurpassable. Someone should give comfort to someone involved with this film because his career was probably ruined because of his involvement in the film. If you actually see or have already seen this movie (I feel your pain), those words have come too late. For everyone else: Stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste 2 hours of your life. Then you can at least clean up something or watch something while you look at it.
