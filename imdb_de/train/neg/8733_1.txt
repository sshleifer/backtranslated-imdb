*** Possible Plot Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Hopper. I wonder why he accepted the role of a cop in The Spreading Ground of 2000? This movie is totally shitty and I'll tell you why now. <br /> <br /> This is about a small town that is about to get a contract for a sports arena. One problem: There is a murderer, and that's bad for business. The mayor makes a deal with the Irish mob to find the killer and make sure he never gets to court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants that guy to get caught, too, but he's at the level and believes in the system. He wants the system to do his job. <br /> <br /> That could have been pretty good. It could have been nice. It was terrible. First, they call this guy a serial killer. Err No. There are certain criteria, and nothing fits here. The villain killed 5 children on the first day, and I think the second day was 2. The entire movie spans 48 hours ... Hardly serial killer. I do not care what distorted motives they give in the end. Serial killers do their job over a long period of time. You do not kill 7 children in two days at a time. That's a spree. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's irritating, the acting was cruel. The only name here was Hopper, and he's the only one who was almost losing his role. Unfortunately, he's a typical guy to me, and I think he does Psycho-Pieces much, much better. This was not a good vehicle for Hopper. It did not allow him to do what he does best, to be scary. It's not like he did something bad. I saw how he did so much better. <br /> <br /> The Irish mob-type Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - long day into the night) who is responsible for your investigation is just overly stiff. Contradiction? Not really. He tries to play the cold, hard guy, and he does that to the point that the character is all wood. Boring to max. He did not scare me. He did not evoke emotion except boredom. I can not tell you how many times I checked how long it was until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that it feels like a TV movie. You know what I mean. The bad production values, the low budget and the reuse of scenes to save costs. Only eh. Yanno? But I think comparison with those is an insult to those. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was both director and cameraman on this project. He bit more than he could chew. I can not help but feel that Hopper must have accepted this role as a personal favor for a friend. That's the only sensible thing I can find. This was Vanlint's first job as a director, third as a cameraman. Hopefully this was a learning experience for him. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the end if you decide to torture yourself with this torture, but I would say that they all lost the ball here. ..even hopper. In a scene that was emotionally painful for the detective, it was just ... well ... blah. I was not at all afraid of the complete gear change of this man. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> These 100 grueling minutes and rated R for violence and language. No child under the age of 13 is interested in seeing this, so do not worry. It's not suitable for anyone anyway. heh. <br /> <br /> Skip this. You will thank me later.
