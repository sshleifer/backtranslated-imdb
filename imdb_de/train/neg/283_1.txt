For the film, this film felt like one of those after school, only lower budget and everything else. I suppose that should be an inspirational movie, but it did not work for me preachy.it has very pale shades of flash dancing, but so there's just no excitement in this movie. The dialogues are stapled to death and made into stereotypes. Of course, the whole movie feels like a bad clich√© of the 80s. Acting was less than outstanding, although that has a lot to do with what the actors were given (or not in this case) to work with. In addition, bad song selection and really bad lyrics are the case. I felt embarrassed by all the actors involved. they are all talented, but you can not say it from this movie. Of course that's just my opinion, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream half a tenth
