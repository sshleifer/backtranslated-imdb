Let's make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically has everything that happens on the show! Well, if this idea does not fascinate you, what you should not do, stay away from the ringmaster. I had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through the confusion of a movie. I think Jerry Springer is not playing himself, as evidenced by the cheap props for his show (yes, it looks even cheaper than the real Jerry Springer show), and he's only known in the movie as Jerry. The plot (if you can call it that) is about a daughter who lives with her mother and decides to sleep with her mother's life in a friend. The mother's brilliant idea is to call up the Jerry Springer show and bring her together with her daughter's boyfriend. (Is it a coincidence that you live in a caravan park)? Meanwhile, a woman somewhere in America finds her deceitful husband in bed with her girlfriend. Of course, call America's therapist Jerry Springer! I would talk about the rest of the movie, but even if I think about the movie now, I have a headache. Jamie Pressly, who plays the daughter, is completely unattractive in the film. And remember Michael Dudikoff, the kick ass karate master of the American Ninja series? Now look at him as a white garb is drunk. The thing is that he really looks too awful and out of shape to call it "contact with his charecter". But if you enjoy seeing Jerry Springer singing a country song about his own show or working with transvestites, then ... JUST WATCH THE SHOW INSTEAD! Steve was at least smart enough to get out of this movie.
