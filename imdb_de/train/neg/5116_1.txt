I rented this movie today and thought it might be a good football movie because I'm a big football fan. Boy, I was wrong. This movie is far too religious and preaching and is REALLY unrealistic. This movie pretty much states that if you're a Christian, you can easily get everything you want in life, like a great footballer! You do not become a great footballer when you become a Christian and ask God, you do this through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and He will give you everything ... Phew Lease. That's not right at all, duh. I laughed several times because of this embarrassment. The only thing that was funny was when they were stupid (Shultz, the draftsman, no, the guy who flew across the Atlantic, etc.), but this movie really was not that great. I do not recommend it, especially if you are not a Christian, lol.
