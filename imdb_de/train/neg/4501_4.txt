True, the Paris area is great. The actors are fine. The story is a twisted moral game. Should it be said that if you want someone strong enough, it's OK to hurt everyone else along the way? In a real romance you want fewer stereotypes than the man who's bored with his wife and is ready to dump his family and the woman who agrees. What if she looks decent and shows Karen Allen her body? The characters are still selfish and reprehensible. Maybe the moral of the story is "you get what you deserve". I give a 4, only for the fast scan potential through the "male interest" bits.
