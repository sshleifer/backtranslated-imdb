I rooted this movie because it's a remake of the 70s children's television series "Escape into Night", which was chaotic and stilted, but was certainly strange, intriguing and disturbing. The play in "Paperhouse" is made of wood, unintentionally a joke. The overdubs did not add tension, they only reinforced that I sat and watched a sip. The casting annoyed the bleak dialogue that led to relationships that lacked warmth, chemistry or conviction. Since there are some good acts in most lackluster films, these people should be comforted, comforted, and reassured that they will not be held accountable. Out of all the possible endings, the unexpected was selected ... Lamer as I could have dreamed. <br /> <br /> "Escape to the Night" deserves a decent remake written by someone with life experience and directed by a subtle director.
