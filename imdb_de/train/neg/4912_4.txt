Since I have not read the novel, I can not say how true this movie is. The story is a typical puzzle material: Killer is aimed at bridal couples; Woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a deadly disease. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and that's exactly how it works. The first 2/3 are boring except for the murders, and the last third is making a partial comeback as it picks up speed to its curvy conclusion. <br /> <br /> Acting is absolutely out of reach, even if it's difficult to blame for the actors alone: ​​the script is cruel. During the last 1/3, you stop noticing because the movie actually gets interesting, but that's just the last third. Director Russell Mulcahy is in his element, but with a TV budget and the network censors on his back, he can only do so much. He's pretty much limited to quick cuts and distorted lenses, though he managed to take a few shots under the floor in the club toilet murders. Since this is for television, the cool compositional details he uses so well for a wider picture are nowhere to be found. Note to Producers: Give this man a reasonable budget and anamorphic lens if you hire him. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This movie is poor by cinema standards and mediocre by TV standards (instead CSI). If you're in the mood for a movie like this, I have some great suggestions: get an edition of Dario Argento's Deep Red, Opera, or even Tenebre. They are stronger in every category.
