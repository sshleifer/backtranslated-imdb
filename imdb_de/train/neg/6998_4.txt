Hollywood has always had difficulty dealing with a "religious image". Strange Cargo is no exception. Although the film uses the talents of an outstanding cast and is produced with a top budget and appropriately atmospheric photography by Robert Planck, the film fails in terms of credibility bad. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden ingress of fantasy elements disturbs the viewer's involvement in the action and fate of the characters. It was hard for me to sit quietly through all the fictitious metaphors, parallels, and biblical references, and it was impossible for me to accept the dogged know-it-all of Ian Hunter as a figure of Christ. At least the censors in Boston, Detroit and Providence agreed with me. The movie was banned. Few Boston / Detroit / Providence moviegoers complained or traveled to other cities because the trailer revealed that Gable and Crawford were somehow involved in a "news story". Everywhere it flopped. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the film has heard something of a revival on television. A homely atmosphere seems to make the allegory of the movie more receptive to the audience. Despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the storyline of these Strange Cargo flows along predictable, highly moral lines that make no one suspect how the main characters eventually cope with fate.
