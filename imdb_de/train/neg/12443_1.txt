- Let me first say that I understand that the invasion of the star creatures should be a parody of the science fiction films of the 50s. I understand that none of this may be taken seriously. My problem is that none of this works. A parody should be funny and it just is not. I did not even smile during the whole runtime. In general, I'm easy to talk to, but I did not find a bit of entertainment anywhere with the star creatures. <br /> <br /> The two "stars" appear with one of the lameest gags - a water hose that they can not control - that makes them both wet. These two come out as Bowery Boys wannabes. Why someone wants to imitate the deed and personality of the Bowery Boys is incomprehensible to me. After less than illustrious beginnings, the films feature comic chase sequences, dancing Indians, vegetable men, decoder rings and other varied pieces. It's all just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> - I bought it on the Double Feature DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls. This movie is an Oscar winning achievement compared to the Star Creatures invasion.
