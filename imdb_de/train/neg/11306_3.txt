Back in Scotland, Lassie is (again) tried for her life. Since the faithful dog sleeps on the grave of their master, he must be killed by law. Strangely, it is also stated that Lassie did not have a "legal" owner, which obviously violates an old Scottish law. If no owner is found after three days, dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (as John Traill) advocates Lassie's case, leading to an extended flashback, showing that Lassie's assumption was accepted by Donald Crisp (as John "Jock" Gray) ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie" some earlier lassie situations; and it does not improve it. By comparison, this is sloppy and unexciting; and it's a disappointing episode of "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (as Susan Brown) and some of the other performers may be charming, but can not improve it. Little Jimmy Hawkins (of "It's a Wonderful Life") is one of the remarkable children supporting Lassie. Much later, he will grow up to marry "Dark Shadows" to "Angelique" (Lara Parker).
