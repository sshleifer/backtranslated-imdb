Yes, the first "Howling" was a classic. A pretty good werewolf movie that I have to admit started slowly, but on the way to a pretty good ending, the anchor woman turned into a cute werewolf shot down in front of the camera. Yeah, that made for an entertaining horror movie, to be sure ... well, forget all that, since this movie has nothing to do with this movie. Oh, sure they find that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something wants to find out what and why things went the way they did, but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere, where they have to fight against evil magician werewolves or something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee did in this movie, even though I've read the little things here that say he's never been in a werewolf movie before, but he's read the script anyway before you play a role play. Maybe you could have gone to hell "An American Werewolf in London" that would have been possible. It was settled in London. Heck, werewolves do not seem to include much in this movie except in a rather bizarre and longer sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this film was to me when a girl began to speak aloud and that man's ear began to bleed.
