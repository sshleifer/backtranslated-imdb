I have gone from about 6 movies all my life. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not know how I lasted an hour. I must have been in a coma that night. I saw it in the theater when it came out eight years ago. I could not even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller was playing in it. It must have really influenced me to waste my time commenting on it today. Yech! Vomit! Suck!
