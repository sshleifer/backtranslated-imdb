Let me confess. I found this video used and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket. But inside was another story. Aside from the fact that the film was essentially a parody of "Invisible Man" special effects (highly visible strings and other such utensils), the script did not waste a chance - it did everything it could to insult everything - WASP races and real or imaginary homosexuals. Any insult against a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both. It's starting to get on your nerves, along with the shaky sound, photography in the open camera style and melodramatic story. The end, however, is a bit surprising. But when you arrive there, you care little less. A pity, it could be a pretty good movie.
