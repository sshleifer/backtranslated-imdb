.... and after seeing this bastard, you will not be surprised that it was not published. <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie, but when I point out that this is one of the worst movies with the name Stephen King in the credits, you can imagine how bad it is , The film opens with two characters staring open-mouthed at a scene of horror: <br /> <br /> "My God, what happened here?" <br /> <br /> "I do not know, but you're sure you hate cats" * <br /> <br /> The camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are dead and mutilated. Boy, this guy is right, somebody hates cats and with such a withdrawal he should be a cop. Oh, wait a minute, he's a cop and if a movie starts with a cop who makes such an obvious observation, just know that you're going to see a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The reason why SLEEPWALKERS is bad is bad, that it is very illogical and confused. We finally find out that the monsters of the title need the blood of the virgins to survive. Would not you be better off looking for a Midwestern Midwestern maiden than an American coastal town? After all, we know the monster motifs - that's the only thing we learn. We never know how they can change their shape or make cars invisible, and this vessel with the end that has apparently been stolen by the TERMINATOR. The monster mother walks around and kills several policemen with her bare hands or blows them up with a hand gun (!) To the police. But if their monster race is immune to the police unit, why do creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible? The demise of the creatures is as unimaginable as the death of a mass attack of domestic cats. If they can be killed by cats, why did not the monsters kill all the cats lying in the garden? There was a whole horde of moggies, but the monsters had never thought of killing them. I think that will put an end to the production team. It was that they started the movie in which I want to complain. <br /> <br /> We are treated to several scenes featuring famous horror film directors John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King Cameos. I think the reason for this is that when an unfamiliar actor in trouble read the script, it was immediately decided that they would not turn up in such a bad movie, and Stephen King had to call his horror friends to fill them up Being So Bad SLEEPWALKERS is <br /> <br /> * Incredible, it seems that was not the worst line in the movie. The worst line is: "This cat has saved my life"
