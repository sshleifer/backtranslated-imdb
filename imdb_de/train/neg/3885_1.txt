Not only was this movie bad - it was awful. After seeing it, I actually felt the need to take a shower to remove the dirt from me. It's "gag" with an older couple that matters, it's not funny, but it's disgusting. The Monster Make Up was cool, but that's all. Just the continuity mistakes will make you angry - at least it was me. The cut is really bad. <br /> <br /> Almost everything else you could do would be better than watching the movie. Even if your group of friends is looking for "bad movies," this movie is extraordinary in its inability. I could not bring myself to laugh about it. You were warned.
