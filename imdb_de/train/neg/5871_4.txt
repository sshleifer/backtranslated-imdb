For me the only reason to look at this remake was to see how bad and funny it can be. There was no doubt that it was funny and bad because I had seen "Voyna i me" (1968). Should we start? Let's go ... <br /> <br /> Pierre Bezukhov of Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison - a slender fellow who lacks the depth of the original; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Natasha Rostova - a scarecrow, their image can lead to insomnia; Andrej Bolkonsky of Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison - an OK incarnation that, like the skinny fellow (see above), lacks the depth of a Russian soul and "inner struggle"; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Napoleon - a rather inconspicuous leader; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Prince Bolkonsky - a shit with an English face; Robert Dornhelm & Brendan Donnison's Graf Bezukhov - a spiderless freak show ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are not much better. <br /> <br /> The movements of the actors and the way they often look and talk cruelly. They behave like modern EU citizens disguised for a one-day masquerade. Everything looks cheap and never comes close to the standards of our Russian men and women of the early 19th century. <br /> <br /> A good conversation that you can question and make fun of. We had some giggles in our office when we remembered this modern product that was shown on our TV the night before. <br /> <br /> "User Rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I think many young people have never seen our movie ("Voyna i me" 1968) or have a weird sense of "Tarantino Spielberg "Quality. Do you remember the scene in which our hussar rescues his friend, turns around, shoots and the bridge is booming? Looks like a CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> It makes no sense nor wise to create a better version of the novel, which was once properly shown in our country. But I would be happy to see a Russian remake of Gone with the Wind. Hey, directors, wake up and deal with it instead of spoiling our classics. <br /> <br /> Now back to common sense. Joking aside. What I mentioned above is nothing new, though deadly exaggerated. <br /> <br /> It is a rude mistake to let foreign actors in for Russians (while participating in very heavy epics and dramas), and the filmmakers make this mistake again and again. Of course, there are many laughs - especially Clemence Poesy is unpleasantly ridiculous and brings Russian audiences to dance and singing: "This is so shitty that it is funny!"). <br /> To say something new, I would like to mention the tempo of the movie. In my opinion, this new version is very sketchy. The narrative and the scenes are not naturally fluent - they sway and jump like in a modern video. I need to remember our "Voyna i me", where the action is so natural and the story so simple that you just sit back and enjoy "walking with the river". <br /> <br /> I thought that might be The Battle of Borodino would be great (to somehow rehabilitate some of the disadvantages), but it turns out that it is not up to the war scenes of 1968. <br /> <br /> There should be something good in this movie. And there is. The actors seem to do everything to make everything work. They had no chance from the beginning, but joined the "loser troop". Plus 1 point for this recklessness. A Russian observer is uncomfortable - some scenes are ironically ridiculous, though they are supposed to be dramatically powerful and the actors do their best. It all reminds of pity and sometimes - laughter. <br /> <br /> What I still like about this series is the last part of it. It shows very clearly how everyone receives his "salary and taxes". Judging from the movie trailers, I thought the movie would have an adult sex scene that would definitely kill the whole project. But luckily it has no such garbage. And that's a big advantage. <br /> <br /> "Voyna i Mir" is not a "Harry Potter" and even today we in Russia today do not have enough craft to film it properly. Do I have to say that the moral quality of our lives has deteriorated enormously? Fortunately, a real movie was shown in our Soviet era. The American version of the fifties was justified to a degree - ours did not even exist. There were mitigating circumstances. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point is given from the start, 1 point for the recklessness and 2 points for the last part of the series.) Thank you for your attention.
