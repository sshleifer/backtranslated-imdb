When you watch the little man, you spend his or her running time figuring out the many action holes. And that's not a good sign, because this movie is supposed to be a comedy! You should laugh about it !! But you probably will not. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the little man is his concept - it's way too ridiculous (even as a comic comedy). So when loud, tedious and exaggerated jokes occur, they make up the whole thing. The thing seems ten times more stupid than it already is. <br /> <br /> "But it's a comedy," some of you might scream. That's true, but that's no excuse for such a stupid plan. I mean, come on, think about it, if you saw a baby with a TOTAL FACE. And if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so much, why was not he putting it on a nearby shelf instead of the purse of an arbitrary woman? And how can a qualified doctor NOT realize that Calvin is a grown man? I'm serious ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the plot, it's about the laughs," you could scream. Well, here's the thing to see, there's hardly a laugh in the little man and that just makes the stupid ass all the more. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a Wayans Brothers comedy whose conviction stops the disappearance of a plan, then stick to white chicks because that has at least some decent laughs.
