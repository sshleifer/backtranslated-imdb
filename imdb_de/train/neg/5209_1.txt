Ok, so I was bored and I saw it all the way. <br /> <br /> This film is mild, harmless and dull. The story is so cute that it rips its teeth at the opening titles. A tail of two "traumatized" children who learn about "God" the fairy tale, which frankly pretty traumatized me. It uses the Irish "Blarney" in such a stereotypical way that one hopes no true Irishman ever sees it. Asked for children who, frankly, would switch off after the first attempt with 'OIRISH' accent. All in all, why are you pumping them out?
