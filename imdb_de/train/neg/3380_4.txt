The Broadway show of Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante ran for years, but the evidence of their power and charisma is lost in this film adaptation, most likely by the director's choice (Richard Attenborough, as far from the B-Bahn as possible) and is the lead actor (Michael Douglas, who plays a director-choreographer like a slimy corporate lawyer). The slender story of a grueling audition for a Broadway show, which will become a therapy session for the actor-dancer singers, will annoy us with loud, lively talents playing the Rafters. Nothing is modulated or subtle, especially a ridiculous subplot about an ex-dancer who returns to the theater and beats heads with Douglas Douglas. The overjoyed hopes are full of promise and heartache, but their personal anxiety stories are a little embarrassing; This, coupled with Attenborough's slow pace, brings with it a catastrophe, and even the now-famous songs can not break through the artificial packaging. * 1/2 of ****
