The movie itself is so pathetic. It depicted deaf people as cynical to hearing people. True, some deaf people are suspicious when they hear people, but they are not necessarily angry, as was Marlee Matlin's character throughout the story. Deaf people do not go to the bar and dance like Matlin. All in all, the movie itself is more boring than pathetic. It is so boring that I would like to believe that it is a film cured of insomnia. When I'm having trouble sleeping, I can just tick and watch children of lesser God. It will make me sleep. <br /> <br /> Remember, this is a deaf who talks.
