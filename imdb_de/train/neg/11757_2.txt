Hey Arnold! is a slow and a bit boring movie. The plot is not very creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) buys all run-down, cheap buildings to build a huge mall, shopping complex and office building. This plot goes back to many children's films of the 1960s. It is boring. Paul Sorvino is also not very exciting, so the idea of ​​him as a villain is not scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the film is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal have to find the document with the covert help of Helga, whose father wants to get rich thanks to Shenks Mall. The children have to travel around the city in buses, and so the exciting pursuit scene with a bus is not only stupid, but highlights how this film is written for very young children. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is usually entertaining and has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster and more resourceful than this movie. Hey Arnold, the movie is about five times more sedated and a great way to bring somebody, including children, to sleep. Hey Arnold, it was hard to stay awake all the way to the predictable and totally boring end. If you want to send your kids to an absolutely non-offensive movie, this is the case. I feel like instead of trying to shoot a 90-minute movie, the producers started a 30-minute TV cartoon script and tried to extend it to 90 minutes. This mall story could definitely have been seen in the TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will make a better writer if there is ever a sequel.
