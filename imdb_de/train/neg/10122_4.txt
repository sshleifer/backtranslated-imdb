Another early film by Alfred Hitchcock, apparently created from contractual obligations. As with Juno and the Paycock, one can say that Hitchcock had little interest in this film. There is almost no style and no craft. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young couple earning some money and making a cruise proving to be a test of their marriage. Emily has the chance of a new life with a kind-hearted, well-to-do man who falls in love with her, but decides to leave the street and stay with her husband. This seems to be more credible if Fred were not understood as a completely insensitive, pompous ass, who at the first opportunity he sees leaves his wife for another woman. The couple will end up together, but there is a lack of a true reconciliation scene. The third act goes in a different direction: The couple sits on a deserted ship and is rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry gives a very moving performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful man. That's all you can say.
