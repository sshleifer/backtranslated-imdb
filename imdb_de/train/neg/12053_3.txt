As always, this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. Television told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad, claiming that we all made more than $ 100 a day when $ 20- $ 40 a day came closer to reality. When someone passed by where I held a sign that offered to work and offer me work, I actually went and took the work with me if I was physically able for at least 2 years and kept the most on the bench and still left me $ 10-20,000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games in the casinos. I usually win and could win decent if I just had a bankroll. Instead, I win about $ 1,000 a month. All of them always play minimum purchases because I do not want to risk losing everything. I was homeless because I did not want to risk spending all my money and going broke. Sometimes I had over $ 1,000-2,000 in my sock while I slept outside. Anyone who wants to talk, contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger. I admit that I was different from most homeless people, as I have never drunk smoke or taken drugs. I'm no longer homeless, I'm in state houses now for $ 177 a month, get SSI, and spend most of my time playing online poker. Mother and sunflower worked varied to get me SSI. I am glad that my days when I was hiding under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night and was afraid of being caught by security forces are finally over. If this TV crew had chosen me, they would have been over much earlier. It's a shame they do not pick who they choose.
