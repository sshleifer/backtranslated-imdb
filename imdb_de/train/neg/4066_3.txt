In director Eric Stanze's 'ISOYC, IPOYG', three men are tortured by a woman who sexually abused them all. The first victim must eat his own crap before it is put to death. The next man ends up with a bullet in his crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the body of the first man. But it's the third man who gets the worst: He has to watch the heavily tattooed "star" Emily Haack undress naked and masturbate with a broomstick (oh, he gets the handle in the butt!). <BR /> <br /> And unfortunately we do too (see how she masturbates, that is, we do not get a broomstick in the butt!). <br /> <br /> Yes, 'ISOYC, IPOYG' is a harsh viewing experience, not because of its relentless power, but because Haack, who obviously has the wrong idea that she has the body of a goddess (as opposed to a goddess) Roadie for Metallica), constantly taking off for the camera. It is not a nice sight. <br /> <br /> In addition to the incessant nudity of a dyed-out hack, viewers also get a horrible sense of punch (which means the endless shots of tombstones and trees) is an entertaining stuff), some really bad acting and the penis of a fat one guy. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I give 'ISOYC, IPOYG' a rating of 3/10, which is actually a bit higher than the current 2.9 average. That's one point for the messy ax attack (which I've really enjoyed as Gorehound); a point for the play where the fat guy gets his face pushed into chocolate mousse who disguises himself as feces (hilarious); and a bit of a penny to point out that this movie could somehow be a continuation of Meir Zarchi's excellent exploitation classic I Spit On Your Grave.
