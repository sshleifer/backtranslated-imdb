Okay, I had not heard much about this movie, so I wanted to see it as a horror movie when it was shown on television on TV. I think I can be a collective "huh?" For all who have seen it. <br /> <br /> I decided to continue my life, but at a party with my closest friends we saw that it would come, and some of us had already decided that we could laugh on our way, both of us proclaimed "that's the dumbest thing I've ever seen". It was not scary; I give it to Roth (whom I consider a young hack); The characters change during the movie, ala "Cube". Even so, despite your typical "rats in a cage" scenario, whoever hires who, etc., it was a pretty average horror. <br /> <br /> Some points: 1.) What about this kid? I do not even talk about being weird and biting people. I'm talking about the whole slow-mo karate kicking. What was that? 2.) Okay, I know that Rider's character liked Jordan Ladd, but as a young woman I was appalled that he had simply molested her in his sleep. Uh, that's illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the movie just for Roth to be in the movie. Talk about how to sign up uselessly! 4.) What about the deputy? 5.) So she was just torn apart by the dog? And there was little to no blood left? Only a piece of her jeans? Anyway, we laughed in the ass and I like to laugh during the horror movies (Return of the Living Dead 2, Evil Dead), but I do not know if we should laugh here ...
