This movie was awesome great movie, terribly hellish through and through. and I mean, it freaked me out just like pulse and IT and the omen, etc., but with a great movie comes a crap that ends right? LAW! The end of this movie was pathetic. I mean, a ghost has turned back time in a chick house and he thinks, now I've done that I can call her, and it's going to be the right time because she thinks it is. Law? not correct. my ass I do not care if the mind is Satan, it just does not happen. Yeah, it's a movie, but most of the bad movies or movies are useful, but it did not work. it just showed us what I just said, and people do not think anything of it. Can someone please tell me why you have not noticed this miserable part. The movie ended up in the hospital for me and that's all. Check out number 3 is much more kick ass
