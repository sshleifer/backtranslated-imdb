This film has successfully proven what we all already know: Professional basketball players suck at everything but basketball. Especially rapping and acting. I can not even describe how bad this movie really is. First of all only me or is the ugliest child you have ever seen? I mean, his teeth could be used as a can opener. Secondly, why would a genius want to pursue a career in the music industry, despite the fact that he is a terrific music lover despite magical powers? Third, I read the Bible. In no form or form did it say that Jesus made geniuses. Fourth, what was the deal with all those crappy special effects? I assure you that any nerdy teenager with a computer with acne can achieve better effects. Fifth, why is the end so bad? And what the hell is a Djin? And whoever created the nightmare called Kazaam has to be thrown out of a plane onto the Eiffel Tower, because this movie takes the word "sucking" to a whole new level.
