As much as I refuse to say "me too" in response to other comments - it is absolutely true that the first 30 minutes of this movie have nothing to do with the endless grudges of the following 90. <br /> <br /> If you were banned somewhere, you can not see the movie. Just because it's not like a Hollywood product does not make it believable. Worse, in addition to no identifiable action (other than there are many muddy places in Russia and many people, even very old women, drink a lot of vodka) a number of visual depictions are so unnecessarily evil that I I could not write one if I tried. Do not waste your time or your money and do not confuse this with good Russian cinema.
