There are just too many holes in this movie to have fun and be EVIL. A bizarre, almost Hollywood-like ending that gets completely out of context with the rest of the movie (this is not a spoiler, as you never know how it ends!). <br /> <br /> You also have to be thick-skinned with all kinds of politically correct undertones. The conflict between whites and blacks was highly developed and one-sided. I did not understand why the author has been so unacceptable to the local black community, is he / she trying to be racist? <br /> <br /> A really bizarre movie. Just watch if you really want to be annoyed by holes in the plot and want to debate all things that may not have happened. <br /> <br /> But on the positive side, filming and acting is excellent.
