If you look at Corey Large's information here on IMDb, it seems that a movie called "Reload" (as of June '08) is being produced, in which he plays a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> How does such a crappy movie ever get a sequel ... and secondly, was Sebastian not killed at the end of "Loaded"? <br /> <br /> I looked at this early in the morning when I was fighting insomnia, and so I drifted during operation. I'm sure I missed some action points, but on the whole it seemed very weak. The performance of Large was (for me) one of the stronger parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised by all the people who comment on the beautiful girls, as I thought the actress who plays Brooke is pretty, but not extraordinary.
