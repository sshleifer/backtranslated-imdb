Mark Pirro's "Deathrow Gameshow" from 1987 is a black comedy, which in many parts is extremely cheesy, but is sometimes very funny. This movie could have been a lot better, the acting is awful, and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch, but the concept is funny and there are some funny moments. <br /> <br /> In the near future (in 1991), game shows have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) is hosting a game show called "Live Or Die," in which convicted inmates of the death struggle can gamble for their lives and for money. Candidates who fail are executed in the air by many different methods, such as: With guillotines, electric chairs, and other, more bizarre executions, followed by audience applause. The show, of course, is more than controversial, and Chuck has made many enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is in many ways incredibly cheesy and crappy, and the drama is terrible, but it certainly makes in many areas of fun, especially if you love dark humor. You have not missed anything if you have not seen it, but it's definitely funny and a waste of time. 4.10
