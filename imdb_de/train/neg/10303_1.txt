*** Comments Contain Spoiler *** I barely stuck to this show as a TV date when they started the annoying music under EVERY SCENE when Don Epps was almost a shoot per case when the very nasal Diane Farr was obviously pregnant was (but we should not remember) and when Colby was a threesome agent. But now, in today's episode, David is caught in a paranoid, crazy job being an OBVIOUS amateur with a gun in an elevator and ... HE CAN NOT FORGET HIM. A trained, experienced sales representative who has been the first to walk through the door many times and has close combat experience CAN NOT TAKE A NUT MISSION. Not when the crazy job blinks, looks away, lowers its head and closes its eyes. not even when looking at the fiber optic wire that wiggles like a stripper on a pole around the ceiling for 20 seconds. Then came the scene that made me know that as much as I learn it chubby, frumpish but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy buddy / love interest Amita, my Friday evenings will be better off otherwise busy. Don gives David the "emergency word" that is the code for "The cunt is about to go"; David is ready, they kill the lights, drop the elevator, scare the madness and ... David can not discourage / kill / beat in the nut work. The villain ends with BOTH GUNS, David ends with SHOT. <br /> <br /> I'm done. I hope the NUMB3RS are fun.
