Here we are: Two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on Earth ... one is on a desperate mission to save a life, another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who is the savior giving birth to a whole race <br /> <br /> So, how could you call this killing machine? It's almost as if he's some kind of destroyer or exterminator ... somehow like a killer or something. What is the word I am looking for ... something that ends things? Hmmmm .... <br /> <br /> In any case, the protector (who quickly steals the white tunic that he stole Luke Skywalker in favor of local clothing) finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future hero. his. The Evil uhhhh ... Exterminator kills some rednecks and steals their weapons and clothes, then tries to find the woman by visiting her workplace and looking around, menacingly looking into people's eyes and threatening her name repeated. </ Br> /> Then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly immortal and unstoppable "Annihilator" pursues the couple across the landscape. At some point he can buy boots and a motorcycle, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Maybe in an exciting finale, he'll try to crush her under the wheels of a huge tanker. .. acid. Then the truck crashes. They are saved ... but no! He will then emerge stronger than ever. He will kill the protector and take the girl to a meat packing factory, where he will be pushed into a big chunk of industrial cutting machines and destroyed once and for all. <br /> <br /> But maybe I'm extrapolating too much ... Finally, I stopped watching this movie after Mr. Protector magically impregnated Sean Young by kissing her in a bar. Then he told her that the child will be born in three days. <br /> <br /> The costumes and effects are great in this movie ... I loved them when I saw them for the first time on Star Trek: Next Generation! Sean Young makes another great turn as an unemployed replica, and Stephen Baldwin is also on board as Young's Fat Cop boyfriend. Not sure where he fits into the plot ... maybe he's an import from another James Cameron movie?
