Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad movie. It's a rarity, but definitely not worth hunting for. This Italian Jaws rip-off makes little sense most of the time and the rest makes no sense. The "alligator" is not convincing at all, and many of the plots go nowhere. If you're in the local video library, you might want to see some of it if you're a fan of monster movies.
