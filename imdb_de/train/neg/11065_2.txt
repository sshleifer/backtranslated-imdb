This movie had so much potential. Anyone who has followed the story of Jeffrey knows that so many details are overlooked in this film that it's ridiculous. In the film about Dahmers homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption was spent too much time and effort. Where was the character development? The origins of every rogue are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where in the movie is it about his youth when he started killing and maiming small animals? Instead, we give a dizzying series of flashbacks intended to explain the murderer's origins, but do not address the main issue in Dahmer's development. The reason why the country was so fascinated by this story was the details - how he kept the corpses in his home and what lengths and measures he took to achieve that; His cannibalism and craving for meat, etc. I could go on, but in sum, too many pliant points in the film that focus on his sexuality and not enough of the blood - the good one would expect from the title the film is " Dahmer ".
