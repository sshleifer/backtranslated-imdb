There are some bad movies out there. Most of them are a lot of fun. "Criminally Insane 1" was one of those stripes. So bad that it was fun and had a new value. "Criminally Insane 2" must be one of the worst films ever made and produced by me. That says a lot, because I'm not the type to say that anything is the worst thing. But believe me, that was just awful and only an hour to walk is 1 hour too long. <br /> <br /> The film has a pretty incoherent plot, but who cares the story, if you want to see everything, it's big fat woman running around and killing people because she is not fed. Well, you can not see that in this movie, except for all the flashback sequences that come from the first one. The new plot could have been really funny if Ethel was sent to a halfway house and murdered everyone there, but until the last 20 minutes of the movie, nothing happens and at this point you are already asleep. <br /> <br /> The camera work in this movie is just cruel. This literally reminds me of something I had picked up with friends when I was 15 years old. The sound quality is different, because you can not understand a word that most characters say. To give an example of how bad it is, go to a New York subway and try to understand what's being said over the speakers. That's the sound of this movie. Not that it matters what they talk about anyway, because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood. Now I know that this is the worst movie out there, pretty tough, but words can not describe how bad this movie is. If you do not believe me, see it for yourself. 1/10
