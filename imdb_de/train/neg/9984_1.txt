It was Sunday night and I was watching the advertised movie on TV. They said it was a comedy! The movie started 10 minutes later, then 30 minutes later and I did not even laugh. The fact is that the movie came to an end and I did not even laugh. PLEASE, someone tickles me, I lost 90 minutes for nothing.
