'The Vampire Bat' is definitely of interest, as it's one of the early horror movies of the 1930s genre scene, but in isolation everything is a bit too crisp for real praise. <br /> <br /> The film is located in a European village sometime in the 19th century, where a series of murders of suspected locals are attributed to vampirism. James Whales "Frankenstein" is very similar and this is due to the introduction of Dr. Ing. Niemann's character of Lionel Atwill and his misguided ideas for scientific advancement reinforced. <br /> <br /> The vampire theme is arbitrary and arbitrary. It was used as a rothering because of the suspicion of the bat-loving village marble Herman (Dwight Frye), which was the excuse for a flurry of torches running around trying to escape - as if they needed one. <br /> <br /> This is one of three trio films from the early horror movies in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray played (also 'Doctor X' and 'The Mystery of the Wax Museum'). As with the other collaborations, the film suffers from bad advice Comic Relief and the tendency to switch from horror to mainstream thriller elements. However, in context, "The Vampire Bat" is still weak and rejected. <br /> <br /> All we have left is an inferior Frankenstein imitation, where the vampire elements are a pure device to take away Dracula fans. But for the title, the movie could hardly be considered a horror, and it's worth noting that director Frank Strayer shot the 'Blondie' movies a few years later.
