Any film with such a ridiculous title as "The Bagman" should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover, but the plot is very different from what you would expect for a DVD cover. The Bagman is by no means a good movie. It falls into the category of films that were apparently (and probably were) shot on a home video camera. The spectacle is terrible. I have not heard and seen such wooden acting since Troll 2. There are many scenes of nudity and sex, but they are clearly jumping too fast. The characters are idiots and completely forgotten. The end (which I will not spoil) is easy to expect after the first scene. Because of the cheesy nature of the film, nothing beyond the dreadful levels of production is truly frightening (terrible attempts at realistic blood, a driving scene in which the car is clearly stationary, etc.). Only recommended for bad movie lovers.
