This was not the main catastrophe I expected, but that is as positive as I can be in my description of the movie. I'm not sure what should be funny in this movie, but I think it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I do not find it funny to watch idiots live their idiotic lives or make a fool of themselves on TV, but on the other hand, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's wretched daytime talk show. It was not too boring to look at that, but I definitely never enjoyed it. If you're in the mood to watch a bad movie, but it's not too painful to win, this is a good choice.
