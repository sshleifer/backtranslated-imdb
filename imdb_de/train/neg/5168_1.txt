If you're trying to build tension in a movie, it's always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Butcher Brothers have not realized that yet. <Br /> <br /> This movie is bad, unlike most of its characters who (if they have not figured out they're vampires for the first few minutes, then be ashamed) that they have the rich offer to "Nobody knows where I am." I'm a cheerleading guy and a homosexual drifter walking past their insulated door comfortably and with a fast-food boaster. <br /> <br /> The only tinker of originality in the storyline is how these vampires become vampires of the first but the rest is ridiculous and sloppy. <br /> <br /> Compulsion, due to the tendency to fill their basement with bloodless corpses, regularly sticks (as inserts), they are really not too bright. If they were to feed their victims, they could run their own small blood farm, which would limit the mortality rate, allowing them to settle and become chintzy. Why the producers thought it necessary, the Incestuous Gemini and the murderously gay older brother are not sure. It added zero to the conspiracy, which was unfortunate because there was not much conspiracy at the beginning and no shock at all. <br /> <br /> People never said why their parents died. unless, of course, this was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. Obviously, for some reason, the social worker must have been made aware of the family, but again it was up to the viewer to write his own reason. <br /> <br /> The only well-rounded character was the youngest brother who looked like Pugsley of the Adams family. In fact, he was way too round, he looked like a kid who accidentally wandered out of a class of Weight Watchers into a very bad horror movie. Oh, heaven, he had. Never mind, you better have another donut with a delicious blood center.
