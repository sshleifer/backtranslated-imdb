This movie could have been great (because it has a somewhat intriguing premise), but it never rises above the sheer caricature. Acting is very flawed and there were moments when I flinched so hard that I thought I would fall off my seat in the theater. Never and I never mean to look at this godly piece. Danish cinema has received a lot of good publicity in recent years, but if this piece crosses the border, I fear that no one can reasonably rent a Danish film. This movie is the reason why I signed up here. I really felt I had to lead people away from this piece ... my sympathy goes to the people who have already gone to the cinema to see this
