When I was a teenager seeing this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. The reason is, of course, Bo Derek and her different states of exhaustion in this film. Now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this movie is awful. However, Bo Derek is absolutely amazing and she and her husband director John Derek make sure you see a lot of her. However, removing this aspect from the movie becomes a boring ride. And Tarzan, well, he's as muscular as you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he does not know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo wears a wet, transparent shirt with her chest clearly highlighted. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have this problem. If you are looking for a movie that sweeps over a beautiful naked body, this could fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and rewarding movie, go elsewhere ... almost everywhere else !!!
