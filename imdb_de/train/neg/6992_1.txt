The plot is about a female nurse named Anna, caught in the midst of world-wide chaos, standing up as carnivorous zombies, conquering the world and attacking the living. She escapes to the street and is rescued by a black policeman. So far, so good! I usually like horror movies, but this movie does not deserve to be called horror. It's not even exciting, just ridiculous. Even "The Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It's like seeing a lot of bloodthirsty drunkards who are unable to get into a mall to drink more alcohol. The heroes who have locked themselves inside the mall so as not to be eaten by the Strolflokraten outside are no better either. Although they do not seem drunk, they are mentally handicapped. Save your money instead of spending it!
