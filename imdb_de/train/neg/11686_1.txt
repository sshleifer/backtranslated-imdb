Movie: There are some very interesting comments about IMDb about this movie. It is really terrible. There is not enough money spent on the film and the way Spike Lee did it. It seems to be a combination of an indie movie and an action movie. Characters / Actors: Denzel did "EXACTLY" what he does in every movie, so no surprise. Here is a little mind game for the readers. Think quickly of 10 Denzel films. Now count in how many of them he played a policeman / detective / bodyguard. Clive Owen, hmmmmmm, this guy needs a better role on his plate soon. His best performance was in "Beyond Borders", I think. Otherwise, he did pretty much the same as in any movie. His tone and way of speaking were very similar to Sin City. This guy sure knows he is acting. He desperately needs a better agent. Jodie Foster was brilliant in the movie when you see her for the first time in her life. She did better. She has had better roles. In Hollywood, even the biggest stars fall on their knees and take lower-tier roles, as Jody Foster did in the movie. Action: The plot was not confusing, in fact I could imagine such a conspiracy, in fact the whole movie, while I took a garbage dump after a nice big Chinese dinner. Come on, **** SPOILER ON THE WAY ----> I'm tired of the unnecessary Haulocast and the racism sign. The movie is about bank robbers, why does Haulocast and racism go there? Are you trying to play with the emotions of people who have worked on anyone? NOT ME. The police made the bank robbers think they were hostages? Right, please, we're talking about US police and security. Nobody could figure out where Clive was, I mean, they did not find anything else in this room. Who are we kidding? Conclusion: Sure, watch this movie, if not, then you have a nice time talking to your friends about how bad the movie was. At the very least, people will not think you're stupid to watch this movie because they think you were watching it because they have a big star cast called "MISTAKE".
