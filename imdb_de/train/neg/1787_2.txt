I liked Batman: Dead End. A dark, edgy film noir environment for Batman was perfect. Batman: Dead end is good. This is not. <br /> <br /> Let me start with acting first. None of that is really that good. The best would probably be Clark Bartram as Batman. That does not mean much. He is good at first glance, and then you realize that he is what he is, a bodybuilder who happens to be a bearable actor. But most of all the problem is that Batman does not belong in the light of day. He looks like a freak walking around in a bat suit. Instead of a terribly scarred man trying to make up for the mistakes of the past. The daylight also reveals an irritating dorky scowl on Bartram's face, which never goes unnoticed in Batman: Dead End, probably due to the darkness so desired in this trailer. Bartram seems to believe that a dark and persistent shaking of the head is acting, it's not the opposite. It's called posing, something that real actors like the plague avoid. <br /> <br /> Something I never understood why Collora used bodybuilders as the lead actor. It makes more sense to transfer the role to an actor who can manage it instead of a bodybuilder who can somehow manage it, but he looks like the comic! Of course they could have done better if Colloras Dialouge did not leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The entire trailer (yes, trailer. There will not be a full length movie) is more centered on Superman then Batman. But on the Superman side everything is stupid, casual and amateur. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He stands around and smiles, says his lines. That's all. Although I'm not surprised because he's just a bodybuilder, they've hired and possibly got some acting lessons. I say again to Collora, act actors. Not bodybuilder. Actors will be so much more convincing that we'll forgive the fact that they do not look exactly like the comic book. <br /> <br /> The costume is what you expect from Superman. As for the Batman suit. Well, I think it only looks good in the dark. I say that because in some settings the suit looks like something you would buy in a Halloween gift shop. Superman flies in this movie. That's not a good thing. These shots look especially amateurish. This and a lot of the entire "movie" looks like it was shot in the backyard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best shots show Superman holding a car in his hands. And the last shot of Two-Face and Batman at the very end. For those of you who saw the trailer. You know what I'm talking about. If only he could have pulled that shot through the entire trailer. <br /> <br /> Finally I ask. Why would you do a trailer as a short film when you try to show your ability as a director? This proves nothing if it is a true director's story. My only advice for Collora is that there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and the ability to work in marketing. Batman: Dead End did not feel like an amateur. I can not figure out where that went wrong.
