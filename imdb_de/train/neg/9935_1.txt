It completely defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his inability as a filmmaker and "intellectual" polemicist. It is difficult to judge that Godard actually believed everything that Marxist and Maoist Kant were. Anyone with half a brain could figure out the bankruptcy of these "isms" and the number of people who had destroyed them and were constantly destroying them, while Godard backed his films. Ask yourself as a filmmaker: Do you have boring speakers who read boring political arguments in front of your audience, and then, if you can not think of anything else, another voice over the first voice over, which had its listeners after the first 100 Words definitely lost? Brillant, Jean-Luc! Godard insisted on making a movie with The Rolling Stones: Of course he did; It was the only guarantee that such a pointless garbage was even seen: The genius of the Stones obscured a talentless and babbling political idiot who was released with a camera. The bookstore scene was not even worth the worst edge theater and was an insult to the intelligence of even the little kids who were used to it - as you could easily see. The end of friendly critics claiming that this artless crap was a satire for mainstream filmmaking is nothing more than a safe exit for those who clearly see Godard's lack of understanding and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironic, Godard's erstwhile great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, has made the best film about filmmaking ever made, and Godard did the worst with Le Mepris! By the way, Godard did not pick the trail of Sympathy With the Devil of the Stones. It was just the track they were working on when the movie was filmed at Barnes Olympic Studios.
