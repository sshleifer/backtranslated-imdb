I have to say that this is a terrible movie just because the film is listed in the guide as a documentary. When I saw it, I started to laugh and thought to myself: Does this guy really expect me to believe that this is real? So I had to look and see that it's a movie, but now that it's not a documentary, it's now a movie with bad actors. Either way, it's pretty bad. I actually did not make it to the end. I had to turn it off. I'm a NYC police officer and felt someone was trying to get people to make this a documentary, with the intention of making money on a dreadful day for me and my colleagues. So I took it personally. Maybe that blinded me, and it's not as bad as I personally believe. Everyone has their own opinion.
