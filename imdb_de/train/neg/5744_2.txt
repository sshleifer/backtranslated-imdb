This movie was awful, to put it simply. It was so bad that I registered with the IMDb to warn you of the dangers. <br /> <br /> I am a self-confessed horror movie expert. I have seen "Redneck Zombies", "House of Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many others. I know my beat. And I know that this movie is shit. <br /> <br /> Three quarters of the movie is made up of frightened people walking from one side of the screen to the other. When they are not running, they inject without sequitur lines, without emotions or motivation. When the actors become acceptable, the direction is different. There were so many shattering low-angle shots; I thought Leif Jonker had a 3 foot tripod. He used what I call the "Leif Maneuver" several million times, that is, zooming out of an interesting object like an amateur. Apparently the film crew could not get up early enough to film a sunrise, so they filmed a sunset ... and played it the other way around. With this lazy direction you are really impressed by the last bloody scene. The only thing you can imagine is that the last five minutes before the first eighty-five minutes were shot. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) bloody movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or the basic course "Tot alive." If you are a weakling and looking for a challenge, try Darkness. <br /> <br /> Quote the Movie <br /> <br /> Vampire: It's the time!
