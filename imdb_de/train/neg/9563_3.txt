This is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80s hit. It is in the present time when we see that a base in Afghanistan is being destroyed by a UAV right at the beginning. <br /> <br /> And this is where the movie jumps on the shark. UAVs are not armed. It could be, but I do not think it was ever really tried. We see the computer that called this process "R.I.P.L.E.Y". We become acquainted with the "hacker" Will Farmer (he is good at chemistry and electronics that does not make him a computer hacker) and his love interest (Annie). Will's first attack not only tried to fail his IP address and Annie guessed who it was. We also meet Will's mother, who works for a chemical company. Wills takes money from his neighbor's bank account (Mr. Massude) and is not a hacker (he helped him set up the account), then we get a nod back to the original movie where they oppose the use of Global Thermonuclear War and The Decide dead code. The track in which the RIPLEY office is running is NOT on Will, but on Massude's PC. So all the evidence they had gathered was useless against Will. <br /> <br /> Why RIPLEY has turned off Will's machine is not explained (he just plays.) an online game?) and also why it was necessary to use the entire stream in the entire block he lived, switch off. Why a counter-terrorism agency sees this as a viable target is highly questionable. How to activate his mobile for RIPLEY? I do not think it was not connected to the PC, and the message would not play if it did not answer the phone. So there is more bad hacking science. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY agents arrive at Massude, take him away and Will gets an envelope that turns out to be a lot of money. Will looking for the license plate of the car that has taken Massude, is not a "hack" because you never see him break into the DMV computer. The RIPLEY agents who grab Dennis at the airport while looking for Will have no authority to arrest or arrest him. Will's mother also had "no chemicals and bio-agents stolen". And even if they did, they had no right to arrest or arrest Dennis. Patriot Act or not. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Will was worried about being arrested for some crime in Canada, as this is a completely different country with laws other than the US. <br /> <br /> The computer is roguish and all measures against Will, his mother and Dennis have not been approved by a government agency. The phone phreak we see is the first show of all hacking capabilities in the movie. We also get a RIPLEY attack that seemed too easy for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> The "guy" who ran into Annie at the airport and also watched her on the street had nothing to do with RIPLEY & the ridiculous notion that RIPLEY could track a cell phone while the subway was in transit Underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips. <br /> <br /> Another reference to the original film mentioning Stephen Falken as the designer of the system that replaced RIPLEY, the Joshua project. We find that the "guy" who meets Annie is Hawk (sadly not played by the original actor) who faked his own death. <br /> <br /> We also see WOPR as "What helps them" beat RIPLEY and they had the same voice as then. Hawks and WOPR are destroyed too quickly after they have been barely used (the same explosion was supposed to kill Will, Annie, and the Russians.) It is also unlikely that they would create a self-contained computer system that could fire or dump the chemical weapons in which he works. <br /> <br /> The whole "decontamination" plot and idea is absolutely unbelievable.These assignments would have to be led by the president or chiefs of staff of the staff - so another laughable and unbelievable idea. <br /> <br /> The IP hacks against RIPLEY are not done by Will, he only contacts one of his friends, who proposes and implements the idea, it's overly ridiculous that Will gets a login when he reinforces RIPLEY's operation Temperature: Having Joshua as the back door in RIPLEY (especially after being torn to pieces) is an incredible mockery and cries from a very desperate writer, de /> <br /> There is a terrible thing in which RIPLE Y plays dead code and we see a countdown (say 17 minutes), then RIPLEY says "decontamination in 30 minutes. " How the hell is that if you can not even keep up with your own timer? RIPLEY's attacking mission against Philadelphia is stopped (in my opinion way too easy), and he decides to attack Joshua in his internal circuits and directs the rocket with a Philly to Washington, where RIPLEY is stationed. The idea of ​​the nuclear exchange that is supposed to make RIPLEY clear what she is doing will not work (surely she would know if she had insinuated Joshua, since he had already learned that lesson in the original film?) The original film. <br /> <br /> Her cop-out, repeating RIPLEY, making exactly the same words from the end of the original film shows how many original ideas she could not find. <br /> <br /> If you want to point fingers for bad and stolen ideas, the men who are responsible for it are Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner. This is a horrible movie and is best avoided.
