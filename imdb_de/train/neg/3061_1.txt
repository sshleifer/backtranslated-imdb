This movie is awful. Give me the dentist anytime! Can you believe that one of the main TV stations here in Arabia had this as their Christmas movie? I can only assume that they had expected to entertain the crowd with Dudley Moore. The last time I saw my hot water bottle, it had more impact, better plot, more drama, and much more interest than this celluloid waste. Do not even look at it when you're drunk!
