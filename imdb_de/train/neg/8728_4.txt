This one is bad. A really bad and boring thriller that contains nothing out of the ordinary. A series of crimes, the murderer not seen in the whole movie, the classic investigations. And even the classic story of a police officer who finds out what's going on and is not believed by anyone, he has to fight alone to reveal the truth. Not too much in this case. Vote: 4 out of 10
