A slightly awkward espionage puzzle with a predictable plot about the dangers of World War II. The secret is whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia or not. The best actor is Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor who got angry. He is head of a spy ring, trying to get information from Amnesia Jane, encrypted information about allied activities. Will she tell you? Can she remember? Moroni Olson (as Mr. Goodwin) convinces Massey as an accomplice. The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) is downright catastrophic. He seems to be so badly misunderstood that the casting must be classified as one of the worst in film history. It is unfortunate that such a talented actor is stuffed into a role that does not suit his talents. The film is worth a look, even though he is half a Spy and a half gangster film and includes a parade of stereotypical characters. It is easy to forget, amnesia is not necessary.
