This movie is really nothing but an admittedly well-done series of tense sequences that come with an inevitable "Gotcha!" at the end of each. Actually, there is no character development and no real conspiracy. There are only the biggest motives for the characters to do anything as they trudge to their inevitable ruin. It's all just an excuse to show a bunch of cardboard cutouts to a creepy ghost kid (who seems to have mixed some of the family cat in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mother (with long black hair hanging like "ring" on his face) two-dimensional excuses for human figures. <br /> <br /> This English version of "The Grudge" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; Satisfying right now, but not really what you should be living on. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
