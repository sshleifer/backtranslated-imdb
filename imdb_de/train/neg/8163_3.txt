I agree with everything people said here, but I have to add that the soundtrack is probably the worst I've ever heard in my life! There are real vocals at a time when you should listen to the actors! And the vocals are like a Broadway version of Danzig: "The darkness of the forest! Oh, the darkness of the dark, dark forest!" or something else that is harmless. The singer has a terrible vibrato and was recorded with a treble mic over synthesizer string sections and fake drum beats. It is awful !! <br /> <br /> Yes, the male leads are terrible. So are the female ones. This is a bad case of gender stereotypes - it's so bad! Everything they say is about being a man or a woman, playing the clich√©s to the max. Makes me sick. Soooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> The children were so in their ranks that one could not understand them. And why do female ghost kids always wear cute little bows in their hair, pretty blue dresses and long hair? And ghost boys always wear clean-cut pants with cute little shiny blond hair? Not scary - STUPID. <br /> <br /> Daddy's face was far too flawless and clean to be that of a man who lived in a cave. Beautiful beard and pony, pa. Did you cut them perfectly with a knife or did you go into the city and go to the salon? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
