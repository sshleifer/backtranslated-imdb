All the funny things that happen in this sitcom are based on the main character Jim, who is either a bad father, a bad husband, or in general, just selfish. How can that be funny? Of course, a character in a sitcom must be flawed, but Jim's figure is flawed in an extremely disagreeable manner. <br /> <br /> And why? My guess is that it "because he should be better now." Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of everything and he has the opportunity. But he does not want. It is a conscious decision he makes when he decides not to play with his children or go shopping because he does not want to buy "women's products", and this is a decision he makes when he shelves his relatives <br /> The other characters only seem to be in the series, so Jim can have someone to give him a jerk. If the Cheryl character were a real human, she would have had to leave years ago and not have to stay at the Deadbeat for eight years. But unfortunately, she's just a catalyst for Jim's quirky, selfish middle class.
