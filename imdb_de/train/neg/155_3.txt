This is less a movie than a big kids TV. As far as I can tell, the villain is a huge swarm of chocolate-covered espresso beans. This theory seems to be confirmed by the fact that the subtitles call it "insomnia". When it was first mentioned that a civilization was wiped out by insomnia, I thought, "Wow, a nihilistic martial arts movie!" but no such luck. Although it must be regarded as an experimental cinema, when the villain is strangled by the long, white eyebrows of an old man. To Warriors makes just as much sense, whether the subtitles are on or off. This is not a good sign. I found the special effects somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
