What a fantastic premise: A film about the Berlin Airlift. It should have everything. Tragedy. Tension. Companionship. Rivals Berliner Miss and strong US pilots. Love and tears. What we have is a movie with none of the above. Heino Ferch tries to personify John Wayne or something, but he fails miserably. He looks so wooden he should crack anytime. He tries to play the tough guy instead of being a tough guy! Why did Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Because they threw rocks into a lake? Because he brings her carbon stones? The SFX are very, very well done. Too much. The approximately one hundred aircraft over Berlin look more like a squadron of attack aircraft formations than an organized airlift. as it was. Interestingly enough, the White House, the Kremlin and the office of General Lucius D. Clays all seem to be one and the same dark and dusty environment. Note the same curtains that hang low on the windows as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout. Why is almost every scene inside dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY looks like a small, insecure and relaxed general who trusts in his own noble idea of ​​the airlift. He was very the opposite. They combine all these single mistakes and the result is a film that offers no passion, no tension and no historical accuracy. Sorry, it started so promising?
