Although I recently added this to my list of the 10 worst movies, I have to say that it's probably no worse off than Burt Reynolds in "The Maddening" or one of the "Look Who's Talking" endeavors. Even so, it's pretty disgusting, even when sexy Drew Barrymore plays a horror movie response to Holly Golightly who moves from New York City to Los Angeles, but finds she's being followed by a murderous look. Poor Sally Kellerman, a quirky actress highly praised in the '70s, cuts herself down to a meager minor role, and Barrymore's lead man, George Newbern, is the worst type of sitcom actor who laughs at each line. The picture is a hoax, but Drew's bloody shower scene offers showmanship and the identity of the psycho (though straight out of a "Scooby Doo" episode) is interesting. But as far as the finals are concerned ... you will be real! Who had to clean up the mess? * from ****
