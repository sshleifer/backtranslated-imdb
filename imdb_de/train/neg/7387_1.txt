The DVD was a joke, the sound for the first few minutes was awful, the sound was out of sync and Segal's voice was not even his !!!! Pathetic! If the audio sync was better in about 5 minutes, the bad plot, the lines, and the actors should get another job, since the movie business is not where any of them should be. At first, the latest ones were a joke and should be for him and the company that she has done, be a fix. because he has no talent. <br /> <br /> This film is an embarrassment to everyone involved and a shame to those who have seen it. I turned it off in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'll ask for my money at Block Buster! Mark from Ontario, Canada
