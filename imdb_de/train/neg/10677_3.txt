I rented End Game because I had never heard of it, but I like political thrillers, so I thought I would try. After doing some research on the film, I discovered that it was originally intended for the movie release, but instead went to DVD. After seeing it, I think "no wonder". The film is shocking in its unoriginality. The plot and the characters are superficial. I found out that half was already over, but the end was a curve ball. I have to say, I did not expect it to end this way, but that's not a point in his favor. The more predictable ending would be preferable to such a bad one. Maybe the filmmakers saw how predictable the movie was and decided to make a turn - even one that made the movie even worse. I want the $ 5.98 and my 107 minutes back.
