I should never have seen this movie. The way of filming may be considered artistic for some, but it is considered to be migraine-inducing for me. I think that there might be an interesting plot, but since I could not see for a long time it was missing much. The flickering images and stop-motion movies burned my brain. I stopped looking halfway and do not come back for a second try. I think if I were in a dark and stormy night alone in my own lighthouse at home, this could be just the right ... PS Not sure if the lighthouse / movie style thing can be considered a spoiler, but I want not on my first review on the blacklist;)
