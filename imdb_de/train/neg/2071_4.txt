I had two reasons to look at this Swashbuckler when it aired yesterday on Danish television. At first I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and I was not disappointed here. She looked great. Secondly, reading the film gave me the impression that he had absurd humor that was not comparable to that in Philippe de Broca's films. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in that regard. I found the jokes predictable (apart from a few funny comments on the subject of war) and the characters completely one-dimensional. The action scenes were made in a strangely mechanical and uninspired manner without drama. I watched until the very end, but it quickly got boring and I just sat there waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida.
