Implausible, incredible and incoherent Spanish production about ... well, let me see how close I get to them. The movie begins with a woman killed by a cat by a young girl. Then she asks her lover to take her somewhere on vacation. He calls work and demands that he lose his vacation time and she says he will pay for it. The importance that plays a role, is anyone's guess at the end of the film, because the guy, a dark-skinned photographer, spies a beautiful Patty Shepard, Queen of the Spanish horror films, which takes off her bikini briefly so he can take a picture and ask you for lunch and then to his assignment to Witches Mountain - for reasons that never come to mind again. Before they leave, Patty has to stop by the house and loud, "eerie" echoes in our hero's ears. This too is never explained. The film continues with these two, who stop in an inn, continue to the mountain and finally realize why the mountain is called Hexenberg. You know, this movie has several aspects that make it better than bad movies. It has some atmosphere, some of the character actors are really pretty good (especially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman), the leads are at least adequate and the highlight - although it makes absolutely no sense - is well choreographed (literally) with the witches in white brassiere and long black hair. It just does not make sense and that's a big drawback for me. I was able to watch the movie ten more times and still do not know more than after the first viewing. That is a big problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap, atmospheric European horror films that covered this decade. If you can do more than me, you can get better performance.
