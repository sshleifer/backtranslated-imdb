Gene Hackman is being jailed by a nameless government agency that wants him for a murder. It goes without saying that Hackman has the skills to do the job. No one tells him anything, but it is given as the audience gets information and information. That should be exciting, instead annoying and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman goes through with the mission, but the escape is confused and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everyone to cover her up. So everyone dies in the cast and in the end you do not care. <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers pointed out that the movie was originally twice as long, nearly three hours, and was pretty shut down a bit. Maybe something was actually lost in the translation, but I tend to believe that it was a mercy action for the audience. A very talented cast that had people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach and Edward Albert so thoroughly wasted that it's a crime. <br /> <br /> And we never know which federal agency has done all this, the FBI, the CIA, the DEA or even the IRS.
