Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship of a shy, reclusive videographer and an equally alien artist, both living in the Big Apple and developing an unusual romance through an Internet dating site. This is not so unusual in itself, but it is their method of communication. To forego the verbal, they have to write notes and communicate later by video. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the Creator's own relationship (Arin Crumley & Susan Buice), which apart from writing and governing, also takes on the role of the actor and the main characters. With elements of the avant-garde, the anti-plot and the docudrama, the film scatters with an undecided structure between narcissism and self-enjoyment in the wind. <br /> <br /> While the film has a short-lived role Separation and deterioration of its once-fascinating form of communication grows old as the couple faces reality. The film focuses exclusively on internal conflicts or the sufferings of the relationship and struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original nor poignant. This would have been easy to deal with with the addition of subplot and external conflicts, and a third act that does not exist - just a montage of the melodrama that leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> What's worse The film's descent from history to reality that ends abruptly with an open end and an unsatisfactory end. This would have been all right and dandy, but no question is asked and there is no meaning to be discovered or considered. <br /> <br /> (By the way, the movie contains beautiful animations and a lively and moving soundtrack, one of the more interesting aspects of the production.) <br /> <br /> But as always, watch the movie and decide for yourself.
