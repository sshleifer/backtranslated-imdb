This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only has no acting skills, the script is incredibly flat and lame. You actually hear a serious dialogue that reads, "I love you more." "No, I love you more." After the first half hour I stopped watching the movie (online), I could not take it anymore. Her "Southern Girl Magic" just does not work and is really pretty annoying; Her attempts to make slapstick humor go back and she provides lines as if she were reading the script directly from the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did not he read the script before he agreed, or did he fall in love with Papa Joe's (Jessica's father and also the producer of the film), does he promise big profits? Hopefully he knows better now than to sign up for another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate to see the painful expression on his face as he suffers from the bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> Also, I think the previous commentator who gave this movie an 8 out of 10 probably was either involved in the film or engaged by daddy joe to give the film a better rating. No one who is wise would actually consider this film interesting. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, right? Maybe buy a few acting lessons?
