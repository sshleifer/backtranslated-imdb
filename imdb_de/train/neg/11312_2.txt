This film deserves recognition for its original approach. It combines elements of theater, film and epic storytelling. Unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. The biggest weakness of the film is the unwillingness to commit oneself to anything. It has storage, moral and epic elements, without ever binding to any of them. As for the story itself, Chretien de Troyes turns in the grave adaptation that transforms the lovable, unbearable, innocent Percival into a most incorrigible and rude creature - francophiles or arthurophiles. As the latter, I found the film unsurpassable and an incredibly shabby, irreverent treatment of a beautiful story.
