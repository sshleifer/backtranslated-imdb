Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger, who eventually succeeded in killing virtually every youth in Springwood; Now he wants to broaden his horizons and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member to do it. <br /> <br /> Failure as a horror movie because it's just not scary. Works better than dark, macabre black comedy to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now lost all his ability to calm this spectator. (Too many secrets, that's for sure.) The actors are not interesting (except Robert Englund as always and an obviously dormant Yaphet Kotto) and there are just too many visual effects. The final is fine, but there are not as many sparks as I think you could hope for. <br /> <br /> By adding a new twist to the history of the well-known Dream Knocker, Englund offers the opportunity to make more make-up scenes than ever before. <br /> <br /> There are notable cameos: a joint cameo of the then-couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold, which has no entertainment value, a decent performance by the experienced shock rocker Alice Cooper and a funky cameo by Johnny Depp, too acknowledge the pop icon that he had become. <br /> <br /> Film debut by Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about This is the replay of key scenes from previous credits during the credits. <br /> <br /> 4/10
