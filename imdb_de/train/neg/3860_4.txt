I'm not a big fan of Rome / Coms at the best of times. A few were pretty good (check of Dream for an insomniac), but this is just the same but less so. <br /> <br /> With a running time of 100 minutes I expect more than a laugh every 30 minutes. The only true belly laugh is when male strangers and friends instinctively help Lee's character. <br /> <br /> All I can say is AVOID. I guarantee that there are at least 10 more movies on the shelf you deserve. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (and only because I'm a big Lee fan)
