This must be one of the worst directions I have ever seen. The close-up can be a very strong shot, but if every scene is just close-up, it loses all effect. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has some very beautiful landscapes to work with, the backdrops of Mexico, the cantinas, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives, and the dusty cities that Costner relives on his revenge , Unfortunately, we only catch a glimpse of these places before the camera shows a big, huge picture. Even the transitional scenes in which Costner travels alone through Mexico quickly become close-up. <br /> <br /> The score is too dramatic and intrusive, dictating every emotion we should feel. The story itself should have been handled much better. Among other things, too many people emerge from nowhere to help Costner - it's just bad writing. <br /> <br /> It's a typical thriller story, but many others have taken the same preconditions and done great things with it. Costner's No Way Out had a similar story, but it was a much better movie. <br /> <br /> The end was absolutely anti-climactic and suffered from the most melodramatic films in the film. This movie would never be great, but if we saw more of Mexico and less of huge minds, this film might have been seen.
