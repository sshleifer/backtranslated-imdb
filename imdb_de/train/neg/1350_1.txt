This film is essentially about the archenemy of Doctor Claw, Inspector Gadget, who has returned to the now peaceful metropolis after many years. Claw's plan is to thwart Gadget once and for all by using a newer "cool" Crimefighter to destroy Gadget's popularity. Unfortunately, the film fails miserably, the series was great, but was revived with tragic results almost 20 years later. Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, it just does not cut anymore. Dr. Not only is Claw visually less fearful, but he sounds more like a wrestler with a cold than his original intimidating self. Granted, this is a children's movie, but the plot is so painfully weak (prohibition of sky that I mention the animation) that it fades in comparison to the original series. Someone has decided to update Penny to update her for two decades. Now she has a quasi-punk, rebellious clothing style and does not play half the role she played in the TV series. The Gadgetmobile speaks as well as a Plotwinkel that focuses all ON-speaking cars. Maybe I'm just a kid who loved the show that grew up, but I thought the live action version was more painful than I could bear, but now it starts and the entire TV series is watered down. It's more than I can stand.
