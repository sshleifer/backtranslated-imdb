I tried to like this Slasher as if I was trying to enjoy all Slasher movies. I mean pointless killing, mixed with a bit of nudity and some tension, how can you do something wrong. But I think that's an example of how this formula goes wrong. The main problem is the terrible spectacle of the three main girls who landed in the house. It was as if they were under sedation, and it prevented me from ever getting interested in their plight. The film strives for excitement and horror, but it is removed from them by the number direction and the film becomes boring. It's a shame, because if the movie were done better, he would have been an ace. The story and the characters are pretty scary and there are some dark and bizarrely humorous moments of interaction between the mother, the girls and the daughter in the old house. There is good nudity and occasionally sparkling blood, just not enough to give the movie the necessary kick. The finale is pretty twisted and frightening and gives the movie a big boost, but unfortunately it's not too late. In my opinion, avoid one, unless you love obscure slasher movies. The potential is great, but the film does not provide enough to be worthwhile.
