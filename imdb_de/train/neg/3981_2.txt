This movie really has no beginning and no end. And it is really incredible. Mary-K and Ashley are said to be interns working in a post office for an Italian fashion company. But for some reason, they are housed in a 5-star hotel (conveniently opposite the Colosseum), and all the other interns they work with look just as unusual as models. One thing that I obviously found in this movie is the way one of the twins does NOT end up with the guy. I think they tried to twist their usual action a bit. Nice try.
