I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place, but Baba was a big disappointment. Between a terrible plot, action and songs were mediocre. The action becomes very preaching. Instead of running for office like NTR or MGR, Rajni seemed almost to be Tamil Nadu's next great guru. My wife tells me that since the film's release, Rajni has sworn off to make more movies! <br /> <br /> We were fortunate enough to have bought Babu (an oldie from Sivajiganeshan) online when we were trying to buy this movie .... that was a great movie that made up for the purchase of this bagpipe except that Baba looks even worse in comparison! <br /> <br /> Bryan
