When I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS poster, I wanted to see it and knew it would be the best satire of all time. What a brilliant idea for a satire - the genre is widespread. Unfortunately, the finished product (I think probably all involved) is a catalog of missed opportunities, out-of-place performances and (luckily!) Some hilarious, inspired pieces. Janeane Garafolo, who is very noticeable, looks really bad here, probably because she's uncomfortable trying to make fun of her flat role. David Hyde Pierce is just sad to look, trying hard to be funny and looks like a Castro nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny, only when you see her, you laugh, but somehow her segment can not turn into something hysterical. Paul Rudd had great teen manners and was hellishly sexy, the other guys are also very funny (the nerdier). I think the problem is that the director does not push things at the right pace. It starts very late, and that sets the monotone. But if he makes things really outrageous (the drug sequence is the second funniest moment I've had in movies all year round, the first one came in a lame movie: Andrea Martin in ALL UVER THE GUY discussing the movie IN & OUT complains) It's just funny. I wanted this movie to go so bad, but it just did not work. The clothing and styling for 1981 are 99.9% PERFECT, and the few songs used are also perfect. This ends up as a moderate MAD TV episode with frustrating overlong sketches.
