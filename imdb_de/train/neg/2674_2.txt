Someone had a great idea: Let's get their own R-Rated version of Lara Croft from Misty Mundae - with two weapons not only in tight outfits, but also without them. It was indeed a great idea. The problem is that the people who had it did not have scripts or budgets to support. As a result, we get a "movie" that barely reaches the middle length by playing many of its parts (often in slow motion), apparently filmed completely in a garage. The attraction of Misty Mundae is still apparent: she is incredibly sweet and has a natural beauty next door. Her two female co-stars, with whom she associates a long lesbian scene, are nowhere near her league. If "Mummy Raider" were presented as a Youtube video, I would rate it higher, but as a "movie" intended for DVD use, it can not make up more than 1/2 a * of 4.
