Just fine, a movie about a woman who is a twin who has disturbing visions of her sister being in danger at home. She then returns home to find out that everything is not good and that she has to find out what happened to her sister and why. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of thing that almost works but does not work. t completely. I can not really say why it did not work, but it was good enough that I wish it was better or at least the little things done right - as the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks are closer to being size. I think maybe that's wrong, there are many little things that are just wrong.
