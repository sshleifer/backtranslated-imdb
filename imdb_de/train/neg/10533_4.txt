This version moved a bit slow for my taste and I think I have problems with this piece. But first the movie, it's a typical TV movie version of a piece, which means it does not have the flair of the original movie version with William Holden. What could they not afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? Why postpone the movie until 1966? So you could give the little sister a line about the Vietnam protests? Why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> As for the casting, some misdeeds occur. Jay O. Sanders made the right notes for his character, especially in his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin, on the other hand, misses many notes. He is credible as a former BMOC jock, but does not have the sheer sensuality of William Holden. I always thought Brolin would look a bit like a gorilla if all the women in the city came after him. Gretchen Moll was lovely, but she seemed a bit too smart for the character she played. She did not project the innocence or ignorance the character required. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about five years older than the characters should be. On the other hand, Holden was ten years old. Bonnie Bedelia was quite forgotten when her mother and Mary Steenburgen could not decide whether to play Blanche duBois or Katharine of The Taming of the Shrew. <br /> <br /> As with Mr. Inge In playing, I always felt that stories like these were always in need of an epilogue by a young woman passionate about practicability. "The Twilight Zone," I think, offers a likely epilogue to the episode "Spur of the Moment," in which a young Diana Hyland was chased by a bitter older Diana Hyland because the younger Diana Hyland wanted to run away with a similar man Hal Carter.
