For years (it was reported), this reunion of two of the most popular characters of the sitcom story began badly - and went from there directly downhill. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend, Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet after a long estrangement in New York and meet each other. What a novel concept! Sad to report that there is nothing to talk about in both years (or even making a movie). Instead, the script contains one complete, old story-telling piece of work (mostly with older women at work), while the bizarre charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner are completely absent. The supporting cast is immediately forgotten, the humor is not present and the chemistry that Moore and Harper had once together, is gone. Moore has reportedly brought this project for years to a standstill, waiting for "just the right script," before it is committed. If this was the case she thought was "right," how did she feel as if she were refusing? It is not the age of the characters doing this (for a time that is inevitable) but the almost complete lack of imagination, coupled with a gross disregard for the elements that have made the series a success. At one time this was intended as a pilot project, but it was obviously not aroused interest in potential sponsors. Or with potential viewers. Forgotten quickly and mercifully, the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic.
