There are no reasons to watch this movie. If you have won and invested a great deal of money and spent your time discovering all the pleasures of life, and you have come to a point where you happen to have a casual ending and some time to kill (so would this ever happen), then get this movie (from the video library (if you can find it AND settle for the wizard who laughs at you, ask for this movie.) Be prepared, however, for extreme wooden playing of absolutely anyone to be invaded (in fact, the best part was the people who did not say anything.) Oliver Reed ends his career by playing a drunken character, but I've forgotten that there's a reason to watch this movie - Claudia Udy shows her breast Unfortunately, there is no other reason!
