The special charisma of Martin Kosleck lends his character of the frustrated artist a certain credibility. He lends his dialogue a peculiar sense of realism and makes the sculptor Marcel a convincing individual. The character manages to act as a real person and not as much as a typical B-rogue. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing special and many scenes are boring. What it does is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as Creeper. Kosleck's speaking, philosophical character is in contrast to Hatton's inconspicuous, monosyllabic attitude. The character of the Creeper is not much more than a basic monster level, but Hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and lets you wonder about his back story kid, so I have a certain nostalgic taste for it. For those who like Fortie's horror movies, it's definitely worth a visit.
