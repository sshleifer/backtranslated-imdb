What can I say about this film other than "Do not see". I waited and waited, waiting for something (or anything) to happen and it just did not come. See how two people walk around amazingly as you set the record for most screen fills in a single movie. What do you do? Do you solve a puzzle? Do you collect clues? It may be hard to say. At the end of the film, after many radio signals (illegible on a PET monitor) have been decrypted and he lectures a few times, the plot is finally revealed and thrown away as quickly as possible. Some foreigners want to return to their homeworld utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth (I think they do not like sharing wealth). My guess is that the filming has been completed and they've seen their 35-minute work or art (garbage!) And decided that the editing crew would turn it into an 88-minute feature film. See at your own risk, it's not even funny because it's so bad, it's just awful.
