European Vacation (also known as National Lampoon's European Vacation) is the weakest of the Vacation movies (the first and the third superior of the films). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they get a weaker screenplay with very bad dialogues. This causes the tempo to suffer, and the jokes are not very funny at all. More specifically, what really makes the film suffer is the fact that the "jokes" as they are are simply put together into a cobbled-together script, rather than serving a central act, as in the other 3 Vacation movies Case is. Well, they can not win them all. 4 out of 10.
