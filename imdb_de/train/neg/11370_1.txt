This video contains a superior method of confusing and manipulating Americans about Islam. It is a pity that the people who did it really believe that the American people are so stupid to believe in it, maybe everyone as an American citizen has to protest against this crap. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... THE QURAN IS THE PUBLIC! You can read it yourself and decide if what they say is true or false ... <br /> <br /> The video uses many audiovisual strategies to manipulate and link things that are not even in one another Related. The music used in some places prepares the public to hate what they see, even if they do not really understand what is going on there. They use images that are out of place due to their original content. <br /> <br /> To finish the comment, I would like to make a reflection ... Do not you think that you can make the same movie with any religion in the same religion world?
