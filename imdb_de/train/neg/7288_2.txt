Note to all directors: Long is not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. Not good, though. The scenes were drawn too far. The sex scenes were unnecessary and often too long. The film, which was edited for 2 hours and 10 minutes or less, would have been extraordinary, but unfortunately it became so boring that I can only give it a 2 out of 10. He is way below average. <br /> <br /> Some There are other problems with this marathon as well. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays a whole family tree. The guy who played the great-grandfather does not look like him, but the grandfather, the father and the son (who gives us a constant, unnecessary voice) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bullhead. No one seems to notice that each of these kids looks like a clone of the last, although photos of them are shot every time they pull. This movie is insignificant, but if the movie had not been 3 weeks long, it would not have been so annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) The fact that no news from Germany has been whispered for the longest time It is ridiculous that Jews are rounded up and expelled. A word had come to them and the thought of running away would probably have been discussed. The uncle in France would certainly have sent a warning that he should try to leave her. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories in this movie are completely wrong. You keep giving us this thing over and over again and the development of the relationships between the main characters is extremely short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost immediately ... married. Then have children. Then we draw things for 6 centuries and forget the development of relationships. This would not have stayed that much in a 2-hour movie, but over time nothing was given to us. <br /> <br /> 4) The end was just bad. I do not want to ruin it for anyone, but you will not like it either ... unless you are sadistic. <br /> <br /> The director / writer should be tortured by watching out for this bloated garbage. Weekly basis, my endless loop, oops, that's the same. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this movie. I mean, I think Istvan Szabo needs to model his directing career after him. Long movie that completely ruins any substance in the movie. A short description of "The Horse Whisperer" and Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, perfect title. If you start watching while the sun is shining, it may be fine after dark when you go out.
