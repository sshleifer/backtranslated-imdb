A teenager who seems to have everything commits suicide. His family and best friend (Keanu Reeves) ask many questions ... and blame themselves. <br /> <br /> Good idea, badly treated. For starters, this was done before 1988 - mostly in TV movies and after school specials. Apart from a few curses and dialogues (hence the PG-13 rating), this did not add anything new. The result is predictable and Reeves acting attempts were really painful to look at. He's NOW good, but not in 1988. Besides, his character was dressed like a slob and always looked so dirty it was hard to build sympathy. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the movie is boring. I saw every scene coming and every "surprise" was telegraphed. Basically, I could not wait for this thing to be over. <br /> <br /> I vaguely remember seeing it in a theater in 1988 and hating it (it bombed BADLY). Almost 20 years later it still looks bad. The theme is worth a treatment, but in countless other films it has been done better (with better action). "Ordinary people" comes to mind. You can skip this.
