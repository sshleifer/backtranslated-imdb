The heart of this movie was in the right place, no matter where his brain was. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is basically a parody of an "airplane". (Two years before the fact - nice walking.) of what happens when vegetables attack or fruit in this case. <br /> <br /> Through all sorts of movie magic (stop motion, paper mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse filming, people watching off-screen tomatoes, people watching basketball-sized tomatoes on the actors on the screen In fact, the tomatoes attack anyone in the green area. <br /> <br /> Then it's up to Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies I would not want from any government to save the day. Of course, there is a meddling reporter (Taylor) who appears at the worst of times and dances and sings army soldiers, Japanese scientists with dubbed voices, a guy hauling a parachute and a samurai sword ... and oh yes, the San Diego Chicken, before he made it big. <br /> <br /> The gags here are not that great. In fact, you could probably do better after seeing them. Part of the dialogue is incredibly bad ("Please give the ketchup off" - not to say something in front of tomatoes.) And as for "puberty love" ... Well, I can not blame the tomatoes for making them stunt hearing. <br /> <br /> What's good about that? Well, I liked the title song and the starting point, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at the same time, which was pretty well done. ... that's it. <br /> <br /> Three stars. No "killer" comedy, but it tries. <br /> <br /> Rock on, Peace.
