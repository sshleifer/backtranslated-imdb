If you can do it through the credits, this may be your movie type. From the first screen of a woman holding her hands to her face with white sheets in the background, one remembers a sophisticated perfume commercial. From here it is only downhill. <br /> <br /> The leading actress is basically a block of wood that takes her computer into the past and reconstructs the memories of photographs to speak of the overlooked genius of history, Ada, who had the idea The First Computer Language in the 1800s. <br /> <br /> The low budget graph would be forgivable if it were interesting, or even an integral part of the script. <br /> <br /> Poor Tilda Swinton is wasted.
