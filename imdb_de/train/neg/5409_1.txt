The Christmas secret was touted as a wonderful movie, but I was really disappointed. They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the movie when the movie was over. That makes me believe that the producers were really proud of this project. As a film actor, I had the feeling that most of the performances were called, even though Beau Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I would not include this movie in my otherwise good CV. It was an embarrassment. I've been a fan since his Waltons days, but I was not tempted to see any of his later works, so bad was this offer. and amateurish through and through. <br /> <br /> I hope that this is not considered a malicious review and negative assumptions about my qualifications as a critic. I turned on the movie because he had a good cast and I was ready to enjoy the movie. However, I would challenge anyone to watch this movie, and I do not want the money back, even if it's on T.V.
