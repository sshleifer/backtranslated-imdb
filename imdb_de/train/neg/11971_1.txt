Even if a movie with Bruce Willis is always worth a visit, skip it better. I saw this on TV, so I did not have to spend any money on it. Lucky me. <br /> <br /> The plot is developing slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes are quite believable, towards the end it becomes more and more incredible. It is highly questionable whether an experienced soldier like Lt. Waters disobeyed direct orders. And even if he would, if the rest of his turn would do that. They know he puts them in immediate danger, and they know that they will definitely die if they follow him, but heck, he's our lieutenant. So let's do what he says (despite the direct commands, remember). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless there are some nice scenes in this movie. Something they save a village in which the population is massacred by the rebels. Well, they save about a dozen villagers, the rest have already been killed. The strange thing was that they took the trucks the rebels had left behind. They prefer to walk. Maybe because the roads are insecure, but there was no explanation for that. Anyway. I think that's what gave the film the only point I gave it. <br /> <br /> What made this movie an insult to the brain, and therefore absolutely unbelievable, is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill or kill so many rebels without killing them. Only at the end do they lose some comrades. And only because they have to fight against an army of almost 500 or more. Can you belive that? <br /> <br /> They are fighting an army of so many, killing hundreds of them and losing only a few of them. And they have cartridges and ammunition. Never assume. Grenades and Claymore mines, an M60 machine gun and even an RPG. Where do you get that stuff from? Do you carry it around or what? They even had a laptop that showed them the activity of the enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that works for days. "Really?" Who thinks about this crap? <br /> <br /> I think if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots, give this movie a high rating. If not, skip it. That saves you time.
