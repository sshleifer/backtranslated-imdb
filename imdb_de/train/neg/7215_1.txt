This movie was a stupid crap. Bad everything. Why do we, who love Western movies, drop nine times out of ten when renting Western movies? If you do not put names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck on the cover, it does not seem to be worth dealing with. The main action of Shiloh Falls took place in 1892. The used revolvers were models from the 1860s. Even the shooting was bad - in one scene, the marshal fanned his six out about nine times and could not hit any of the three tall men who were only about five yards away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this insolence. Perhaps those who participated in the film would have taken lessons at the Sunset Carson School of Acting.
