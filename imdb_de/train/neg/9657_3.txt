1) I'm not a weapons expert, but even I can see a difference between US Army weapons in WW1 and WW2. In the film we can see individuals armed with "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!), Not authentically "1903 Springfield" (aka "Silent Death"), private until World War II. Difference - M1 can load 1.5 times more ammo and 3 times more firing rate! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield needs to be reloaded after each shot. Little difference ?! 2) The German uniforms have borrowed since 1940. Especially - helmets. German helmets until the end of the First World War have a considerable pike, we can not even see one in the movie. And if we do little additional research in archives - how much truthful is this "true story"? I am surprised how much "truthful" film directors can be to achieve cheap distribution.
