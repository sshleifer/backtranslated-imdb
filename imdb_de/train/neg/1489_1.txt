That started off badly, got worse and when the girl finally attacked the old lady, I literally wanted to bring the DVD to the person we borrowed from and choke off the C ** T. Avoid this movie, a bit of good cinematography, and some nude shots would be almost acceptable if I was 14 and Jenna Jameson had not seen a million times naked. If someone feels the need to watch this movie, I strongly recommend spending time more appropriately. As an example, I would say stuffing a Lego house in the butt without lubricant would be a good start. I've heard that this movie was not the original version, I would like to see the original, as it looks like this cut version does not contain any plot, and apparently most of the nudity. Can someone please tell me how I can do it In connection with Christian Viel he owes me an hour of my life back!
