* Verification may contain spoiler * <br /> <br /> predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV movie feel. The idea of ​​the UN as adopted by Satan is, according to the Bible, an interesting turn to the end of the world. The premise is interesting, but its excuse is too short. If you want to convert people to Christianity with such a movie, at least make it a quality movie! I seriously checked my watch while watching this filth. I can not say much more about this movie since I saw it over a year ago, and there is not really much to say about this movie except ..... skip!
