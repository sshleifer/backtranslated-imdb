I put this film in the hotel room to entertain my children on the morning we left home because I had stashed all their toys. (Toddlers do not like to look at "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View.") My four-year-old boy found a scene funny, but told me the rest was "too stupid." This is a FOUR SEASON, folks. Anyone over the age of nine wants to kill their TV instead of letting it play. <br/> <br /> To say that this film is bad is like saying the Holocaust is a small mistake. There are no words for how ridiculous and absolutely terrible this "movie" really is. Acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetically quiet. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh that the movie is bad makes it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst one with a weird fake accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun, as far as I could tell), but all the characters are terrible. I have not seen a real Laurel and Hardy movie for years, but I know they had to be a lot better. What's the point of ruining a classic comic duo with ... this one? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: deposited garbage. Avoid at all costs, unless you have a fancy Bronson Pinchot Fetish. 2.10
