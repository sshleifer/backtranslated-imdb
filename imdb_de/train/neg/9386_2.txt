In the many films that I saw Warren Oates, I came to a final conclusion, here is a talented person. I saw Mr. Oates for the first time in the 1960s Stoney Burke television series. From then on, I followed his career closely and felt that he was destined for big roles. That happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him the highest reckoning in a movie titled "Bring Me the Head by Alfredo Garcia". Of course, his most famous claim was his great role in 'The Wild Bunch'. I've always thought he could bring some magic to every character until I saw him in that flop. The film is called "Chandler," a tribute to the iron pugilist of the 1950s, created by Raymond Chandler. Because the synopsis said it was a tough private eye, I was immediately interested. However, I sat patiently through the entire movie and found it boring, uninteresting, slow, confused, confusing saga that, if it had a theme or plot, was left behind in a dark back room itself. Along with some of Hollywood's best stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this film had enough power to reach Mach Five, but it was popping up and down the launchpad. As a result, one of my favorite actors was stuck in a poorly built vehicle that never got off the ground. **
