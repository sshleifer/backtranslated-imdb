Another rape of the story <br /> <br /> This movie is a disaster. It uses only a historical story and makes a sweet love story with bad actors and low budget. The movie should be 1/3 of the time, they just took the time to make a miniseries. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes are so stupid and illogical, the soldiers log dumb, the costumes a catastrophe. The Romans fought well in open areas, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in a forest. In this film, the Romans want to fight in the city. > <br /> And by the way, Cleopatra was of Macedonian origin, which means fair-skinned person.
