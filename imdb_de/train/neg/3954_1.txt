The ENTIRE MOVIE is a retrospective of the first Boogeyman movie and inexplicable footage of another Brainwaves movie by Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love. It is equipped with more up-to-date material (from the early '90s) that is boring, poorly played and cheaply shot. Not only is the movie almost completely flashbacks, it also repeats the same flashbacks throughout the movie. So you always see recycled material as if you have not seen it yet. As if the originals were not bad enough. I've never seen such a cushioned movie ... Someone milked the last dollar from those movies. Totally rip off And talk about padding ... Why do I have to write 10 lines about this junk? If I can convey that it is rubbish in two lines, that should be enough.
