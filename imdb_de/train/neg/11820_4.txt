I've seen this on DVD (known in this format as CORRUPT), and the clatter on the case has really hyped up, as Harvey Keitel's character Frank is very similar to that of BAD LIEUTENANT in "This Grim and Powerful Police Thriller." What the case did not mention that this is an old Italian movie, how old is Theo? When a character plays music that he does not put on the CD player, he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing and puts it on a Type rotatable hob, where a kind of mechanical arm touches the pancake thing, which makes music heard.See my point that this is an old movie? The DVD case did not indicate that this movie was shot 20 years ago. It's also a movie with bad production values, like many other Italian movies that dress up as American, and aside from Keitel, the actors are awful, though Johnny Rotten's performance is rather bizarre r is terrible. The cinematography is static, and the picture and sound quality gives the impression that I've seen a pirate copy of the fourth generation (I do not know if it's a dodgy DVD or if it's a very bad movie print) and worst of all is Ennio Morricone. It's impossible to believe that the man who made the irritating intrusive sideline for CORRUPT is the same one who made the music for these Westerns from Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> All this is a pity, because CORRUPT has its moments It's by no means the greatest psycho-thriller ever invented, but it held my interest and as always, Keitel performs well as a violent spinner. Too bad that the rest of the movie did not live up to its high standards
