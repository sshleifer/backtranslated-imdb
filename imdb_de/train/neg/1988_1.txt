Okay, I passed the horrible acting. I got the fact that Lil Kim had blown up some cannons and their arms or hands did not move, I got the weave, I got the colored contacts. <br /> <br /> That killed it for me: In the scene where the four roses sat at the table arguing. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun stand up, and Lil Kim gets up to stop all hostilities by saying, "Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Wait, let's chill here for a hot second." I'm a fan of the Western movie genre, and I've never heard anyone speak something like slang in Clint Eastwood's movies. <br /> <br /> If anyone thinks this movie deserves a rating above 1, please tell me another movie that's worse than Gang of Roses. <br /> <br /> I'm done.
