The original Japanese film "Gamera" from 1965 (http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/) was essentially an update of the darker, less child-oriented Gojira (Godzilla) for the sensibility of the 1960s. Of course, Gamera is a huge, flying, flame-throwing turtle that literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but usually similar. <br /> <br /> This version of the original movie was edited and re-edited by the infamous Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla ("Godzilla King of the Monsters") gets "Gammera the Invincible" more than just the spelling. The American scenes are not nearly as ridiculous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but they do not add much to the story because they are not pursued much further. <br /> <br /> The movie starts promising, there are some scenes where character development continues, and there are enough personalities to create excitement outside of the main action. As soon as Gamera shows up, however, the film begins to go into a fairly normal Kajju movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is good enough - even the American add-ons are fine. The direction is pretty good for this time and genre and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some sets and scenes are actually very good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here is, of course, that there is little or nothing original about this film. However, Gamera develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most are worth seeing if you're a Kaiju fan.
