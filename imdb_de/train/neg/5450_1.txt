Such a presumptuous and lame attempt to do hip-hop. Diabolical writing and dialogue and really embarrassing action. Really the worst movie I have ever seen (in the cinema). In my opinion, nothing saves this film from total catastrophe. I saw it when it came out in a cinema in Brighton. People went out and there were more people chatting outside the toilets than in the auditorium! In the end there were brood salts and contempt from the meager crowd, which was rather sad as relatives of one of the main characters were present and looked really mischievous. However, the movie was so bad that I really could not feel so sympathetic. Everyone has to start from somewhere and his son started his acting career with this really terrible attempt at "Tarantinism made in UK". 5 years have passed, but sometimes I still scare the memory of that sad night in the cinema! This is a movie without any redeeming features! I gave him a 1 because 0 was not available. They should invent a "shameometer" for all involved in this sad mess of a movie. I know that some of them have gone on to better things. The positive is that none of them could have dropped anything below.
