This movie is awful. The characters are absolutely incredible and completely contradictory. The plot is awful and some of the lesson scenes are uncannily worthy and make viewing uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The quality of the script and the characterization suggest that this film was written by students alone. The total lack of credibility for the school environment suggests that the authors probably never attended high school. Acting was also weak in most cases, though this was largely due to a bad script and a bad plot. I am not sure that any actor could make this movie visible. <br /> <br /> after he said the sound track was fine, and the cinematography was nice in some places (although the cut was bad).
