I bought this video in Walmart's $ 1 trash can. I think I overpaid !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi produced a long series of 3rd prize films for small studios (in this case Monogram - most of the Bowry Boys movies). While the misery of most of these films does not match the level of horror that his latest films have achieved (Ed Wood's "classics" like "The Bride of the Monster" and "Plan 9 From Outer Space"), they are still bad movies and movies should be avoided by all but the diehard fans. <br /> <br /> I'm an old movie junkie, so I tried. Besides, some of these smaller films were actually pretty good - just not this one. Lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he brews from young brides. They never really explained why it had to be brides or why it had to be women or even what illness his wife had - so you can see that the conspiracy was never really eradicated. <br /> <br /> A really annoying reporter (a Lois Lane guy without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of all those obvious murders in which the bodies were stolen! So she follows some clues to the front door of Lugosi. Lugosis home is complete with his crazy wife, a female assistant and two strangers who are obviously the sons of the assistant (an ugly humpbacked sex lover and a dwarf). Of course, this brave reporter faints over and over again throughout the movie - apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! At some point, the insane die ALL - mainly because of their own hands and everything is fine. In the end, the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry. And of course, the stupid cameraman of the reporter faints when this happens. If you have not noticed, there is a lot of powerlessness in this movie. Or maybe, because it was such a slow and lumbering movie, they just fell asleep!
