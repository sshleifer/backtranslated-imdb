This movie is not funny. It is not entertaining. It does not contain a second of originality or intelligence, nor does it cause you to focus on the characters or the situation. On top of that, it's such a young movie as anything that has lately been in the memory. It's as if a group of 14- or 15-year-old high school students who had never met or had any relationship with a real girl had written a film based on their phony fantasies about being a grown man would. This movie is boring, disgusting, and sometimes offensive and disgusting. It contains at most one or two moments that make you laugh. It also seems twice as long as its 85-minute runtime.
