I'm not sure if users should be able to review the movies after half an hour, but I'm afraid I just could not stand another minute. <br /> <br /> If this shameful excuse for a movie is wrong If the late, great GP does not spin like a wheel in the grave, then I doubt that anything will come of it. <br /> <br /> The excellent review above "No movie for Parsons fans" summarizes most of my feelings. How can a director and writer (second prize) dare something that they are so clearly unable to deliver? What did they think? Where should I start? <br /> <br /> THE SCRIPT: I thought I would get a bit of bittersweet Americana. What I got was a badly executed slapstick, without a clich√© being turned on. Stupid hippie? Check. Stupid fat policeman? Check. Terrible Aids Check. Embarrassed written characters? Check. Absolute disregard for the story you want to portray? Check. <br /> <br /> After a while you realize that this is a soap and not a very well written one. Scene with Knoxville. Scene with ex-girlfriend. Scene with Knoxville, who did not move much. Scene with ex-girlfriend that was a bit like the last one. And so on ... <br /> <br /> THE DIRECTION: After some deliberation, my friends and I decided to watch a bad episode of Quincy, or perhaps a particularly poor Duke of Hazzard. The direction was so bad. Terrible jumps, terrible camera work, chunky entrances and exits to scenes. God, it was crispy. And then I discovered that the director was an Irishman whose most notable recent work is a really lousy BBC Sunday drama called Monarch of the Glen (trust me, it's the lowest common denominator TV). And then it all made sense ... <br /> <br /> THE ACTING: Are we so critical now that if a random guy on TV decides to try acting, if he's not that bad, he'll stink , we applaud his efforts Knoxville JUST ABOUT manages to get through every scene. Poor Christina A. has no such luck. Your performance is a car crash (though you know what you do with these wires I do not know). The hippie in the hearse: Oh dear, Oh dear, Oh dear. Have not we moved since Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you get my drift. I would say that, as mentioned in other reviews, no one in this film clearly gives a flying damnation for The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram's solo work. They did not know anything about the American road movie, and they go out of their way to start with an admittedly decent story from rock mythology. This film was flat, could not explore anything and was out of date from beginning to end ... oh, I did not quite make it to the end. And I suggest you stay away too.
