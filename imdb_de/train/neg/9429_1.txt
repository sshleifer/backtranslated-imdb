I bought this movie for $ 5 in a used CD store, and I somehow regret it. I start by saying that I'm a big fan of kitsch horror movie. They offer a terribly cheap entertainment. This movie entertained the first half hour because it was so bad that it could easily spy on MST3K style. Then it got boring. <br /> <br /> Acting is the scariest part of the movie. Although great spectacle is not expected, this was ridiculously bad and, frankly, offered all the entertainment that was available. That's the plus of the movie. Where the movie is really entertaining is writing, lighting and editing. <br /> <br /> This movie contains way too many "What is the% $ @ #?" Moments There are many moments, such as the mother having strange seizures at dinner, and that this has absolutely no effect on the movie. As for dinner, one person in charge decided that it was fun to watch people eat fancy food without dialogue for five minutes each time a meal was served. During dining and other inappropriate moments, the scene falls outside in pure darkness. Then it goes back. And when we talk about darkness, the climate is one of the funniest parts of the movie where it does not seem to be night when it's not raining. And when you talk about darkness, the movie's big problem is that it's so badly lit that half the time you do not see what's going on, which is more of a frustration than anything else. In one of the climate scenes, you can not even say what you're supposed to see, that's so shocking. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to climate scenes, Unhinged contains one of the worst. I saw people say, "Wow, that surprised me and that's good." I can say that the big revelation surprised me because I did not see it coming. The reason why I did not see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense. I will not ruin it for you, but I'll tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes moving through different parts of the movie to find anything that would have confirmed that it was not possible , <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is actually better if you watch it with the commentary tracks that make fun of it. I love crap horror movies, but that was too much.
