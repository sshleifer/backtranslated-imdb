I really liked A Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970, but Return played like a typical sequel. Everything about it - budget, script, plot, casting and acting - was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman, an elder of the Yellow Hand tribe, does not look like an Indian and half of the other "Indians" who were played by Italians, Mexicans and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old man who played the chief behaved more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors. He even used the bow like a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who has done such an excellent job in the original, seems to be sailing this time. I think he could not resist the simple paycheck he got because he had repeated his role as a horse. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the movie, such as Horse undergoing a painful cleansing ritual "find his vision" and collect the yellow hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors But by and large, Return is uneven, boring, cheesy and predictable - just like most sequels.
