With a "borrowed" title from Werner Herzog and liberal helpers from Kubrick, Haneke and Noe, it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay cuts across the usual garbage of our British movie theater. "Robert Carmichael" (short: Robert Carmichael) is a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time apparently criticizing the Iraq war. The problem with realism is that the characters are obviously unrealistic and atypical - unlike the annoying notions of "extreme" filmmakers, most teenagers are not drug-addicted rapists. As a criticism of the Iraq war, a film about youth violence (by a talented classical musician - the subtext society has damaged this sensitive person) is so infantile that he hardly needs to think about it. There are signs of technical skill, but some critics have overdone it. Like Kubrick and Noe, he shows that the desire for a shock in conjunction with supposed serious intent may be the worst movie trick of the last film. People liked "Clockwork Orange" and "Irreversible" because they liked the rapes and the violence, but most of all they liked being culturally superior because they loved the things they most hated. Too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) calls this one of the most idiotic films in years. (I'm not against film violence, if you take it seriously, it's a hard trick - the people in the cinemas cheered Alex in "Clockwork Orange") and showed that Kubrick's alleged intent was far out of reach the claims of many art directors.)
