I seldom make these comments, but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I had while watching this movie. It's so stupid and implausible, both in the overall story and in the details, that you just can not expose unbelief. The problem starts early when you see a government researcher working in a new Porsche and dining with his team in a restaurant that looks like a castle and overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington, DC. Hah! It only gets worse. Towards the end, when the evil one starts killing the good guys, this group acts so stupid that they want them to die to purify the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good - any producer can buy that - and the lead actors were great in other films, but the script and direction here are moronic. Many people have wondered if there was a deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven's earlier, stupid movies (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this movie should stop the question. He is just bad.
