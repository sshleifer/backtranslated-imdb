I can not remember that "Barnaby Jones" was just a very mild standard detective show in which, as in any Quinn Martin show, Act I was the murder, Act II was the main character in the investigation of the murder, Act III The plot plot (another character was murdered), Act IV was the break up, and the epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether), who asked her father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) how he had figured out the crime, and then someone said something funny end of the show. <br /> <br /> One thing I remember was the late, great composer Jerry Goldsmith's great theme song. Oddly, I wanted to watch the show for the seven seasons in which the show ran because of the opening sequence. I also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a different role than Jed Clampett, although Ebsen was a heavy failure. I just wish the show would be more entertaining when I remembered it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Update (Jan 11, 2009): I saw an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through their American TV channel archive. Let's just say, I was friendlier than Goldsmith to the show "Barnaby Jones".
