Michael Jackson would have claimed a seat for the figure with the highest price in THE GOLDEN CHILD and because he loves children. That did not work (and why would it be?), Instead we chose Eddie Murphy to save the world by rescuing Kid Midas. I would urge all future screenwriters to thoroughly study the actor 's inhuman dialogue in this quirky fantasy adventure comedy ISHTAR takes a step closer. Whatever Murphy says or does may be best liked, but do not understand me about his exquisite, weird talent. He does not belong in this movie, and the same goes for DR. DOLITTEL! The violence and the visual elements are reasons to call it a cult camp classic, and that would not have made sense, since Hollywood and movie fanatics constantly struggled with the guy. Speaking of visuals, at the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential glory, they were surprisingly well dressed. Murphy is much better at COMING TO AMERICA and 48 HRS, but this outdated movie is not exactly my golden honey for a sweet, crunchy taste.
