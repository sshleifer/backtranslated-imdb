Also referred to as the "House of Exorcism" in another form, this little movie takes itself so seriously that it kills any entertainment value. <br /> <br /> whatever. <br /> <The replacement property concerns the European tourist Elke Sommer, who has a chance with Telly Savalas, who looks exactly like the devil she has seen on a fresco in the fortress square. Summer gets a ride to a mysterious house in the countryside where Savalas is a butler. There she is considered a long dead woman, and the actual theater opera begins. The husband of the house, a blind matriarch, had an affair with the dead woman who was the betrothed of the matriarch's son. The couple, the summer brought the ride? <br /> <br /> Well, the woman gives the chauffeur a "Fahrunterricht <br /> <br /> class", and the man knows and does not care. Finally, <br /> <br /> most of the cast is killed, summer is stunned and raped, <br /> <br /> escapes, and the viewer climbs aboard an empty <br /> br /> airplane ... which resembles the empty theaters where this <br /> <br /> thing was played. <br /> <br /> The alternative version of this "House of Exorcism" has added scenes <br /> <br /> involving a priest. <br /> <br /> The VHS copy of Elite Entertainment is crystal clear and <br /> <br /> letterboxed. There are "extras" after the credits. Sex deleted <br /> <br /> and Gore scenes. <br /> <br /> Mario Bava's direction is quick and furious, but his screenplay is <br /> <br /> awful. There are half-baked ideas, abandoned storylines, and breathtaking amenities that do nothing but push this thing in a forward direction. They have a life like dummies for funerals, the blind matriarch does not seem so blind, <br /> <br /> and Savalas gets the same lollipops he had in "Kojak" (who < br /> <br /> chasing you, baby?). <br /> <br /> The project seems to have two names stars, then the script quickly wrote something happening in Hollywood in a daily incident right now. Savalas looks utterly lost, hesitantly delivering his <br /> <br /> line and wishes his character did not die in "The Dirty <br /> <br /> Dozen". Summer runs around and screams and gasps, but <br /> <br /> her character is empty, I use the term "character" loosely. The only thing we know about her is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a really strange movie, and your reaction to it may depend on <br /> <br /> how heavy are you in Eurohorror and Kojak. I can not recommend "Lisa and the Devil". <br /> <br /> This is not rated and includes all the extras at the end of the VHS. <br /> <br /> Copy, contains strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong gore, strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content and adult situations
