This movie is not funny anyway, it tries to be funny with its lame humor that is so dry and boring that the movie is only two hours torture. Throughout the movie, I thought of one thing, "when is the end." One thing you have to give them is that they have some mild funny moments, which is why I have given them whole 2 stars. It's unoriginal and uses up almost every old blond joke in the book, even those that were not funny the first time around. It's basically a movie to vilify blondes and record the entire repertoire of blond jokes. <br /> <br /> To sum it up: This movie is blond humor that has gone bad, it's just so bad.
