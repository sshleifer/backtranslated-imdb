Now I have seen many bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. I have seen (and enjoyed) Jean-Claude Van Damme's films, including the film in which he is his own clone, both in which he plays twins, and all three in which he is a cyborg. I actually own the one in which he plays a fashion designer and beats himself in a truck full of durians. (Hey, if nothing else, he has a great ass and you can almost always see it.) With DVD you can even pause and zoom in!) So you can trust me when I say this movie is so bad Citizen Kane look. <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. The sets are bad. The battles are bad. The stunts are bad. The FX are bad. The spectacle is spectacular, groundbreakingly bad and probably shows the worst performance of any so-called actor in the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas. That really says something. And I'd be willing to bet that everyone involved in this movie is lousy in bed. PARTICULARLY Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> It's unintentionally funny, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either an innocent idiot or very, very stoned. I could assert myself because I had to watch something to keep myself from flushing cat urine out of my laundry. <br /> <br /> It did not help much, but it was better than nothing. A point for Ron Palillo's cameo as a gay arsonist.
