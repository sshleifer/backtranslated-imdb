The Deadly Wake is THE PERFECT FILM for movie students ... to learn how NOT to make a movie! Worst Mixing Worst Editing Worst Shooting Worst Shooting Worst Shooting Worst Shots Worst Illumination Worst Illumination Worst Illumination Worst Illumination Worst Illumination, etc. Imagine if this "movie" was black and white and extremely dumb ... it would still have been terrible , All scenes are dark (the lighting is called "black"), often the music score drowned out the meandering dialogues, which was fine since no one spoke two whole sentences without long breaks. The "evil" robot was weird ... what was that? Jazz dancing? Oh, I think it should be tactical or something. I'm sure it scared the poor editors' hearts. And how do you handle so much garbage? Not possible. Garbage is garbage, no matter how you split it. How did anyone ever get this through the newspapers? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I could not stand to see more than 15-minute segments, it was so bad ... but I saw it all (with many breaks) just to see if it had any good parts at all. NEE! NONE! <br /> <br /> A perfect example of how not to make a movie ... a must for any serious film student !!!
