... but I regret to have seen it. Since the ratings for IMDb are relatively high (and must have been relatively high on Netflix as well), I probably put them in the queue because they're being promoted as a soft comedy from the UK, a category that has produced a lot of films like mine have fallen immensely. "Saving Grace", on the other hand, is one of the most laughable comedies normally populated by Hollywood films produced and directed by the talentless. Brenda Blethyn is a capable actress, and I loved her in other films. The concept - a gardener who grows marijuana to overcome the misery she faces after her husband's death - does not offend me. Despite the effort of the cast to create humor, the film falls flat on his face (falling flat on his butt might have been funnier) as far as I and my wife were concerned. Be forewarned, oh dear reader, not all unusual British comedies succeed. This is a guy.
