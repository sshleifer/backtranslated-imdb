Normally, I have no problem getting away from a bad movie, but this was a unique case. This movie was so bad that I actually sat down and almost prayed that he would have a minute of movie time to justify the one and a half hours that were wasted. Needless to say, I was brutally disappointed. In a beach house, where a group of college friends celebrating holidays, this film suffers from numerous problems that make him not worth seeing. First, there are gaping plots. Second, few C-list actors (I do not even dare to call them B) play a damn valuable role, so scenes that have potential fail miserably. Third, the speed of the film is very choppy and uncomfortable when you have to watch most of the time, which makes it very difficult to build tension, resulting in very few surprises for the audience. Fourth and foremost, the end is partly completely anti-climatic, because it ends (attitude / who is the killer) and partly because the dialogue is simply abhorrent. The movie is the only movie I'll ever say, the worst movie I've ever done, and I've seen so much the happier that you've never heard. The next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret, you will scream no.
