'Home Alone 3' is the first of the Home Alone movies in which Culkin does not feature in the lead role and the same rogues. However, the plot is very similar to the original movie "Home Alone". Instead of two weird villains we get three or four of them. This movie includes some traps, but it also has a long scene with a remote-controlled car. The slapstick humor is also consistent, but the boy and the bad guys really have no influence in this movie. (No pun intended.) This movie is nothing new or different from the previous movies, and there really is not the warm holiday feeling or the subplots that the other two films had. It's more of a pure comedy, but it did not make me laugh because the characters really did not do it for me. I would not recommend this movie. It's pretty boring If you're looking for a good family movie with comedy, check out the original movie "Home Alone".
