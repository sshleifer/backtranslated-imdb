We all know that countless guys have harbored the 80s Slasher genre and often earn nothing but our deepest disgust. Maybe it's a bit hastey, but damn it, if "Slaughter High" was not terribly unoriginal even for a Slasher movie. In fact, the plot is a kid who experiences a Carrie-like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the run-down building to seek revenge on a group of former bullys who all remember. As expected, on April 1 they are killed by a masked lunatic by electric shock, burning, hanging, and chemically modified beer. I have a lot of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie, but considering the end, I feel the need to reject my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time. Ignore any thought of watching this movie ...
