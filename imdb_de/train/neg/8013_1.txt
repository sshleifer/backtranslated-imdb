You'd think a movie about a young person coping with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but boring. Think again. This production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia, as it is about ten times as strong as any other sleep aid on the market. It's almost as if the filmmaker were making a movie, but he got lazy and instead decided to make a series of random (and randomly boring) images and go-nowhere scenes. This good lighting does not matter in movie production, and wrap it under the auspices of an "Arthouse" movie. This is a kind of crappy product that makes it easy for many traditional filmmakers to keep the indie film movement from poo-poo and the general public from embracing indie films more easily. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in films that deal with this topic, you would be much happier if you look at some of the great short films available on the logo website, or Get Real rent. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this long-winded bastard.
