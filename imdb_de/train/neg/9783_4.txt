Not the worst movie I've seen, but definitely not very good either. I myself am a paintball player, have played a lot of airball and going from the forest to the airball is a big change. The film shows similar qualities First, the film starts with this team, which seems to be trying to turn this "phantom" type or whatever, they seem to be a professional team and wear jerseys and magazines, Autocockers. A guy with a bushy sport. Not much wrong with the movie, but more than it was perceived, it was very cheesy. A few of the good guys are Woodball players who do not seem to have much money and dreams of "better weapons." Another team is constantly attacking and insulting them for playing forest and blah blah blah. The Phantom helps these Forest Ball kids, trains them and all the crap, gets them to play Airball, and basically defeats all teams including the "pros". <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movie? Well, the budget is a huge deal, a paintball movie would NOT be bad, but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was made by an amateur. There are no big names in this movie and the acting is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is also pretty bad. They seem to imply that every speedball and all the other crap will play. It was just a lousy movie in my opinion and does not give a real idea of ​​what paintball is. To be honest, real paintball is not just a buddy, it's a lot of swear word and bonus balling, not "respect" and sticking to the rules. Do not look at this movie and then wait for a box labeled "4 is 1 !!"
