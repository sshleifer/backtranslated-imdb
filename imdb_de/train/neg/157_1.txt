Ok, first of all, the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s. I was shocked when I found out that it was released in 2001. If there had been a brief prologue or introduction, the story would have been better. I also appreciate the imagination, but this movie was too much. It was bizarre and badly filmed. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd. It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation, but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic movies, but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy movie, I would not recommend the Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development). Beware, you will be disappointed.
