This movie gets only a second star because I work downtown and liked it being destroyed. The effects were pretty good - I've heard that it was the most expensive Korean movie ever made. the most expensive and still absolutely terrible, makes it a massive waste of money. I rented it, so I'm not going to complain too much about what I paid. Plot holes abound. terrible action down the line. I do not recommend giving up time to watch this movie, life is too short. If your friends want to see this, run away. I can not stress enough how bad this movie was. <br /> <br /> Where the hell did the second dragon come from? Why did not he turn up earlier? How did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs 500 years ago?
