Would have been much better fortified if it was done as a <br /> <br /> 50-minute episode of the outer limits. Too much superfluous material and things like the boss villain who looked like he'd fled the Phantom of the Opera did not help. The whole 'Night of the Living Dead' was extremely stupid and quite unnecessary. If the dead punish anyone for their sins, now remember exactly who killed everyone again?
