A pale shadow of a great musical. This film suffers from the fact that director Richard Attenborough misses the point of the musical entirely, unnecessarily "opening" it and confusing the thrust of the piece. The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a B'way musical and explores their drive and desire to work in this challenging and not always rewarding job. Attenborough gives us a new group of Hope students who expect to get their "big break" in show business instead of presenting the on-stage mix of characters as a group of "gypsy" work shows, along with a few newcomers. The movie has an advantage over the piece and this is the opening scene, which shows the size of the original auditions and the true size of the shrinkage up to the 16/17 of the line (depending on how you count Cassie, who is stupid outside of the line) Movie). Anyone who can watch a local opera performance of the play with the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this ill-conceived film.
