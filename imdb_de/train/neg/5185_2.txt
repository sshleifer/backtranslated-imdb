A complete waste of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a complete waste of time. The script and the dialogues are poorly written, the direction is dull and the acting borders on Hammy. This film clearly aimed at the amount of De Basanti, which, however, lags far behind the mark, as it does not even contain any of the elements that were made. RDB is linked to the scriptwriter, grandiose spectacle, good direction, and a powerful social message that was never preached, but shown. <br /> <br /> Compared to this masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step back and captures scenes like the hero's licking a hole in the villain's Persian carpet and the mentor of the hero staring at the bullets in a truck, not less! All of this may have been acceptable in the '80s, as film quality deteriorated and bad movies like DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante became big hits, but filming lately has become increasingly subtle and thoughtful. <br /> <Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director, and I appreciate that he wants to convey a social message in every movie he makes, but he just does not know how to do it! He intervenes to preach without regard to the intelligence of the audience to understand what he is trying to say. Maybe he should just concentrate on the conversation and leave the social messages to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khan. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with everything I say, you will agree that you will be present throughout the show. I thought Rang De Basanti was much better and Mr.Santoshi had the Industry should leave Om Shanti Om. Industry-bashing? That's right !! Santoshi has portrayed the industry as a place of haunting, sobbing, and casting couch that the hero cheerfully pampers with an asterisk called Sania. There are people who think these parts show the true face of the industry. Do not believe everything you see! All in all, raise your voice against such films and do not spend your hard-earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * from ****.
