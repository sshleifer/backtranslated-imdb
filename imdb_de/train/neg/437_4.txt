(Spoiler) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see this movie after hearing it was smart and funny. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: the way the relationship develops between a man and a woman reveals all the problems and difficulties that two people can experience in a big city. What I did not like about the whole movie was two things. At first the film was so down to earth that it looked like it describes the problems that a couple has to solve in a single day on the basis of today it has become ordinary and boring. Second, the general negligence of production with dialogues that were hardly comprehensible. <br /> <br /> Pity.
