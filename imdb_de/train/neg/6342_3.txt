I have it in the video library because of the recommendation of Tarantino ("If you do not like (them), go yourself!") Putting on the box ... seemed like a resonant confirmation ... I expected it a bit more like " Death Proof "... not much actual violence in this storyline or action, character or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Look at the poster. It is all there. Stunts and rock. It goes back and forth. About a week in the life of an LA band performing a crappy magic show, on a level you might see in one of the smaller casinos on the Strip, and an Australian stuntman in the city who finds his feet ... you work They meet girls, they celebrate. End of the story. <br /> <br /> The band obviously needed all of that, because they are frankly second-tier and play a style that was already dating back to 1978. It must be said that the stunt bits in the movie are really crazy - this Aussie Fellow is really something, and the movie seems to be largely motivated by love and respect for the "art". I hung it up there to see what he would do next. I only wish he could have found a better vehicle.
