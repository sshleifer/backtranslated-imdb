Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie: Too long a face only on shots where you usually feel the bottom half of the movie is missing (that the screen is cut off), because seemingly important actions are occurring, but you can not see. There is already too much confusion in the movie anyway, so it gets worse through these angles and does not contribute to elaborate visuals. <br /> <br /> I like artfully made films and unconventional camera work. I can handle deep and slow films. But this one is trying too hard to be something artistic, and in my opinion is failing painfully. <br /> <br /> Nothing the characters could stick to because they are not well enough worked out. To train characters, you need more than just a few minutes of facial recording, at least with this set of screenplay + director + actors and director or because of the actors. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I'll stay away from movies written and directed by Le You in the future. <br /> <br /> What an annoying movie, also for someone who would be interested in this part of the story, and for someone who was in Shanghai.
