Just too many cases of violence. <br /> <br /> The film goes from one scene to another, and violence breaks out in almost every violence. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not one who is shocked by violence and I miss something in a movie without a fight. But please not one by one. My reaction was not shock or horror, it was, "Here we go again." Between the scenes of violence there is a semblance of a story, but two-thirds of the entire movie I had completely turned off and could not wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If this is the case The best the filmmakers can do should have something else to do with their miserable life, such as: B. make shoes or post.
