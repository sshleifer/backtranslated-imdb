This is a big step after the surprisingly pleasing original. This sequel is not nearly as funny as the first part, and instead too much time is devoted to developing the plot. Tim Thomerson is still the best on this series, but in this entry his joke painting is somewhat toned down. The performances are all appropriate, but this time the script fails us. The action is just routine and the plot is just a little interesting, so I need stupid laughs to be entertained during a "Trancers" movie. Unfortunately, there are only a few laughs, and therefore this film is visible at best.
