I think this movie should be shocking. But the only way it's really shocking is how shocking it was. It's one and a half hours of torment. Even more for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). <br /> <br /> Sure, the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically okay, since it's a horror. Movie. And I like horror movies (usually). I have no problem with violence in these types of films per se. The violence in this film, however, has no purpose. It's not a show, just that it's just grotesque. It's so lame that it even gets boring, and really fast too. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (if that was not enough for you above) about this movie is that they have tried to copy the Blair Whitch project by filming with cheap handheld cameras. But even this serves no purpose. In "Blair Which" there is of course an explanation, namely that they are looking for the Blairhexe with a camera. There's no other explanation in this movie than, "Hey, let's make us look like the Blair Whitch !!" The sound in the movie is also something to be depressed about. The girls scream so hysterically that one often can not understand what they are saying. No effort was made to do anything better, both in terms of sound and otherwise. <br /> <br /> Finally there's the soundtrack, which is just as bad as the rest and from cheap euro house to the worst grunge rock ... <br /> <br /> My tip: take a look DO NOT, under no circumstances.
