We've given up on the point where George Clooney's character pulled out his fingernails. We were not squeamish - after sitting for an hour with this jerk, we just knew how it felt. To say that this film is incomprehensible, boring and presumptuous would be to praise it! How did people manage to get through this confusing, slow, depressing pseudo-corner of a movie, let alone nominate for an Oscar? Clooney looked as ill as we watched him. What did he think? Oh .. and what about these subtitles? - Did we just have a Dud DVD or was the original movie like that - phrases that got stuck in the middle of the air? The film was heavy enough to follow without it. I feel sorry for the cast, which obviously did its best with the available material.
