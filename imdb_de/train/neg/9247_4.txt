"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Charlie's Essanay films from 1915. While this group of films can be seen better than their 1914 counterparts, it seems to be slightly below average. The gag with the double guard with janitor and the hard end, when Charlie awakens from a dream in which he strokes the main actress on the hair, just to stroke the head of a wiper, which he had used quasi pillows are both classic Chaplin moments. They are both ironically the beginning and the end. The center is full of battles with the rival janitor and a bank robbery to win the girl. The mop is probably the biggest physical prop in the movie, and Charlie uses it to make a comedy, whether or not he's intent on his character. The mop seems to be Charlie's alter ego doing things he desires, but he could not do it with his own hands. Interesting stuff, but it's better.
