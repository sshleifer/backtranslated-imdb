I have seen many bad movies. Most of the time I can enjoy a fucking horror movie as it is. But that really brings new extremes with it. <br /> <br /> It's bland, the plot for what it is, never really goes anywhere and takes time. There are no shakes, no horror, no tension, just a lot of guys rubbing for an hour and a half and then reaching a quick target. <br /> <br /> A stain on the crappy horror genre. <br /> <br />
