I'm a big fan of the original book and this adaptation is just bad. At first it was difficult to decide whether it was a kid or an adult that created a strange mix of an adult story and some pretty violent scenes with a stupid little duck that gives "funny" moments at the beginning br /> <br /> But that's hardly important, the film is just boring, immobile and not true to the original story. It simply fails to transfer all the points that Orwell has made to his book to the picture. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> Second Revolution? !! Did not the boys learn anything? Who is the next Napoleon? Benjamin?!!
