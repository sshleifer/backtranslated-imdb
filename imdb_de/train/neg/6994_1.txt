When I saw this movie, I had big expectations. But I was so wrong. This movie was just like any other horror movie. It's a virus, zombies, etc. Just like Resident Evil and many, many other movies. But the difference with this and other movies is that the story is a week. They are bad actors and boring music. The photo is fine, but the rest is total crap. Do not see this "horror movie", watch Ring 2 or another movie that's much more of a story. I hope they will stop making horror movies that spread a virus and spread the virus to make humans zombies. We have seen enough of it. The only good thing about the film is when they stand on a roof and shoot famous, infected celebrities.
