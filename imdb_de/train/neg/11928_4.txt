The Saints' lives begin with an atmospheric vision of London as a vibrant city with busy, picturesque streets and sunshine. I was hoping it would maintain that atmosphere, but it's stuck in a story that's pretty much not going anywhere. At least I think that's what it should be because it's never really defined, but it lets kittens fall into fryers So trust me, he's an asshole. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black guy who always crashes from A to B. Until the day he encounters an almost dumb homeless child who allows him to stop. Runner drops the lost boy in Othello's apartment, where he promptly fulfills more wishes. To fulfill some of his own wishes, Karva has the boy abducted. But he is not sure what would really make him happy. Is it the innocence of being a child again, or is it another handiwork? In any case, I do not want the little boy to grant him the second. <br /> <br /> It takes forever to get started, and there are plenty of repetitive scenes. The end seems shocking, but with little background for investing in any of these characters, it only serves as a release for the bored audience. <br /> <br /> Writer Tony Grisoni, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, tries to blend in with a kind of religious allegory that ironically turns out to be hell. If he gave us something more accessible, or at least better explanations for the suddenly funny looking characters, it would have been a more enjoyable movie. As it is, we are acquainted with a lot of annoying sounds that miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy. Who is the origin, never revealed. That's just irritating! <br /> <br /> Apart from sporadic moments of the atmosphere and an atmospheric score, this film has little to recommend.
