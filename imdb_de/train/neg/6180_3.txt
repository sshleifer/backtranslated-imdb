I participated in one of the premieres last night and made the following observations: <br /> <br /> 1. Just because you have directed a lot of music videos, you are NOT qualified to make films. The film had a wealth of long shots that made no sense, terrible angles and terrible lighting. The editing did not help this mess at all. When "Dixie" arrives late for the memorial service, her mother notices her hand, but it's never clear what she's talking about. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot had promises, but the script was thin and full of holes the size of a Ford truck. We never understand what drives the characters, what really stands behind the conflicts they have with each other or how they are resolved. Sixteen years of distance seem to be eradicated by magic in 4 days. The deep conversations were clouded by stupid stereotypes. (In fact, the whole city was a big stereotype of southern life.) Half of the audience groaned when Toby said, "Ya gurled my blood through the veins" ... and we were not treated to this threadline, but TWICE! The revelations were yawning and the dramatic confessions were reduced to "I was stupid and stubborn". <br /> <br /> 3. Acting was okay, considering that a script was a wreck they needed to work with. Toby was dark and muttering most of the movie, but when he smiled and brightened, he was charming. It's a shame that he did not have more time in this way. Kelly Preston's spectacle chops are pretty rusty and that's what it shows. Lindsay Haun is talented and it's certainly not her fault that the writers initially made her character so unlikely that you did not blame her father for not looking for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper could do more with this film, but still looked more or less lost. (And in fact their characters are lost in this movie!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you're a Toby fan, you'll love the songs. But often the movie felt like a scene, just to present one of his songs - or the artists on his record label. For example, the official love song of the movie is "Crash Here Tonight". You'd think that would play around a tender love scene, but no ... we'll hear about 45 seconds of it while attending a memorial service. It was like saying, "Well, we have to use this song somewhere". The song "Broken" is haunting and the best that can come from this movie. <br /> <br /> In summary ... A promising storyline never develops completely and the movie is awfully inconsistent as it forcibly tries to get a vehicle for Toby Keith music and product placement for Ford Trucks. It's about people who have rebuilt broken bridges to try to deal with the power of music, but the story is so poorly narrated that both points are lost in this overgrown music video. I like Toby and really wanted to like Broken Bridges, but the people he filmed this movie abandoned and earned one of his famous boots that you know where he is.
