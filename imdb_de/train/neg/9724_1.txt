Bad Tobe Hopper. He led a horror classic "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre". Since then, everything he has done is terrible. That's probably the worst ... and that says a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to set things (and people) on fire ... or something like that. Hardly an original idea (someone still remembers "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally EVERYTHING is done wrong! Pathetic spectacle (even Dourif!), Asinine script, low production values, crappy special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! A must ... not even good for laughing.
