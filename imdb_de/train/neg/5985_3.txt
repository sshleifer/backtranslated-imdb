This movie is just a kid against the evil genre. Thunderbirds is just the catch to get people to see it, but it's almost randomly in use. The fact that the action takes place on Tracy Island is just a trick to attract the public. It was interesting to see how the filmmakers will see the future London and how the world fits together. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is some of the lines provided by Lady Penelope, which are very funny. This was a slight relief for those who expected a repeat of the TV series. <br /> <br /> After being told that she spends about 90 minutes "having fun" and therefore maybe worth seeing.
