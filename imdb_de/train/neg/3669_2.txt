I really can not say anything good about this movie ... not a single thing. The script is a nightmare ... the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological features and does not seem to understand the difference. They would think that they would at least get a technical advisor. The performances were bad for most of the performers ... although I do not really blame them ... the material really stinks. The editing was just as bad. I just stop. It's all bad 2/10
