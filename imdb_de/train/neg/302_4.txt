I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely love Kenny Hotz, and Spenny Rice has a charming side. Not that I like Spenny at all. Spenny ruins this movie. He should let Kenny and his hot girlfriend shoot the movie. <br /> <br /> Still, it's pretty boring except for a scene with Roger Ebert. There really are not too many celebrities in this movie, and most do not seem to say more than one line. Overall, this movie was disappointing. I'd just suggest seeing it with Kenny vs Spenny's DVD (Season 1) (it's free on the 3rd CD). Regardless of this production, I'm still looking forward to The Papel Chase.
