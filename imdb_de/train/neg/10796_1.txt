This film proves that "commercial" cinema or Hollywood movies are in a serious crisis. There is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced, except that someone expected a success based on Shaquille's name. It's not worth referring to the plot: it's a bit more confused than a knot. What else? The screen is a bit dull, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is even worse. <br /> <br /> rating: 1/10.
