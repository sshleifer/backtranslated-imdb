Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both excellent actors who are sure to face any theatrical challenge. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' offers both actors and audiences only one thing: not falling asleep during a breathtakingly boring, highly predictable and unimaginative story. <br /> <br /> 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' tries very hard to be funny, but the comedy is forced to be extremely poorly directed and embarrassing to the brink of a complete ridicule. <br /> <br /> After a third of the movie, nothing is hinted at, which even the most willing audience, such as the director's friends and relatives, could tie up, let alone do. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure anyone who liked it faked it or had to fake it, like Neil's ex-girlfriend did when he showed her an old B & W movie she cares less. 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' is nowhere near category B, it's somewhere between Q & R, as-questions? and -press the questions again! The director knows what he is doing! Well, if his goal was to bore the viewer to death, he did a great job! <br /> <br /> 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, bur Please do not let it be a waste of time! <br /> <br /> rating: 0 out of 100.
