I just enjoyed watching it and having fun with the movie being totally bad. I saw this movie through the helpful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I have the DVD. If you scroll to the other side of the DVD, the actual movie will be displayed, so I gave it a chance. Seriously, folks, that's grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> The drama, the special effects and the plot are generally very kitschy and unrealistic. "Does not need her lungs," Crow said, noting how the head can still speak, even though he has no body, and Tom Servo only realizes he says no. The end is just classic and nobody can handle this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved the "cat fight" between the two strippers. The "meow" after the fight or the scene, however, was classic. In a way, this was a funny movie. I think for horror fans, you will probably enjoy it. Take a look at the MSTK3 version and you will have a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 The brain that would die: 1/10
