Oh dear, oh dear. I started watching that I did not know what to expect. I could not believe what I saw. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I loved that the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader is to blow up an unarmed man and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack. If only it were really that easy. I finally found a movie that is worse than "Plan 9 From Outer Space".
