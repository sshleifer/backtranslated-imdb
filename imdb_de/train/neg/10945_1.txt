Words can not just describe how awful this movie is. I saw it on video yesterday and just could not believe what I saw. Basically, "Snakeeater" is a former military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for his abducted sister, who was held captive by Rednecks in the style of salvation. The drama, writing, directing, photography, and editing of the film are regrettable, along with a song called "Soldier," which must be one of the worst theme songs of all time. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) from "Welcome Back Carter" plays a ridiculous villain in the movie. Otherwise avoid this chaos at ALL COST.
