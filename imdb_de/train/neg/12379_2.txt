Due to the positive reviews above, we saw a free show last night. Well, I know that filmmakers produce positive reviews because there is no way an objective person could have written. "Definitely to become a" cult classic "?" The theater seemed to be full of friends and families of the production crew, as few of them came out the first hour. <br /> <br /> The songs were the most literal that I've ever heard in a musical ?? "Do not take the short cut, honey, there's a wolf in the woods ...". Debi Mazar's eyes blinked angrily as she struggled to sing. Fortunately, most of the tunes only lasted a few lines. <br /> <br /> Well, who plays the wolf in this story should be charming and seductive. Instead, we get Joey Fatone, ex N'Syncer, who deserves his last name because he has not aged well. He's not supple with his extra fifty pounds and high school high school makeup and disgruntled vocals. Seriously, was this guy in a vocal group? The rest of the actors are half-adequate, but can not change much in the unimaginative writing. Do you know it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time? see "Pixar". <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the virtual sets looked good and were well integrated with the actors. And it was not as offensive as "Crash".
