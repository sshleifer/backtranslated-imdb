This movie is awful. Carlito's Way (1993) is a great movie. It's not Goodgfellas, but it's one of the better thrillers that was made. This movie should be closer to THE STING Part2 or possibly to the speed zone. Remember these gems! The only reason this movie was made was to use the cult sequence of the original. In this film was missing everything De Palma, Pacino and Penn have worked so hard. There was no sympathetic character and that is the fault of all who are responsible. I hope RISE TO POWER wins every RAZZIE it possibly can, and may even invent some new categories to become a record holder. After watching this S @ * T FEST movie, I sat down and watched as Carlitos originally got the bad taste out of my mouth. After looking at it, I wished that Pachanga had come and beaten me out of my misery.
