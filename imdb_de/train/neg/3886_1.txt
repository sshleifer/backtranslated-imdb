Is that a stupid movie? You bet !! I could not find a moment in this movie that was scary or scary. Stupid moments? Much stupid characters? You bet Bad effects? All over! Rick Baker may have done bigger and better things, this is not one of them. Well, people have to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is cheese. He's the weirdest doctor I've ever seen. Somewhere in Ventura County, a melting man is running amok, he is not very happy that his wife is pregnant (probably because she is 55 years old and weighs 90 pounds) and there are no crackers. He also has the not-so-helpful general who wants to find the astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff wants to know what's going on, though Mr. Nelson can not tell him anything. There are also some random characters thrown in, who meet the melting man. Finally, the movie ends and the monster is scooped up to become compost. In the end, that's exactly what you need for a great MST episode.
