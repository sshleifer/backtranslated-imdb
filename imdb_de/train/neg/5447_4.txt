Only the most passionate DORIS DAY fan could even find this bearable. Thinking of the wealth of material available for a story about New York City's most famous blackout, a film that could deal with a lot of real-life stories that people had to deal with, it's scratching for lack of narrative originality. <br /> <br /> Once again, Doris is outraged because she suspects she may have been compromised on the night of the blackout, when she returned to her Connecticut quarters, took a sleeping draft and woke up in the morning with a man who had done the same thing and erroneously wandered into the house. No one can save this mess - not Doris, not Robert Morse, Terry-Thomas, Patrick O'Neil, or Lola ALBRIGHT As directed by Hy Averback, Day's faintest vehicle is the film because of her husband's machinations turn and could not come out. Too bad.
