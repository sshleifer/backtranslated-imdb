This movie (along with Rinne) are little gems among the retouched tribute images that have gone on the 8FTDF "horror festival" for horror movies so far. And yes, that's a low praise. There is nothing much worse in the film than there are writers who see the atmosphere as a substitute for a coherent conspiracy. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that was shot almost exclusively in the minds of the directors. Sure, it would have been nice if he had translated it into the movie, but instead it happened. It's a very pretty movie with a few real scares, but the last role is solely for the latte that cineaste viewers sips.
