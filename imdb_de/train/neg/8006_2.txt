What makes this movie good is the combination of action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that loads the audience with more emotion than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately, the movie's frustrating storytelling, frustrating hand holes, and conflicting scenes were mostly frustrating and hardly "the biggest monster movie of all time." <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good stuff: comedy, drama and special effects. This movie starts from the beginning fast and cheeky. The opening scene - the monster's origin - is campy and fast, honoring the classic environmental catastrophes that have spawned so many other monsters. The pace is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often meaningless dramatic opening scene of other monster flicks and lets the movie plunge right into the action. Within 10 minutes you get the 'why', 'where' and 'how' of the animal and are ready for action. In this film, the film delivers. <br /> <br /> After another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced: the lazy son and his precocious little girl, the kind grandfather and the talented sister (aunt) and of course the monsters. The characters are presented in context, and their conflicts become immediately apparent, giving the audience the feeling that the monster suddenly appears and causes devastation in the river area where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster itself looks great: alien and yet familiar - kind of like a dog and a fish shitting on a squid. The creature's effect is second to none, and although it looks strange, it is believable and at no point in the movie could you see its strings. Even the monster's movement was horribly known as a growing and agitated Rottweiler on linoleum poking the monster through the crowd slips on surfaces that crunch and eats on its way. When the monster's path crosses with the family and a tragedy follows, it is a painful moment, and you may feel the need for revenge, but from then on the call of the movie begins to unfold. After the onset of dynamite The film quickly loses focus and continuity. Plot lines are introduced, then abandoned, characters change their position for no apparent reason, and comedy becomes confused in dramatic scenes that confuse the intent, while obstacles appear seemingly random and vanish. <br /> <br /> As for the comedy, let me say this: I'm ready to accept that much humor is probably cultural. I am not familiar with Korean humor, so things may have been lost during translation. As an Asian college student and as someone who has been living in Japan for 5 years (still here), I would like to think that I understood the Asian humor better than the average white guy. That being said, there were many parts of the movie that I knew were supposed to be funny, but not to me. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: After the first attack, in which the young daughter is lost, is the family near the funeral; All mourn. A new character is introduced - a brother - and the tension is heightened as it becomes apparent that the two brothers are in conflict. Both begin to mourn their loss and compete with each other who mourns more. In essence, this contest is funny: two brothers who do not like each other so much, they even attend a funeral - they show the prickly nature of family love that is common in Asian comedy. This subtle slapstick comedy, which makes fun of family and ritual mourning, should be funny, but seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then come the storylines. There are so many issues that are addressed in this film that are never explained or, worse, explained and annoyed, only to be proven powerless and pointless in the end. Finding an obstacle is not an obstacle, it can be a good thing for a character, but you would expect a commentary on that nature. Instead, the audience is blocked by moments of anti-climax when problems are simply gone and no one points out that it was ever a problem to start. So I ask you: why start at all? <br /> <br /> This has been omnipresent throughout the film as problems have created new problems and suddenly the world of film is filled with opposing forces that never break free. The introduction of new and larger problems is, of course, a proven story, but if the introduction of a new bow leads to the forced foreshortening of another one would at least expect the new sheet to receive a full explanation. Not in this movie. Instead, it was like receiving multiple stories, each of which explained only 20% of the way, and in the end, the parts never converge to complete the whole thing. Much of it could be "cultural." Maybe it's the Korean narrative tradition of putting comedy into a tragedy. It may be normal for stories to go through like a child, coloring on each side out of line, but never ending one. Perhaps it is okay to present a problem to develop the plot to then randomly remove the problem without obvious solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves.
