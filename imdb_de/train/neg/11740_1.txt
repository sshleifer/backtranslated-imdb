Positive terrible George Sanders vehicle, where he is the thief to police officer. Although Sanders was an outstanding character actor, he certainly was not a leading actor, and this movie proves it. <br /> <br It's absolutely about stupidity. Gene Lockhart provided a strange relief, until a moment of anger led him to fire his weapon with a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, George Sanders and co-star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After shooting such a regrettable film, he is not shocking. <br /> <br /> The usual appealing Signe Hasso is really nothing here.
