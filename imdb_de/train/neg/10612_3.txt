Wow, what a great premise for a movie: Hire a filmmaker with a writing pad who chooses tango lessons. Hey, and what an even better idea is the role of a filmmaker interested in tango. Gosh, I wish I had the genius. Yes, I am sarcastic. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that this kind of zero potential is made for producing money films. Come, unless you are a rabid tango fan (I admit they exist after the comments) or a hardened member of the Sally Potter fan club (?). There is nothing in this movie that would make you storm the cinema to see it. Even if you are interested in tango, much of the movie is about to be recorded with meaningless scenes like a renovated house or a wheelchair user traveling on a street. THE REVIEW LESSON A failed screenwriter from Scotland is sitting in front of a computer, writing very sarcastic but entertaining reviews of movies he's seen. Startled, as Theo Robertson puts the shoe in the latest Hollywood blockbusters, he pines in pity when he gets another rejection letter from a movie company, with pleasure as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well-toned body. THE REVIEW LESSON will soon be in a movie theater near you if someone is stupid enough to finance the movie. <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter has nothing to do with Harry Potter
