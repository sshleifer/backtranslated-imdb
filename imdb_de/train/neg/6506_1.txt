If you're not a geeky film student and need to see everything, this movie is not only a waste of time and money and a big disappointment, but also gets angry beyond belief. <br /> <br /> It could be a story to tell, but Hopkins chose to hide it and encode it among so many incessant chaotic layers of seemingly random audio-video microcuts, which caused patience of the observer becomes scarce after a short time. <br /> <br /> Why would someone like Hopkins choose such a difficult, difficult and highly unstable project as anyone can guess his first screenplay, first film music and third film? Maybe he was playing around in his head until it became unrecognizable than what it was, not even for himself. The result proves that he does not have enough experience or ability to achieve the desired result. <br /> <br /> Even the craziest Carpenter and Lynch films, to name but two unusual filmmakers, had 90% more coherence, 95% fewer characters and 99% more story flow. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony, you were looking for the stars, but unfortunately missed a few light-years. Please stay tuned, in this section you are an unequaled giant and nobody should ask for more of you, not even yourself!
