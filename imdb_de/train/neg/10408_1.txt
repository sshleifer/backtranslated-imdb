If Fassbinder made a worse movie, I certainly would not want to see him! Anyone who complains that his films are too talkative and claustrophobic should look at this to appreciate the rather frugal style he has chosen for his excellent films like "The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant" , This film is littered with so many artistic, quasi-symbolic images that it looks like a parody of an "art film". The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene in which Elvira's prostitute friend surfs for seemingly ten minutes are just two of the most impressive examples of what makes this movie a real test of the viewer's stamina. What really annoys me is the few scenes that show only Elvira and her ex-wife and / or daughter. These are the only moments in which real human emotions are shown, proving that at the core of this horrible movie was an excellent movie that tried to free itself. What a waste.
