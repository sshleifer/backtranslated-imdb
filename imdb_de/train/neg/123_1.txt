Oh, brother ... after listening to this ridiculous movie for countless years, all I can think about is the old Peggy Lee song. <br /> <br /> "Is that all?" ... I was only a teenager when this smoked fish hit the United States. I was too young to go to the theater (though I managed to sneak into "Goodbye Columbus"). Then a movie show in a local movie museum lured me - I finally saw this movie except that I was the same age as my parents when they dragged themselves to see him !! <br /> <br /> The ONLY Reason Why This Movie Was Not The anonymous sand of the time was condemned for the obscenity error caused by its US release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker and thought they were watching a sex movie ... Instead, they got a lot of close-ups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, street interviews in dull shopping malls, political claims ... and weak caring simulated sex scenes with flabby, pale actors. <br /> <br /> Cultural icon, holy grail, historical artifact .. Whatever this thing was, tear it, burn it and then put the ashes in a lead box! <br /> <br /> Elite aesthetes are still scratching for value in their boring pseudo-revolutionary political spits. But if the censorship scandal had not been, it would have been ignored and then forgotten. <br /> <br /> Instead, the rhythmic title "I Am Blank, Blank" has been repeated endlessly as a title for pornographic films for years (I'm curious, Lavender - for gay movies, I'm curious, black - for blaxploitation movies, etc.). ). and about every ten years, the thing rises from the dead to be seen by a new generation of idiots who want to see this "naughty sex movie," the "evolution of the film industry" ... <br /> <br /> Yeesh, avoid it like the plague or if you MUST see it - lend the video and quickly rewind to the "dirty" parts just to get it over with. <br /> <br />
