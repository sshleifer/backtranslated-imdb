So far, Nightmares and Dreamscapes have been unpredictable and disappointing. While the first section, led by Brian Henson, may hardly provide groundbreaking storytelling or real fear, at least he was well-directed, exciting, and visually interesting, with solid plays by William Hurt and impressive special effects for a miniseries. <br /> <br /> However, the second story in the series was horrible and not in the right way. The script is bad, it requires that the superficial, unlikely protagonists act illogically to postpone the plot, and that the characters romp incessantly to achieve a chunky, unnecessary portrayal. Acting is exaggerated and unconvincing, and in the first story I felt much more empathy for a cold-blooded murderer than for the newlywed couple in the second. The director has tried to make the story scary with a million tricks, but with the amateurish acting and writing, the end result looks like a film year for a new year, with camera shots for himself and little in action or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the show goes on, I will be very disappointed. I'm looking forward to William H. Macy's installment and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far, the quality is far too inconsistent to predict both directions.
