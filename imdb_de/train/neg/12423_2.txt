Cage (1989) was another of those "cheap" low-budget action-flicks that were produced in the 80's, mostly thanks to movies like 48 hours. and deadly weapon. Here Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno are referred to as former Vietnam veterans who run a local Tauchbar. Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft. Although he is huge, Lou has the mind of a child. One day, some Ruffians wait around in the bar and Lou and Rebb beat the tar out of them. But Payback is a mother. They dump the bar and leave nothing to Lou and Reb. Until these two thugs come into the picture (one of them is a really nice guy) who have a plan. <br /> <br /> The movie is a waste of time. If they had done anything and made a hard core movie instead of trying to tone down the cruelty of the situation, it might have worked. Unfortunately, it does not and the audience remains in the bag. Well. It's a shame because you have all the elements for a great B-movie. Better luck next time, I think. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. <br /> <br /> xxx
