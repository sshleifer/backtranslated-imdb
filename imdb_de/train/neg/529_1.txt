This is undoubtedly the most offensive "chick strip" I've seen in years, if not at all. The writing and the characterizations are so full of clich√©s that the film borders on parody. Before we left the theater one hour and five minutes after the disaster, we were exposed to the following topics: If you have a child, all your problems are solved. You throw your dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a waste of a talented cast and some great-looking sets and costumes. When Natasha Richardson Toni Collette said that if she does not lead a mainstream life, she'll end up shuddering - "Alone!" I can not believe that this film has come to the theatrical release. It's the kind of fare you expect from those "women's" cable channels that I always pass by while surfing the canals. I'm female and over 35 years old, so I should be part of this movie's target audience, but boy, "Evening" misses its target.
