Usually, I read reviews before seeing a movie. You know what? I did not do that before I saw TLB, and I have to say that I was very surprised to see the above-average rating on IMDb. I found it totally lacking in history. You're just dropped into it (and unfortunately not in the way Saving Private Ryan plunged us into the movie), and it comes to a sudden end, which was very unsatisfactory for me. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me, especially given the low budget. But get ready for a laugh ... Some guys are hurled into the air after a blast as if they were Olympic gymnasts. A corkscrew or somersault in the air is a bit too much for me during the First World War, especially if it was done countless times during the movie. But the parts that really made me laugh until I was almost crying were the scenes of close combat. The screaming and screaming German voices ... incredibly funny. It seems they are being talked about by a single actor / speaker because they all sound exactly the same, and it sounds like a typical German voice. <br /> <br /> I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to anyone but people who just want to laugh because of the sad and cheesy quality.
