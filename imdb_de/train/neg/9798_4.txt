15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially the youth. When I was three years old and living in the Philippines, I watched this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 there). When the film came out in 1995, it was a shock and awe for me to see him with my dad and my 2 uncles. My grandparents even sent me a "Balikbayan" box full of Power Rangers stuff (including the easy-to-build Megazord figure and Rangers stuffed toys). I even played video games and loved only one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was REALLY sad. Anyway, it was the show that drew my interest in robot series (especially anime mech series like "Gundam"). Now that I'm 18, I'd like to think that this show is pretty cheesy for me now. To prove it, I bought a 2-set DVD collection of "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and watched both of them. I was like "Ugh, how terrible, just a garbage in the attic for me." For all people of my generation this is NOT a show that you want to see again and again. I'm not saying to leave it for the rest of your life, but occasionally it's not a bad thing now, is it? Instead of "Power Rangers", I would recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam", "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (also known as Ninja Robots) or even the ORIGINAL Sentai shows that form the basis of "Power Rangers" were.
