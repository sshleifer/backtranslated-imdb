Why is a star reaching the top of the star chain ruining all the good work by making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds peaked and began making terrible Hal Needham car chases. Arnold Schwarzenegger became Hollywood's hottest possession, only to be ridiculed by the appalling Last Action Hero. And here, the talkative Eddie Murphy erases the memories of Trading Places and 48 Hours with this "Family" adventure movie, which is an incredibly boring, childish and generally terrible misfire, where Charlotte Lewis can see big, big boobs in a tight blouse most appealing aspect of the entire film. <br /> <br /> The story is just modest. It is the social worker Murphy, who was contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one. Chosen for what, I hear you ask. His job is to rescue a Tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world. As the main demon, chic actor Charles Dance looks awfully embarrassed to be in the movie, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents. Of all Murphy's films, this is by far the worst. I've read some reviews that suggest that it's nice to see Murphy in an atypical role, in a movie without a formula, and though both points are flawless, it's not forgiving that the movie is - atypical and not It's formulaic - it could be - is an absolute load of garbage. <br /> <br />
