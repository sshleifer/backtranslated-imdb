The movie was on TV the other day and I did not like it at all. The first George of the Jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel ... totally terrible. The new actor and actress who played the main roles were not good at all, they should have had the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original actress (I forgot her name), so this movie gets the 0 out of 10 points and not a movie you can sit down to watch and enjoy, this is a movie that you turn to another channel or take it to the store when it's rented or bought. It was nice to see that Ape had the monkey back, but it was not as funny as the first. They should have the new George grown up as Georges son and Bredon and (whatever their face) in the movie would have 'I was a bit better than it was.
