This movie was weird ... I saw it when I took a quarter of Psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was really funny. I'm pretty sure you should see it up, but mushrooms were not enough. I could not stop laughing ... maybe LSD would work. The movie is a series of things that turn into other things and dance. It's really cheesy for today's standards, but when it came out, it was good ... unique. I could see how some people would think this movie was good, but I did not find it very interesting, and I was on mushrooms at the time. If you have a party or something and everyone is pretty enlightened, then make some laughs.
