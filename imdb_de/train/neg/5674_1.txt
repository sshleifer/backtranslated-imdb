My God, what's going on? a Uwe Boll movie and positive comments? Wow! <br /> <br /> It's nice to see that most of the positive reviews from newcomers come from Boll's work. As I have stated in previous Uwe Boll reviews, I myself watch his films only in the hope that one day he will actually do something good. I mean..IT MUST HAVE A DAY! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Seed is not that day. I'm not sure where to start with the lame attempt at a horror movie that is seed. People should remember that all the sick in the world are like that because they have seen various sick acts in the video or on the net ... or at least Mr. Boll believes. I still can not figure out why footage of animal maltreatment and murder was needed in the first 10 minutes of this movie. I understand the concept that Seed (the killer) is a Sicko and enjoys watching such things ... but can not understand why Mr. Boll believed that REAL footage would work in the movie. Maybe to shock us? Hmmm .... well, I'm not squeamish and can see everything on film. However, I do not think that the use of real animal cruelty material is the least entertaining. If you tried to shock me, it did not work. It just reminded me how confused the world was because such things happen and that Uwe Boll continues to make films. This kind of context worked for movies in the 70's / 80's (Cannibal Holocaust) but not for today's market. <br /> <br /> This allows us to move on to the fact that Uwe did it Give the movie an overall favorable feel like BloodRayne 2. One can only say that there was not much money for the production. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr. Boll does not really care about a decent story as we expect boring shots of police officers seeing various videos of Seeds victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of these videos ends in an accelerated decomposition of the victim. It's all very boring and boring. I will not comment on the toddler scene, as it is ridiculous and just another cheap "shock" factor. If you manage to sit the first 25 minutes, you will be treated to the police officers who are going through a very dark house to catch seed. The lighting here is terrible and Uwe has the old fiasco "I'm not using a stable cam" he committed with BloodRayne 2. You can watch the police die in stupid ways until Seed gets caught. This scene is so damn stupid, you have to see it to believe it. The policeman actually tells Seed he could have shot him. For some unknown reason, the policeman does not shoot him. Given that Seed is a scythe that kills both children and adults, at this point in the scripture, you would have thought that the sense of victory would come from the bulls who buried Seed alive (and they know he lives .. why not shoot him in the head ????), followed by Seed, who emerges from the ground and then kills a random woman with a hammer and then kidnaps the policeman's family. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to achieve here is that it's just STUPID! It's not even Hollywood horror stupid ... just stupid. Uwe Boll can not **** directly. Anyone with a taste would agree with this statement. Anyone who looks at this film and found it entertaining in any way must take a serious look as a person. <br /> <br /> Once again, we are treated with a badly traded, straightened, lit, produced, scripted piece of UB manure.
