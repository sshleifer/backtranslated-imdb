The real shame of "The Gathering" is not in the bad acting, nor in the abominably flat plot. The real shame is that it was a lot worse than the series it started, even though it had one main attraction: Takashima. I would like to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova, even for only five minutes. She has that sarcasm, that joke, that double-edged personality that's both fleeting and endearing. Unfortunately, the pilot "Babylon 5" has an incredibly boring history of murder. Fortunately, Patricia Tallman, who never returned to the series seriously, became much better with age than Lyta Alexander, who is little more than a whiny, tiring telepath. I leave you with a final thought - why does Delenn look like some kind of space frogman (even though she's a woman)? Thank you for seeing the Minbari later on the show.
