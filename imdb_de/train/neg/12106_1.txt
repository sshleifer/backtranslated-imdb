A cowardly, cowardly movie. Director Boorman shows how Cahill breaks down rich houses, but the male resident is unfaithful to the nanny, that's fine. The forensic scientist investigating Cahill gets blown up in his car, but he's faced with a rat face and does not look like a nice man, so that's okay too. The Beits, owners of Russborrough House, earned their money by building "Darkies" to dig diamonds. Therefore, it is alright to rob them of invaluable art and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. The Garda kills his ferrets and is involved in his murder. Moral equivalency is annoying, Boorman is looking for a successful movie, but he does not have the guts to oppose the crime of the general gang, which is terrorizing the neighborhood and unleashing another wave of bugs on Dublin. He even worked with the Generals son while he did it. Disgusting. Shame on his cowardice.
