Sugar & Spice is one of the worst movies of the year 2001. The movie tries to cross Heathers and Bring It On and fails. When I saw last January, I was so disgusted by the movie that I talked to my girlfriend on the phone during the last half hour of the movie. I've heard that the DVD has a Director's Cut, maybe I'll take a closer look, but this PG-13 trash movie is s *** and the worst S ***. If the movie had a little T & A, that might have been okay. But the gags are lame and the spectacle is terrible. Worse than a Troma movie.
