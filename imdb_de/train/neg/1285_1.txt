Born, raised and raised in Scotland, I was appalled by this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more or less than a rancher. Worse, the thread of the entire movie was sex in one form or another, implicit or verbal. To see it, one would think that Scotland was populated in the 18th century by a series of sex offenders and homosexuals. Long was a joke as a "young" mother at the age of 49, but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a "bath" in a Scottish hole is NOT common since they portrayed him - but it gave them another opportunity to show how sexually driven we were. Save your money and look at Pinnochio.
