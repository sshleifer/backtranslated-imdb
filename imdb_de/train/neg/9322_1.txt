Please do not be fooled by the cover of this movie. And if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh about, that's not it. Normally, I'll go foolish if it's funny, but that was so stupid that it almost made me (or possibly) stupid. <br /> <br /> The movie quality is better than a handheld, but not nearly It's quite possible that the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on a Casio keyboard. These problems should never be really daunting if you watch a horror movie, but add that amazing cast and you have a real sense of humor. <br /> <br /> The story is about a man who invites his friends to a family lodge in Texas for the weekend. He also invites his wife's invitation to his office. Along the way, they meet a woman in distress, who is then invited by the other girls. <br /> <br /> Staying in the cabin involves sex and nudity, and soon all the panties in a group of girls disappear and weird objects appear in the house. <br /> <br /> From there (you) (the audience) and the idiots, er, actors, try to find out what's going on, and they'll soon start mistrusting each other. All in all, I think it sounds better than it is. The main battle in this film is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot is made, the acting is bad and the motivations are unaware. Once again this could be forgivable, it was the least funny, but unfortunately it is not. <br /> <br /> The Twist End is just a twist where no one would guess it, just if you had really thought through it The movie would not have made sense anyway. Please do not let this criticism stop you from watching the scissors games of this movie. (Woah, my nose just grew eight centimeters.)
