When the movie was released, it was the biggest hit and soon became a blockbuster. But frankly, the movie is a ridiculous clock with an action that glorifies a loser. The film has a tag line - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara", which means love, but Sacrifice is immortal. In the film, the hero of the film (Ganesh) sacrifices his love for the lead actress (Pooja Gandhi), even though the two love each other! Its reasoning is the meaning of the tag line. This film influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this "loser-like-sacrificial" attitude very thought-provoking and therefore became a cult movie in which they could continue their lives. Ganesh's acting is amateur, Crass and Childishly stupid. In a song he actually looks funny (Onde Ondu Sari ...), if he is to look stylish and cool. His appearance also does not help the lead role. His hairdo is bad in most parts of the movie. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. Her costumes are abominable in the movie and very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> The good thing about the film is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music of Mano Murthy, which are actually the true achievements of the film. The lyrics by Jayant Kaikini are also very well written. The director Yograj Bhat has to be celebrated to present the songs tastefully. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all in all except the songs, the movie is a very ordinary movie !!!!!!
