A squashy slapstick mess that pretends to be a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian Bull Rider champion leaving the rodeo to stay at home in the desert of his people in Arizona, where government suits have just invested in the cattle herd of the family (which desperately needs a stud). What director Peter Tewksbury desperately needs are some storytelling skills. What he misses in the assessment, he makes up for in sloppy, comedic montages are some funny scenes). Despite the colorful supporting twists of Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general craze is getting out of hand, and there's too much hacking and screaming to arouse great interest. As far as Elvis is concerned, he's always laid-back and playful - and though it's nice to have fun on the screen, you have to wonder if he's just been dropping movies at that point. This confusion of a picture has a distinct sense of hell, and although spirits are high, yields are usually low. * 1/2 of ****
