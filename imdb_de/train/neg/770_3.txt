The stranger Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives in the studio of antiquities collector Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, dominates Jack and ties him to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes $ 100,000 for everyone to protect him with a wealthy and dangerous collector at a trial of the antiques "Spanish Judge". Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his backward friend who thinks she's from Mars, to put together the backup team. However, Jack thwarts the collector and then he fascinates Jack, Jamie and Piece. <br /> <br /> The low-budget "Spanish Judges" is a movie with a decent script and a terrible result that wastes a good cast. Valeria Golino is amazingly beautiful, but together with good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, they can not save the stupid story. Besides, the scenes that are supposed to be funny do not work and in fact they are stupid and not funny. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Tudo Por Dinheiro" ("Everything for Money")
