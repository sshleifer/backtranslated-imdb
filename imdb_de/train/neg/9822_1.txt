There were times during the movie, I wish I had been beaten to death. The only reason I survived the entire movie was that I could not believe how bad it really was and I thought it would have to get better. That was really a horror movie. I was appalled that I seemingly had wasted 4 hours of my life, that I will never come back. The other two hours I spent for the loss. Please recommend this movie to anyone who wants to torture you and tell him that the tension will kill him.
