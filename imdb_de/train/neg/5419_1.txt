Why do filmmakers always go against the work of the author? I mean, yes, things have to be condensed for the sake of viewers, but look at Anne from Green Gables. You have done a wonderful job of combining important events into a coherent whole that is simply adorable. I can not believe that they have decided to combine three novels for Anne of Avonlea in such a terrible mess. Take a look at everything they missed. , , Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, the Widows, Windy Poplars. , , and Anne's college years, for God's sake !!! Would not it have been nice to meet Priscilla and the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan should have filmed things one by one instead of bringing them all together and combining characters and events as he did. This movie was good if you skip the novels !! But the beautiful work of L.M. Montgomery should not be denied. This film was a flop after seeing how he had successfully brought Anne of Green Gables to life.
