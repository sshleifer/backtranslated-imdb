My Name is Modesty is a low budget movie that tells the story of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is awful, it's just not what I expected or hoped for. Although I have known the Modesty Blaise character for years, but I do not know the comic strips or the comic novels very much, so I come as an outsider in this movie. That could be a reason for my disappointment. I expected more action and more comedy. The movie is dialog-driven. I guess I was looking for a little more camp value. My Name is Modesty is a deadly serious movie. If anything, there are only a few "easy" moments. The acting, at least by Alexandra Staden, is acceptable, but nothing special. As others have commented, it seems a bit too weak to be completely credible in the title role. What action scenes in My Name is Modesty is one of the weakest points of the movie. I never had the idea that this woman could handle a group of trained killers. I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes further and turns the rumored movie into a big budget movie based on the Modesty Blaise character. I am convinced that the concept has a lot of potential and I would be very much looking forward to it.
