It's hard to know where this adjustment goes wrong because I think the problem starts with the books. Alexander McCall Smith has found out that you are not reading them for the detective stories, but for his profoundly condescending and completely false idea of ​​an Africa that does not exist. He did for Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan - not so successful, but just as thorough. <br /> <br /> After I understood that, I was no longer mad that there was an American singer / actress Jill Scott's cast as Mma Ramotswe. If she is to represent a country that is not Africa, how appropriate is she to be a black woman who is not an African? She is not the only American in the cast; Mma Makutsi is played by Anika Noni Rose. Both women are far too young for the roles they play and way too glamorous. Both brutally murder the local accents, and both focus so much on this brutality that they do not offer much in action. Scott's Mma Ramotswe is springy, sweet and soft. Rose's mum Makutsi is an annoying bitch with a motorized mouth. <br /> <br /> The result is almost unsurpassable. The main cast is only achieved by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who presents himself as JLB Matekoni in a decent performance. He's smarter and more intense than the books, but I can not blame Msamati for that - he's a shining light in a sea of ​​sucking power. The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly at the feet of those who wrote the butcher committee. For me, McCall Smith's writing was always entertaining and notoriously bad. He refuses to be processed. As a result, his books contain grammatical experiments that border on the scientific and signs that change the name in the sentence. It is therefore an achievement that the writing team for this project has actually made it worse. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is now largely anglicised. Characters speak of "opening" and "sensitivity to needs". Mma Ramotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni flirt openly. Mma Makutsi moans about not having a computer, but with her hair, make-up and jewelry constantly redesigned, it's surprising that she does not have a MacBook with her Visa card in her purse. <br /> <br /> So what? We're here with It's hard to get worked up about this crappy work, because frankly, most of the stuff I like about the original books is apocryphal anyway. McCall Smith paints a fictitious Botswana populated by cute, non-threatening blacks, full of amusing and tasty wisdom nuggets. It reads well despite linguistic travesty, but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person desires black people. It's just not true. <br /> <br /> In view of this, it is hardly surprising that this show is as shit as it is. It remains to be seen, however, whether the European and American audiences will even notice.
