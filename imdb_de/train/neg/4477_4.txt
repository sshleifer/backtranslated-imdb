What an empty and deficient reproduction of the classical novel. I wish people would stop looking at classics if they clearly have no idea of ​​the true intent or meaning of the original. This version is no different. I had the feeling that the version of Ralph Fiennes is a lot worse, since the casting of Juliette brioche as Kathy was the worst casting decision of all time ... anyway back to that version. The goal is to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and musical style. It succeeds in both, but high art is not nit. A look at a rainy day maybe ... The direction was average and the editing was miserable. Worse than old Quincy. Deepak Verma makes a great turn as Hindley and is indeed one of Britain's wasted talents. The part of Heath was played with great charm and faith and I think casting is the strong point of this project. Although a talented director would have used his facilities better. It is clear that he was hired as a director and did not endow the project with the passion that deserved it.
