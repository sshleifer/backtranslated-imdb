I knew that this movie should be so bad that it was funny, so I agreed with that expectation. I just thought it was so bad that it was murderously boring. The crying theme song is funny for about 10 seconds until you realize that there is nothing clever about it except for its deliberately irritating quality. In about 30 seconds it gets old that things are splashed with tomatoes. There is simply nothing clever or funny about the movie except the premise. It could be maintained a 3-4 minute comedy sketch, but this is just not a feature film, which is determined by the imagination.
