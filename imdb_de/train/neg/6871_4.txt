A great concept went wrong. Bad drama, worse writing ... After watching the first two episodes, I was wondering why it came to season two at all. The characters are forgotten, the writing is bad, the sets are just fine. The special effects are just sad - so much was done in the same timeframe even better - where does the money for this? The first episode starts interestingly and goes downhill fast - the bid of the entire show is just stupid. Do not get me wrong, I'm a big sci-fi fan and "geek" - but this show just does not cut it off. As I said at the beginning, I am really surprised that the second season has come - so much better was already canceled after one season (for example, Jake 2.0). This show was just bad.
