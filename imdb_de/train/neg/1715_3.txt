It does contain facts that are not common, but it's not exactly the truth. They took advantage of many freedoms to rearrange events, exclude people, and use sets that did not reflect the facts of their lives in the 1930s. At various times, there were more than just Bonnie, Clyde, and WD in the gang, and these people had as much to do with the facts as the ones involved. Buck and Blanche were convinced to convince Clyde to come by much sooner than shooting, and were actually involved in the crime again. Some of the events depicted in daylight actually took place at night. Bonnie's wound was much worse and never healed properly. It was so bad that someone had to carry her around until she was healed and even then it got stiff and she was stiff. Clyde also went limp because he cut off a big toe in prison. I know, I'm not very choosy, and it was a TV movie, but even without these factual mistakes in this "TRUE" story, the movie moves from event to event too fast and seems more like several snapshots of its life rather than a coherent flowing one To be history. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
