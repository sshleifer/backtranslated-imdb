How wonderful. Again, a film about America from someone who has probably visited here half a dozen times a day apiece and considers himself an "expert" of the country. Sheesh I should travel to Germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about Germany as the "Land of the Nazis" or something. Wim Il boy, you should meet Lars von Trier and shoot the ULTIMATE movie about the Americans. Of course we all know that it takes a presumptuous leftist "we are the world" Europeans to shoot a "real" movie about America. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. For a continent that unleashed not one, but TWO world wars, Europe certainly has a lot of opinions about America's wrong "foreign policy." <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not worry, Wim II boy, there are many UC Berkeley Americans who will love your movie. Of course, these are the same people that George W. Bush considers to be worst than Hitler, and that painting a soup can is "pure genius" !!
