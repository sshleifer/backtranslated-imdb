It's not uncommon to see US reproductions of foreign films falling flat on her face, but here's the downside !!! This is a terrible remake of the US movie "Wide Awake" by the British! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is weird but entertaining and fun! "Liam", on the other hand, is just weird. I have to recognize "Liam" for one thing and that makes it clear that I made the right decision when I changed my religion!
