I recently rented this movie because neither my girlfriend nor I had ever seen it, even though we had heard from a mutual friend how "great" it is. Well, I'm pretty conservative in mind, but I knew it would be pretty liberal to lead. I thought, before the movie started, Michael Douglas played a sympathetic popular liberal who was loved by the masses, and there would be a recalcitrant conservative opponent as his opponent. But I thought there the political statement would begin and end. <br /> <br /> OK, the conspiracy was firm: a single president falls onto a lobbyist. OK, that has potential, which I thought was pretty entertaining, as the storyline is unique. Then the movie became a liberal infomercial. The film was more about gun control and environmental issues than the relationship between the President and Sydney (Annette Bening). In this film, there were several ridiculous requirements: 1) The character Sydney, who played this six-figure lobbyist who is "closer". Could she have been more volatile? She was constantly disorganized and seemed to impress everything. Hardly a "closer". I'm a shop assistant and she could not "close" by selling a glass of water to a thirsty man. <br /> <br /> 2) Second, is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing a right-wing fanatic? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and she plays a right-wing ideologue. Give me a break. I liked how he took his conservative character and made him as scary as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) The speech in the end was just ridiculous. The line about "I'm a proud cardholder member of the ACLU" was a joke. First, no president would ever admit that as an active member of an ultra-marginalized group. Second, why pick something up? They have alienated only half of the filmed public, which is moderate or conservative. <br /> <br /> I found the plot to be great and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the film went from a "movie" to a left-wing political statement, which is why the film failed. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see that Hollywood has destroyed a great conspiracy that forces its viewers to force its political views
