Another movie with an interesting premise and some miraculous special effects that fall directly into the bin. <br /> <br /> Boring direction and performances (with the exception of the pretty Annabel Schofield, who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material and the always serious Charlton Heston) deserve the rating of a real stinker. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how Heston experiences his usual performance and how bad this movie is. He even plays in a subplot that interested me, just to see how it fits into the main line of the movie. The way they had solved the problem was that they did not. It just falls off the end. <br /> <br /> Really. Do not waste your time with it.
