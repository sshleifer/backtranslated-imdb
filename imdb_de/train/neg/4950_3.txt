I think that can summarize this show as well as everything. Batman TAS may be the worst thing comic-based cartoons ever did, because everything that comes afterwards is compared to it and nothing has been measured yet. It's just too damn good. Was Batman Beyond Good? "Yes, but it was not a TAS." Is the Justice League good? "It's not that bad, but it's not a TAS." <br /> <br /> The Batman is certainly not a TAS, but I will not refuse. It would be unfair and also has a lot of other problems. <br /> <br /> The concept of a younger, less experienced Batman fighting crime is good, and sometimes the art is very nice. But the rest of the time, art is worthless, and this betrays many shortcomings of the show. It's clocked, written and designed like an American. If I wanted to see Jackie Chan Adventures I would see Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could always beat my head against a wall and achieve the same effect. The Joker is a murderous, mentally unstable clown in a suit, using his wits, his unpredictability, and his smart games to fight Batman. If he is forced to fight hand in hand, he either resorts to something cheap or outbid completely. It is not intended as a monkey with dreadlocks who knows kung fu and can jump into the air, accompanied by speed lines. If they wanted to do with a bad guy, there were other less important characters they could have used, or * gasp *, they could create an entirely new character. And it's not that thinking is a bad thing, do not get me wrong. TAS (I go back there) took Mr. Freeze from your standard villain with igloo influence, making him a memorable and morally complex character. Of course, Freeze was not a classic villain at the time and they upgraded, but the point is. What The Batman does is take everything you liked about Batman comics and lecterns, and take a big, smelly garbage dump. Guess what? They ate corn. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that this show can not stand up to TAS, but can stand on its own and not work for me. The actions are not good and they do not develop better. They were written for the demographics of children under the age of twelve. Should children enjoy a show? Of course they should. This should not be an adult show of cursing, nakedness and nonviolent violence. But the hallmark of a really good show is that it can be enjoyed by all ages at different levels. This show misses this mark. <br /> <br /> Is this show a TAS? No of course not. The problem is that it is not even a JLU.
