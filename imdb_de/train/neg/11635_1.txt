Okay, that's a quick and sweet review ... Something that the movie should have been practicing, and made its life shorter and sweeter than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. There is a good reason that there was a petition with over 40,000 signatures. EVERYTHING asks Uwe Boll to make films out of franchise films. Blood Rayne is a big guy. <br /> <br /> The jokes are good ... if you've never heard them a thousand times before. Acting is descent, but you can only blame the script for it. I even wonder if they even use a script. <br /> <br /> The film has NOTHING to do with the original games. HI When you've played the games, you know that the main character has no real motivation outside of the murderous drives like mass murder because he has repelled his toe or something like that. For such a stupid movie, there is far too much history. Like I said. I would not steal this movie. And for the person who says this is the "funniest film of 2007" .......... you have to look around, the news is better than this.
