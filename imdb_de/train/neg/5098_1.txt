This is one of the most overrated anime shows ever made. And yes, I was even shown the "end of the Evangelion" and that still hated me. Not to mention the countless prints of this show! <br /> <br /> I have nothing against psychological and philosophical undertones, but Evangelion like nothing else in the mud! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones who seemed to be interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Apart from that, most of them were a lot of whiny losers. You need to go to a psychiatric center and not drive huge robots against "aliens" called angels. <br /> <br /> Even the battles between mecha and aliens did not help. It goes something like this: <br/> <br /> "Well, there are these robots, and they are really cool because they bleed (!), When they get hurt, but they are not really mecha, but trapped angels They go insane and do not do what the underage pilots want, and they need to be better controlled ... blah blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm so sorry, but I can not recommend Evangelion to anyone , Anime Otakus or not. For those who love this series, well, you have the right to that opinion, I respect you. But to those who have the obsession of believing everyone would like this series, you're more of an egotist. <br /> <br /> I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run" -Dim "and" Robot Taekwon V "myself.
