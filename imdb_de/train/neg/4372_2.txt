I love Don Knotts, let me say that in advance! He is a tremendous talent and the best of what he does, which is a nervous, lovingly confused loser thrown into an authority position. He's fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming, the reluctant astronaut, but the movie is pretty boring, though my brother and I as a kid were very pleased to watch these and his other films. It's still worth it, but it's really a movie that kids like best. I would classify it as 100% family friendly and something that you could look at with your children on a family home evening. <br /> <br /> As with all Knotts films, there's a great cast of popular characters actors and you can not help but smile as Knotts draws one of his shaky, gaping eyes, no matter how old and jaded They are great at this film, as he captured NASA in the 1960s - all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was surprised how gracious Leslie Neilsen was then. The only complaint about the story is Roy's love interest, a rather worn-out, unlikely woman who can not give him time until he gets a big shot - if you're like me, you hope he gives her the shudder at the end. Take care - you will not whistle the topic until days, it's so catchy.
