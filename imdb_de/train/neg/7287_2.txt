In his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbade it. Many decades later, the old man raised three children (two boys and one girl) and allowed his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon the sister is bored with brother # 1 and jumps into the bed of brother # 2. <br /> <br /> You would think the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no - they are upper-class Europeans who study in college and are busy in the social world. <br /> <br /> We never see a flirting moment between a woman unrelated to the two brothers. We never see a flirting moment between an unrelated man and one sister. All coquettish moments are shared only between the brothers and the sister. <br /> <br /> The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young Emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marital girls everywhere, but no - he just wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, SUNSHINE will (slowly) inspire you to the end.
