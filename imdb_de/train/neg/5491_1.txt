We should have been suspicious when we found out we were the only ones with only two minutes of light output. There were only five others before the movie started. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that can redeem this movie. Acting is terrible (especially Mrs. Hurley). The script is banal. We have seen the effects millions of times. The movie direction is the worst we've seen. Meandering and incoherent. Nobody laughed, including the children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It would have been earlier if my wife had not been looking for a hot dog! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie. If you can not see anything else in your cinema, buy some drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and watch the people. You will have much more fun! <br /> <br />
