Predictable, hacked and badly written. Foolishly, I thought such a prominent cast would not be involved if it had no merit. I think the competition among the actors is so intense these days (and only gets worse) that you can not choose much anymore. Early on, we had a clue who was instrumental in the assassination, and since then we've been shutting our throats. The film lacked intrigue, which gave us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder. Part of the discourse was frankly embarrassing! It's hard to believe that anyone would even consider spending tens of millions of dollars to do that threesome.
