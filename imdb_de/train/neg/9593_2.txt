Judging by some comments in IMDB, I expected an action movie - maybe a dramatic or a stupid or a simple or a funny, but essentially an action movie. Whatever it is that I saw, definitely did not feel like a movie. The story is simple and uncomplicated (though the prologue tries to make it complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of assassins. <br /> <br /> Now pull off the first one (they never appear in the movie). Then just let one of the assassins, the princess, become a rogue on a revenge journey. Add a rebellious love interest with a guilty conscience. And you have the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they still have not made it into a story or a movie. Between some random action sequences and some unusual images trying to use sci-fi on a low budget, there is a sense of emptiness left over. The movie just does not feel like a movie, but a weird, incoherent, boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
