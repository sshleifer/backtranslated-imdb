I'm the type of person who always goes into the horror area when I choose a movie, so I said five over the eyes, I was disgusted about this movie and thought there was no action and no reason for that you could enjoy it. My skin crawled to the idea that people like to watch movies that just encourage violence, the hell, it was a low budget and very garbage! I think I could do better. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and you should not bother to see how the actors were garbage. The camera was awful, the picture was bad and the sound was not good, I think it was a bit of a bit of a joke from the baler which project and it did not work at all it was bad.
