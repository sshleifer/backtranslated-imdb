Blue Monkey (1987), or "BodySuckers Invasion," as it is known here in the UK, was a rather boring horror movie about an old man being bitten by a mysterious poisonous plant in a greenhouse !!!! The man is taken to the hospital, where this worm-like creature comes out of his mouth, which of course turns into this insect monster and rages from now on !! Although Steve Railsback and John Vernon were in the movie, I found it boring, with a predictable storyline, uninteresting characters, cheap special effects and lack of action !!!! Horror fans do not really need to track down this rare movie. I give this movie 2/10.
