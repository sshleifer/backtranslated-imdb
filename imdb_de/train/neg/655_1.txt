I went with my hopes in the matter and after twenty minutes in the film, I could not have been disappointed. Although I thought this would be another horribly bad remake, I hoped that maybe ... just maybe somebody would do it right this time. Unfortunately, Prom Night is about the same quality level as the last remake of April Fools Day, bad script, bad directing, cheesy over-the-top drama and generally horrific horror worthy of about a dozen eye rolls. We've seen it all before and done a million times better. If you watch the prom night in the theater (I would say, wait for the DVD or the PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh because it will make you laugh. The laughter is not in parts of the movie that are supposed to be funny, but in response to important "exciting" moments in the film that are made as bad as if you felt like you were watching the latest issue of Scary Movie. Seriously, should that be a remake or a spoof? The filmmakers missed the mark so much that a large part of the theater I visited went through the movie about halfway through. What I wish in retrospect, I would have done it. Not me, but I had to torment myself and stick to it, hoping it would get better. Needless to say that it did not. The "horror" scenes are a joke, not even because of acting, but because of the direction, the script, the "special effects" and the camera work. The film looks as if it had spent a fortune on the production, but still came out with a micro budget movie. Halfway, I expected to see dollar shop tags on some props and always thought I'd see a porn star in the cast somewhere. <br /> <br /> This movie is scary okay, if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is bound to fail.
