The plot is rocky. The acting is somewhere south of a Jr. high school game. The camera is not bad, but it looks like it has been cut with a machete. I could not decide on a deliberately hokey strip, or if the people behind it really believed they were making a good movie. Think about Death Valley Days and Mayberry RFD. In a "lawless" modern city, people walk around carrying 6 express train machines. It has more than its fair share of Cutsey stuff. Imagine the good men driving up to an old farmhouse and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a trailer hitch. Imagine the employees in a hotel looking at an obviously western (hemisphere) movie with a Japanese soundtrack but with English subtitles. It's all very strange, but could be improved if you watch it while taking part in a little peyote. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to any Western clich√© you can imagine. There is even a modern version of the good-natured ballroom girl AND a twisted Jew's Harp in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell them that your DVD player has died.
