I really like Brad Pitt. He is an actor with wit and wit, not to mention face, chest and everything else. Since I saw him in "Thelma and Louise", one thought bothered me, to whom does he remind me? "Troy" did it for me. He is the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious. Male, American, etc., but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind anyway. He is so beautiful that he is most effective when he plays against it. "Kalifornia" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Snatch" His self-deprecating humor makes him human, almost accessible. Fortunately, "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Only stills with Pitt, half naked in gorgeous sprint positions, decorate the walls of the legions of saliva friends. Strange, "The Boat" is one of the great films of the second half of the 20th century. What is Wolfgang Petersen doing here? Well, I think it would be very hard to refuse cooperation with the new Brigitte Bardot.
