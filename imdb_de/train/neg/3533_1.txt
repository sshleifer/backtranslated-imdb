Let this film serve as the death knell for the "Big Twist" movies of the 1990s. Known in some circles as The Kyser Soze Syndrome, this cinematic manuscript was now made to death by Mr. Night Shayamalan, and even Ron Howard used a variant of A BEAUTIFUL MIND. In REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna") uses the Soze motif much more suppressed. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with a highly questionable hair) plays the lead role as Jack Green (known as "Mr. Green"). He can be criminal to Mr. Gold, too. Or, maybe Mr. Gold is a cranky ghost who can own members of the underworld. I'm not sure, but I do not care. REVOLVER is one of the most reworked examples of cinematic excesses that I have long been unable to endure. Experience the broken time structure, the painful jump cuts, the incessant inner monologues and the painfully overbearing animated sequence. This directorial style "Everything and the kitchen sink" makes Quentin Tarantino's oeuvre seem calm. The cinematic smoke and the mirrors only make me believe that Ritchie was so bored in telling this banal story when I looked at her. <br /> <br /> The film is full of moments of revelation that are supposed to be shocking, but they're just coming in front of messages to Mr. Green. I wanted to like Green, because I always like Stratham as a figure that is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here he fights like a tutor in a university literature for English literature. His lack of wit is offset only by the lack of restraint displayed by his nemesis macha (Ray Liotta). Liotta spits, cries, and steams through the backdrop like a starving man on a Smorgasbord, in an embarrassing display of overreacting and leopard pacing. <br /> <br /> REVOLVER has no redeeming qualities. It's another of Ritchie's cinematic faux pas and could even surpass his miserable remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst movie yet.
