Occasionally you get a new appetizer from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it raw. American films rarely dare to touch the forbidden themes of society. Too many problems and a morbid fear of financial failure. The almighty dollar determines their choice. Something that invites European directors. In addition, audiences around the world are hungry for "other" films, especially those that offer a hearty bite out of the wretched, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many viewers long for beauty, poetry and the original taste of life. This is what the movie "On the Left of the Father" offers to curious listeners. A family is bound by the belief that the unity of the family stems from the unity of their obedience to tradition. However, when the patriarch forgets about a family that its members are flesh and blood people, filled with angry, unbridled dreams and dark passions, the two set themselves in motion against each other. Selton Mello plays Andr√© as a son, trying to control his inner passions with his father's stagnant philosophy. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is Ana, a young woman who wants to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the older brother. The movie offers a lot, but takes a lot of time to say it. ***
