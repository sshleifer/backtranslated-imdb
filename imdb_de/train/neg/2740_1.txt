I still do not know why I forced myself to get through it all. This "movie" was not worth the Memorex DVD-R on which it was burned; I thought I would see the end result of a group of middle school students who stole their parent's camcorder. This is by far the worst movie ever made. I really want to sincerely sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life. <br /> <br /> So it seems that it should be deliberately bad; However, if you end up in hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute Doo-Doo round, you will find that Yamasato is really trying hard to make a fantastic movie. The actors attempt dramatic kick-ass performances comparable to Crimson Tide, but are approaching The Marine. <br /> <br /> The crap game is just the tip of the iceberg. The camera angles are terrible. The story is, at best, a C-movie - the plot is not even good enough to be considered a B-movie caliber. The dialogue tries to be dynamic and witty, but like everything else it is crap. It is rumored that a printed version of the script actually attracts flies. Besides, the techno score is annoying ... not because it's techno, but because it's NON-STOP. That's right, the music plays ALL TIME in the background and serves as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. I do not care what the disclaimer claims, I will not buy it. BOTS was not purposely made so bad because it takes itself too seriously what it was: a joke. <br /> <br /> This "movie" was very cheap. But that's no excuse for his record-breaking suction factor. Big movies are made of substance, not budget. BOTS had none. <br /> <br /> Allow me to continue to express the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: If I had a threesome with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and Blood When the samurai came, I would be faster in the Decision as Steven Seagal. No doubt some people will try to defend the movie. Two, maybe three. They will say, "It's Grindhouse Chop-Socky!" or "cheesy in a good way!" or "it's so bad, it's good!" These people are idiots. A movie is either good or bad. There is no good bad movie. But there are things like idiots who like shitty movies. Do not get me wrong; There are many not necessarily serious Cornball movies that are fun and entertaining. Slither is one. BOTS is not. <br /> <br /> This suckfest takes about one and a half hours, and in my humble opinion it's 90 minutes too long. The best thing about this "movie" is the DVD cover. So next time you're near the Wal-Mart DVD trash can, take a look - DO NOT TOUCH IT, just look - and just go away.
