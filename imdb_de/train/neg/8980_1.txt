I will never forget the night in which I saw this movie. We were on a submarine patrol in the North Atlantic and this was the movie planned for the evening. We gave up ALL after the second roll. They did not even try to show it in the middle of the night. I decided to do a repeat ...... This is all I really have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment must contain ten lines. I should not fill in the comment with random words, so I'll just keep moving until I get my ten lines of BS. I could not find George Goble in the credits, but I remember him in the movie. The sin was terrible and the songs even worse.
