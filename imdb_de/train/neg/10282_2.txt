I did not expect this to be a great movie, but I did not expect it to be that awful either. I hated the mother figure so much that I had to turn the channel. I turned it back and hoped it was only part of the movie, but no. And for the daughter who sits there being ashamed or almost getting her job done or being driven insane in her own home? Are you kidding me? I was brought up to respect (and even fear) my mother, but I would quickly put her in the nearest hotel if it turned out to be annoying in my house. I was expected to follow some rules in my mother's house. <br /> <br /> I did not buy anything. I tried several ways, I really did. We are sorry.
