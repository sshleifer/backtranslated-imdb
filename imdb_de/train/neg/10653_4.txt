One two three four five six seven eight and back, haha. This is a must, especially to see the work. A lot of work is shown, you see these close ups, man, you will enjoy it. A few years ago, a video clip was certainly based on this film. It's a slasher, but without tension. The ending is also funny, and the clothes she wears in wood facing the copper, Jesus, looks like a clown. Most murders are done off-screen, but blood never flows too bloody. There are also many fight scenes and hey, nobody was hurt. And what about the weapon to kill that you have never seen, it will not spoil, you have to see it. And as a Slasher, there's a lot of T & A. To guess who the killer is, you'll be trapped a few times. But because of his cheesiness this is still one that many would like. I am glad that I have my copy, one of these mistakes. But man, these clothes and not to mention the hairstyles! If you are in your 40s, then this is a reminder.
