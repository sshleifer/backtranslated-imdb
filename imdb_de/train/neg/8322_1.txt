I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating when I checked it for IMDb after seeing it. This is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of bad movies. In the beginning it looks like a good movie, but when he gets into surgery, I can not believe how bad it got. This voice-over destroys EVERYTHING! Imagine being cut open and listening to what he says. I saw the movie in German, so I do not really know what he said in English, but ironic stuff like "Yeah, it does not hurt ..."? If you say to yourself, "think of something else" and then forget about your pain just by thinking of your girlfriend, that is ... just stupid. And his mother ... how the hell can she figure that out? Someone comes to tell her, her son died from surgery (which she somehow expected). She also found some letters in Jessica Alba's bag. plus that "she knows the hospital" stuff ... and then she needs "a second" to figure that out? What the hell? ^^ And the end ... why are the police bombarding them? The patient died in an operation, that's all happened. This drunken doctor knows nothing else ... and then they all beat down, even the girlfriend? Why??? In spite of everything, I think Christensen did a bad job, but that does not really count for me ... those mistakes and stupid things that I wrote above are the problem. I saw this movie with some friends and we were all very disappointed.
