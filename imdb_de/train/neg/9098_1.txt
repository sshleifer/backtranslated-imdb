There is a reason why certain films go straight to video, and of course the obvious reason is that if it is too naughty for the theater audience, the release will be done directly on video. Of course it is not fair to the good movies and they are also posted directly on video. This is no exception, though the film has good actors or at least actors with potential: Amy Adams (an Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunne, who deserves a better or at least a better agent, and Sarah Thompson, who earns her roles A departure from teen melodramas. The film is also wrongly stated: This movie plays in front of Cruel Intentions, so this movie is actually a prequel and pretty stupid. This was a waste and it's really a movie that's on the level of softcore porn and pay-per-view masturbation films. Fortunately for the actors, hopefully they can erase this from their CVs. So if you want to see something nasty, but do not have the guts to buy porn, then rent this movie as a starter.
