When it comes to horror movies, I'm more than willing to ignore unbelief, ignore below-average production levels, and overlook plot holes in the interest of good fear. This movie just does not have any good scare to offer. It can not even be enjoyed as a warehouse. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad direction, the killings were predictable and poorly staged, the music was annoying, the camera work was miserable, even the costumes were bad. I felt really bad for the actors, who were obviously trying, but struggling with terrible, constructed dialogues and an obvious lack of orientation. I doubt they have a sample too. It is embarrassing to see, and as boring as getting through to the invented "surprise ending" requires tremendous perseverance. It is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not usually write reviews, but it was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a waste of time. If you need to watch this movie, do not miss the "Making of" feature. The author / director seems to have the impression that turning the murderer into a woman was a courageous, courageous move. (Seen). He and the performers spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it were a "Citizen Kane" of a new era. It's like listening to a group of third graders taking you behind the scenes of their Christmas parade. They really believe that they have created some substance. It's really sad? The only reason I gave this movie a "2" is because I think that "1" should be reserved for true cruelty, like "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny". So "American Nightmare" is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I have to say it's somewhere in the last fifty.
