<br /> <br /> The entrails of a virgin are so bizarre and incomprehensible that the viewer can interpret them subjectively, using their inexplicable excesses of sex and violence as they please. If this were a deliberate feature of the film, it would be a work of postmodern brilliance - but of course not. <br /> <br /> Let's take a quick tour of the events without getting too involved in the plot summary. In a secluded cabin, an orgy is in progress, which includes topless wrestling and diapers. A number of latecomers join in the ongoing orgy, but unintentionally followed a monster that I like to call "the muddy ninja". This monster kills the orgy participants one at a time, except for the proverbial virgin (if you do not count oral sex) who receives her semen and, with passion, becomes so passionate that she masturbates with a man's severed hand. <br /> <br /> At last she has taken the courage out, and then there is a scene that implies that she is pregnant with a muddy baby ninja. Do you have it all? If you want to rent this movie, you should not speak Japanese and have no subtitles. In a season populated by boring Hollywood movies, this could be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy in your VCR. It will certainly be something else.
