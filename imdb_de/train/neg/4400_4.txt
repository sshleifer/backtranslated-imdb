One of the first films by Frances Farmer; At 22, she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby has a great voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their probably great comedy at the time is really crazy today. Roy Rogers also performs in a singing role. In my opinion, it is only worth taking a look if you are a fan of Frances Farmer and possibly a fan of Bing Crosby.
