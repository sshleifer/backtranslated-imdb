OK, I'm not an American, but in my humble Scottish opinion, Steve Martin is no, never was and will never be a jolly man as long as our descendants point south. Sergeant Bilko's Phil Silvers was a funny man, no doubt due to the talented writers and directors and all the other talented team members in the series who have contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and most dateless sitcoms America has ever produced. How anyone would have the audacity to even replicate the Phil Silvers character is unclear to me. In summary, the exercise was repeated in Martin's unwilling attempt to be Peter Sellers Inspector Clouseau, another failed attempt to rekindle a proven untiring career in my opinion. Some of your contributors say "Steve Martin gives the character his own stamp", I would say "Balderdash", his depictions will long be forgotten if those of Silvers and Sellars are appreciated for generations
