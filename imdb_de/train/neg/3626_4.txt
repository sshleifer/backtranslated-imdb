I do not know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie, but they must have seen pretty hard stuff to get the Best Picture Oscar in it. All I know is that luckily Gene Kelly was there, or that would have been twice as bad as I think. First and foremost, I do not think Leslie Caron was really capable of playing such a role. She's not that talented, she's not a great dancer and does not look good at all. It's a shame that an actor or actress can ruin a movie, as well as through playback. Because if Leslie Caron had not been there, maybe he would have made a great movie. The story was intelligent, the direction was not bad and Gene Kelly was, as I said, pretty good. Now I'm not saying everything about Leslie Caron just to criticize her, I'm just saying it because I think that's the worst part of the movie. She's probably a good actress, but I can not say it because I did not see her in anything else, but I think she was pretty bad at An American in Paris. So if you want to see it, keep going, but I tell you, you better see 'singin' in the rain '.
