I find that most people who believe that this movie is telling the truth were not born before the moon landings (1969-1972) or were not old enough to appreciate them. I think it is much easier to question a historical event if you have not experienced it. <br /> <br /> I was a teenager at the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The whole world followed the moon landings. Our families gathered around the TV to see the start. Newspaper headlines have blended the latest developments every day, from takeoff to landing, from moonwalking to lunar lifting, to spraying in a variety of languages. In school, some courses were canceled, so we could follow the main events on television. While Apollo 13 prayed the world and held the collective breath, as the men hobbled home to an uncertain fate. You could not go anywhere without anyone being asked what's new. The world was really a community. <br /> <br /> Now, with a buffer of 30 or more years, it's easy to claim fraud because of worldwide enthusiasm and interest. We've lagged behind with our history books, and anyone can claim that history is wrong and try to 'prove' them with a series of lies and fabricated facts, ignoring the preponderance of evidence proving the opposite - Not to mention the evidence dwells in the souls and memories of those who have experienced these wonderful intoxicating and fantastic days.
