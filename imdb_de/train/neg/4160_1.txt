This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I saw it with a large group of friends and after it was over, none of us understood the plot. Apart from the lack of conspiracy, the drama was cruel, the "special effects" were not so special and the writing was absolutely awful. The only redeeming factor of the movie is that it's so incredibly bad that it's pretty funny. You can not help laughing at a zombie being run over while the actors spit out shitty dialogues. I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something a group of friends can meet and have a good laugh at. It's a joke among my friends and me now. 1 out of 10.
