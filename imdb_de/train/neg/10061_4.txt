'The Curse of Frankenstein' is faithful to Mary Shelley's story for a word of the title, which would not be so bad if the changes were good at all. The tragedy of the creature that destroyed Frankenstein's family was completely removed and replaced by ... nothing. The heart and moral center of history is gone. It does not help that this Frankenstein is a crafty, insidious murderer; He deserves everything he gets. The plot is basically a flat checklist of Frankenstein clich√©s. Even on his own terms, this is garbage: a mellow, sprawling film that depicts a shabby-looking creature with a pudding cup haircut. As the first of Horror's films by Hammer, directed by Terence Fisher starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, his place in the horror story is secure. But it is crap.
