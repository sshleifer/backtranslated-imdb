Elizabeth Taylor could not act at all and in this film she was just her usual, annoying and untalented self. That was before she got so fat, but she still looked very short and stupid. Rock Hudson was fine as a Bick Benedict, but an extended-acting actor like William Holden would have been better. James Dean has certainly proven that he could mumble through a movie. The whole movie is incredibly slow and takes way too long. The actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them were convincing due to the bad make-up. Hudson looked ridiculous just because he was being pumped out and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
