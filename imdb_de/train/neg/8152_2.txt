"Do not drink the water" is an incredibly bad movie. It is based on a 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen. It plays Jackie Gleason, the weird genius behind "The Honeymooners". Director Howard Morris has starred in several Mel Brooks comedies (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) and has made a name for himself in animation. What went wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the premise is played too seriously to work effectively. Allen's original play was tongue in cheek, which is why it worked on Broadway and at Remen's Remen in 1994. The script by R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock surpass the premise to death and make too many changes to the original game. Turning Gleason's wife into an airborne child in this version, when she was originally a wayward woman, is just one example of why this does not work. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is not much better. Gleason does the best he can with the material, but he can not save that. Gleason was a funny genius, but also a good actor, as he showed in The Hustler and Soldier in the Rain. His rough personality could have worked here, but the lousy script does not even give him a chance. Too bad. The wife of Estelle Parsons will drive you crazy after 20 minutes. See how soon it will take you to strangle her. It's a shame, because she is also a good actress after having performed two extraordinary shows in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel". The other actors are not very well suited. Woody. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated this movie so much that in 1994 he re-composed it with himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) in the lead role. They manage to hit all the right notes, and the movie itself is a weird masterpiece. It's finally on video, after a long legal battle. Go out and find this version. Everything that is the original of 1969 is good for eliminating unwanted guests who exceed their greetings. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4 stars
