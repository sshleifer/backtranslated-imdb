Well, to answer a person's question, "Why does anyone remember this movie?" That's because there were not that many people in 1978 and since then, not much has been shown on TV. (If it's a video, that would be news to me!) Even in times of the sometimes rash comedies that were in the 70's, moviegoers had the art of avoiding this movie. Unless they love Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers "so much"! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was more fun on "Bewitched" or "Hollywood Squares" than here. Joan Rivers was laughing in her career at the time and was cruelly joking about singer Karen Carpenter's weight loss! Har-Har Joan! It also seems that every "something" famous name from that time is in the cast. (Most surprising is Doris Roberts later of "Everybody Loves Raymond"). Anyway, a good idea for an action: a man who gets pregnant, instead of the wife, wastes himself here. With the help of a male friend, Crystal is set up with a hooker to finally lose his virginity. But because she was "at the top", he becomes pregnant! (A commentary on women taking away men's positions of power.) Crystal grows belly, he goes through all female feelings and allied feelings. Unfortunately, he is now a socially misunderstood outcast! He is being attacked by a mob who wants him to be rubbed out (I think). He is forced to go to seclusion to have his baby in a barn. Or, if you want, a crib (God only knows where he came out! Ewwww!) It turns out (no shock here) to be a girl! <br /> <br /> Everything else about this movie is worthless and forgetful, the humor is high school or less. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea and some good touching and relevant moments / Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of the Rabitt test, it's a big time! <br /> <br /> I can not believe that Roddy McDowell also signed! (THE END)
