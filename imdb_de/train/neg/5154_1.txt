This is the only movie I have ever seen. bad acting - bad plot - bad casting - bad direction - bad camera - if they wanted to get a bad picture, they could not have done a better job. I hope you are proud of your turkey. I am surprised that anyone associated with this film ever got involved in Hollywood again. Do not waste your time!
