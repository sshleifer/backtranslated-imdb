Here we have two misunderstood children who never had a chance against a cruel, poverty-stricken existence: Robin Hoods was picked by the police for persecution because they were sometimes a bit wild. Gad! According to this crap, Bonnie west of Missouri was the cutest little thing that a life-loving friend who did not really want to hurt anyone taught her to be a psychopathic killer. Badly played, poorly filmed, unbelievable dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, blood that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing. Avoid this bilge water. Thumbs down. -5 Stars.
