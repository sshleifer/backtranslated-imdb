This movie has left me down hard. It was a great concept that was ruined with a terrible script. The story just did not flow and was at best incoherent. There were so many elements in this story that were not explained or forced without real reasoning. Elements like the love story could be extended a bit, and the guns need to be written better. The entire main character growing up growing up needed more about the training he received, and less standing around. Everyone likes a good "little guy overcomes" story, and that showed promise, but with the scripting failure it should not be. Although there was some pyrotechnics in the final battle sequence, there was a lack of choreography. This made an incredibly boring clock <br /> <br /> that could have been so good :(
