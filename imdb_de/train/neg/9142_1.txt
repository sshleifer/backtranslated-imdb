I looked at it after hearing how bad it was and wanted to see it for myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments here, you will not even be able to understand how horrible this movie actually is, though it must be one of the funniest things I've ever seen! I have never bothered to post a comment here, but this piece of crap really guarantees it. <br /> <br /> First, the whole plot is ridiculous and nonsensical. Brother of the main character (either Ben or Arthur, I forget what is, and frankly it is never quite clear) wants to end some kind of gay marriage by bringing everyone into view - because homosexuality is abhorrent to Christians, but obviously mass murder There is another crap into which a gay couple's wife was thrown, wanting to force him to marry her again at gunpoint. This leads to nothing, but offers us one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the entire "film" - "I have no sense, they do not make sense, that makes sense!". Brilliant. <br /> <br /> Then there's the acting, which is just cruel. It has to be seen to be believed. My personal favorite is the seemingly stoned civil rights lawyer, who clearly reads her lines from something and still manages to confuse them. Enough said. The gay couple could not be less convincing. There's the unsightly attractive and completely gormlose guy, and his friend, who looks like the little cartoon doughman of bistro advertising. Only fatter. And less talented. <br /> <br /> The "movie" was also filmed by someone who is not even able to hold a camera remotely, and the number of bugs is amazing. The whole thing starts with the fat captain in bed with a pair of boots. Yes. <br /> <br /> But we all know how awful this thing is, so I want to highlight some of the most precious comedy moments the movie has to offer. <br /> <br /> - When the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six-year-old girl on the other side of the parking lot to escape. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - Mildread! No idea how she relates to the main characters - sometimes they know her, sometimes not, but she still shows up in a few scenes. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - The petrified lawyer. I already mentioned her, but she is so funny that she deserves another mention. <br /> <br /> - The dinner of the evil brothers of crackers that he lays for his guests. <br /> <br /> - The evil of the bad brother's gay-potion. <br /> <br /> - The bad brother's cats. <br /> <br /> - The end I will not betray because it MUST be seen to be believed. I warn you, but make sure you do not eat at this time !!!! The tub of the lead actor / director / producer becomes naked. It's bad. Basically, Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but unintentionally the weirdest thing you'll ever see. Literally, there's nothing wrong with this excuse for a movie, the idiot of a director even manages to make the opening credits a joke by writing his own name about 15 times.
