Extreme filth. I reached the 16-minute / 27-second point and gave up. I would have given it a negative number of ratings if that were possible (though "pissible" is a more appropriate word ...). Unlike the hiss that you saw and felt in the original between MacMurray and Stanwyck, the chemistry between the stupid Dicky Crenna and the face does not exist here. The anklet becomes an unattractive, chunky bracelet? There is no ciggy lighting with your fingertip? And I thought I was SICK, if they have a shy look (and rightly, believe me) Lee J. Cobb as Keyes, who practically burps himself in Mr. Garloupi's explanation of his "Little Man". No insult to the blind, but it looks like a group of blind men with the set design of the two houses of Dietrichson and Neff would have moved. The same goes for those awful plaid trousers that Phyllis wears. And how much money does Neff make that he lives overlooking a huge marina? This, again, people, everything takes place in the first 16 minutes. If you can handle more, you have a much stronger constitution than me or you are a masochist. But please, take Alka-Seltzer first, or you will develop a "little man" who may never disappear. Of course, be careful.
