I saw this movie on DVD last night and decided to check the reviews this morning. It seems that "I, Robot" has polarized the critical viewer community to IMDb (and has led to a lot of insults and name shouts). <br /> <br /> I think that's a bit surprising. Film is not great (or even good), but it's not terrible (or even really bad). What this movie really is is ... depressing. Worrying that the US film audience is ready to celebrate bland, cliched rewarms and call them spectacular new works. This movie was retouched everywhere, from the Plotline (a disagreeable mix of Asimov and modern Uber action) to Smith's character (a clever cynic with a titanium backbone) to the special effects (borrowed from Matrix and some others) ). Unfortunately, "I, Robot" may be the perfect one Action movie for today's audience: superficial action, threadbare dialogues and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's last unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has many holes in all sizes, but I do not think most people interested in this movie are critical enough to notice it. For today's standards maybe a blockbuster, but in comparison to true winners a very good B-movie.
