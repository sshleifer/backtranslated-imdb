Do not waste your time with this filth. As shown, the characters have no redeeming values ​​and it's sheer torture when they interact with each other. "Gothic" was at least entertainment, that's crap. If you like to watch lavish and spoiled poets trying to outsmart each other, this may be your lane. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete jerk, and why the others spend more than five minutes with him is really confusing. Mary Shelly seems to be the only figure with a backbone, but she also comes out of the test without much respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember that I saw another superior movie that focused on the same subject but did not see the title. I had hoped that it was, but no such luck. Not recommended.
