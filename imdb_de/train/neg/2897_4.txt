There is little to inspire "Dan in Real Life". First of all, the entire setup is incredibly thought out. Did you really believe that Marie Dan did not tell her where she was going during that first meeting in the restaurant? And since Dan has been talking all over this conversation, why should she be so attracted to him? I never found out why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the movie. He is very narcissistic and does not do much to convince himself that he is really a good guy (for example, he lies to Marie in the bookstore, smiles at his brother over his former girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous with a blind date ). There are more pieces of furniture like this ridiculous scene in the bowling alley, where Dan and Marie are caught by the whole family. Yes, that could really happen. Dan in real life is slow, juicy and manipulative. Even chicks like the Jane Austen Book Club get higher scores than this predictable "tearjerker".
