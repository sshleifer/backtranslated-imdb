Model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) is brutally raped by a teacher (Chris Sarandon) of her sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He is being tried, but he is completely free. Then he raped Kathy! <br /> <br /> Violent and Ill Rape movie. This film was promoted as an important drama against rape. What it is is a poorly written and (mostly) badly played drama. It claims to be sympathetic with the victim of the rape, but pushes the scene into our faces. To be honest, Hemingway's drama is so bad in that order that it loses any real influence it might have. The trial scenes were boring and predictable. And the movie just went too far when 15-year-old Mariel was raped (luckily that was not shown). However, I admit that this has led to a great ending when Margaux grabs a weapon and shoots Sarandon. But seriously - raping a young girl is just outrageous. For example, Margaux was not an actress. She was certainly a beautiful woman (and a true model, I think), but her acting left a lot to be desired. It reduces the movie. Mariel was just okay, but this was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as a rapist. He was not bad, but the terrible script worked against him. <br /> <br /> I remember listening to a demonstration in 1976 that some women got up when Sarandon was killed. I thought that was boring, simple and really sick. A 1 all the way.
