This is undoubtedly the worst, stupidest, most horrible piece of crap I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This film plot says that a guy goes crazy and disguises himself as Santa and kills people because he saw his mother give oral sex to his dad while dressed as Santa Claus. THAT IS WHY HE MADE INSANITY? Is it just me or is that the worst reason for someone going crazy like EVER? and that is not the only one. I'm serious when I say NOTHING IN THIS DAMNED FILM. nothing until about 1 hour and 15 minutes have passed. <br /> <br /> There is a whole damned scene where he has a friggin Santa bear on him. It's a fresh minute. WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS? However, I have to say that the end of this movie made me laugh at it. So, if you watch this movie on TV or come back in about an hour and 20 minutes to see without a doubt the worst ending in movie history. and I'm serious. <br /> <br /> It's not even so good, it's boring, it's idiotic, it made me break the VCR. It just is not worth your time. I'm sure every other review mentioned this, but the actress who played the mother on Home Improvement was in this movie for a split second. You want to know how bad this movie is? I would rather go home to improve on the improvement of SIXTH HOURS, though these films keep coming back.
