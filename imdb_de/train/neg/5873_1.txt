I do not know what they think. By them I mean that someone was connected to this disaster even remotely. I've seen so bad movies, I've seen really bad movies, and then there are. But I'll say one thing Whatever the script has written has changed to bring the possibly most indecent dialogue to the screen. There is nothing good about this film, either technically or otherwise. Whoever has allowed it, makes it possible The film should have been fired immediately. There are some pretty well-known names in this movie. Actually, I hesitate to use the word movie. It's more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to others and less than 0 make sense. I do not understand why someone with any dignity would appear on this issue. I got it really cheap, and I was still torn away from it. Even if I had received this film for free, I would still have been demolished. This is an absolute 0/10
