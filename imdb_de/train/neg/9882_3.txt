There are exactly two good things about "fantasies" (both were also mentioned by a previous reviewer): <br /> <br /> a) Bo Derek's extraordinary, poetic-inspirational beauty. She has footage in this film, in which she even gets Catherine Zeta-Jones for her money, and that's a great compliment indeed. Her nudity is short and discreet, but a look at her face is enough. <br /> <br /> b) The Greek island with its sun and crystal clear blue waters. <br /> <br /> Other Then there is no story, the dialogue is miserable and sometimes unintentionally funny ("He touched you on the woman!"), and Peter Hooten's character is a slimy idiot. Bo overrides the naivety of her character, but if you have to work with such bad dialogue, it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she said "Damir" in almost every sentence is a big irritation). Oh, and although the film is set on a Greek island, there is hardly any Greek word to it - apparently everyone there, from children to old people, speak English all the time. (*)
