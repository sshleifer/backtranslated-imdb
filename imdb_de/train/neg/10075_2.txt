I'm sorry, but Adrian Zmed of TJ Hooker could not save this sequel. I went through half the movie and thought that this is a parody of the original. Then came this wild and crazy motorcycle scene (note that this is the only movie directed by Patricia Birch); and I realized with sadness that they were trying to be serious. I got a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang who had lost their "wheels" in the original Grease due to their playing habits was forced to use motorcycles in the second movie. I'm not ashamed of this cute character Carrington, and I would hate to see what they would fall back on later: maybe mopeds? <br /> <br /> I've never bought the hackneyed theme: hunky fit-in-outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-goes-for-tough-guy-with-stupid-biker-helmet-look. It was a Disney story that went horribly wrong. <br /> <br /> So it looks like you could ruin a good cause by putting a bubble gum powdered sugar Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical. The only thing I took from this movie was the idea of ​​how many out of ten points he should give.
