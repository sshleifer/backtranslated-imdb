This documentation is based on sponge cake as soon as you get the REAL proof. The integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap. For example, Bart Sibrel claims they had multiple sources of light, as the shadows appear to cross if that were the case. In this case, there would not be two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 passed through the van Allan radiation belts , There were 30 minutes spent, not the 90 minutes claimed in the documentary, and they received a radiation dose similar to that of an x ​​ray. <br /> <br /> Seriously research what really happened. Do not let this bunch of crap of a documentary affect your mind about what really happened
