I thought this movie would be a lot better than it was. It sounded like a parody of espionage, and the beginning reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this film was running out. <br /> <br /> The plot is just too ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia have set up a spy school where they teach their spies how to behave like Americans, but the city where they settled for training is a bit dated, so they get two punches from the US to spice things up. I do not know, but that seems easy. It becomes strange when almost no one speaks Russian accent throughout this Russian city. Someone failed the casting. <br /> <br /> It's also painfully dry for a comedy. There are one or two funny spots and they are not for singing and dancing. The movie at the end will probably get you to sleep. <br /> <br /> And as a twisted slap in the face, this movie is so for the US that it makes me sick. The film keeps saying that the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is the kind of smear campaign that was carried out against the Japanese in World War II. It's films like these that give everyone the impression that the US is full of itself. <br /> <br /> This gives 4 out of 10 points. and I'm nice. It was supposed to be one, but the dance scene was fun, but then it was too long to be really funny.
