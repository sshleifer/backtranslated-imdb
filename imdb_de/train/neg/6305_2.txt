This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We're still working on that.) Despite the fact that this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie page. I realize that it is difficult for independent films to get good actors, but wow. The only thing that is mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he could not compensate all actors (even those who played him as a young man) for absolutely cruel spectacle. Granted, the script was a terrible clich√©, but even then you have to get some decent actors! I would not recommend it to anyone because it's so bad in every category. Read some books about the true story of the American Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
