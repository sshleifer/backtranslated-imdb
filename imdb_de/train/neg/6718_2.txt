I wanted to watch the movie because of an article in a movie magazine. It was not a very recommendable reviewer. The story is different and I'm sure it would have been a good movie if it was in the right hands. Director and drama were terrible !! I felt like watching a movie that was going to make a lot of amateurs. Although the film started promising, it got worse and worse. I think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters. I still think it's worth seeing as I have not seen any movies subject to gay porn. However, if you do not keep your expectations high, you will be very disappointed. * out *****
