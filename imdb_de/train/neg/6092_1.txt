Someone must have made a joke seriously when they made this movie. <br /> <br /> Firstly, it is absolutely impossible that this movie was shot in 1993. The fashions and the music say that these are serious 80's. My guess is that this was on the shelves for a long time before a crazy distributor picked it up and released it into an unbelieving world. <br /> <br /> There is a conspiracy. A strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he meditates while singing his favorite song he can become the person he chooses. At this point I feel obliged to point out that the favorite song of the individual is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is this his favorite song? Because he is an idiot. We're only a minute in the movie and the movie has already reached a monumental stupidity. It gets even stupider. <br /> <br /> The loner is the nostril picker. I can only guess that since there are two scenes in the movie where he is seen snapping his nose. That clears up the title. He decides to turn into a girl to approach other girls. And kill her. That is more or less the case. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is generally appalling. Every single performance in this movie is shitty. In fact, I would say that acting conforms to the standard of a pornographic film. It's really that awful. The nostril picker appears to the audience as a nostril picker. The characters of the film see him as the girl he has won by singing London Bridge Is Falling Down. Man, I feel like an idiot even typing this. Anyway, it's kind of weird to see a middle-aged weirdo hanging around with schoolgirls. And not in a good way. There is even an extensive montage of scenes in which the nostril picker is in school with the girls playing a song about it. It is most likely the worst song ever recorded. I will not even describe it. You will know when you hear it. And you agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes of violence, for sure. And there's a Benny Hill-style chase sequence that involves a transsexual. There is even an immortal dialogue that may have come from Shakespeare or John Milton, where the nostril picker says to a prostitute, "I have the money, if you have the wound." Well, I'm sure you agree with that. <br /> <br />
