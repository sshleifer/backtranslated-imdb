Jimmy Dean could not have been jealous or absurd loutish. Hysterical, if you look at it through the eyes of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I rate as 10. I mean, the sight of this obese corn-fed pig stumbling across Malta should be enough to make you vomit if you make it far into the movie. This ugly, hysterical farce should be cast among others with "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs Go To Bangladesh". Such a film shows that sometimes actors, writers, producers, etc., lag behind with their mortgage or become stoned to madness. It begs the question, "Who was so stupid to finance such a whale?" If then had a good judgment enforced and "Final Justice" was never, then we would not have the delightful parody in "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
