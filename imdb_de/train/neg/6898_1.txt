Avoid this crap at all costs. Bad script, bad direction, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Do you get an idea? This movie tries to be western, it is not. It tries hard to be violent, it is not. It tries to take an old look at an old genre, but it is not. The actors try it best there, and my heart goes out to meet them. But with such unsightly material, it's hard to make something shine. For me, this has all the looks of a "fresh from the film school that will set the world on fire", the first attempt. Freshmen filmmakers often bite off more than they can or chew on their budget. The best you can do is take a few steps back, re-evaluate the possibilities and work on your limited budget next time.
