I'm lucky! I got a quick taste of Artisan Entertainment's miserable Texas-shot 'horror' streak, a week before he got into the video rack, and I'll tell you ... I seldom laughed so much in my life as watching this awful Megabombe flies off the tracks and steals the title of the "worst killerclown movie ever made" from the incredibly stupid Full Moon fiasco KILLJOY (I'm sure many of us horror fans have suffered!) Was shot on DV and it does not look that bad in terms of quality for digital, but in every other area where it matters, it fails miserably! <br /> <br /> and a clich√© as it is) goes like this: An executive (Ken Hebert, who also co-produced and co-produced a screenplay with the director) takes over the skeptical employee Tracy (Amanda Watson) and horny couple Mark and Susan (Hank Fields and Hank Fields) Chris Buck) on a weekend getaway to a (yawning) secluded cabin "12 miles" from the nearest town. Along the way, they'll take a sloppy hitchhiker (Melissa Bale) to a bar and land at their destination, where a nocturnal campfire story about a murderous clown in the same wooded area will come true if each of the profanity Yackin fills, Pot-Smokin's friends disappear one by one, leaving only mutilated puppets behind to tell the story of their fate. <br /> <br /> The killer clown does not even appear in the movie until the end and it does not look like the demonic image on the video box (apart from morbidly obese). Basically it spends an hour fooling around in the woods, chopping wood and prattling nursery rhymes. I can not say enough bad things about the line-up, especially the two guys and the hitchhiker, who either lead their dull dialogue with a minimum of enthusiasm or act excessively at inappropriate times. It does not really help that the script is completely and completely without tension, originality, intelligence, general coherence or humor. I could spend days thinking about how incapable this movie is, how many continuity flaws there are and how amateurish the entire production is, but I just nod by pointing out that the entire package in this boy-this-so sucks it somehow , <br /> <br /> Also the movie was released as SICK here in the US (Serial Insan Clown Killer). It is currently cataloged under its (original title) GRIM WEEKEND. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
