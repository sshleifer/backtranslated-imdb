Usually I only write reviews for movies that I really hated or really liked. And, as you can probably tell from the number of stars above, I did not like that. I suppose you've read about the plot or maybe even watched the movie, so I'm skipping the summary. Let's break down the pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: The concept: The premise was rated as interesting. The use of chaos theory as a topic was interesting. However, it was not done so well. Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that the Chaos Theory has been misrepresented. The event that happened in the film seemed more like a coincidence than anything else. I think the butterfly effect was caused by the whole "God (s) that the tsunami brings back the statue". The presentation, however, looks very sloppy. Some people call it intelligent, but it just seems like another neat action movie. <br /> <br /> Storyline: Is it just me, or does it seem like Kamal just threw it together to give him an excuse to roll ten? The conspiracy is extremely thoughtful; Govind lost the vial so often in confusing accidents (his boyfriend just mixes the vial with a package to India, a crazy old lady simply shoves the vial into an idol, half of the cast accidentally. Unexpectedly, we meet in the same hospital, and the case with the idol was randomly mixed with one that belonged to a famous singer.) <br /> <br /> CGI: Oh god, the CGI. It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3 and the ones that were sucked. I could immediately see which parts were animated. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars do not look that way. <br /> <br /> Stunts: Yeah, I know now that action scenes in Tamil movies are not realistic, but the stunts in this movie were awful and actually distracted me from the story. <br /> <br /> Make up: I have to admit, they did a better job than expected. I thought Kamal would play people with similar skin tones, so that the two wrong white guys and the wrong Japanese Aikido guy surprised me. However, it was still pretty bad, I could easily tell which masks were wearing. <br /> <br /> The songs: The music was often distracting and out of place. <br /> <br /> Asin: Your character was possibly the most annoying in the movie. She was loud, stupid and obsessed with this idol. I actually wished that I wish she would die. <br /> <br /> Plot Holes and Fridge Logic: Let me make that clear: A laboratory monkey was smart enough to pass a password-protected door, but not smart enough to say the difference between a bar of chocolate and a vial with a deadly virus. And then, an ex-CIA agent who finds out about the phial assumes that it's going to India. Instead of following him immediately, he first marries a pole dancer. A famous Punjabi singer with cancer checks into a small urban hospital in the developing world when he could afford the best medical treatment. He is also shot with a bullet in the neck. You'd think he was going to be killed, but instead the magic bullet cleaned his tumor. You read that correctly, a BULLET knocked out the tumor. <br /> <br /> Pros ... The Naidu Character: Maybe the only sympathetic part of the movie was his comedy.
