As an actor, I really like independent movies, but this one is amateur at best. <br /> <br /> The boys go to Vermont for a civilian service, but when the plane lands, it flies over a palm - that's what the directors knew Palms are not in Vermont? Pines yes - palms no. And the same for the wedding service - again a beautiful palm grove. <br /> <br /> When the guys leave VT, apparently they can not get a ticket on one of the major airlines, as the filmed plane is Federal Express. Did they ship overnight in a box? Come on, little details like this separate indie movie by totally layman. <br /> <br /> The Christian brother is much more than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal ribbon tattoo. The two should have changed the roles. <br /> <br /> The minor characters are ridiculous and exaggerate something terrible. <br /> <br /> Cheers to the directors for a gay movie, but watch out for your filming locations and pour them next time
