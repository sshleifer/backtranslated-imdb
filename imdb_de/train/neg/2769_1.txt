This movie is a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own movie. Face, you can not. Because that's the way anyone can tell you if you'll break big holes in your storyline, have meaningless transitions, have fun, memorable dialogues, and turn a pretty cool Korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid crap. > I wanted to like this movie as a greasy popcorn movie, really I did it; I like a lot of fucking movies. But after I was forced to ask myself, what the hell happened and WHY, LORD, WHY? I can not stand it more than a few times. <br /> <br /> I would also like to love someone who explains how LA became Mordor in the last scene.
