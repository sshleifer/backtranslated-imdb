{rant start} I did not want to believe them at first, but I think people are talking about it when they say that South Korean cinema has reached its peak and may even go downhill. After the surprisingly entertaining and moving monster movie "Gwoemul" (aka "The Host") of 2006 - which has actually managed to turn a B-movie genre into a sharp satire - successive Korean blockbusters have become even more generic in their budgets (mainly for special effects) have become more and more fantastic. Do the South Korean filmmakers really want to waste the entire audience and the good will of the investors who have built their industry since the outbreak of the film "Shiri / Swiri" in 1999, by making a whole series of medium-sized, low-priced films like the Chinese mainland? {rant end} <br /> <br /> The only "reason" I can figure out for making this film is to get investors to finance the most detailed and flowing digital animations of a Korean / East Asian dragon, I have ever seen until today for the last scenes. If they had introduced this dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose as in the 1996 "Dragonheart", the movie might have had some other redeeming qualities than many digitally animated dragons. Do you remember "Dungeons & Dragons" in the year 2000? Has not anyone learned that the trick is not how many special effects you use, but how well you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends that they can use because they've just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed them. In short, I agree with all the negative reviews that lay before him and ask how the Koreans ended up playing their folk anthem "Arirang". As a creature feature, I would have given it at least 5 out of 10 stars if the special effects or action sequences were worth it, but I have seen many video games with better camera work and better scripting (less dragons).
