This movie probably had something for something; I'm amazed how these completely prosaic, inglorious themes keep putting it in the theater. It's like recycling ideas just because generations are. In fact, the survivors behind most of the films are like dogs and return to themselves for vomiting. Well, because of me they are 19 dollars richer. That was not imaginative at all, there was no redeeming moment in the trailer everything was somehow funny (and in the trailer was nothing amusing), the performances were tense (especially Molly's, absolutely unconvincing). What should theoretically be regarded as comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a preference for Disney movies; None of his analogies met at home, his little moral speeches were shallow, I literally waited for them to say something meaningful just to find out he was done. The so-called "hard 10" is the blandest plastic thing that exists (apart from a horse-like face with a funny smile); I've honestly found that her friend Patty (referred to as Hamburglar) looks much better than she. But on the other hand gentlemen prefer brunettes;) Well, the whole premise is that society is superficial and, when love is true, transcends all social facades; The way they showed it, with a guy shaving someone else's scrotum, and the millionfold mutilated and death-tested ejaculation of the horse (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the latter in the vile scene-resolution, the involved) the family dog). I feel like the movie is like a joke of juxtaposed, ridiculous jokes in an undeformed, wretched ball of raw sewage. Going to show that marketing can push anything, whatever foul-smelling mass is, and call it gold, people will come (work for me). Done with the tirade.
