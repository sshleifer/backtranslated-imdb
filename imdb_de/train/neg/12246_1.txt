*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Looking at the movie on the premise alone, one might think that one is watching an average animal-oriented horror movie. The action is as follows. A group of documentary filmmakers head to the island to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or blood surfing. (I live in South Africa, so it was released as "Blood Surf.") Admittedly, this seems to have some interesting idea behind it, which could have improved the film a little if explored further. However, this is not the case as the blood-sucking part of the film is minimal due to the fact that the documentation is interrupted by a fairly large saltwater crocodile. <br /> <br /> The script is absolutely terrible. A good example of this is that if someone is eaten by the crocodile, which is common in this film, nobody is too bad. Most of the people who appeared in the film were merely inciting the victim in a scene that was supposed to be stubborn, but eventually became ridiculous because the dialogue in this film was highly doubtful. What really irritates the movie is the fact that it introduces characters that are completely superfluous to the movie itself. They are introducing a series of pirates, all of whom can only be seen to add another 10 minutes to a compassionate short film. <br /> <br /> It can be said that the acting is mediocre. It would probably have been much more impressive if they did not have such a horrible screenplay. All in all, there is no person who has had a terrible influence on me. Every single person seemed to be a watered-down cartoon, and so none of those actors had any influence on me. <br /> <br /> The crocodile itself should be huge, just about 30 meters and this size feel represented by the obvious fake a crocodile which they have provided to us in the film. The death of the crocodile at the end of the film is so ridiculously faked and invented that the stomach turns. With a daring bravura cry of the hero of the film announces that he has a plan to pour down a hill, and to bring the crocodile to be speared on a happy placed spike at the end of said hill. > <br /> All in all I would say that this movie is one that you have to see to believe how bad it could be. What seemed likely at the time as a good idea suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of budget, which led all at a really terrible film.
