Haha! All you have to do is smile and smile if you actually made it through the movie. I think it says something about me. The film itself was designed as a kind of psychological test or as a kind of drug to take you to a place you have never been to. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece, the Tractacus (sp?), He said it was meaningless and useless, but if you read it after you're done, it would take you to a new level, like a ladder, and then you could throw the work away and see things with clarity and true understanding. This movie is the same as I think. <br /> <br /> As a movie, it's undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in such a unique way. These are mainly snipes. I loved seeing this guy in different movies. and I went through some weak ones. Although you know the movie might be shit, you would never suspect it could be as bad as it actually was. what's the fun of it. I mean, that's Snipes. You know it might be good, but it'll be alright, right? Smile. <br /> <br /> So this thing is pure boredom on every level, pure unoriginality. The reference to the pro is both dead and obvious, but made so bad that it's weird. There is not a single character in this movie that is the least interesting. And to make the whole thing a bit unreal, they have a soundtrack that sounds like parts of different Bourne identity films. Only is not true. Although it seems to be close to action-movie background music, it happens in a way that will greatly amaze you. <br /> <br /> Then all the scenes in the overall pitch become black, where honestly Because the characters are so shallow, you do not really care what will happen, but still, after it happens and someone gets killed, you just say to yourself, if I should see that. what else? How about scenes with blinding, unpleasant flashes in a flash of lightning, for a period too long to endure. Sure, let's interject. But how about that? If you make an effort and your eyes can not deal with it, you do so in dark killings where you really do not see what happened. and on top of that, let's face it, you do not care. They were bored from the beginning. <br /> <br /> So I slipped back and forth a few times, but I almost got the whole movie. and it becomes something that you can see without something that occupies your mind at some level, so it becomes something that you can effectively zone and start thinking about your life, where it goes, where it has been is what we are people. <br /> <br /> and that ... that's the true magic of this movie.
