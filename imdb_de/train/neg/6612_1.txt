I downloaded this movie yesterday via a website. The quality was somehow good! I watched the movie with high expectations (though I knew it was a flop), especially as superstar Amitabh Bachchan plays the role of a villain. At least, actors like him did something to their roles. Unfortunately, Mr. Bachchan had failed to impress as a villain that no one could handle that AMJAD KHAN's magical trial of Rgv could leave the past behind. Sholay, the old one, is a milestone in Indian cinema with All Star Cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack that is a hit with the current generation. A good actor like Ajay Devgan's TALENTS are wasted and his performance was wasted on average. Prashant Raj, a freshman does not know what acting is. Nisha Kothari has proven that she is one of the worst actresses we have. I do not know how she is seen in RGV's crew Urmila & Abhishek in a song without excitement and passion. Mohanlal did his best, and Susmitha Sens's work was good, I liked her somehow work in this movie It was a total slaughter of the original Sholay
