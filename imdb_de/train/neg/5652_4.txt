This is not a bad movie ... but it's the guy your girlfriend lets you watch. The story is not bad ... it only takes one and a half hours so long. It's hard for me to throw this movie in the bin because I really like the idea, but the story was too long and too thin. The main character never seems to really change from beginning to end. I mean, go through something "life changing" and he can barely break a smile. I really liked Mac. His strange strangeness prevented the movie from being a complete catastrophe. Maybe I "just" do not get this movie. If anyone can explain it to me, I would like to be informed.
