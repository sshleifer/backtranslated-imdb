Howling II (1985) was a complete 180's from the first movie. While the first movie was campy and scary. The second was muddy and cheesy. The production values ​​on this movie are pretty bad and the acting is disgusting. The brother of the anchorwoman Werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sister. The "scene" from the first movie was badly recreated. A thin-looking woman accompanies bro (Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to uncover the mystery of her sister's murder / transformation / death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears every now and then as a sort of sage / guide for the two. Sybil Danning and her two biggest assets appear as Stirba, the chief werewolf of Romania. She also suffers from a bad case of morning face, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There's nothing good about that stinker. I am surprised that Philippe Mora staged this picture because he is usually a good filmmaker. The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to look at it (no, not the content, but the movie itself). To round out the movie, you get a lousy "punk" performance from a damned wannabe "Babel". If they gave themselves a few dollars more, they might have the right deal instead of an imitation. <br /> <br /> Best to avoid, unless you are desperate or have lost the remote and are too lazy to change the channel.
