The murders in this movie are not that bad, but the movie is safe. It's even worse than that. It's not even worth the wear that could be caused if you push it into your DVD player. <br /> <br /> Not even the wear and tear that it causes on your shoulders when you take it out of the DVD shop, and not talk about the money and time you hire and watch. Horrible. <br /> <br /> It's incomprehensible how anyone can say something positive about this movie. It was just a masochistic tendency of me not to stop watching and, in addition, the peer pressure from my fellow observers. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is awful, the director's worse and the acting just abhorrent. <br /> <br /> I hope you do not consider this as fun for your fun, I would rather take it as a warning: do not waste your time to see this garbage!
