This review also includes a spoiler from the first movie. So if you have not wanted to see any of the movies, but do not want the spoilers, please do not read this review! <br /> <br /> While this movie is about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the movie is a bad copy of the first Cruel Intentions. The actors who portray Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn, are very bad indeed deputy. Neither can the smarmy, who made the original actor snooty rich kid attitude, penetrate. It is absolutely terrible that some dialogues were literally - not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen carefully, you will realize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this was really the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, why did Christian then falls in love with a girl at the end of the film? He is said to be in love for the first time in the original film (with Reese Witherspoon's character). <br /> <br /> Also the interaction with photography / "You could comment on a model" The end was totally lame and did not add anything at all. Overall, this film was a waste of time. I can not believe that they made a cruel intention 3.
