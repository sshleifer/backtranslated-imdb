This is the clich√©d and worst romantic comedy I've ever seen. Every scene is damn worthy and the two main characters - Corey and Danny are so annoying. Corey is very stupid and naive and never heard Danny's false promises. Neve Campbell and the murderer of Urban Legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a movie. Danny (Dean Paras) looks the late thirties and the girl he wants to go to bed - Corey looks like she's still in college. There is nothing smooth about this movie. Avoid 1/10
