There is no entertainment in this movie. There is no eerie, funny or even interesting scene in this movie. She advertises as a horror, then she calls herself comedy. It's not even humor. She also does not try to be scary. <br /> <br /> So as not to be bored by this film, you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people in the world. If you like this movie a bit, then you have no standard for what you will ever see. I have a hard time understanding what the filmmakers wanted to achieve. It's not funny, scary, shocking or fascinating. So was it a drama? Because it was not really dramatic. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. Life is too valuable to waste 90 minutes of it.
