I would have liked to rate this movie as zero, but that was not an option !! This movie is shit !!! The women can not act. I should have known it sucked when I saw Bobby Brown. Nobody in my house could believe that I had not changed the channel after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​black women as gunslingers in the Western days is ridiculous. It's not just a race thing, it's a gender. The combination of the two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry, because some of the people in the movie are not bad actors / actresses, but the movie itself was horrible. it was not believable as a movie. It may be "entertaining" for a certain group of people, but I do not belong to that group. lol. and with a great line from a great, great movie ... "That's all I have to say."
