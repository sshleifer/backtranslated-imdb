Buck's role as The Kahn is reminiscent of Bob Barker (of The Price is right), who leads a country as he directs his show. In this turkey, there is much more to laugh and sniff. Kurt Thomas, the "baby face" hero, has some notable acrobatic skills but no talent at play. There are a few scary moments (mainly in the village of Crazies) and some slightly impressive martial arts sequences. But any given "Ninja" movie will give you much more entertainment and you will not feel so guilty when you laugh.
