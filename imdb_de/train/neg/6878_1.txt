I am Puerto Rico and this is one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. You can see that people are unaware of this. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Ricans because they come from Puerto Rican descendants, but they probably know less than others who are not from there. They can see as they speak that they contradict each other. If you want to see a real movie and I mean a real, real documentary from Puerto Rico, then you have to see "Mi Puerto Rico". This is a serious, real documentation. Not like this piece of garbage. Rosie Perez has taken this documentation to herself. I thought it should be Puerto Rican. They keep repeating that I did not know. Well, that is about the only thing they have understood correctly in this so-called documentation. I hate to see how a piece of garbage with the name of the island is made. It downs the standards.
