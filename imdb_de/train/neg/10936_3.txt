I wanted to like this movie, I really did. It has some good actors, but in the end it falls flat. It's too hard to be funny in some places (the daughters over eager cooking attempts), to skim over the others (the scene in which they tidy up someone's garden, so he agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that are mildly interesting, really are just filler (all working scenes). And I did not find the "Villians" intimidating or hateful, not so much that I found them childishly disturbing. <br /> <br /> I met people like that in the movie during the church ball. And I'll say the referees are just right. Nevertheless, I was not really that interested in the characters or in their search for the glory of the church ball. Maybe because they were all so one-dimensional, which might not have made so much sense to me, if the movie was funnier or seemed to run a bit smoother overall. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale and Halestorm Entertainment made some good movies, but this is not one of them.
