Although this seems like a pretty old show (2002), I saw my first episode last night and I have to say it must be the worst show. , , <br /> <br /> I'm not responsible for posting comments, but I was so shocked that there might be a show that's obviously trying to make an effort, and I'm just assuming that this is their target audience was, children under 12 years old or people with a below-average IQ. <br /> <br /> The episode that I was exposed to last night contained so many incoherent storylines, trying to imagine ANY possible blog summary, trying to talk about friendship preaching, family, religion and politics !!!. <br /> <br /> Basic story they discussed in the episode: Frat House, who has been wronged with too much alcohol - Death turns out to be Senator's son, who wants the FBI to investigate. Death is actually murder by peanut allergy. Senator believes it could be his sworn enemy and best friend from childhood who did that because Senator took money for his votes for legislation, but eventually got a conscience and means "no" to mean a million-millionaire , Everyone a suspect, but all have the usual alibi (former student pushing a married teacher, so had to lie, an angry student who was reported to have actually made his victim life-changing experiences) gives money to many broke students). During the dribbling's heroine remains her niece, who is "at this age," and has a crush on a boy with whom she finally gets the courage to speak with the help of her aunt, but only to dismiss him in ' Girls say he's not good enough, and she drops him to stay with them. Do not worry, she will come back with a boy after learning the truth about life and dropping the girls who leave her. Aunt also explains that God is the only one she can really rely on (I was almost sick at the time). <br /> <br /> This "drama" gets even better as Sue and her FBI team figure out who the killer is. , , You laugh about it, I certainly did. , , <br /> <br /> It's one of the frat guys who just found out a year ago that he was adopted and that his real dad is an international terrorist and he tries to impress a real dad by playing at the Burial kills boys and plant bombs. , , , , , , <br /> <br /> The characters are cardboard, the acting is cardboard, the continuity is cardboard. The story is cardboard. Anyone who says he loves this show has cardboard for a brain. <br /> <br /> Why did the authors do this? show has tried to put EVERY eventuality in one. Show means that they obviously have no confidence in character development or the ability of the actors to wear a simple plot line. If you look at this show, it's like seeing 'Last Action Hero' with Arnie killing 5,000 people with a toothpick, except that Arnie is a better actor (wow, never thought it would be one) Would give day to which I would say that !!)> <br /> In the words of Simpsons beloved character "Comic Book Guy". , , , <br /> <br /> the worst TV show. , , , , JE.
