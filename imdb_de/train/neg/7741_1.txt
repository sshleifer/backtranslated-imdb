Josh Hartnett's dead eyes, the fat writing of it and Harrison Ford in a buddy comedy! Here are 3 reasons to hate, avoid and make better use of 116 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> The Buddy Cop movies are fun. Their true golden age, however, was in the 1980s and 1990s. It's certainly a good idea to make a movie that tries to mix action and comedy by the Hollywood police itself, but the end result of it did not prove at least a parody of the subgenre, but rather a reason to ask God for mercy earlier Films of the same kind, the worst of which was definitely bigger than (Hollywood Homicide). <br /> <br /> What really happened with this fun formula ?! For a whole decade, things were not the same anymore. You would have a persistent flop-flop after another. I will inspire you with some of the titles you can do well with the disaster: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004) and the worst of them, that existed so far (Miami Vice - 2006)! <br /> <br /> I believe one of the reasons for this is the natural case of saturation after many similar filmstrips and television programs that have already emerged in two decades. In addition, there is the negligent action and the dull humor. Actually, the thing is completely unbearable this time. Yes, we have the characters of 2 loyal policemen who have part-time jobs and the background of a sinful city, but what was new ?! It's not about stereotypes; These are few renewals that have been mixed with stereotypes that have both been done badly. <br /> <br /> The acting, especially of (Hartnett) 's, is terrible. This guy is anything but a comedian (or actor!). So his character wanted to avenge his father's death! Revenge yourself, he probably died watching your acting !! Even the small roles have gotten people who have nothing to do with comedy (or at least they seemed to be here somehow!). <br /> <br /> The director fails to present anything that is funny or hard, some parts have managed to be up boring (arresting the black by the lack ??); It's a rare time to be bored with action / comedy! They did not use Hollywood itself, be it as an ironic place with an ugly face behind its superficial charm, or even as a place full of glowing or fallen stars (cameos that might have given it some interesting moments ). <Br /> <br /> It's a very simple movie, based on the fact that only the glamor of its stars can be seen and that it is a buddy cop movie, considered one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non-chemistry on screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself, guess who ?!) and a destroyer by Buddy-cop more than a movie! God, do not let me or my children live enough to bear witness (Hollywood Homicide? Part 2)! After all, look at Harrison Ford's performance, he wanted to have a good time, but at least we did not.
