I do not envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for this movie. In a word it is boring. Perhaps the fact that it is too predictable, the more than exploited loser role of Ben Stiller or the not so funny scenes, that this movie is easy to forget. Even the look of Christopher Walken ends in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's acting. I loved it in most of his movies, the last one I saw before was duplex with Drew Barrymore and was not that bad. About Jack Black ... Apart from High Fidelity, I've never seen him do something good. What about School of Rock? Ooops, terrifying.
