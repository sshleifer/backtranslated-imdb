I just saw this movie last night, and I MUST warn all the others who want to watch this movie. In a word - not. I seriously feel that this is something that a screenwriter would have written in a Quentin-Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase, d. H. Every other word was a curse word. I have no problem with rich cursing, as in "Good Will Hunting," provided it helps to dive more into the characters. In this case, it was just a joke, trying occasionally to get a gasp or laugh from the audience. The three main characters are all their own unique clich√©, the Wall Street Ruck, the Coffee House Ruck and the "I'm not just gay-just-in-touch-with-my-feminine-side". of-a-Jerk. They just are not ashamed of one of them! They are all superficial, irrevocable losers who want to lose you. For those who dare, this movie has some fun moments, the beginning and the end. The toilet / vibrator scene is funny in a kind of "Uh, yeah" way. But I would recommend this movie only to my worst enemies.
