This could have been the gay counterpart to Gone With The Wind, as it has an epic length, but it was satisfying by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which nothing happens. The characters are one-dimensional and have no other development in history (there is no story) than to seek each other and kiss each other. It is a shame that an interesting aesthetic sentence that has almost no dialogue is completely wasted in a movie, rather than making any effort to examine the psychology of its characters with some dignity and achieve true emotional resonance. In addition, he pretends to be an "art" film, using the worst naive clich√©s of cinematic snobbery. But if someone can identify with his heavy banality, that's fine.
