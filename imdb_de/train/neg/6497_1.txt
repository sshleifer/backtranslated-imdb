I really had high hopes in this movie, so I took what salt was and hoped for the best. About 1/3 of the entire film run, I just had to give up, the film is just a mish-mash of material that happens for no apparent reason and everything is not interconnected. I love movies that make you think, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas that were thrown together and never really connected. Do not think that David Lynch-esquire is anywhere near this kingdom, except for a few trippy visuals. To say that it is artistic to disguise the fact that there is no obvious plot or story is just one way or justification why you have wasted the 1.5 hours in the movie. The show was good, but that can not save a dearth of history. I agree with the one comment that was previously posted ... "It's like being in another person's head ... while they're taking drugs," in other words, nothing makes sense.
