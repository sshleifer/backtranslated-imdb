A battleship sinks ... Its survivors hanging from a nearby life raft sit there and do nothing while we sit in their heads for a series of long flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Even though Noel Coward's name is just one thing you'll notice during the credits, all that's cinematic in it is because of Lean. And technically it is very good. David Lean KNEW movies from the beginning. There are many moments when Coward's studied dialogue takes second place and Lean's visual sense is central. Try that the soldiers leave the ship in the end, and this whole scene; The tracking to the song of the anthem, the scene in which we are in a house being bombed. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He is totally made of wood and shows neither emotions nor character or humanity. You can see in his eyes that he does not really listen to what the other performer says, he just waits for them to finish so he can rip his own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. <Br /> <br /> It's episodic, a bit repetitive, and the flashbacks overwhelm the story: there's no central story that drives them, but gives general insights into the characters. Still, it's an interesting movie worth seeing - and a good debut for Lean. It's not a very profound or penetrating movie and definitely a propaganda movie, but it's also a showcase for Lean's cutting art - it's all about how the pieces are put together.
