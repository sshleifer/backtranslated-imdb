Put simply, this is a simple and one-dimensional movie. The title "Ascension to Evil" should tell you that this will not try to do anything deep or do much with Hitler's character. Rather, from the first few minutes of the film, in which Baby Hitler looks evil with evil music in the background, a look at Hitler is presented, who presents him as Cartoony Supervillian, who is apparently torn directly from a television series on Saturday morning. The movie really wants to say that Hitler was evil, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil? After all, it's so boring and confusing to turn him into such a one-dimensional evil character (you have to wonder how the incompetent, phsykotic character in the film can ever make a nation follow him or be considered Time's Man of the Year). , This film had a great opportunity to record a character who has committed some of the most terrible acts of the 20th century and to try to immerse himself in his thoughts. Instead, it's basically just, "Hey, Hitler was bad, I just thought you'd like to know ..." over and over again. The great irony is that the film was still attacked because it made the character too sympathetic. Give me a break.
