Roy Rogers and his company are trying to bring "Sintown" back to life - it's a ghost town booming with successful silver mining. Andy Devine (as a "cookie") beats around. Jane Frazee (as Carol) loses a piece of her bitches to Mr. Roger's sharp smile. Foy Willing and the riders of the Purple Sage Stand-In (or is that sung?) For the A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the sons of the pioneers. James Finlayson (from the Laurel and Hardy films) complements the slapstick look of Grand Canyon Trail. A loose bottom plate delivers the winning comedy performance. Mr. Devine's mule steps on his heels. There are also energetic human performances - but the material is not great. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney - Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
