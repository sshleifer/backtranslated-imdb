: Spoiler: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with Love's Abiding Joy. I had waited a long time, and finally got the chance when it aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three "Love" movies, but this movie was not what I thought. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were many miscarriages and the editing was very bad - for many scenes out of context. I also believe that the death of Baby Kathy happened soon and Clark's appearance in the movie just did not seem to fit. It seemed as if none of the actors really wanted to be there - all emotions were lacking. There did not seem to be any interaction between Missie and Willie. <br /> <br /> I think screenwriters should have kept more of the book. It seems like every movie that has been shot so far is getting further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean, in the movie they never mentioned anything about the mine and the two guys or Clark hurting themselves. And I think Missie's and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard instead of just being heard. <br /> <br /> Of the four films that have been shot so far, I must say that the love of love remains my least favorite. I hope the next four movies will follow more of the book and if Clark's character is in them, I hope he has a bigger role and I hope his role is not so bland. I also hope there's more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty, but who knows what the scriptwriters will have in store next.
