I give five out of ten points. All five points are for Hendrix, who delivers a very decent amount of his material for the last day. Unfortunately, the quality of the camera work and the cut is very daunting! We have countless full-face shots of Hendrix, where he could do almost anything, maybe even pee? We do not see his hands on the guitar, that's what it's about! We also got a lot of footage of Hendrix from behind? There seem to be three cameras on Hendrix, but all amateurs do it all. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be anxious to walk lazily across the stage, as if Hendrix on guitar is a mere distraction. While the guy afterwards relies more on a few chicks in the stands than actually documenting the incredible guitar work that bleeds the amplifiers (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider). Wandering through the tracks are student losers, who protest against Vietnam, etc. on tracks like Machine Gun, complete film waste! If Hendrix lived for another two years, Berkeley would be one of those things that would never have seen the light of day for full official release. The only gem it contains is the incredible Johnny B Good, but all in a rather poor visual document of the big man, which is inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight
