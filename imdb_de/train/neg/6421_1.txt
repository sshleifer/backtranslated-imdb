I am amazed at the reviews of this film. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is awful. The plot is extremely lazy. It's not scary either. People out there who think that because of Sarah Stars Geller, somehow it's like The Grudge forgetting. This movie is more like Dark Water, only it is more predictable and slower than it is. I was extremely disappointed with this movie. It did not scare or interest me. Let's face it, this type of conspiracy was beaten to death at this stage. the dead trying to connect with the living - dragonfly, what lies beneath, ghost story, dark water, darkness, change, etc. It seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films today are the Japanese and the Koreans are. The movies that come from Hollywood are cynical exercises in making money without respect for the viewer. They are simply rolled out
