First three words: READ THE BOOK! Really guys - that shows the difficulty of a true rendition of esoteric things. I loved the book and was totally disappointed with the movie. It was ridiculous, with half a heart and history poorly explained. The novel - in the first place! - should not focus on an adventure! That's just the environment. In the film, the focus is exactly on that and the message has taken a back seat! In addition, the visual effects were to show the energy of all living things, and the enlightenment of the events in the end were economical! They messed up! ... I will never see it again!
