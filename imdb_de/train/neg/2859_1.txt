It was produced in 2007 and the CG is bad for a movie that was shot in 1998. Part of the movie is a stop-motion shot of a dinosaur that actually looks good, but that makes the extremely amateurish work on the CG footage even worse. <br /> <br /> Writing, acting, directing and everything else in this movie is just awful. That's as bad as, if not worse, than Raptor Island and 100 million BC. ... pure crap! As with the other films, the only scary thing about this movie is that it was actually made and is now being broadcast on the sci-fi channel. <br /> <br /> I still can not understand what they look like. Get people who have some acting skills to act in these films, and then somehow make them feel as awful as anyone else in the movie are. <br /> <br /> For those who are unsure, the other poster is obviously being sarcastic in its review ... or he's one of the people who worked on this movie.
