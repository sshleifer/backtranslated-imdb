Ever heard of a Taiwanese horror movie? Or a Taiwanese movie? Probably for a reason. This was really boring, though it has black magic, including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels. <br /> <br /> After reading other people's thoughts, I was looking forward to violence and bloody, but there is not much at all. Blood and other lame things, if you wait for graphic flashes or cruel effects you will be disappointed. Apparently they did not use the eel explosion and other things to their maximum efficiency. <br /> <br /> Pretty nothing good about this movie; a single character who was not completely bland and some black spells like the eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect did not work at all, the scariest was an albino girl (not really scary). This is the worst Asian horror movie I have ever seen.
