Yes, unfortunately I came across the DVD and found that it was incredibly awful. <br /> <br /> First of all, suck the characters. I mean, come on, if a dork in an orange hat calling himself "Orange Sherbert" is the best creative idea these guys are looking for a character, then they definitely should not be in the movie scene. Bad "costumes", bad "interviews", and basically there is no "wrestler" on this CD with charisma. <br /> <br /> The "Wrestling" of Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing but these idiots jumping softly and playfully together on a trampoline. They also make sure that they giggle with each other all the time and that the experience looks more like a toddler game than a "wrestling death match". <br /> <br /> Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a rather listless backyard wrestling clone. Instead of blood, guns, chaos and WRESTLING, we only get a trampoline, giggling kids, awful audio and a guy called Orange Sherbert. Wrestling fan or not, avoid this DVD. It is terrible.
