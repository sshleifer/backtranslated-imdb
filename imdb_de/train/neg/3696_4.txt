Normally, I would have given this movie a 6. He deals with a very important topic and does it relatively well - despite Katie Wright, which in and of itself is already a feat. I do not know if she was. Actually, she was instructed to play the character like this or is of course irritating, but she really did a great job of making it impossible for me to care for Lexi. There is no dimension for her except how confused, helpless and helpless she is and how good she is at whimpering. I can understand that a young girl blaming herself for the loss of his girlfriend, whose eating disorder is out of control, is desperate, frightened, and painful. However, all of Wright's performance is based on continual lamentation and drizzle while the rest are whining. I could not help feeling that this girl's problem was not caused by the demon Bulimia but by the absence of a spine. I very much doubt that this is the point the movie should make.
