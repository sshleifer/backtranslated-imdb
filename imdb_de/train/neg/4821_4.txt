Feature Film (he lists for a story, though he has a "documented" credit) about a group of scientists going into the wilds of Canada to find a Bigfoot device). It's a lot of scientific hocus-pocus mixed in a really boring movie by a group of people wandering around in the wild. There are some attempts to create tension and anxiety, but to be honest, there's nothing worth seeing here except great wildlife shots. This is a perfect definition of a commercial that promises you so much to catch a glimpse of Bigfoot, but in reality it does little. Only recommended for insomnia
