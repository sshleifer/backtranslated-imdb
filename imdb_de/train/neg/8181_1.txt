I saw this movie at the Mar del Plata Festival (Argentina) (actually, I saw Family Portraits, which includes Cutting Moments + 2 more short films by Douglas Buck). After the first half of Cutting Moments I had to cover my eyes and take a look every now and then. When it was over, my stomach was upside down and I felt reckless. I had left the cinema just minutes after the second short start (by the way, of course I was not the only one left the room). WAAAAY was too violent and disgusting for me! I'm impressed by the many brave people who really loved it. I just do not understand how you can love this kind of movies! The shocking, bloody and terrible pictures I saw stayed in my head for two days !! I also try to analyze the story (my friend saw the whole thing and told me about it), and I just do not think it makes sense. I mean, this amount of violence and stuff does not make sense other than trying to shock people. And that's not a good reason, I think. There's absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say "Well, at least 'x' was good." But I think I'll never understand this kind of movies.
