When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought the movie could not fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it. <br /> <br /> We were misled Crystal's character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film. Sure, he made some good jokes, but as a character, he did not take anything but space. <br /> <br /> And poor Julia Roberts. In past shows she plays as a strong-willed, self-determined woman. In this movie she seems to be completely suppressed and had very little fire. This is not Julia Roberts, who likes to see my wife. <br /> <br /> OK, if I found a good cause, it would have to be Christopher Walken. That's entertainment. But just like Billy Crystal, little of his character is shown. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of mindless laughter with a very low salary, look at them. If you're looking for a smart, romantic comedy, this is not your movie. It's none of that.
