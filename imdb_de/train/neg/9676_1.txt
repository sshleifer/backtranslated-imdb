Movies have always put me to sleep, but no film has ever done that twice, so I needed three sessions to finish it. The dialogue was bad. Women spoke quiltily and the men were cartoons. And two of the supposedly Japanese women looked Chinese, had Chinese names, and spoke with distinctly Chinese accents. I'm still trying to figure out why Emmental men were sexually involved. 10 minus 8 1/2 is a difficult choice: do I give this movie a rating of one? or two? <br /> <br /> Films used to put me to sleep, but this has never been done twice before, so it took me three sessions to finish the movie.
