I do not know why, but after all the hype about NPR, I thought this was a new movie. The best material was used for BBC documents and NatGeo projects you've seen when you're into nature programs ... it's been compiled with juicy narrative and overdramatic music for Disney to use Earth Day. There are great moments, and it is always nice to listen to Darth Vader ... oops, ... ......... James Earl Jones speaks, but I was hoping for a groundbreaking film, given the new camera technology used in creating this movie, you can actually see better material for free on youtube ... I think we're due for something as groundbreaking as Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie definitely is not
