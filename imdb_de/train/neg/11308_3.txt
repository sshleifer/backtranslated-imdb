<br /> <br /> Get your Brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action movie. Speakman's remarkable tempo skills (nice spin kicks, decent sticks - bad couch!) Is the only redeeming quality of a movie that screams only bad action. The plot is not half as bad; just run pretty badly. But if you see this movie for anything other than martial arts, you miss the boat completely. And for a movie to take place in Koreatown, far too few Korean actors (even extras).
