What else can be said about this film other than "watching the audience". Christmas Evil should come with a warning sign like cigarettes, as this damages eyes and ears. I'm rarely so unhappy with a "b" horror movie, but this movie did not even scare a five-year-old. The point of a ruthless maniac thirsting for blood in a movie is that he / she should look almost godlike, as if nothing could stop his anger, but in this movie the psychopath is stuck in a chimney in a chimney. A bizarre attempt to surprise next victim, and of course the ever-popular legend of Santa Claus. It reminds the viewer that this man is by no means dangerous because he is way too stupid to be dangerous. All in all a waste of film.
