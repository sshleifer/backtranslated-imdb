I like Jane Austin novels. I love books and movies with pride and prejudice, sense and sensuality, and I'm halfway through Mansfield Park. But I did not like Emma. I gave up the book after two chapters, and at the end of the film I was no less interested in Emma. She did not seem to change at all. Maybe it was the acting of Paltrows (which was so great in Se7en) or my lack of interest in the movie. No idea. <br /> <br /> The costumes are nice, but the dancing was awkward compared to Pride and Prejudice by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> I basically gave him a 2 for Knightly damn great, and although it was a rather mixed appearance for Ewan McGregor, I liked his singing.
