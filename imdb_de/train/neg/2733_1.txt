I debated whether to tick the spoiler box or not. Since 99% of this show has probably already been seen by every Scrubs successor, it's probably not one of the spoilers. <br /> <br /> Clip shows. Grrr. We all knew that friends went down the tube when they started to do clip shows ... and after five and a half years in Scrubs they fell down that hole. I have to wonder if it all works Writers just could not bother this week and said, "Let's show the other funny stuff." It did not work. <br /> <br /> For beginners, it's not funny to show that people have fallen off. It's not funny to see Todd dangling from his banana hammock, unless we know why he dangled on his banana hammock. Another was not his fantasy, though I forgot what. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is completely forgotten. We've seen all these things before. And the collection of dancers? Why? That's not funny. <br /> <br /> Finally I have to admit that in my last compilation two of my favorite Scrubs moments were shown ... Cox realized that Ben died ... and JD told him how proud he is. <br /> <br /> But seeing those moments again did not save the episode. The summary says it all. <br /> <br /> Worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, PLEASE do not let your show run like friends, keep it fresh, make it funny ... or wrap it up.
