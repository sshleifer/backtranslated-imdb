Dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and leads to murder and chaos. Violent sexy Milligan at home. Slightly better than a home movie (like many Milligans movies), this is a journey into the depravity style of the 1960s. Notable for its luscious nudity and sex, this movie is neither sexy nor cruel and now plays rather quaint (though decidedly r-rated). The film suffers from its uneven cast and cheap production. (No one was ever sure where the money was spent on his films because he was always broke). It's a bad, bad movie that's not worth seeing except as a Milligan Completeist or because it has some good-looking people fooling around.
