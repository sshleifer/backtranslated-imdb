Primal Species comes from the B Movie legend Roger Corman. Therefore, anyone who observes this must realize that it is a low-budget B-movie that knows it. <br /> <br /> A bunch of terrorists and a truck kill an entire army, they believe it contains uranium, but no ..... It contains two Dino's who have a taste for Human Flesh. Then a cracking team, which might as well be called Delta Force, is called. <br /> <br /> OK, this is not Jurassic Park, and yes, the Dino's are never clearly seen because it's obviously a guy in a costume that's not too different from Barney the Dinosaur - just a bit Less frightening, but come on guys this had about 1% of the budget of Jurassic Park and as such it does what it can. <br /> <br /> Does it deserve to be among the 100th? .... HELL NO !!! I think that almost half of the voters who award this 1 are way too harsh, much more than a 4. This is actually much better than a whole bunch of other films that are not in the bottom 100, and has a similar one Production value like sci-fi channel production. (Again, movies that get too hard by critics on IMDb.) <br /> <br /> The drama is as expected in a B-movie, though none of the actors take it so seriously, and also the script <br /> not <br /> All in all it's an entertaining B-movie - nothing for movie snobs <br /> <br /> ** *****
