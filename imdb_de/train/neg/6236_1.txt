This movie was the most line-drawn and generously fed movie I've ever seen in my life. (Except Farenheit 9/11). All information was supported only in the view of FIVE scientists, while 80% of the Assosiated Press highly criticized Gore's sponsored science. Global warming is a mass media hysteria and nothing more. Most of the information in the film was either misquoted or incorrect. This film was repeatedly researched and evidence was shown that his lies were nothing more than lies. An idea that they are showing this at school proves that the media has brainwashed us to believe this garbage!
