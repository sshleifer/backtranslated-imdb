Boston Legal has turned his tail and is focused on the barn door and the pork trash that created it! When this show premiered almost four seasons ago, it was a humorous blow to the legal system that all actors seem to be proud of. It was funny, varied and partly factual. The sitter was acceptable and to some extent real in her depictions. The sexual commentary and the activity were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is and has been as beautiful as in other shows she has participated in, but she is now drawn into the deeper depths of media programming of sex and violence. Julie is a great actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois is an outstanding actor who has maintained himself in the entertainment sector since the days of "Benson" until this production and always shows the humor and respectfulness of the production. Captain Kirk "is". Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and can be admired for her continuation in this production. She is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt about his acting ability, but he should return to his XXX origins like "Crash" as he seems to have a lot of talent and inclination in that direction. We demand that this series be discarded as already and really start to smell !!!
