If a man who has no Alzheimer's can not remember how many movies he has made, he's probably the most prolific director in the world. This man is Jesus Franco, the king of the so-called Eurotrash. His 1980s film Devil Hunter is literally hurry, obscure, stupid, lazy, and exploitative (the title of the film is misleading at first) like any other Franco movie I've ever seen. That sounds pretty awful, and it's ... But Franco has an inimitable sensitivity, a generous way with the bald-headed, with nudity and violence and even with his stupid cheap cut that tries to pave the way for the extreme Hast, with whom all his films were made. The mixture of all these elements will make you romp your movies, even if you usually wait for them to end because they are so boring. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is almost incomprehensible for half an hour. The abduction by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or movie star is associated with a number of natives in South America. There is plenty of naked wind, dancing and endless repeated zooming on an ugly totem pole. You need to get used to the repetitive zoom-ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot three times in a row, as these are Franco's main ways of extending a movie to the length of the feature. <br /> <br /> The monster that looks like a totem pole is really scary. He has rough beetle eyes and his presence on the soundtrack is always signaled by kakophones groaning, which seems to have been recorded in an echo chamber. At the beginning of the piece, he is chewing on a local woman strapped to a tree, and it's hard to know what's really going on here, but I think he ate her belly (or her genitals, sweet Jesus!). <br /> <br /> However, the adventure begins right when an exiled guy and his freaky Vietnamese veterinarian are sent to the island to rescue the white girl from the kidnappers. The Flakey guy has an accent that's what he calls half Brooklyn American, half English Liverpudlian, and all left behind. All the dialogues and syncs are ridiculous and ridiculous, and provide another layer of the movie that can kind of spark your interest. <br /> <br /> Not too much happens from here, and it happens quite lethargically, with the odd bit of outrage like a rape. The nebulous action is stamped by 360 degrees of nudity from the natives and the two female leads and even the monster itself (haha!). Running around with his penis exposed makes wrestling an unappetizing prospect for the hard hero, but it has to happen at some point, and it's nice to know that the director shows everyone's genitals in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The best feature of Devil Hunter is filming locations. Franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and historical aspects of filmmaking, but he does not play with sets. You get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen. This is something that is really cool to experience these days with crappy CGI sets and backgrounds to nausea. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, questions of recommendation regarding this film seem questionable. If you're trying to see all the video nasties, you'll have to look at this at some point, and you'll be as restless as me. If you like Franco, you'll see it anyway. If you do not fall into any of the above categories, you probably will not find this movie. Copies of it are not just lying around and I can hardly recommend searching. It's Franco. Lazy, crazy Franco.
