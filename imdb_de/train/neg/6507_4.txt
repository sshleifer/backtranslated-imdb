You know this will be a cheesy movie if: <br /> <br /> 1. It was made in the 50's. It is in black and white. 3. It has no name actors! 4. Screaming makes up for the lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Not to be outdone - this film brilliantly turned all four of the above elements into a cinematic flaw. <br /> <br /> Okay - shhhhh, but I'll be discussing special effects here - or the lack of them. <br /> <br /> Did you capture the underwater scenes? It looks like it was badly filmed through an aquarium - note the cape blowing in the wind. <br /> <br /> And the repeated reuse of stock footage (exterior shots of the houses, the bridge scenes - great) KRAF-Tiness of this movie - not since "PLAN 9" - I have seen such creative use of footage. <br /> <br /> And where there was a lack of special effects - do not worry - screaming also makes room for special effects in this movie. Yes, this movie has even cleverly used the old hacking trick. <br /> <br /> Grab the popcorn - put your head on stun (several fermented drinks definitely help) and ask yourself: why the hell did they put this back on film? <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
