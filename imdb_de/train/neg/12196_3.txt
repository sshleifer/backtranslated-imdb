The actors did a really good job - especially the mother. However, as the film progressed, I saw that I saw it more as an actor, not because I cared less about people. And sometimes I felt irritated by the irresponsible and intrusive approach to education, which was shown time and again. The daughter is a 17-year-old flat prostitute whose main concern is to dress famous men and become a dancing nymph (complete with "booty shaking"). The son is a man of low self-esteem who is very desperate for a relationship and friends - so much so that he celebrates a drug party late in the movie. The husband and wife are bored, but instead of putting energy into their boring relationship, they would rather seek new partners (though the woman chooses bad because the man she is "throwing" on is randomly gay - OOPS!) , I just felt ALL characters had to grow up, and I found it difficult to do such shallow tricks. I think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and emptiness of the capitalist system. However, since these characters are NOT typical of the average Western family, it seems disingenuous.
