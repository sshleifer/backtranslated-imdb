This picture reminds me of a picture of Keneth More from 1957 titled "The Admirable Crighton," when he was a servant on the boat and became a master on the island, and when he was rescued he returned to servants when no picture shows that Madonna can not play, is this this. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this was a subtle copy of "The Admirable Crighton", but it certainly looks like If it does, then Hollywood has to run out of ideas, and that's saddening Providing actors with a platform to improve their careers, and that fails at every turn and every detail. <br /> <br /> The plot is casual and the acting is mediocre. The script would have had to be dragged through the shredder before it was shot on location. While many here have canned Madoona for all their acting, I think that in movies like "A League of Own Own" was quite good and enjoyable and "Who's That Girl" showed a bizarre Madonna's style that is not shown before or after , Other Madonna movies are not so enjoyable and I would have liked to see a Madonna animation series with the character of "Who's That Girl". I like the music from these two movies, but "swept away" down here on the stack will stay that way. <br /> <br /> Everyone has a bomb right?
