This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm not joking. Next time I will keep my head running against a wall. It would be more pleasant for me to sit in an emergency room and try to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen than trying to make it through this movie again so badly a project. They are both good comedians, so I was shocked that this was so unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If they had to do it all over again, I'm pretty sure they would choose not to. The people who faced the money must have lost a ton. Not really - because the special effects (all 2) were awful.
