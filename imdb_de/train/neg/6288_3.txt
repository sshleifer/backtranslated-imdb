After reading a lot of comments here, I'm surprised that nobody recognized this as an oversized remake of a 1960's Twilight Zone episode entitled "Mirror Image" starring Vera Miles. Rod Serling has done much better in creating a powerful, scary story in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis did in 88 minutes with this boring snooze. A short piece may be effective with a mysterious and inexplicable ending, but in a feature film there should be some more substance and the story should make sense. Content and meaning are unfortunately two things that are missing "The Broken". Yes, it does have a few moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some more observations: Although this is clearly a contemporary story, none of the characters in the movie has a cell phone! And although a car crash is the event that gets the story going, there's never any indication of an insurance company, the person driving the other car, or the police asking for a report. My tip: Skip this hole and see the original instead!
