This movie was awful. I was so emotionally uninterested in each character that the movie's biggest opponent was me. I played it nicely everywhere; I promised myself I would go away, but just drink another beer, hoping it would automatically turn into something enchanting on the way. Even in this state, I could not help but notice that Cuba's acting was as weak as tracing paper. His obsessive commitment to his job was not convincing, as was his only nocturnal shock at the failure of his own idiots. Burt appeared on the screen as a general, that's right, a general (who wears too much makeup). I fell at a frighteningly fast pace to compete with Cuba unless mine was real and I squeezed my toe. Reward! Forget my booted toe!
