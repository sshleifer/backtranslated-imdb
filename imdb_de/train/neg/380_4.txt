I wonder if there is any meaning in this movie. It's a big joke. Good .. It's entertaining .. You see the stupidest action that is very seriously played in the form of a movie. I wonder to which target group this film is basically directed. <br /> <br /> Priety (a Pros) plays a surrogate mother for a happy couple Salman / Rani who wants a child but can not. I wonder what it would be like if this drama from the life of a real couple was a real start. <br /> <br /> Rani seems to be happy with another pretty woman in her house, who was being used to give birth to a baby and Salman. She takes care of piety and tries to urge her husband Salman to Preity so they can have romance. When will the audience of Salmans Nakhras get full? <br /> <br /> Although it's a good past, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.
