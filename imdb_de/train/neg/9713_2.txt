I saw Cold Case for the first time after running on Danish TV for about a year. By the time he came to the television, he had nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other American crime shows broadcast at about the same time. The inferior actors with self-righteous faces and morality were a pain in the butt. The whole premise that so much money was made available to a team of investigators to solve 10-20-30 or even 60 year murder cases seems so unlikely-60 minutes to tell the story, which means That they have recently been breached to solve the case and bring justice to the surviving family members, if they are still alive. Combined with the "personal" problems and relationships of the investigators for whom it is time to leave the show, this is a completely listless moment. That's really the only reason to look at it ... which of course you will not do, because this is too lame, a reason to look at this crap.
