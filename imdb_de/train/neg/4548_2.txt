Boring. Minimal plot. No character development. I have presented this movie with high expectations for the book. It COULD have been a great movie. It COULD probably have become a cult classic. No, it was a huge disappointment. It was poorly staffed and had terrible special effects. It was hard to determine who the bad guys were: the rebels or the military or the church or all? I'm still confused by certain mini-plots from the movie. I am amazed at certain aspects of this so-called "prophecy," which is never really fully explained. I felt like I saw a crazy episode of a miniseries on the sci-fi channel. It looked very much like a TV movie. Do not look at this movie. It's a waste of time AND money.
