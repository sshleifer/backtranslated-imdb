102 Dalmatians (2000, dir. Kevin Lima) Cruella de Vil (Close) is released from prison and wants to start a new life in life. It's good for Cruella, who's busy helping homeless dogs get off the street. When the clock strikes Big Ben, it gets bad. The hypnotic cure is reversed and Cruella is back, and this time she is determined to make the spotted mantle she always wanted to film. Every scene with her is worth watching in this boring sequel, which is more of a replay of the previous film than a new story. <br /> <br /> She has changed. ?? Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)
