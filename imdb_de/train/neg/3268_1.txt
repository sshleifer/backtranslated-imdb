It's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby that's devoured by feral canines and the mother is wrongfully charged with murder, but against all odds this succeeds. Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life, melodramatic, reworked, but with this weird genius that makes you laugh even when a mother struggles with the ultimate horror. <br /> <br /> If comedies about having children eaten by dogs are not, your cup may be inconvenient to you if you look at this, and yes, it's a weird choice of subject for a farce, though Really very little of the movie has anything to do with it, as it matters to give Streep a showcase for her Australian accent facial contortions. <br /> <br /> When dealing with media bias, sensationalism and disregard for either truth or ethics, the film can muster the courage to make these things bad.
