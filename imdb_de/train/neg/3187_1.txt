From the star of "MITCHELL", from the director of "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are headlines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie. And the worst thing is that all the above statements are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats every five minutes in this movie. It's like a bad remake of "Coogan's Bluff"
