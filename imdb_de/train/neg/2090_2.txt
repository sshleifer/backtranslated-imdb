I know that it should not be BSG and I can master slow shows if they are interesting, but I find myself totally uninterested and bored with this series. The formula for BSG seemed to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> The formula for Caprica seems to be: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi <br /> <br /> Maybe it's interesting from Episode 3 I can barely see it. In fact, she's at the bottom of my to-watch list for my week. This is a sad situation. The Syfi channel has really destroyed the Friday lineup. What happened to the rest days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday night? They had a good thing there.
