Some very interesting camera works and a story with a lot of potential. But it never comes together more than a thesis of a student in film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons. Faust, there is not a single sympathetic character, not even a villain we could admire for his / her chutzpah. Second, acting is terrible - even by veteran Willem DaFoe. The ham is so plentiful here, it feels like a picnic - but one of those miserable company picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get a hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat a missed hotdog and puking you. <br /> <br /> Alright, I'm a little rough on a young director who may still be in places - as I said, the camera work is pretty good. <br /> <br /> But I feel cheated - the blurb for this movie suggests that we're going to watch a "Modern Western," and there are pictures on the DVD packaging that implicate this as well Seems to know that this is the kind of movie they should do. <br /> <br /> This betrayal is what hurts; But even without it the fact that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed by the actors, the story is hopelessly confused, and in the end we do not care. <br /> <br /> I took it about halfway from the DVD player. but the rental company would not give me back my money. <br /> <br /> Well, that really hurts.
