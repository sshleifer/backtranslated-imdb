Ice-T plays Mason as a homeless African American who is chased by wealthy hunters (Rutger Hauer, Gary Busey, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham, William McNamara and John C. McGinley), however, proves to be a much harder prey then the usual goals in this ridiculous and slow actioner who takes too long to set up action scenes and then totally rob them.
