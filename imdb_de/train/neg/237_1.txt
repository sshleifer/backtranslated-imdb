After being rated entertaining by Mr. Brosnan's performance as "Kad" in "The Tailor of Panama" (which I rated a total of 10/10: casting, drama, script, story, cut, tempo, music, emotional impact, etc.) I expected this movie with enthusiasm. I was very disappointed. It's a script that is not a vulgar film to be vulgar, and bankrupt in every way is that "The Tailor of Panama" is rich and satisfying. Write guilt on the screen and direct it. I sat in the theater and waited for the "good part". It never came. I did not laugh or cry, although a line of dialogue made me smile. Worth $ 7? Barely.
