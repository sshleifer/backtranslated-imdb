This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say, I've never seen a worse movie than this !!! <br /> <br /> AND I never thought !!!! <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of "B" horror movies. As you might imagine ... I'm faced with some of the worst things the movie industry has to offer. I mean, come on ... which true horror fan would not be fascinated by a title like "Vampires vs. Zombies" ??? Pictures of the "undead" who fought with the "undead" danced in my head. I thought to myself ... "I have to see that" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well ... I'm sorry to say ... "I wish I had not seen it" !!!!! <br /> <br /> This movie title is very misleading, to say the least. There were no vampires fighting zombies. In fact, there is no conspiracy !!!! If you asked me what this movie is about, I could honestly tell you that I have no idea. <br /> <br /> There was no action !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie makes absolutely no sense !!!! <br /> <br /> At the end of this debacle ... I was sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money on this project, since they certainly have no business sense !!!
