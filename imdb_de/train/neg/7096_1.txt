It is unbelievable that it is terrible on so many levels. The script, acting, directing, and casting are all terrible. The costumes, scenery and the pseudo-medieval language are also terrible. In a strange way, I really liked this movie after I agreed that it would not be good. It seems a shame that people spend so much time and effort producing something so poor, if they could have made something decent out of the premise (though not very believable!). A story of dragons and knights, the the charm of other fantasy films is missing. Let's just hope the Lord of the Rings is a little bit better! Oh, and the haircut by David Thewlis makes him look like He-Man. It does!
