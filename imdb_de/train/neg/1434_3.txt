James Bond in the wild? Well, it looks like this: Pierce Brosnan is after all known as Bond in "Tommorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995) - both shot before this release. Honestly, the two main roles of the film are both a serious failure. Brosnan had a slightly more convincing performance, and Annie Galipeau (as a pony, Gray Owl's love interest) had to struggle with carelessly written conversations. <br /> <br /> The two aunts are perfect. But the movie is not about aunts. It's about the wilderness of the Canadian wilderness. And though the photograph may be pretty, there's no harsh impression of the harsh reality of living in the wild. Unfortunately, Annie Galipeau as a pony can not convince because I really wanted to believe in her. She was a relatively inexperienced twenty-year-old in this film, and it might have worked, but Richard Attenborough might not have been strong enough for her. It makes her vulnerable, which she is natural ... but the wrong way. <br /> <br /> But one thing is for sure, she is perfect through and through. But mascara and eyebrow thickener in the wild? It just does not fit, especially since she seems to be only ever going through forest tests with Bond (sorry, Gray Owl) and uses Photo-Ops to kiss close-ups. <br /> <br /> I've lived with forest dwellers in the Pacific Northwest, and they just do not look pretty and stay so cute while they fight for their survival. Which brings me to another point: the film does not remind us of the time in which he plays: the 1930s. I attribute the blame here largely to a flawed script that preaches at the expense of dramatic arcs, plot points, and those small details that can trigger periods through action. William Nicholson wrote the script and his latest offer "Elizabeth, the Golden Age" was opened three days ago, so I hope there is an improvement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I've read the comments others have posted, but I'm not convinced. Lots of potential, but mishandled and maybe even poorly understood. If there had been a religious movie, it would have been missed, but because it preaches environmental awareness, the film remains a bit of criticism because it is "politically correct." Sorry, I do not buy it for all that. Amen.
