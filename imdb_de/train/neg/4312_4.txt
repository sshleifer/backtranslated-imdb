This acts as a satire during the time of the women's rights movement. Of course that does not mean that COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience that you can see. It runs in the same direction as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still tame), and is basically a standard flow. What I mean for this movie to be uninteresting is easy to spot. Anyone spending their time outside of a regular job training a few lunatics who deserve the sudden victory is wasting their time. It's the same feeling that you can get after looking at it. A nice try to use the opposite sex for the duty of a man, but I expected better things.
