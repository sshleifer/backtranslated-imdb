... that would be the worst movie I have ever seen. Hmmm, OK, maybe connected to Boogeyman. Terrible, really terrible. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations and they did not succeed! I honestly can not think of a good cause. So here are the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. MAKING 2. THE PLOT 3. THE CGI (Xbox 360 has a better graphics .... really) 4. THE PLOT 5. THE DIALOG and finally .... 6. THE PLOT <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions: If they made a 2: 32-hour movie, then they realized that they did not have Lex Luthor and Superman in one When they've gotten together and forced themselves to decide for the 3-minute time, or did they really think that nobody would notice that the main hero and the villain have less screen time than Superman's son and the henchman he kills ? !! <br /> <br /> Was half of the budget spent convincing Kevin Spacey to do it? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, the doctors do not ask, "What the hell do you want us to do ?! He's a fucking alien! We do not know what his anatomy is!" ? <br /> <br /> What happened in the 5 years that Superman left to bring the technology forward for 28 years? <br /> <br /> Where did the people who wrote good reviews see the same movie? <br /> <br /> and finally: why? Just why? By the way, for those of you who wonder why Superman could lift a whole Krypyonite continent, I think I found out ... <br /> <br /> ... since Superman is untouched by kryptonite until he sees something green in the rock, it's clearly all in his head. Therefore, the thing of the continent is only he suppresses his fear of shiny green skirt ... either the author or the authors are flabby claws that do not believe that this was a pretty obvious mistake.
