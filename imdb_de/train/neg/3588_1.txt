Follow-up to "Walking Tall" from 1973 continues the real drama about Sheriff Buford Pusser in Tennessee, but this part is like a lame TV movie. Bo Svenson plays the lead role of Joe Don Baker, but he's far too lenient for the role. he comes out like a flying country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui have very little to do in the end. I would only give the film a star when it comes to its good intentions, but the script is a transparent and lazy mass of routine problems, and the production is cheap. In 1977 followed "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 the TV movie "A Real American Hero".
