Black Candles is more of a mess by the same director who brought us "Vampyres", and much later "Rest in Pieces", among other things .. I only notice those I've seen. In any case, we have a couple, and somewhere near a needle is over a voodoo doll, pierced them and the man tips over. I was not sure if it was good for everyone at the time. Fast forward to the place where the man's sister has come to the house to examine and hear the reading of the will or something similar, and of course all but her are busy with something that happens to be devil worship. It's really hard to tell who in the moments of the movie is and sometimes it gets confusing. To freshen up the whole thing, there's a simulated bestiality scene (I hope it gets simulated) with a black goat that's sure to be a crowd pleaser. Pooh. At times, this sounds like "Rosemary's Baby," minus the baby, because the hostess always gives a woman herbal tea and the place smells like some evil satanic herbs, which are also these, because that's always mentioned. But not only the herbs stink in this movie. The end seems to be back at the beginning, and many viewers may wonder where they were in the middle section. It's not unsurpassable, it just is not very good, and I think it all depends on what you like to see in movies, and there was not much here that did much for me. 3 out of 10.
