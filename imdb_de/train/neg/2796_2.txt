In most cases, On Demand delivers pretty terrible horror movies and only offers other horror movies that everyone has already seen, and already has an opinion. It was either this or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg movies) that I did not see, and I was actually in a movie mood that does not happen often, because I've been watching all the movies I own A million times, and that's a lot of movies, and I'm not very interested in new films, and boy, this movie made me regret it. I will not use any spoilers, I'm just going to tell you that only a few of the few actors in this movie are reasonably decent. I think the main girl, the dead, who kills everyone, looks very annoying, but convincing. I would take her for a psycho slut everyday, so she fits her role well, even though she is lame. The blood is not great, just a few of the killings, or I say, "wounds" are okay, but you do not see much and there are no props for the body part that make the injuries more convincing. Towards the end of the movie, I asked my friend to turn off the movie, and as a band member, the "recording" parts were not very interesting, although what happened would really happen when you take pictures. I'm done, if you want to see that, adapt.
