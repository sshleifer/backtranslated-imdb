This Cannon Movie Tale is the worst part of the series and positive proof that a five-minute fable is not a full-length movie. Poor Sid Caesar as a futile emperor looks so stupid that it's hard to watch him. As a smart tailor, Robert Morse has no charm. Even his unfortunate nephew (Jason Carter). The "songs" are terrible and slow down only what's left of the plot. The direction is virtually non-existent, and the supporting characters add very little. Lysette Anthony is pretty as the Emperor's daughter, but her voice was obviously baptized for some reason, a fate that many of the smaller players share. And the movie crawls at a snail's pace. Hans Christian Andersen had to have made purzelbisse in the grave when this appeared. To be honest, at least from this movie story, it's no surprise that it got straight into the forgetting of videos.
