Even for a weary movie model as a nature-human cycle that was so prevalent in the 1970s, ants are miserably even effective (though entertaining for reasons they did not intend). It is sooooo absurd. Apparently these ants, who are bulldozers near a tavern, have been consuming toxic waste for decades and are now adjusting to poisoning bites - hundreds of these bites are deadly. It's painfully funny to see not-so-good-but-very-bad way to see actors clumsily dropping in between tiny black spots. So many scenes look ridiculous: a boy trying to fall into a dumpster while being attacked, and Suzanne Sommers screaming in bed with terror, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathing through wallpaper pieces, Bernie Casey faking a gamba List goes on and on. The danger presented ranges from ants crawling from an outflow to black lines of ants everywhere on the walls. The cast for the film is not bad on paper, but none of those actors seem to believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy has to sit in this wheelchair because of this horror. I hope she has found a good use for the money, because it is obvious that this was the ONLY reason a woman of her pedigree would be stuck in this nonsense. Although it is a pretty bad movie, it is - once for me - visible and has many of those bad movie qualities of the seventies - startled actors who embarrass themselves, feel like TV and the dreaded creatures of nature seeking revenge smell the man. This time, man has to press his hand into a heap of ants to be hit. Really pretty awful.
