The movie was awful !!! The worst movie I have seen in recent years. One of those films that I can tell people about for the next three years is the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for giving me an answer to this burning question, "What's the worst movie you've seen?" Answer: Celestine Prophecy Trust me ... I read the book, enjoyed the news and was excited to see the movie, but then treated the audience as if we were thrilled. There is no story and this story is crippled by too much magic and chance. It's too bad they need to formulate the nine prophecies and not just weave them into a story that's entertaining. They spent no time developing the character and it was easy not to worry about whether a character died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stayed until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is also quite boring, but I enjoyed the parallels that can be seen during reading in everyday life. The film does not offer the same opportunity, and I would suggest that you do not see it if you want to keep the words of the book to your heart. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. Trust me.
