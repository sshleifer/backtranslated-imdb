This movie stinks! You will need more than two hours to get through it. Sliding Doors, with Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, have done what Melinda and Melinda are trying to do much better. This movie was smart, funny and well played. I wanted to know what happened to the two Gwyenths - or rather the characters she played - and the cast performances were awesome. <br /> <br /> Where Melinda and Melinda are tiring, the dialogue is understandable and I could do it. I did not care so much for these people - least of all Melinda. A Melinda is so dysfunctional - her first glass of wine is at 10 o'clock - and so melodramatic she is ridiculous and not in a comedic sense. The second Melinda is fine, but forgotten. Woody Allen's previous ensemble films worked because I think he spent time on the script and the actors were talented. One little thing for this movie is that he wrote this script in two months: You can say it. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented - those around her are not enough to be a full presence. The film ends with Chloe Sevigny and some other people you know you've seen in other films but can not remember. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
