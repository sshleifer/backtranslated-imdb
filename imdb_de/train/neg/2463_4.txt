I do not know how to describe this movie. It's definitely one of the craziest movies I've seen in a long time. It is sometimes very disturbing, but boring elsewhere. The scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and can attract anyone who is in Gore & Splatter. In some of the above scenes, I held my teeth in my hand. The smart thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and The Dentist is therefore quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> The movie's humor is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. But if you're a fan of weird and strange conversation and getting teeth to drill, this is the movie you were looking for. <br /> <br /> If you read the comment and are somehow attracted to this kind of entertainment, give it a try! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a bit too weird for my liking)
