Maybe it's the dubbing, or maybe it's the endless scenes of people crying, moaning or otherwise going on, but I've found that Europe '51 is one of the most revamped (and therefore most annoying) movies I have ever seen have ever seen. The film starts off promisingly when he's familiar, as Mother Ingrid Bergman is too busy spending time with her spoiled son of a son (Sandro Franchina). While Mom and Dad (the dull Alexander Knox) ​​entertains their guests at a dinner party, the boy tries to kill himself by initiating a life-changing series of events in which Bergman finds time to pity the poor and Needy to take a shower. Driven by communist newspaper editor Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she soon spends more time with the oppressed than with her husband, who soon arrives at a madhouse for her troubles. Bergman plays the sacred role and reflects on her role as Jeanne d'Arc in 1948, and Rossellini does a fantastic job of illuminating and filming them as best as possible. Unfortunately, the screenwriting hammered with clashed subtlety as Andrea and Mom alternately declaim Marxist and Christian platitudes. At the last tear-touched scene, I had more than enough of those annoying characters. A real step for Rossellini as he moved away from neorealism and continued to embrace the mythical and mystical themes of the flowers of Saint Francis of the 1950s.
