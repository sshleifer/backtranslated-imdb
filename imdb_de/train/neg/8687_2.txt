If anti-Bush jokes are really easy to do, such a show should better make sure that it has something special. When it comes down to it, children's versions of political personalities who make jokes about the future that they do not have yet are simply nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush are well done, but Dick Cheney mostly mumbles. There is also Condoleeza Rice, who for some reason has had a crush on Bush, and Donald Rumsfeld, who is not at all like Donald Rumsfeld at all. Democratic characters rarely give their names, so it's a mystery who else could be except Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. The episodes have coherent stories, but that's not enough to keep that from happening.
