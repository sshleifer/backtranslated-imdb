The worst movie ever !!! Please have a look at the real-movie reviews of the pros in this movie. Check out Rotten Tomatoes on the Web for some independent, independent reviews of this movie. The comments on this page seem to come from people with a financial interest in the movie. I find the positive comments very misleading. I find it amazing how negative the negative comments against this film are and the positive comments sound like an Oscar speech. Do not waste your hard-earned money !!!!!! This movie has been left !! I can not believe such a movie would ever be made. Why would Hollywood waste its time with so much garbage? This movie is not trying. I wonder what Locker would actually lose so much money by producing so much garbage. I went to the blockbuster and the clerk even told us not to waste time or money. I did not listen and wasted my time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! It really is the "worst movie ever made!"
