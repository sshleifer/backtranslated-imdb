An uninspired direction leaves a decent cast in a handsome, but threadbare adaptation in which the dialogue is recited rather than felt by the heart, and the ghostly apparitions of ghosts do not round off any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward wobbles as a Ghost of Christmas Present on stilts and seems to give an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As C. Scrooge, George C. Scott is too weird, and he never seems to really believe what robbed his performance of its effect. The scenes in which he has shown his past seem like he is half-heartedly leafing through his family album. Nobody else seems to be trying, except Frank Finlay, who overreacts chronically.
