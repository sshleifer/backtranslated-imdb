This series was CBS Networks answer to the success of the Big Valley. It was a 90 minute western like the ABC program. Although it was an answer, it did not have the makings to make it last season. <br /> <br /> The problem was really lost reality in this show. For example, in one episode Johnny gets his eye pricked out with a stick. Amazingly, Johnny was completely healed at the end of the show. Besides, the stories were not as strong as The Big Valley. <br /> <br /> This is a show I do not want DVDs for and I hope they will never be released. Remember, since CBS runs out of lots, they have reused many familiar settings. This was one of the last western series CBS produced, as Western was not really popular in the 1970s.
