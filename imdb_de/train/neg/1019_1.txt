Before I saw this movie, I honestly heard that many people said this movie was a shame. I did not believe that Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took on roles in this movie and looked at them myself. Apparently they were right. I was really disappointed and wondered all the time during the movie - why the hell did I watch this movie. Of course, I did not expect much from Justin, as he really does not belong in the movie / theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop wondering why they were ready to join Edison. To be honest, their roles are pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, you may think, if the players are shit, then I should pay more attention to the story. It is indeed a story that forms the core of a movie, but guys ... trust me ... this is not a movie you want to honor for its story. Imagine, an intelligent journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learned from his boss (Morgan Freeman) how to become a "real" journalist. All this was supported by an agent who still has a heart for justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). In the end, they defeated the system with a happy ending story. <br /> <br /> Jeez, I could not even keep going. Just thinking about the movie makes me sick. My advice guys, do not look at this! Please save money and time for another movie.
