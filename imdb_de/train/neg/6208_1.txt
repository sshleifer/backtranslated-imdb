There is only one word for this movie. Terrifying The director clearly has talent, but like his character Robert Carmichael he throws everything away. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has potential, but like Cray, he can not deal with it. Cray's vision of British youth is to be involved in a small crime and then to go to corruption. Like the British tabloids, this film shows young people without pretensions and respect. Cray screams for attention, but does not deserve it. <br /> <br /> I was appalled by the violence Cray made to the onlookers. He assumes that the audience does not know the atrocities of the world. Like a piece of obscene graffiti on a toilet wall, it shows us male depravity with youthful joy. <br /> <br /> Some quality actors have small parts in this movie. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville make short appearances. Acting is otherwise amateur, the young men Joe and Ben are scared. Carmichael, played by Daniel Spencer, is scary. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, the attractive wife of celebrity chef Jonathon (Michael Howe); How she could undergo such an examination is inconceivable. The film is never subtle, and Monica is treated with the most violent violence interrupted by warfare. War pictures are used to convey the idea that young men can not help themselves, that acts of violence will occur even in "civilized" countries. This is certainly true and symptomatic of our changing society in which men take an increasingly unimportant position, but Cray descends to the level of barbaric men he seeks to uncover through his use of such brutal and violent images. The female characters of the film do not offer any relief. They are either victims or, in Manville's case, a washed-out mother. The community is shown as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> This is Crays first movie. I heard what he had to say during a question and answer session in Edinburugh, and he is not unintelligent, he just has no experience and his film reveals his naivety. The movie is expected to be released later this year, but I hope the company goes bankrupt because the public really does not need this kind of messed-up material.
