That really does not agree with Castle of Cagliostro. Lupine is not that funny or crazy or hyperactive. The scenery and the music are not inspired and the plot is just not interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this 'Un' is the nakedness (only in the unabridged version) of Fujiko. It helped to spice up some of the boring scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some fantastic set pieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very lively or appealing. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen do not even enjoy proper sideshow entertainment this time around. It is as if they had fulfilled a contractual obligation by the appearance. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full screen with Dolby stereo sound. There are a lot of extras, including some trailers. But a strange thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed after inserting the player. However, you can still use the remote control to jump to the next scene number.
