I've seen a screener from last year's award season, did not really know why they spent it after the end of the poll, but whatever, maybe at least for the exposure, but the movie was a tangled mess. Sure, some parts were funny in a black way, but none of the characters felt very real to me. There was not a single person I could connect to, and I think I failed. Sure, the plot is interesting and very subversive in Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... let's see if that has not been broken down to futility. The whole ordeal feels fake, from the lighting, the casting, the script, to the terrible visual effects (which I can say is what is supposedly intended, and anyone can do it, no one laughs with you). Anyway, I hope it at least appears for sale on DVD. I would not wish for a project in which many people obviously try very hard to go completely unnoticed. But either way. Boring tripe to.
