Apparently, the people who wrote the back of the box did not bother looking at this so-called "movie". They described "blindly choreographed intrigues and violence". I saw no "intrigue". Instead, I saw a miserable dialogue attempt in an alleged kung fu movie. I have not seen any "violence". At least, I did not see anything that could make me expose my unbelief, which could hurt a man with "impenetrable" skin - but here I may expose too much of the "conspiracy". As a spectator of many and various films (which occasionally include a kung fu film), I can authoritatively assert that this piece of celluloid is unsurpassable. Whatever you want to do, I will always stay <br /> <br /> Correct, <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> P.S. The choreography did not dazzle me.
