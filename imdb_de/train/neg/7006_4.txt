Mark Hamill would have felt embarrassed with CORVETTE SUMMER! This time, he uses a new kind of "force" to regain possession of his dream machine, a bright red "Vette". It looks like another sour teenage movie is shooting in the first half hour and is making a turn in the wrong direction. The writing and directing work is terribly done, with a few scenes you can hardly do anything. You expect this to happen anyway, and you also smell the smell of dodging from the late 70's. Only a former newcomer like Annie Potts would easily steal the show and save this bad movie from the repo horrors! Her impractical but adorable personality will hold on to your interest forever, and this is the best chance to see her in a bathing suit. Hurray for Annie! Sorry, Mark! I suspect the power was not with you this time.
