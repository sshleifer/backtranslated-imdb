Want a good recipe for failure? Take an action, add weak, completely undeveloped characters, and cast the worst special effects a horror movie is known for. Leave it to stew for a week (the time you've probably spent doing this junk). The result is Corpse Grinders, a movie that brings bad movies to dangerous and exotic locations. <br /> <br /> The movie was totally blown. My words can not convey how painful it was to watch. This is not a bad movie where you and your friends can sit around making fun of each other. This is not plan 9 from space. This is a long, boring, sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. I'm feeling depressed as I realize that people actually took their time shitting, if you can call it acting. But then, if you have bad direction, bad story writing, all bad, acting is the last thing you criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a huge, disgusting idiot you're so anxious to crave that a friend or lover could somehow see it. I could really destroy every copy of this movie so it does not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for bringing me new respect for every film I've ever seen. They showed me what's really terrible and why I should appreciate all those movies that are just crappy or boring.
