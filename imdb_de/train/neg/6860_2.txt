Aside from the fact that crazy people exist and there are religious nuts out there. <br /> <br /> The characters usually do not make sense. <br /> <br /> The film has no real beginning, middle or end, nor is anything explained. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a young man with the unlikely name Hazel Motes, who apparently returns from a military residency. <br /> <br /> He races to a two-story house, which is in extremely poor condition, and the windows are boarded up. He goes into the house, walks around and finally writes a note he leaves there. This scene comes to nothing and we learn nothing more about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> It is never explained exactly whose house is here or where the people went, but we get the impression Hazel probably lived there once. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to a city. Why - we do not know. When he arrives in this city, he writes down a name and address he sees on the wall of a bathroom, and goes to that woman who is a surprisingly fat whore. He sees her for a while and then he does not seem to see her anymore. Like everything else in this movie, nothing comes and serves no purpose. <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch tries to make friends with him, but Hazel is not really interested, although they keep crossing over. <br /> <br /> Enoch is as crazy as you can get. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimpanzees are and talk to them offensively. <br /> <br /> We never really know why Enoch behaves like him or why Hazel behaves. Beyond the fact, Hazel had over his grandfather an overdose of old, frightening, fundamentalist religion. Enoch is later fascinated by a man who dresses in a gorilla suit and manages to get the gorilla suit from him and then runs around. <br /> <br /> Hazel, who is tight-wounded and seems to be in a constant border rage, does a bit of street preaching. I had the impression that he was trying to free himself from the untruths of the religion that had been put into him. <br /> <br /> He has several encounters with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions are never really special, and there is no line of action. <br /> <br /> At some point Hazel succumbs to completing the religious fervor and begins to hurt herself. <br /> <br /> It's a very strange movie. Interesting in its oddity, but otherwise it has absolutely nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> The cast does a great job, but this film does not provide a point of view or a story. <Br /> <br /> The movie also has the characters thrown around the N word from time to time, without any connection to the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
