I've just spent a couple of hours observing this and totally disbelieving for 80% of that time, and I can give that garbage the turkey of the year, no problem. To say the plot was incredible is a great understatement. To be honest, I have no words to describe this ultimate trip. Not only are the characters perfect and completely original (this sort of thing has been done a lot better in dozens of 'serial killer flicks'), but the drama was grim. For those who pay for it, I hope you get your money back. For those who have been paid for it, I hope you return your money. Believe me, there are many new releases that are much, much better. Go see.
