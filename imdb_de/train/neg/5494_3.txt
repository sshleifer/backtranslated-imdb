<br /> <br /> Cheap and ugly, this movie did not even entertain the kids in the audience except for a rather funny toilet joke. Christopher Lloyd is far beyond his best position in this role and actually quite tiring, though the sad apology for the jokes of the authors does not help. Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly funny role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid the humiliation. There is really no reason to make this film, especially since it is inevitable that it is compared to Robin Williams' often brilliant improvisations in Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
