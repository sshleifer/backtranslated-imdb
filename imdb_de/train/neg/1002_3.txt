I do not want to go into too much detail because I can not really justify wasting much time checking this movie, but I had to give an alternative opinion to help people avoid the movie. The animation is rough and the story changes from boring / pointless to extremely irritating. The humor was completely lost to the audience, and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans, this is NOT an action sci-fi or anything like that - it's an attempt at a slapstick comedy, and the humor simply did not work after the translation. It was a tedious job watching this movie, and a horrible way to start the film festival, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was to anything entertaining, and it just worked Not. Yaaawwnnn ... Rent Cinema's Journey instead.
