The acting in the movie is really honest well done, but the movie is so slow and boring, as soon as it gets interesting, everything slows to a big standstill. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell doing a great job, including the other actors I mentioned, but man ... this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Maybe this movie would be good in a short movie, but otherwise avoid it. This film has so much filler that a twinkie cake gets jealous. <br /> <br /> I have never seen movies, but when I saw this at home with the family, I went out. Yes, it was so boring. Apparently my comment does not have enough lines to post anything. I think I was inspired by the movie I just saw.
