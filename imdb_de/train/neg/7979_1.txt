This film was slow but boring and acting often drifted into the land of ham. Redgrave's character was unappealing as the 60-year-old woman tried to compete with Thurman's 20 for the love of the Fox character (why can not I). The title of the film should be "Flat people at the lake". The actors played like in a rehearsal. A terribly predictable end. I can not believe it's a comedy on this site!
