I already know that critics and some viewers say it was a satire, there were a lot of political and social messages, the names suggest other names, etc. It could be. I can not realize such things (I do not want it anyway) because I'm not interested in it, I'm interested in 'Cinema'. As far as the film itself is concerned, it is again said that the film is clever and dramatically powerful. I could not see anything that we do not see in monster movies except the scene that takes place in an office in the second half. Yes, this scene says something about humanity, but it does not make the movie brilliant. The movie is entertaining (mild) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but nothing more. The biggest flaw in the movie is visual effects. It was just shocking, I could not hold myself together for a while because I expected a realistic monster because it's not one of the old Gojira movies, it was made in 2006, but it was not like that. It's like you do not believe there's a monster you can not care about. If you agree, I recommend Cloverfield, which is extremely realistic. The design of the monster is not interesting, but at least planned, there is an effort. Dramatically powerful criticism. Some critics speak of it as if it were a Kurosawa film. Yes, it's more of a drama than a thriller or an action, but it should not mean that it's dramatically powerful. I do not want to compare The Host to other monster movies, but I'm trying to say that the host does nothing that other monster movies do not. By the way, some people call the film masterpiece because of their sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I also like Asian cinema, but that's the fact.
