I went into this movie and thought that it would be a decent football drama (in the same direction as Remember the Titans); However, I felt as if I had just visited a Ted Haggard sermon on the Rapture. The only thing missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the film. In fact, one would probably get more out of a televangelist sermon than this poor apology for entertainment. At least in the televangelist sermon there are quotes from the Scriptures rather than quotes from popular self-help pulp. The plot was so predictable that anyone with a sufficiently long attention span could have interpreted the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the movie.
