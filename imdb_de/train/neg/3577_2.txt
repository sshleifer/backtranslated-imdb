This early vehicle from Pia Zadora followed a well-known Harold Robbins formula: the ambitious protagonist indulges in decadence as she makes her way to the top of a randomly-chosen but glamorous world, in this case the film industry. But although he is formulated to be completely predictable, he also manages to be absolutely incredible. Zadora (to call her inexperienced as an actress) is never confident as a scriptwriter. One would expect a film about filmmaking to have insight into its own industry and creative process. But the script does not give her any of the qualities that make writers interesting movie characters: observation, skill with words, a love-hate relationship with one's own creative abilities. Her character is as empty as a donut hole. And this is just a taste of the inability shown here. The cinematography is so bleak that sometimes it's hard to see what happens. And the scenes never really get together, so it all seems like a succession of random moments at bad Hollywood parties. Avoid.
