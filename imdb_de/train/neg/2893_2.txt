What should that be? A remake of Fisher King? Why are we interested in Sandler's figure? What a slow, dreary, boring, who-crazy-about-this-human movie !!! Just to sit through painfully, I turned it off before it was over. It's so obvious that Cheadle needs just as much help as Sandler. As I said, can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character work in his daily life? We should not think that deep, I think. Why is Cheadle Sandler still giving him the chance to become violent against him? If they were such good friends, how did they deal with each other? If Cheadle is so in control, why is he constantly seeking the advice of the shrinker on the street? We are never told. That's why Fisher King was a better movie on so many levels, and that's crap. Almost 8 out of 10 averages? I do not agree at all. Even the top movies are lucky enough to get such a high average rating, and that crap does not deserve to be in the same universe with them.
