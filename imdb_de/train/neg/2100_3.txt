You'd think the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough, without any idea. This documentary, however, seems to make everything appear in a scary light. It talks about the risks of the lunar module and mentions Armstrong's almost fatal accident with the training vehicle, as if the trainer and the spacecraft had something to do with each other. This turns the computer congestion problem (alarms 1202 and 1201) that occurred during the last landing sequence into a near-disaster if it was just a nuisance and no risk to the crew. And the call takes thirty seconds to signify fuel for thirty seconds before it's used up, when in fact thirty seconds pass before a break is mandatory. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary or a dramatization of Apollo 11, select "From Earth to the Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip it.
