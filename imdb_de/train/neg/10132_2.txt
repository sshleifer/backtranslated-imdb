STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> The American military has just launched a new stealth fighter aircraft that allows Dodge detection differently all other. A rogue pilot (Steve Touissant) is stealing it and planning to get the US government to demand a ransom. So you are forced to send her best husband, John Sands (Seagal, who else?) To stop him, in return for his freedom from a jail, in which his mind learned of all the incriminating information he learned over the years has, should be extinguished. <br /> <br /> I skipped Attack Force because I could tell from the title and any post-production manipulation that it was crap and when all the negative reviews and low ratings of users poured in it I thought. But I chose FOF because Shadow Man (by the same director) was not bad and, what the hell, Seagal was once my favorite action star and maybe he could just make a great movie. Oh, what a fool I was. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, terrible archive footage of stealth fighter planes, terrible camera work, cheap production values, rising, unconvincing battle scenes that have become Seagate's hallmarks, and a boring sleep aid plot, that's not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I'm going to skip), is apparently marking the end of his contract with Sony, which means no more These dreadful European action-action movies and his next Movie Prince of Pistols could mean a return to the theater. Damn, he's done it once and Stallone will have done it before him (Rocky Balboa). <br /> <br /> This is not a flight of anger. It's not even fun. It's a flight that does not even lift off the ground. *
