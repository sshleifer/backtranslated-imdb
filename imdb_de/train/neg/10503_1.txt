I saw this movie yesterday. I rented the DVD from Blockbuster. Actually I know one of the actresses from the movie .. I will not say who ..! (That's under lock and key ...) But I have to admit, it was not as good as I thought ... Tom Savini? Hats on this guy .. But it's a shame he was not long in the movie. What's missing from the movie is the idea, the script, the sound, etc. It may look like a good movie. But it was not so well, I'm glad my sister paid $ 10 for renting 3 DVD's from Blockbuster. I opted for this ... and I was disappointed. Anyway, keep your fingers crossed for me ..! Not my problem! 0 out of 10!
