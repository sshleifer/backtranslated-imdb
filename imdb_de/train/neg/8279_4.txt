This movie had all the elements to be a smart, sparkling comedy, but for some reason he took the stupid way. Maybe it did not really know who his audience was: but it's hardly a men's movie given the cast and plot, but too slapstick and stupid-blond to fully appeal to women. <br /> <br /> If you have seen Legal Blonde and its sequel, then this is like the confusing, terrible sequel. Big actors like Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could have done so much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supportive roles that are more stupid than amusing. Many things in this film were painting by numbers, the various super-clich√© montages, the last minute of "misunderstanding," even the kidnapping. This is just an indication of lame script writing. <br /> <br /> It should be possible feeling that movie is enjoyable if you do not take it seriously, but it's such a blatant effect that you'll probably feel increasingly frustrated as the scenes roll by.
