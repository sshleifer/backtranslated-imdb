The author / director of this movie obviously knows nothing about the movie. I think the DP was tied up in this project and replaced by a monkey, since everyone seen was either too dark or had the hottest hot spots than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was awful, the characters were very one-dimensional. For someone who said that this movie was made for poker fans, not movie fans, someone makes fun (it was probably the director). No poker fan in the world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. Going to a casino and playing a few hands does not give you the experience of writing about poker. Keep your job. And if you play poker then you have to be hurt.
