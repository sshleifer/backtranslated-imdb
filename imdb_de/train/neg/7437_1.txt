This movie is simply not worth the time or the money. Full of clich√©s and an action that makes absolutely no sense! I can not believe that so many people gave this terrible movie a 10. <br /> <br /> If I could give this movie a zero, I would do that. Too bad IMDb does not allow that. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw it because I went with a friend who wanted to see it. What's sad is that at first I never had much expectations for this movie and yet I felt a little different. Take my word, do not waste your $ 8 on this garbage. The only conversation I got from the movie made me laugh at the name of the directors. Altogether very NOT RECOMMENDED!
