I'm lost for words. This movie was extremely hard to watch and in retrospect I really wish I had not. Although I tried to get through it until the final credits, I have to admit that I could not last more than an hour, so my opinion might be unfair. However, this film would require the most impressive last third in the history of filmmaking to get a review that is anything but vicious.
