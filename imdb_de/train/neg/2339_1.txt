This swirling movie looks more like a combination of music clips on MTV than a real movie. There is no real story and as the movie continues, ask yourself, "What will happen?"; but nothing happened. The story of Eric Cloeck, the frustrated writer, is the only good thing. The other people do not seem to have anything in common: why bring them together in a movie? With music you can watch the worst movie. If I open the faucet and water comes out with creek music, most people will like to see it, but this is not a movie. The director should learn to write a script for a movie of at least 100 minutes before he starts directing.
