An absolutely steaming bunch of cow dung. It's unbelievable that this movie was made at all. Hip-hop and old western just do not seem to mix. Which target group were these people thinking about when planning this move? <br /> <br /> Not only the concept and the plot are a joke, but the acting is abhorrent and the fact that some decent actors were in this nightmare The movie makes their entire career a joke. The chick of ignorance should never be forgiven and it will be deprived of any remaining dignity. After reading the first ten pages of the dialogue, she should have asked which of her friends played this sick joke. After some research I actually found a list of other actors who have passed the film: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah and finally Marge Simpson In short, I would rather have a blank TV staring at it, to look at this movie again.
