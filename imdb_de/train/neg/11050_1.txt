Terrible use of scene cuts. All continuity is lost, either through terrible scripting or through lethargic instructions. This rogue robot ... must have been a jazz dancer? Also one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard (monologues usually drowned out the music). And ... where did you get your props from? The ship looks like a milk carton ... At the age of 13 I had better special effects for 8mm! <br /> <br /> I would recommend to any film student to watch this filmstrip (5 minutes each) to learn how NOT to make a movie. Or ... was it the editor's fault? <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because the scenario was actually a good concept ... it was poorly implemented. (Sorry, Malcom, you should have sent a "stunt double." You're too good an actor for a stink bomb.)
