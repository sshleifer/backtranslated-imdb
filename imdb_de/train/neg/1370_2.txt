**** ATTENTION: Here are spoilers **** Why am I wasting my hastily fleeing years seeing garbage like this? This film is an impressive collection of clich√©s, bad writing, bad direction, and then we have not even come to acting. <br /> <br /> And of course you can predict the whole story from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Hero expert fights stupid, corrupt and incompetent followers. An avalanche sets in and buries all heroes who manage to get out alive despite all sorts of cliff dangers. A corrupt partner who caused the whole thing is fried alive along with his payoff money. Second avalanche heroically distracted by the adventurous experiment of the renegade experts. Bad stooges also have a heart in the end. The disturbed teenager hugs her crispy stepmother after being rescued by her. Etc etc etc etc etc and so on. <br /> <br /> There's really no reason to warn about spoilers. You could probably work out the whole plot if I give you the basic ingredients. At least most of the time I was not too far away and expected what would happen next. <br /> <br /> And then we did not discuss the factual mistakes. <br /> <br /> I agree with an earlier commentator that even with a bad movie, there are usually some redeeming features. They would be hard pressed to find in this one. I suppose I gave 2 out of 10 for some nice scenes, but that's it. <br /> <br /> It's been some time since a movie made me moan, but it certainly has.
