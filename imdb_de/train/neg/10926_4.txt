The idea is more original than most sci-fi movies, but the execution is missing as usual. While the practical mummy effects are not bad and the "Gun Nut" character acts over the top giggle, the only real attraction is Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin on the small screen. I suspect that was the whole time. They do their best with what they have, but the "must see" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes when Morena's character wore some Tomb Raider shorts. I do not know that it's not a high-brow movie, but you can not deny true beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin taunts it again as the guy you hate the most. If you only want to entertain a few of your favorite subordinate Firefly characters, this may be for you. If you want good acting and character development, you should look elsewhere.
