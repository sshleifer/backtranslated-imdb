I've watched 3 episodes of Caveman and I do not know why I'm going on, except perhaps to wait for it to get better. <br /> <br /> For me, this show simply pumps without advertising from the commercials. As we watched the shows, we all speculated on what would happen. <br /> <br /> The episode of the cave woman with a posture was actually a big yes for us. She's rude in a theater and acts hard on strangers, and to be honest, she needed a slap show, my mother, the car. I give a 2 just because they earn a better than a 1 because they actually spent money on it.
