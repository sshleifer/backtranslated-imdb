It's not often that I see a movie as horrible as this one. I kept watching, hoping every minute that this was just a joke just to find out it should be taken seriously. Well, as serious as the genre demands. <br /> <br /> The spectacle was a shame and the situations were awfully smart and clich√©d. For example, if a movie was made in 1920 and the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) was in its direction, we would think the movie was naive at the time. Coincidentally, this film was filmed in 2000, and I have not yet seen a silent film that has as little charm as this one. <br /> <br /> No way for the serious moviegoer. <Br /> <br /> [No rating]
