I saw it recently at the Palm Springs International Film 2009. This is the full-length directorial debut of Dutch actress Monique van de Ven. Based on my observations, it should be her last. I hate movies that are so implausible that you take apart virtually every scene. This movie makes you scratch your head right away. A young photographer starts and his friend, who works for an international aid organization, makes a leisurely drive through the Taliban-controlled mountains of Afghanistan and talks about her love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They get out of their car to watch Talliban fighters armed with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades carry all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) begins to photograph all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents firing at a hand grenade that kills his girlfriend. Since they throw away with their hands, they can not be more than 50 yards away, but it somehow comes away. His girlfriend is blown up, and he takes a picture from the moment of the grenade impact that kills her, and wins a prize as Photographer of the Year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this movie is as ridiculous as the opening. The following year, Bob is on a Dutch vacation island on behalf of National Geographic, where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and fits into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers. Avoid this movie. I would rate it at 4.0 out of 10.
