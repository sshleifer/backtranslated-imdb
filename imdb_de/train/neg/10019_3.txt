Kareena Kapoor in bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good banner .. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in bikini ..... <br /> <br /> No good reason, this one Not to see a movie .... <br /> <br /> Or so I thought ........ Did not these guys do JBJ ... <br /> <Why? Why did I forget that? <br /> <br /> For all the criticism, the first half of the movie is not that bad ... <br /> <br /> There are some intrigues and you feel a touch of irritation mixed with enthusiasm, that I FEEL at the sight of Guy Ritchie's films like LOCK STOCK AND SNATCH. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor is sizzling in a very thin way. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar, as only he can be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying, but somehow weird. YOU FORGET that most of the time you can not understand him. <br /> <br /> Saif is ala Main Khiladi lonely ... once again. <br /> <br /> There are occasional laughter and a few giggles and some goose bumps during the love story of Kareena-saif (Kareena in the rain, hmmmmmmm behind me on my bike). <br /> <br /> BUT MORE THAT THIS HALF MAKES MORE THAN IT IS DELIVING ..... WHAT THE SECOND HALF MAKES EVERYTHING UNIQUE ... <br /> <br There was almost a cheer when the interval came not just because of the wet Kareena, which people thought were things to come. <br /> <br /> We treat mind numbing FOLTERs instead of THAT WORK IS HARD TO SET. <br /> <br /> Saif Suddenly Coming Like a Comic-Buddy ... <br /> <br /> SUDDENLY SEXY KAREENA LOOKS INORGANIC, YOU REALIZE THAT THE SECOND LAST STICK IS NOW EMPTY AND HAVE YOUR FACE FOR YOU GREAT TO SEE <br /> <br /> ANIL KAPOOR AND HIS SIDEKICKS GET ON YOUR NERVES. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one who carries the madness to some degree, but even after a while he becomes unbearable. <br /> <br /> ALL IF YOU NEED AN ABSURDITY AFTER THE OTHER BECOME. <br /> <br /> WHY ?? !! WHAT??!!! WHEN?!!! FROM WHERE?!!! What did I do to accomplish that? <br /> <br /> A collective breath passed through the audience before each song in the second half, which was quite normal even without the movie. <br /> <br /> The trauma can not be alleviated .... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION. <br /> <br /> THIS FILM BEGINS AS A BUZZ BECAUSE YOU CAN FEEL THAT IT CAN BE ABOUT TO A HIGH DEPRESSION ON THE PATH TO A HEADACHE AND THUS QUICKLY TO A FULLY DRAWN MIGRAINE ATTACK. <br /> <br /> Please watch this movie for academic reasons only. <br /> <br /> + Cast, Akshay Kumar, first half. <br /> <br /> +/- s what, when, how, who too much confusion. (You need a book to fill this). <br /> <br /> + s performer, the whole second half (I need many pages to fill in). <br /> <br /> total 3/10 (I try to avoid the 1 and 2 does not seem to be too extreme, but do not make mistakes this film is inappropriate, no matter how decent the first half is).
