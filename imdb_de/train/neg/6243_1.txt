Do not drink the cooling aid. <br /> <br /> This is a documentary filmed opinion. And calling it "truth" is simply crap. The debate over global warming is far from over and will not be over until the eco-zombies begin to recognize the mountain of evidence against their beloved theory. Only Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you will find a flow of information that refutes almost every link in the chain of logic Gore receives. The reason why it is so important for humans to educate themselves is the devastating economic impact of measures to prevent global warming. Wake up to people. Anyone who has a computer, has some time, and has common sense can find many reasons why this theory is not nearly credible. Do not just read articles that support your current opinions, but read everything you can find. There really is no need for in-depth analysis. There are just too many alternative possibilities and counter-proofs for the theory itself to have the most basic scientific credibility. It is so incredible that it can be the biggest hoax in the course of human existence. It is time for people to speak out against this kind of propaganda, and it is time for people to admit to themselves and others that you can both be a conservationist and realize the stark conclusion that the global one Warming hysteria is a big lie.
