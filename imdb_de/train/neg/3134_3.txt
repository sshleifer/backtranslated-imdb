"The Fallen" fall into the category "WOL" (WOL). I'm sad that I was two hours older and had no conversation. My other family members also watched this movie and cast humble comments on the screen and squatted for the mummy. The actors have me sorry (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and can not add anything to this movie other than that it could be shortened to 25 minutes. Therefore, it could take a 30-minute time on TV without losing the plot. It reminds me of a dish that contains several good ingredients, but when served it is bland and tasteless. In my humble opinion, the 42-foot mummy would have been 8 to 10 feet and improved the conspiracy by removing the mystic and replacing him with several people who shed light on the facts and wanted DNA samples for evil reasons. The heroes are discredited by their colleges and thrown on their ears. Later, everything was screwed up by the bad people. The heroes would save the day and prove that all are wrong.
