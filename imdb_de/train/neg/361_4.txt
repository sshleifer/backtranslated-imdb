After reading the book, I loved the story. When I saw the movie, I was disappointed that so many changes were made. It's understandable that books and movies are different, but they were two different stories, leaving only the names and part of the story of the book. Read the book and you will understand the movie better. The book gives you a better character development. These characters are extremely interesting and let's take care of them. The places actually coincided with the descriptions of the book. Some characters are not included. TV has so many great books and stories in the microwave. This is a perfect example of this. The author's contribution does not always guarantee a good movie, but it can sometimes help.
