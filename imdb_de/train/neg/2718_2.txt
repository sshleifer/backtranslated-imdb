This is the least scary movie I have ever seen. How the blob eats everyone is the biggest mystery of the movie. The blob moves so slowly that a o.a.p in a Zimmerframe escaped. The blob is lucky when he meets a typical horror movie woman who stops for half an hour to be eaten. If you have not seen this movie yet, I recommend you, it's way too funny to be taken seriously.
