This movie should not be seen as it should be a flop. Ram Gopal Verma wanted to do a remake of the classic Bollywood movie "Sholay" first, but after having problems with the original creators, he decided to continue the project and ... I think, all the good parts of the movie (drama, script , Songs, music, comedy, action, etc.) and shoot the movie just because he has already hired the crew. Waste of money, a waste of time. After making films like Rangeela, Satya and Company, he put us on a coppola (godfather); What did you think about RGV? Anyway, the story, though hard to follow, is almost like Old Sholay. Ajay Devgan plays Heero (Beeru, Sholay) and Ajay, a new kid in the block playing Ajay (Jay, Sholay). Both "bad but funny" friends help a police officer catch a bad guy first. Later in the film, they are hired by the retired policeman as personal security and as protection from the much sought-after Bubban of Amitabh Bachan. If you have not watched Bollywood movies, the good guys win in the end. There I have just saved you three precious hours of your life!
