This could be the worst movie ever made, and is worth a visit for that alone. Streisand is ridiculously unbelievable, as a young woman posing as a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is agonizing as Barbara spawns some of the weakest babblers ever made. And do not even start with the plot. You will actually get more giggles from this movie than many comedies because it is soooooooo awful. The rampant ego of Streisand, who believed that he could lift this stinker to Oscar height, led to this catastrophe. I am pretty sure that novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer hated this movie and never forgave Streisand. I can not blame him. This movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours while the Soundtrack of 'The Sound of Music' is playing backwards on an old turntable. It's really that bad. I am amazed that everyone from Streisand enjoyed this movie as he wanted.
