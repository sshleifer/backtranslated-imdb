** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The really exquisite Sean Young (who looks a bit like Elizabeth Taylor in some scenes with her hair combed out) shows up in her first moments in this movie. She sits in the back of a police car, waiting to signal a bust. Face and body are tense and distracted. Unfortunately, Young's tense behavior after the bust never changes. This is a deadly inhibited actress. <br /> <br /> You just have to compare Young to the actress who plays her colleague and best friend Arnetia Walker to understand what's missing in Young. Walker is always open, emotional and relaxed ... there is no obvious barrier between what she can feel and her expression of it. She is an open book. On the other hand, Young acts in the awful, self-confident way you expect your neighbor to act when he suddenly starred in a movie. Basically, she has no idea. <br /> <br /> With this great emptiness in the center of the film, we have to think about the implausibilities of history. For example, after Miss Young is kidnapped by the criminal and locked in a closet, she breaks the door when left alone. Granted, she only has a bra and a panty on, but in a similar situation, with a psycho-captor coming back any moment, you would go to the door ... or take the time to go through his dresser, take off some clothes and get dressed? I would guess that these and other scenes try to express mixed feelings that Miss Young's character experiences, but Young can not convey that kind of complexity. <br /> <br /> There are some influential moments in the film, such as the brief police interviews with the victims' offenders, but overall this is an aimless endeavor. It is a pity that Miss Young was replaced during the filming of two comic-style films that could have exploited her limitations with some humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY), as her attempt to play real people is strangely touching. Watching Miss Young try to act in this "thriller," is a sad spectacle.
