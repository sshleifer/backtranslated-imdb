This film allegedly concerns non-establishment types (aesthetic and sexual) that seemingly can not resist the basic romantic needs. Although some excellent players are among them, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, they are grounded in a childish script that relies almost exclusively on clever dialogue. which is not Nixon's role has the best lines, but she often intervenes too quickly, a timing mistake that the director must be caught. The grotesque climax takes advantage of any available clich√© he has spent or not, and ends this shabby attempt at comedy appropriately.
