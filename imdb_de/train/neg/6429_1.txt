Personally, I would advise people to stay away from this movie. It's a boring sight on the whole, and the fighting is badly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. When you buy the DVD to release the Hong Kong Legends DVD, the only audible sound is the Bey Logan audio commentary. <br /> <br /> But definitely, since when has it ever been worth watching a ninja movie? I can not imagine and I honestly do not want to. <br /> <br /> When it comes to movies, I have a golden rule: Avoid movies that contain the word "ninja".
