Yes, that was an incredible, condescending chatter. We know that the French often have a twisted notion of the US, it's Puritanism and views about sex. As an American (Hoosier) living in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And although some of these preconceived opinions might be true, NO USE of the Midwest realm depicted in this movie was ringing real. A man who has never had sex because he was told 20 years ago that his penis is too big? Where in the world would you find that? A jukebox in a bar that only plays vintage bluegrass? A city of perhaps 16 residents less than two hours from Chicago, but without a gas station, no TVs in the flat, no McDonalds, no kids ... a family that hates each other. The adult males plant cushions in the local caf√©, have farms, but do not reap, kill the guy they do not like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with the same emotion? The liberated Frenchwoman who is going to screw up the 17-year-old virgin boy for her sexual generosity, the overly fleshy guy who gets out of the cornfields by the sheer breath of an Illinois breeze to help deflower this 17-year-old farm boy? HELP! I am so stunned and stunned by the absurdity of this film that I do not clearly state how ridiculous it is. Take a look at the A to Z primer to see what you should avoid. Gosh, I hope I did not ruin it for you!
