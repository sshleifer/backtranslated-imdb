Possible spoilers maybe. I have to say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst movies ever made. Initially, the film was shot during the height of Disney's youth campaign. It was written at around the same time as "The Little Mermaid II", "The Jungle Book II" and "Peter Pan II", all of which abused their original movie classics. (Disney has also made "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II," but I'll drop that topic because their original films were never really classics.) Let me continue and say that I'm an avid follower of good Disney movies, and I absolutely love the original Disney "Cinderella". However, the sequel to "Cinderella" was a waste of time. The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so different from the original girl I grew up with. In the original, Cinderella was gracious and loving. The new Cinderella had very extraordinary moments with phrases from the modern day like: "I'll do this banquet in my own way!" You, this new Cinderella (as I lovingly called her) say, "Ewww!" That's the anti-Cinderella. I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the step-sisters, is good! to hell? Why? They've made everything as if Lady Tremaine and Drizella were terrible family members for poor little Anasta sia. My question to the world: Did the people at Disney see the original "Cinderella" when they did this sequel? Well, it certainly does not seem like that. If I recall correctly, Anastasia has abused Cinderella as much as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am all for salvation and forgiveness, but for Anastasia there was no need for salvation in this film. In the first, Anastasia was angry. In the second she is good. You just can not leave such a story. I hope Disney realizes that this movie, among other things, shames Walt Disney's name. Maybe after Michael Eisner is gone, things around the house of the mouse will evolve.
