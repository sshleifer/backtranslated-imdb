This must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not have to agree with another commentator who said the special effects are okay. I thought it was pretty bad: it just was not realistic and they were so fake that they were distracted from the actual story. <br /> <br /> Maybe this distraction is the reason I did not fully understand the story. The archaeologists search for "the set". You do not bother to say which sentence or something is so special. This also makes it unclear why they are looking for it in California, while the intro of the film takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you're shooting a movie that's playing in the desert, you're taking the trouble to really go into the desert. The beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was filmed in a studio instead of a desert. <br /> <br /> The action level was constant throughout the movie, with no highs and lows, no highs. The movie looked short, and that's certainly a pro for this movie.
