The only redeeming qualities of this film are the rather original death scenes. Apart from that, this movie is a big DUD. We have Kim Basinger, the beleaguered housewife, who meanders slowly through the local shopping mall for the first 30 minutes. the movie that did not add anything. Then the movie starts something, having faced 4 punks occupying 2 parking spaces on this busy Christmas Eve. They start following her after they leave the local security guard who tried to help her. From then on, this movie gets worse. I know it's just a movie and you have to go with the river, but it has about 5 minutes. Headstart and she can not hide or find someone who can help her. Instead, she drives to a semi-erected subdivision next to a forest. Typically, she does everything so that her followers can easily find her. But now she is turning into a tough mofu. They get the point. Never buy or rent this movie, no matter how much you like it. It's so illogical that you question any scene. It is embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the cast as well as for the consumers.
