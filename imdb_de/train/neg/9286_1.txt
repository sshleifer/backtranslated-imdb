OK, first of all, I'd like to say that I'm still amazed at the plot, <br /> <br />, but then again it's a movie that does a Steven Segal movie just without Steven Segal Omg! !! /> <br /> only random low budget action scenes really no point, I am still amazed that I have really burned 90 min on this crap and has no and do not suspect to have and plot !!! plz plz plz avoid it !! By the way, the best actor who plays there is Bill Goldberg and that says a lot! <br /> <br /> and no, he does not play as well as i said, plz avoid it pfff i still can not believe i wasted 90 min and spent 10 min more writing this !! :)
