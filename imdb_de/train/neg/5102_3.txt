Nicole Eggert was listed as the star, although Micheal Dorn and Stacey Keach were much bigger stars than they. Basically this is a bit of a shot on the movie "Alien lands on Earth". Eggert plays the girl, who feels sorry for an alien who is being hunted by the military, and takes the out-of-control creature in her very sexy disguise. A bit of nudity and partial nudity, a pointless sex scene that occurs along the way. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles through some obvious set pieces and jokes about photos being shown. I really liked the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was taken over and he got a really cool death scene. <br /> <br /> It was pretty obvious that Stacey Keach would be taken over and the movie had pretty much a faint end, it would have been nice to show exactly what talent the alien was going to Eggert.
