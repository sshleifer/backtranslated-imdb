It has a great name, but that's it and you will not get more than that for your money. In fact, you might find the first 30-40 minutes of the movie somehow funny, but then the story goes from one page to the other. There is no specific reason, and you can not understand what happens until the action is over. <br /> <br /> And yet the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call him an actor, but I do not think it could be like that called nothing but exaggeration !! .... Period. The little kid playing as his son has absolutely no sense of acting, and I think it was just a favor he did or not, because he had no idea what he was doing. <br /> <br /> For some reason you thought casting comedians could do it, but they did not !! and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor is so bad, I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> But hopefully this is as bad as it gets. In order for people to make these DVDs accessible to good taste, they must offer something to eat that could work out. <br /> <br /> Maka
