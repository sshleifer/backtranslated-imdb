This film is yet another example of the curse of East Asian cinema: two or more separate stories grouped together in one movie. Other reviewers have obviously picked it up, as there are several mentions of the "first part" and "second part". How can one have a character development or a deep action if the characters and the story are shown for such a short time? I enjoyed the first part until it stopped abruptly (it did not end, it just stopped what seemed to be the middle of the story), to be replaced by a crazy and totally unbelievable second part that seems to be about a girl who rearranges and cleans a man's apartment (wow!). I'm looking forward to the day Wong Kar Wai gets a decent script to work!
