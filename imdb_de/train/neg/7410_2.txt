I love horror movies that bring out a real mystery like "Silent Hill" (which I thought was pretty good, but still missing), and movies you just suspect was one of those movies. At first the movie starts with a lot of excitement and is a good starting point for a good horror scene, but after that it just rolls down the hill and from there it just goes faster and faster. I first mentioned Silent Hill for a reason, because here I can see a lot of "stolen" motifs from this movie. All in all, I would say, look instead on Silent Hill, it's better, it's scary, has a lot more suspense, and the end is a lot better. And best of all, you will not feel so taken aback as I am have done with this. This only seems to be one of them. "I like this movie, so I'm doing it in my own really bad version" somehow movie "Oh and one more thing ... Lordi ... in a horror movie ... that's like trying a kid to scare with a bear who "hugs me" and I'll love you forever "written on his stomach ..
