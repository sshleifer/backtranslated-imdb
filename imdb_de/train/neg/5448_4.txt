Doris Day never lets a bad script get her down. Even in the most difficult of circumstances, Day gives 100% and usually comes out unscathed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by a real New York black-out of 1965, but in fact adapted to a French play by Claude Magnier in the late '50s, gives Doris little to do but fake her own goody-goody image second half, weirdly sedated (which is amusing because the spin day gives way to the situation). There are some funny lines, but obviously the material was taken out of the game ... and instead of conjuring up some amusing incidents in the Big Apple, we get stuck in the suburbs. The co-stars of Doris (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) are not suitable for them, and the shapeless hairstyle they wear is not good either. Still, it's not terrible, there are some big laughs and it's a must-have for day buffs. ** from ****
