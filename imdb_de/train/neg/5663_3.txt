This is to the Zatoichi movies, since the "Star Trek" movies were "Star Trek" - except that in this case, each of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this great, shiny re-do and was also made better. if the substance is more important than the surface. Had I never seen her, I would have thought it beautiful but empty; I had found the style inappropriate and found the content inadequate. The idea of ​​reviving the character in a larger, leaner production must have sounded good, but there was no point in it, other than hoping to make money. It's just a show that mostly does not capture the atmosphere of the world of the character and does not take the character anywhere where it was not (even the actor was not at his best). I had hoped to see Ichi late in life, in a story that would gracefully see him and draw conclusions from all his experience; this only rhymes pieces and pieces from the other films, spiced with more sex and violence against women. Not the same experience at all.
