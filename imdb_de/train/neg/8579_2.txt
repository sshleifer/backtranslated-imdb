I'm afraid that's pretty awful, despite some good performances and generally competent camera work. It is a first and last attempt by author and director Soo Lyu. "Rub and Tug" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of the Canadian program to promote domestic filmmaking. While the program encourages worthwhile efforts such as "New Waterford Girl," it opens the door to untrained newcomers like Lyu, who did not have to aggressively set up this project, but were highlighted green without proper scrutiny of their script or evidence. <br /> <br /> The low budget does not bother you, because of the shabby production design, poor lighting, poor audio and the dark selection of Docu pieces. the workers in Canadian massage parlors. But the dialogue and conspiracy give the actors nothing to work with, the editor much, or a viewer presents a mental challenge other than the lifting of unbelief. If your story is so simple, the last thing you need is , a confused narrative technique. Although nothing happens, it is difficult to follow the movie and it is impossible to determine the point of view. <br /> <br /> Don McKellar's performance as Conrad is a few degrees below his similar characteristic in "Exotica". Lindy Booth's Lea is her usual bizarre airhead; As always she is sympathetic, but here she is little else. Kira Clavells Cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of consequence, Tara Spencer-Nairns Street Betty, more than makes up for her outstanding performance in "New Waterford Girl". Her flat performance in "Rub and Tug" should reduce the tendency to search for other films she appeared in. Unless you need further confirmation of the ability of "Waterford" Alan Moyle to work with young actors. <br /> <br /> You quickly conclude that Lyus reptile brain can not capture concepts such as the complexity of the plot, so the need to end up using a lazy and lame "Deus ex machina" device is no surprise. It could be even worse, the lewd story has so little internal logic anyway that the unlikely ending is not as painful as it would normally be. <br /> <br /> What else do I know? I am only a child.
