The problem I find in this title is that I'm not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or a movie. A mix of the two genres just does not work and it all hangs in the middle of nowhere. This is all the more the case when the director has chosen the most extreme aspects of everyday life, resulting in an unconvincing documentary. If it's a thriller / drama, that's too boring and monotonous. In any case, what is the moral or message that the director wants to convey to the audience? That there are people around us who mistreat others who are ready to be mistreated? That there are many crazy lunatics around us? So .......... so what?
