OK, anyone who honestly said that this movie was great or even good is either delusional or knows the director, writer and producer and tries to increase the excitement of the movie. I saw the movie because a friend of mine was working on it and it was awful. I am an actress and have been working in the industry for some time on big films and even independent and this movie bores me to tears. The reason why I'm so tough is that this movie was clearly a different take on "Of Mice and Men" and they should complain because it's such a terrible rip off of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be bankrupt creatively ... if someone takes a classic book and a movie "Of Mice and Men" and destroys it with a new spin, that bothers me a lot. The actors, the accents, the dialogue and the direction were amateurish and the writing was bleak. I mean, if you make a new spin on an existing story, make sure it's as good or better than the original to justify the new spin. I did not like this movie at all.
