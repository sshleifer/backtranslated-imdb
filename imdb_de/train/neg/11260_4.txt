This film should be referred to as "Plan 9 by Joseph Smith." I think his strangeness is underestimated. The playwright seems to have read Paul Ehrlich's "Population Bomb (1968)" and developed a musical response specifically for Mormons. The crux of the game is that it's as much as possible to have children as part of the plan of the "Heavenly Father" (God). and anything that gets in the way of more babies is very bad. Get it? <br /> <br /> This version was shot in 1989, which is confusing. It is Utah, as it looks and feels like in 1983, the piece was actually written in 1973, and of course the theology is part of 1840, part Battlestar Galactica. Part of the action takes place on Earth and some in "pre-existence," an aimless Romper room where angry kids wait to get their bodies so they can come down and try not to open the door to the missionaries slam and lose their shot in heavenly ways glory. <br /> <br /> It's as infinite as they come, but do not let the poor theatrics spoil your appreciation for this denied Mormon universe, where the "cool kids" are all (presumably) the most populous Counseling your parents did not have children anymore !! Having large families at the time the piece was written was the cultural norm in the lds community, and, more importantly, as part of the divine plan. I made family planning a choice of parents, and big families are far less the cultural norm these days. Make the whole teaching of the film for a modern Mormon idiot! ahhh, but it's really just as good as the music, here are some catchy tunes that just will not let this movie happen. The death of the 70s for which it was intended. Brother and sister sing love songs in which you wonder if something else is going on there - Wink. and the tough, cool kids make new kids look like metallica on the block. So much applause for all this! Gather the family, make jello and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
