I have seen about a thousand horror movies. (my darling type) This movie is one of the worst. For me, an idea is a movie. So even a badly played, cheaply made film can be good. Something weird is definitely cheap. However, it has little to say. I still do not understand what the karate scene has to do with the movie in the beginning. Something strange has little to offer. Save the pain!
