The worst movie ever !!!! I can not believe that I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this crap. The only reason I did not turn it off was that I wanted to see the gangster dude on the cover and he did not even talk about false advertising. The people who gave this film a ten are either stupid, stupid or CAST MEMBERS or friends of CAST MEMBERS have to write more and I do not want it either. to waste my time talking about this garbage. Please do not look at it and if you have chosen then this film can go where it belongs. below 100 films. I can not even tell you how bad it really is. I think the worst movie you've ever seen is ten and that's this movie. It sucked !! If you think I'm bitter then look at it, I trust you !! This film should be used to torture war criminals or terriosts. If they even look at it twice, they will spill the beans and beg for MERCY !!
