Somehow they summed up the 1960s, ten years that radically changed our country, in four hours. And what a painful four hours it was. They trivialized the big events and happenings and they "claimed" that they were two families, but one barely saw the African American family. If I were NBC, I would be ashamed and ashamed of having broadcasted such garbage. The funny thing was that this happy family you saw in the first place was tortured in a variety of ways, but it did manage to take part in every major event of the 1960s across the country. And the second family was such a non-factor. They dedicated perhaps five or six scenes to this family. The poor son ... Please NBC, do not make films about other epochs ... leave the PBS and the History Channel
