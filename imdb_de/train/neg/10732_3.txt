The Russian film "4" shows the life of three (not four) strangers who meet one evening in a local bar. One is a musician, the other a frozen meat dealer and the other a call girl. <br /> <br /> "4", I gather, to demonstrate the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post-Soviet Russia (the characters have to invent stories to make their lives more interesting than they really are), but the film is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt that many people can sit all the way through the movie. It seems that the film is suggesting that the dark Russian government is behind the scenes behind dodgy actions - they are operating secret clones, selling decades-old frozen meat, etc. - but the film is so informal and incomprehensible that I doubt it Everyone was able to find out what everyone was really up to. <br /> <br /> Despite decent acting and some clear-sighted scenes, "4" is a two-hour endurance competition that should be avoided at all costs.
