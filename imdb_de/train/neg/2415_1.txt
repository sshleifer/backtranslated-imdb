... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DO NOT RENT THIS FILM. If you're looking for a documentary about Hood life, you're in the wrong place too. If you are looking for a ridiculous movie, this is a real winner! The drama is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is definitely the officer who examines the passage. I can see that he also did the voice for the 911 operator by the flat tone of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box, it would probably sound like that guy. Oh yes, and the "zombies" made their best impression of the snake wearing their FANTASTIC acting overalls (note sarcasm ... HOW HAVE NOT won the Oscar for Best Makeup?) The Quiroz ... ... did not do any kind of directing. I felt like I was seeing a piece of improvisation (the period is more like 90's in LA). The direction, however, is one with the worst scenario I think to grace a movie. I have not heard such beautiful lines as the epic word that came with the movie "F ** k!" Starts since "Ice Grill", another "urban" thriller. Of course this only works in conjunction with the equally epic hip-hop soundtrack! All three or so songs of it! All in all, what the hell do you expect from a movie titled "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rented this movie with the full intention of laughing at every scene, and the boy delivered and MORE! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to meet some guys and laugh about a horror movie on a low budget (yes, right ...) for the night. An unforgettable experience!
