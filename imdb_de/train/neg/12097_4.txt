I did not really hope for much when I saw that. After Mst3k did a lot with Jason, I hoped for a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the movie took itself too seriously. Am I interested in Jason's problems? I'm sorry no. There is a Legion Ft13th movies that cover that anyway. Towards the end of the day he is an undead serial killer. I just will not be so sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the film with the hallucinations and what not, but unfortunately there were only a few and at the end of the movie it had become a bad episode of Celebrity Deathmatch ... just not funny. <br /> <br />
