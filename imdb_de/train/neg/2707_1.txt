This is one of the laziest films of the 90s. I would not recommend it if you have something better to do. <br /> <br /> This picture shows African Americans as wild, uncultivated, violent, inarticulate sociopaths. Fudge (Ice Cube) and his group of homies are not only disrespectful to whites in the dorm, but also to Asians, and are never disciplined for their actions. Despite all this tolerance, they whine and cry over and over the evil white oppressors who lead their lives and stand in their way. In fact, it's Fudge's influence that causes Remmy to connect with the skinheads, leave college and eventually kill Malik's girlfriend away from campus and usually stay away from everyone else. They never bombard their music to annoy people, or do not mock the police. They commit a serious crime such as battery and rape, but are not as repulsive or threatening as Fudge and Dreads (Busta Rhymes). <br /> <br /> There's a lot of material in this movie that would almost insult me ​​or make me giggle. Some of these are as follows: <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dreads are reported as students at Columbus University, but we never see them in class and it's completely unclear how they pay their tuition. One can only speculate that the grass they smoke has something to do with their finances. Although they are students of a university looking at a private university, they can not speak a single line of proper English. Their characters are only developed through compulsive whining and xenophobia. <br /> <br /> It seems that the drunken Kristen (Kristy Swanson) knew exactly why drunk Billy brought her home. She even asked him to get some gum so they could start. The fact that he had penetrated her without a condom became a rape, and it would only be good sex if he had a practical device. Later, Kristen was assured by Taryn (Jennifer Connely) that she had no responsibility in the matter, and though she had willfully jumped into a man's bed, she was not ready for intercourse and was malignantly exploited by a sexual predator. Then, about a week later, she met and slept with an ultra-sensitive doctor who knew how to avoid rape and brought a condom. The director thoroughly emphasized the contraception. <br /> <br /> This movie is complete and full of trash that makes black people look like antics and women who look stupid and frail. Cole Hauser's acting and the accent of Laurence Fishburne are the only reasons I can imagine. The author / director is obviously a man of limited intelligence. If you want, limit your own limits by watching this crap, but remember that neurons do not regrow. Just follow the advice at the end and make UNLEARN.
