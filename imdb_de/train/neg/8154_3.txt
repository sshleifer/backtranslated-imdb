The long list of "big" names in this movie (including the omnipresent John Mills) did not bother me so much that I could not judge the movie by its actual merits. It's full of stereotypes, caricatures, and standard scenes, from the modest Air Ace hero to the noisy backcounter. The music title was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the movie was over: loud, rising crescendo, grandiose thriving and ending, then silence, but then the movie went on! I found no real plot, random writing, but cleverly pressed uniforms and the pretty Jean Simmons (pre-nose job) with a rousing little thing. I can not say that this image has any of the ingredients that make a movie great. I found it maudlin, mawkish and minor.
