Extremely complicated and drab. I'm a smart guy, but that was just too much for a tired brain. It would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they do. Probably better for the US market. GC itself suggested that this alone did not deliver its Oscar, and you can see why. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the sand dunes are pretty. The nails are bad. The drunken father of lawyers is a mystery. The cricket is good to see. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to write the required ten lines, although it takes over 2 hours. Thank heaven, they cut it. We do not get much to the pictures, but the last movie we saw Walk the Line was ten times better and I do not really like Johnny Cash. My wife says George still looks good with the beard and a few pounds more, so ... I'm almost there yet? <br /> <br /> How about now?
