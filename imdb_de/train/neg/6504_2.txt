Why did I spend 1.5 hours of my life watching this? Why was this movie ever made? Why am I actually commenting on this movie? <br /> <br /> One reviewer said this film needed patience to look at it, and it was not for everyone. I can not figure out who this movie is for. Maybe after taking a bout of acid, SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE ANYONE to observe this and make sense of it. It's incoherent, it's not experimental, it's easier garbage. The movie does not follow any plot line unless you think you have something, well ... you do not do it. <br /> <br /> I think the end brought the film to a certain finality (no pun intended), giving viewers an insight into what was possibly going on. I do not think I used a spoiler here, not that it matters. This film is another must in the film world.
