I saw this movie a few days ago ... what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> I like watching movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are fun and enjoyable. When I saw a name for this title and genre, I thought it might be really good ... a spoof for Slashers or other Gore movies ... but then I read a preview and thought it might still be good ... but it was not ... <br /> <br /> my opinion: If movies look like documentaries, try a bit of comedy, some moore movies or alien autopsies, then it's really about something. this one was empty. <br /> <br /> and a comedy titled ... no comment ... really bad joke
