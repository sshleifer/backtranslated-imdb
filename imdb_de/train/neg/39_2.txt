An actress who makes a movie in Africa is kidnapped and taken to the jungle where she is being held as a ransom. The producer hires someone to bring them back. Complicated are the cannibals in the jungle who adore a really ugly-looking "god" who likes to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> This is a bloody, filthy movie. There is plenty of nakedness and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. It's a commercial film that appeals to the deepest, darkest parts of our being, and if the movie were not so boring, this movie would be a classic. Let's face this movie despite the blood, the bad sex and abuse and the ugly monster, this movie is a snoozer. The tempo has gone completely off balance and it bothers you. There are several plotting lines, all of which seem to run separately, even though it is ultimately a single story. Worst of all, almost nobody says anything. Most of the minimal dialogue concerns the cruelty or protest of a character: "I will do what I want". It is such a quiet and boring film that if not for the frequent screams of the victims, I would recommend this as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid, unless you need sleep or unless you have to watch every euro cannibal movie. <br /> <br /> (Incidentally, VideoAsia has just published this as part of their series Terror Tales. Their print is strangely boxed, which seems to be the result of the recording Fog), which was trimmed to remove the subtitles, and their print does not have any initial titles.
