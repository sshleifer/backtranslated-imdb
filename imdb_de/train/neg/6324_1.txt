I ran movie theaters for eight years in the '80s and' 90s. This was by far the worst movie I have ever shown to the public. One thing that made it so bad was that it seemed like a great, inspiring movie. Even the great Gregory Peck could not keep this terrible fool from being far less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis has clearly shown in an early non-horror movie role that she has not yet learned the drama (she still tries, but it does not get much better). And here is the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament will never happen just because Kids are afraid to play little league baseball! Even the shows on Nick and The Disney Channel are not stupid enough to make us believe the shit. <br /> <br /> It's not worth the time you spend on cable TV. It's not worth the price of a movie rental; Your dollar would be better spent on an extra microwave popcorn package to match the other movie you chose (because it can only be better).
