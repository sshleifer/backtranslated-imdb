It was one of those late night "It's there" I saw it. Sometimes they are great. This was awful, but it should not have been this way. <br /> <br /> The movie had a really good cast. How can you fail if you have Charleston Heston and Jack Pallance? We're talking about Oscar winners here. It had good special effects. It even had some really good tits! And I mean well shown, full breast with full nipple and at some point even some beaver. But the missing ingredient could not be compensated - a story! The conspiracy was ridiculous. I do not mean the "sun crisis", the sun is exploding, but that was bad enough. It was the rest of the material - the oh so silly and totally predictable evil company. Man who only STANK! No good acting or cool spaceships or fight scenes could get around them. <br /> <br /> I have seen that the same actors are incredibly good. I've seen wonderful sci-fi movies with tiny casts and budgets. The whole difference lies in the writing.
