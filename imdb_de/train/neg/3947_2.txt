In the comic Modesty is strong. Alexandra Staden, who plays Modesty Blaise, looks more like an anorexic model. She has neither the moral nor the personality that Modesty has in the comics. Modesty would never advise a woman to show more skin to make more money. I do not see any resemblance to my comics with Modesty and this movie. It's Impossible film like a mission when Ethan Hunt is locked in Internierungsraum high school and talks about with the caretaker when he went to junior high school and Hunt DJ Qualls (in Road Trip) would have been played. So if you are a fan of Modesty, you do not see the movie, you are simply angry. If you do not know much about the Modesty comic books, which is sending a different movie, you do not waste time with this film. I can not understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name on it. I'll request a refund from my DVD rental tomorrow.
