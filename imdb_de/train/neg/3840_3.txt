I heard about a friend of this movie some time ago, and she recently got it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement when we both heard that this was a scary movie, really scary. How disappointed was I? VERY!!!! Apart from this one scene (we all know which piece), NOTHING has happened !!! I had expected to see the woman in black a few times and she would do some more erratic scenes, such as appearing at the window or running down the hall or something. Almost all the reviews say here What a scary, gripping and atmospheric film. I just did not see it, I'm scared. Maybe there is a difference in what people in the US find scary, here in the UK. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment after all the hyped reviews :(
