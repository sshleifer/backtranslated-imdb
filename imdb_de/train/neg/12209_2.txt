Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and brother both had the policy that the person picking the movie should pay. And though I would never pay to see any of the crap they took me to, I could not resist a free trip to the cinema! So I saw crap like the second Conan movie and NEVER SAY AGAIN! Well, even though this is a pathetic movie, it's in places that are entertaining - in a brain-dead way. And technically, the stunts and the camera work well, so my rating has risen to 2! Why is the movie so bad? Well, in contrast to the first Rambo movie, this movie has virtually no plot, Rambo himself only says three words (except grunts and screams), there is an unnecessary and completely irrelevant and undeveloped "romance" and the movie is a giant (and stupid ) Special effect. And what incredible special effects. While firing bullets and rockets in Rambo 12383499143743701 has no effect on him, and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo fires hits his target! And while the bad guys use AK-47s, helicopters, and rockets, Rambo has a bow in some scenes with arrows that look like nuclear-powered tips !! The scene in which the one villain shoots him as he slowly and quietly starts one of those exploding arrows is especially meant for silent viewers! It was wonderfully parodied in UHF with Weird Al in the lead role. Besides, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX makes a funny parody of the genre - not just this stupid scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, a movie is so stupid and pointless that it almost looks like a self-parody!
