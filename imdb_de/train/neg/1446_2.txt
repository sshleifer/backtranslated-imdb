The film is an extra-long story of a classic novel that completely misses the original spirit of adventure. The rather dreadful American Patrick Swayze is cast as British hero Allan Quatermain despite the obvious nationality. The film is continuously continued in "Hollywood-ise" by changing both the plot and the characters fits more comfortably in the accepted form. The film manages to be consistently predictable, even to those unfamiliar with the story, and is plagued by some extremely bad plays and terribly disappointing fighting sequences pretty bad collection of films based on the legend of King Soloman's Mines and Allan Quatermain ,
