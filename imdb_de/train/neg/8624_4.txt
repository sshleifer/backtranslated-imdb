The drama was not great, the story was full of simple twists and transparent characters. It concerns the effects of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one hand and Moroccans living in the Belgian city of Antwerp on the other. Is it a political analysis? Is it a kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film just is not strong enough to answer both questions (assuming these were also the director's questions). However, some scenes could serve as a kind of Ken Loach film in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point of the right-wing Flemish bloc party and has many problems and tensions between different populations and cultures to fight. It is very difficult to make a film about this situation, and unfortunately this is not successful. Nevertheless, it tells a story about a very real and complicated situation in today's Belgium. The few foreign viewers should try to enjoy it and realize that it is not the actual movie that matters, but the social dividing lines that Belgium, a country with 10 million inhabitants, follow in the 2000s
