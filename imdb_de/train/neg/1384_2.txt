Jet Li is one of the best hand fighters in the world. He's been around for over 20 years, bringing others into the genre to shame. While he is big in Asia, he is almost unknown here in the US. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him, but fails terribly. First, it is dubbed. Although it has a storage value (the dubbing is not even close and the sound is flat), it seems to be inappropriate for the ordinary film viewer. Second, the director in this movie, Daniel Lee, does a terrible job. He cuts scenes so fast, sometimes you do not know what's going on. At other times, the camera wobbles and wobbles. Fans see Jet Lis films for the fantastic martial arts. However, the director handles the scenes so fast that you do not even know who's who half the time. Other times a scene gets stuck (ie Li starts cutting a hole in the bottom of a jeep while the badguys arm their weapons two seconds later, both Li and the love interest are already under the car!) Other scenes are like this unlikely to go beyond the point that they are completely ridiculous (killer CD-ROMs - just give it to Throwing Stars !!!!). Li needs a director who is less inclined to machine cutting and rather creates a cinematic staging. The added rap / techno music is going from okay to intrusive. The storyline has its potential, but all are squandered by cartoon-like characters who take away all the credibility that this film seeks. And should we really believe that the love interest Simon would not recognize, because he wears a half mask? Would not the hair, the lower jaw or the voice betray it? <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or its classic Shaolin Temple. This disconnected mess is a waste of time ... 2/10
