This was one of the worst movies ever !!!!!!!! It was so bad that I laughed the whole movie! The plot was so cheesy; especially the end. This movie is about a doomsday catastrophe to save the eels! I mean, come on! And I swear ... I think they use SOCKPUPPETS for the eels! And in the middle of this terrible kissing scene with the two main characters who were divorced by chance was. How predictable! It was so terrible that my mother, sister, and I could not finish it, and when we finished it, it was about a year later! The second time, when we saw it and this time ended, we made MST3K similar comments in the entire film. Make funny comments, take a look at that if you sleep laugh and I mean HUGE laugh. Also pay attention to ridicule. The metaphor that explains this film: This film is a very flat field full of cheese and sock puppets!
