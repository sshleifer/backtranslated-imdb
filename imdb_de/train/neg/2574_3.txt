I know that movies are not necessarily supposed to reflect reality, but this one got on my nerves. It perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about "psychological trauma" and mental illness. The "psycho-mom" thing has been done too often (and usually better) and the rest of the plot is also far-fetched. The acting was not terrible, but nothing to rave about. <br /> <br /> One highlight: I am a longtime fan of General Hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles of former GH tribe Jon Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> If you can overlook the fake psychoanalytic part of it, just as a person has to expose the reality / judgment in watching a lot of movies, this movie could be bearable. If you have nothing better to do and a relatively low standard. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that I spent my time looking at it.
