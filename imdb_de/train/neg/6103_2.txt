To be honest, I'm surprised by the positive voices this movie received. The movie only stretches over 81 minutes and the audience has to suffer all the way. In fact, there are some positive moments in this movie; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She has a pretty pitiful dialogue and can handle it well. Scott Valentine (Merrideth's friend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a pretty rough watch. I think the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy lying on the beach and wearing tiger-patterned chummies ... give me a break. In addition, Valentine gives us a malicious and pathetic portrayal of a suffering vampire who misses the day (for a more compelling account of the suffering vampire, see Denice Duff in "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The movie moves so slowly and is only positively interrupted by Charlie Spradling's dance scenes. This movie can really only be recommended to the diehard fans of Charlie Spradling (which is me and I still had a hard time looking at it!).
