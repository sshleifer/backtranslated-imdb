Billy Crystal has co-produced, co-produced and plays stars about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility and aging in this extremely safe and comedy comedy drama. Billy plays a cardiac arrhythmia (ha ha) that causes him to locate his strange father (Alan King), a movie extra that introduces a big star. The script is sub-Neil Simon nonsense with one-line galore, a flat, blankly directed production by Henry Winkler (in sitcom mode) and family conflicts at the ready. Crystal and King do their best, but King is overzealous and often over the top. JoBeth Williams still has one of her ungrateful roles, but manages to bring her innate down-home class into the proverbial girlfriend figure. It's a comedy, I think, but one that blinks back tears ... shamefully. ** from ****
