DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE (1 of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Terrible, horrible movie ... based on the pulp magazine / paperback series by Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... on a superhero Adventure hero in his thirties and his five assistants, all experts in a field where they can fight evil. It was a pretty hokey series ... but pretty funny to read as a teenager. I knew they made a movie version of Ron (Tarzan) Ely in the 70s, but I never had a chance to see it. It never played in cinemas where I lived and was never shown on television. Now that I've finally seen the movie, I can understand why. The plot and the characters are never treated seriously ... it's all kind of joke and helplessness ... sort of like the old Batman TV series ... just without the benefit of being funny ... or being visually flair. Corny dialogue, cheesy special effects, stupid stereotypes, gritty action scenes and bad, bad acting. Actually, I find it fascinating in its wickedness ... what could you possibly have thought? Rumor has it that Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in a modern remake ... but I can not imagine that would have proved much better.
