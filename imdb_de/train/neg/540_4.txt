ALL FOR LOVE (as it was broadcast on the weekend) is a romantic drama with Captain Saint Ives, a French officer in Napoleon's army captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland, where he meets and falls in love with a young girl. that visits the prison. There is also an act involving murder. <br /> <br /> I'll be honest and confess that I was not taken away from the movie, as I'm not a big fan of historical dramas and the script is somewhat episodic, but I'll say that this is good by everyone involved and there is a good cast that includes Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E. Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. The costume design, as you can expect, is also excellent. <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised if this movie gets no complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 for the Teatime. Captain Saint Ives lies in bed with a prostitute in full nipples, and there is a scene of French prisoners holding full male nudity from the front, not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly visible. You really have to worry if BBC schedulers have any idea what they are doing
