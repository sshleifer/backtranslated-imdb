Needless ridiculous film version of the literary classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who falls in love with the pastor's daughter Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is a rival for Mrs. Bennett's affection. When Mr. Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, Bennett rejects him. He has to kill the whale and win back Bennett ... <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that might have thrilled the theatrical audiences of 1930; especially the scenes in which Barrymore lost his leg. The film, however, has not aged; There are much better films from this period, both from the 1920s and the 1930s. The two name attractions John Barrymore and Joan Bennett are not at their best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
