I can not believe that they have managed to spend $ 17 million on this film. Spectacularly bad acting, monstrous scripting and effects you could do on an average PC, incredible conspirators ... a reporter who can turn an inexperienced stewardess into an important UN job? What? Not only that, but the message of this film is so inconspicuous that you feel like you've been trying to beat it over your head with a full size crucifix. Everything that this film will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. If the creators of this film really wanted to move people to Christianity and show what it means to truly believe, they would have used the money to help people who are really in need. Well, that could have got some people to actually listen to them.
