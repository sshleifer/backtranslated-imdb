WHITE CHICKS Wait, why could not they have disguised themselves as black chicks, oh yes, they would not look different at all. Can someone give me a Wayans movie in which they did not dress up as ladies? Do not Be A Menace does not count, Jack White and Michael Costanza Ghost wrote (the other Norton Trio members acted as directors). There are never really any jokes in White Chicks. It's only the Wayans who behave like girls for two hours. There are no setups, no punchlines and no laughter. There are many "I think I will play Time Crisis 3." At least for me there was (5 times, to be exact). Someone has to stop making Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the Only Gifted), Kim, Rakeesha, George W. and Osama Bin Wayans. It only harms the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * from ****
