Platoon is for the Vietnam War, as Rocky IV is heavyweight. Oliver Stone's story about the experience of a US Army convoy in Vietnam in 1968 is so exaggerated that it's ridiculous. While most or all of Platoon's events occurred over a 10-year period of US military involvement in Vietnam, the presentation of these events to a small group of men in such short time (weeks) gives a horribly crooked picture of the war. In Platoon, the men on the train see the following in a week or two: US soldiers killing civilians, US soldiers raping civilians; a US sergeant murdered another US sergeant, a US soldier who killed a soldier killed or wounded by friendly sergeant, 90% killed or wounded in the wake. For Stone, who's trying to make this movie, the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a shame. Two Vietnam War movies that I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the true story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
