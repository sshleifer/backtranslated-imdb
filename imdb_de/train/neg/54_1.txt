The only good thing about this film was the attitude of Goldie Hawn, sitting in her little French bikini bottoms, trying to keep a dozen other spoiled women from removing her tight little cotton top while giggling and cooing. Ooooof! Her loins compete with those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and the shot nearly killed me. I had forgotten that everything was hidden in the naughty Roladex of my mind until I saw it on TV recently, where it was actually blurring its midsection in this scene in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
