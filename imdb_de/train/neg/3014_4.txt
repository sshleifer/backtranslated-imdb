I recently saw finished landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. The movie attracted me as a photographer because I'm both familiar and a fan of Burtynsky's work. While I believe that the film can convey its message well, I feel it was made entirely after the photographs and the subsequent popular book by Burtynsky. One reason is of course the extensive use of stills with zooms and pans. Although this is a good effect when used economically, 75% of the film was just stills from Burtynsky's book (which I already own). That's probably overkill, but that's how I felt. If you own the book or are familiar with its work, you should skip it better.
