Christopher Guest need not worry, his overwhelming influence on the mockumentary subgenre is not in the least bit of trouble to be churned up, especially by this hugely uncomplicated jab on RPG players. The jokes are indescribable. Not enough substance to withstand the typical length of a (particularly rancid) SNL sketch, not to mention the vile minutes I watched this drivel. The great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) deserves much MUCH better. One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw it worth mentioning in my mind, and that is to be published here. I hope I will spare someone such a bad experience. <br /> <br /> My Rating: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: 2 audio comments; 7 interviews with different actors; 4 deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom Extras: 2 wallpapers <br /> <br /> Easter egg: Mark the eye for a short scene in the main menu
