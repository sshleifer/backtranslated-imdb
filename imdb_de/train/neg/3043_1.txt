This movie is meant to be a "carefree" story about Santa Claus and his "magical and mystical" wonders. Instead, it's downright scary. Two things in this movie that strike me as horrible are 1) the way Santa looks. and 2) the "evil repetition of Satan" pitch is just strange dances that just get sick. Watch this movie only if it is the MSTed version or if you like a very good laugh. I can not believe that this is a children's movie.
