This film offered NOTHING new or valuable. After we saw it, my wife and I agreed that the studio just got it out and less could have done something entertaining. This is a good example of a "concept only" movie - they have a concept about a movie, and the other details are unimportant, since the Execute KNOW know that $$ is made from the original concept. The movie starts with Cruella is released from prison and released on probation. She does not hate puppies anymore but was programmed to worship her - she just could not hurt a flea. This does not take long after her release and she is back to her old ways. Period. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the movie were the minor characters. Eric Idle, when the voice of Waddlesworth, the bird, hated me - and that's TOUGH, considering I'm a diehard Python fanatic. It was obvious that he did this because they gave him a lot of money (there can be no other reason). Tim McInnerny, Cruella's low self esteem, was funny in the Black Adder shows, but here he is totally wasted and not funny. It had cost a few bucks to get GÃ©rard Depardieu, but it was also wasted. There were also some other supporting actors, but since the characters were badly written, I try to banish them from my head. <br /> <br /> All in all, it would be better if your kids watched TV than bothered to see this jerk.
