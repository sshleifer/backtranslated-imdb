This is just an ordinary Indian garbage that turns out to be a movie theater. As Indians, we can proudly claim that we have the biggest cinema industry, but also the worst. <br /> <br /> how can other poor countries work with real films characters that challenge the viewpoints of their respective societies and we are constantly pumping garbage. Take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, watch the brilliant movies they have and we get crap like Kisna! <br /> <br /> Get real people, no wonder the international community generally laughs about Indian cinema.
