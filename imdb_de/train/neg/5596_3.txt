A group of models is looking for an apartment to live in and is shown by a local real estate agent. However, the models and the agent are unaware that there is a "Hell Threshold" in the flat, and when they are exceeded, the demon "Dethman" is called to kill everyone on his way. The story is told by Sam Bishop, a journalist accused of murder. <br /> <br /> Although I'm an advocate of low budget, micro budget and independent films, I can not praise this movie. The creators are proud of their 24-hour schedule, and at least one actor can claim his acting skills on the DVD, but I can not care. Why spin a movie in 24 hours if one or two extra hours of editing would make the difference? And why is one proud that one is bad and nonsense and a handful of lines are poorly delivered? <br /> <br /> Through much of the film, the models of a property are shown as part of an apartment agent. The dialogue is clearly ad-libbed because no scriptwriter could come up with such an empty diction. The agent does not know anything about living either ... she focuses on aspects of a home that nobody would care about, explains the source of heat incorrectly (did she not see the radiator?) And says the pest problem will be solved if she "the terminator "call. Please write a script - some deviations are fine, but that was a mess. <br /> <br /> And why did the girls move in models? Her career had no purpose in the plot, and this seems to be a forced situation. At one point, an actress breaks the character and says something to the effect of "dude, they get angry," which sounded more natural than any other line, even though it was out of place due to the other bad dialogue Demon made no sense. I appreciated trying to explain how the threshold of hell jumps to random places on earth (including apartment fireplaces), but why not explain where the demon came from? His background includes a man whose love is being killed by another man. How does that make you a demon? (Why did we need all those Victorian flashbacks without dialogue and look over a field? That was overkill.) <br /> <br /> The dramatic pauses between the lines were dreadful. The Sam Bishop character was by far the worst, the interviewer not far behind. Does each question need a break, a funny face and an answer ... followed by a break, a funny face and an answer? I was so frustrated. For me, the only point was to take the time out ... but I'd rather have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour's terrible delivery (and then wasting more time if the same credits went through twice). <Br /> <br /> Who was the character of Sam Bishop? He allegedly "saw" all this and was accused of killing the girls, but at no point was he ever in the story with the girls. How did he see her? And if not, how did he know that Dethman killed her? And if he has not seen Dethman, how does he know that Dethman is the spirit of the apostles? I was so lost ... was there even an outline for an action when this was written? <br /> <br /> The only part that I found pleasing in this movie was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom. Not that it was really important or anything, but it was the only break from boredom I got. I wonder what the director Felix Diaz thought. His music is very good (see the behind-the-scenes DVD for his spontaneous playing), but I wonder about his skills as a filmmaker. By far the best part of the DVD was the trailer for his "Superhero Excelsior" (the trailer alone was better than the entire time wasted). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that I have to be so tough. I would like to believe that this film was a test of what can be done in 24 hours, or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea was never to make a quality movie. But if "Super Hero Excelsior" is an indication, Diaz can create quality ... so why did he choose to avoid this? Maybe the world will never know.
