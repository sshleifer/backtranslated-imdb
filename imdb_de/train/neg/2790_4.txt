Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels to Savage Island, her own island, with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and her young son Alex for a few days with her family. The couple expects to solve the weekend's problems on the remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the harbor, and when their brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that there is a family of hillbilly squatters on the island. The reckless Peter Smoke Pot, while driving the truck at night, turns off the headlight to show it; However, he accidentally attacks the young son of the Savage family, but in the dark he thinks he has met an animal. Later, the family asks Savage Alex as compensation for her lost son. The young family does not accept trade and initiates a deadly war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a very inexpensive movie with a stupid script, amateurish cinematography, but surprisingly good acting. The flawed story is completely absurd and there are many incredible situations. For example, how can two men leave two women with the baby alone in the street at night when the endangered family is threatened? The logical procedure would be to get to the continent immediately and rescue the police with Peter. Then the young family disappears. Julia and Steven leave their car on the continent and their house and their friends, and nobody chases them? Peter calls his sister Julia from Alex when he arrives by boat in the beginning. There are so many mistakes in this movie that I could spend many lines writing about the subject. I think this movie was shot with a home video camera, so awful are the pictures. The good cast had earned a better material. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Island of the Blood")
