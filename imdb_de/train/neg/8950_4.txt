I've heard of this novel a long time ago, and many of my friends have recommended reading it. I searched it everywhere and finally found it. This is a book that every man should read because it is awesome and because of his vision. I enjoyed every page. <br /> <br /> I knew about the movie and could not wait to see it. When I finally did, I was very disappointed. Many of the things contained in the book are not included in the movie (I do not think this is a spoiler) that just does not make the movie logical ... Michael Radford could be a good director. but a bad writer. Especially as an accountant. The movie is not dark at all, the writing is really bad, the only thing that's good or even great is acting. John Hurt is an amazing actor and the only face I could see as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> What annoys me most is the people in IMDb who called it "The Best Adaptation Ever" without even reading the book! Or know something about screen writing! <br /> <br /> You can only understand the brilliance of the story by reading the book, but do not think of it as an alternative. As a fan of the book I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The points I gave for this film are about acting.
