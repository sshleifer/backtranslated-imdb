This movie was so awful that it was almost good ... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Despite the terrible sound quality, the bad cinematography and the many actors who can neither sing nor dance, Anthony Rapp actually (especially towards the end) was able to perform well. The figure Marjorie, a drunk lady, was also pleasing to look at. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and could have been fun without terrible singing and happy piano music. Although some of the songs are (fantastically) pretty catchy (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House is a fun movie, just because it's terrible! We think it could be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).
