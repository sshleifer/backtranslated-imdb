For anyone not using c.S. Familiar with Forresters book, this movie should be interesting. It's colorful, well played and shows a high adventure, but for those of us who know the original stories, it's horrifying. I could hardly stand it. <br /> <br /> For some reason screenwriters seem to be forced to rewrite the stories they are currently working on. Of course, the spoken word is different from the written word, and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film. But why do scriptwriters rewrite history instead of just adapting it? In this case, the writers have done themselves. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: There was no mutiny on Renown. The officers took over after the half-mad captain went completely crazy when he fell through a hatch - for reasons that were not there. There was no court-martial. The investigation court was conducted in an almost happy atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower saga, nor does Col. Ortega's wife. Hornblower himself was not in prison on the ship or ashore. There are many such manipulations of the history of Forrester. <br /> <br /> From a purely technical point of view, I think the film's repeated use of the Flash Back device will affect the continuity of the story. > Why, oh why did screenwriters have to mess up a good story?
