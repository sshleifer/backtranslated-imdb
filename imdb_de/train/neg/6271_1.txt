There are no words that explain how bad NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It just contradicts the description. Something about a computer that can turn personal items into silver bullets that get into the victim's mouth, kill them, or turn them into zombies. The whole thing is so shaky that it is stunning. There is also a girl with PC in her room and the computer talks about a hand puppet !!!!!!!! I do not mind that. The computer also controls things like cars, even if the computer is not connected to the vehicle. <br /> <br /> The "movie" is total garbage. Surreal bad garbage. Spectacular, unique garbage. There are a lot of sex scenes here and there that are not very hot or erotic. There is even a scene in which a woman seems to make love or kiss a bird that made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Up there with the equally miserable direct-to-home video BOARDINGHOUSE or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!) At least it's fun to see it and understand what's going on.
