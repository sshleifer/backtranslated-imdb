How this movie was made with so many big stars is inexplicable to me. This is a horrible clich√© movie with the worst acting that any of these actors ever did. I'm really surprised that so many of these A-list stars agree with this inglorious movie. Even worse, the fact that nearly 100 million are made here in the states. However, it turns out that big stars can cash in, even if the movie is awful. I was sorry for everyone involved in this snoring. Billy Crystal tried his best with what was given to him, and the rest of the stars seemed to go through the motions. Whatever you do, do not fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved it.
