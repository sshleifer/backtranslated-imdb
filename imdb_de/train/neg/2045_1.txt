This movie must have been the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend rented Zodiac (2007) and got it by accident. thought it was a joke before the actual movie. That was terrible, I waited for it to get scary, and it never did. This movie had no actual facts about the real zodiac killer. Obviously the filmmakers did not even bother to research the murders ... They just liked the name ... and decided to write a script that said nothing about their name. I'm upset, I did not know that the movie was not earlier. I try to like something out of every movie, I do not hate movies ... never ... except this one. If you could not have given stars, I definitely would. 1 out of 10.
