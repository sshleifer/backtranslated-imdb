OK, the director renews the LOVE NEWS Director Nikhil Advani after his debut with KHNH makes his second half and waits. <br /> <br /> He makes a 3:30 hour + movie that loses patience, time.etc The viewer seems to have a 3 hour sleep watching this movie <br /> <br /> OK, they had 6 stories So it was necessary, but why? 6 stories? <br /> <br /> We have the Anil Juhi story convincing, but boring, serial shows no such stories? <br /> <br /> We have Govinda Shannon story that is funny and works well <br /> <br /> We have Akshaye Ayesha story believable again but soon get bored and the focus is on more comedy and also on boring comedy. <br /> <br /> We have Salman-Priyanka history, which is the worst, not just acting expressions, it does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> We have Sohail Isha's story to guide you to Laughing, and the trick sometimes works thanks to the boredom that is set by most other stories. <br /> <br /> We have a good history of John Vidya in every way <br /> <br /> But when all the stories come to pieces and parts, the viewer becomes boring and sleepy. However, the climax is not appealing. Especially the culmination of the Salman Priyanka story. Nikhil Advani's dealings are good in places, some stories are well handled, but weak in some places. Music (SEL) is good, but too many songs. Camerawork is beautiful, every story is given a different look, a different texture and it works <br /> <br /> Actor Govinda rocks, after a layoff comeback with BB he actually makes you laugh and love him in this movie although he is old and heavy. Anil Kapoor plays his part well though he looks out of shape and tired John is tired in his role, Akshaye Khanna trumps for a change <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is too over the top and Isha has nothing to do. Anjana Suknani is fired <br /> Priyanka and Salman deserve a prize for this movie that they are shocked. <br /> <br /> Salman Khan does not just act but just talks as if he's asleep and that fake accent that God Priyanka talks too much. You want something to defy her standard, she'll be better off The End. Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is okay, Shannon is okay
