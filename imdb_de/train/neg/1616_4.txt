STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> This second part of the Che movies moves the story to late 60s, in which the man his resistance fighters has relocated to the hills of South America and survived without food and water and increased tensions between the group. Everything comes to a head when he crosses the border into Bolivia and the government forces step up their campaign to bring him down. <br /> <br /> Without slipping between the time and place of the final film, Soderbergh's second installment focuses solely on the action in the hills and manages to be an even more boring experience. And even more cautiously, the score has been drowned out, giving the second installment a rather unwelcome, artistic character that also alienates itself. The film is unshakable and does not cause boredom. You can not fault Soderbergh's ambition or Del Toro's drive in the lead role, it's just a pity that things were so disappointing somewhere in production. **
