Imagine The Big Chill, with a cast of 20-year-olds whose characters are all unlikely, and an iguana-like lizard that's chasing them, and you have an idea of ​​stupidity. It is positive that the film is not scarce in the representation of the monster. There are no peek-a-boo shots or night scenes where you have to imagine what he looks like; he's right out there people. Unfortunately, the design and construction are not that inspired. A little secret might have helped. I have seen much worse, but if you have him in full bloom for a lot of film, your monster looks damned good. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead !!! <br /> <br /> Oh, and there's a twist-end involving the supposedly dead brother who makes absolutely no sense. This was no surprise given the small spelling of the script. As for the acting; Well, let's just say, it was not painfully bad, but I do not expect that we will see many of these children on future movie outings. <br /> <br /> Gore quotient: 2 out of 5; Nudity quotient: 1 of 5; Intelligence quotient: Negligible
