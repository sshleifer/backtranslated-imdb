Words can not describe how totally stupid this story (and therefore bad for this movie) is! Basinger, Del Toro ... what did you think of? So there is a shopping mall and the parking is full. Basinger's character walks in to buy a cup of tea and some wrapping paper. <br /> <br /> When she comes out, is the whole place so empty that no one hears two shots nearby? Although she lives there, if she moves away from the evil, she goes to a remote and god-forsaken place instead of to the nearest police station or at least to a crowded place. COME ON !!! I will not even go to the infamous red toolbox, as other people have already done that. Not to mention how she kills the moronic thugs after another. <br /> <br /> That's so stupid, without the slightest logic, I can only warn you to see it, it's a total waste of time, honest !!
