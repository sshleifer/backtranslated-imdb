Many people seemed to like the movie, so I feel a little bad when I rate it badly. But after 96 minutes I feel like I have to do it. Where the hell is the plot in this movie ?! I must have missed it, I waited for the story to develop and nothing to happen. Sure, the end was "a bit shocking," but they did not care. I forgot who was half the time, so they did not really develop the characters. The spectacle was so-so, most of the time it was believable, but I mostly got it through. So ... without giving anything away, I have to say that there is no reason to watch this movie if you do not like the actors in the movie. I could be wrong, but I just did not understand why the movie was so little or too much. I can not decide which one that would be, so I say for myself. I do not even know if renting would be a good idea, the cost and all ... <br /> <br /> Act: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 Overall: 3/10 I think that's really too high, I stay up with my voice.
