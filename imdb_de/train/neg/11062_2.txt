Way to the ace! You've just turned a daunting, mesmerizing story of a necrophile cannibal into a gentle, mature drama. Obviously, a movie called Dahmer would be one of two types: horror or documentary, right? That was neither. It was not close to detailed facts (in fact it had hardly any substance) It was not really morbid or scary or even tried to be very disturbing (as if you had to try it !!) What the hell was this author / director thinking ? Here's one of the most real examples of sick serial killers we've ever encountered, and we're badly shot, badly bargained gay bar roofie rapes, and lengthy looming flashbacks at his parents' house for a single time. I think Jacobson actually tried to present (or invent) "the soft side" of j.Dahmer.
