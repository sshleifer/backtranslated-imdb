Dude, really !!!! Where have you been the last 20 years, that's shocking in all ways, horror? This is a joke, there's nothing wrong with having a low budget, but it's a laugh when you see the classics, freaks of Tod Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the Immortal Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener The golem and the passengers of The Ghost Train, you can not compare it, it gives it a bad name, bad drama, bad script, etc. Totally waisted money and free time, have seen many movies, were like horror My Eternal Darling, I'm really speechless, have nothing more to say, please do not bother to see something so stupid, please understand
