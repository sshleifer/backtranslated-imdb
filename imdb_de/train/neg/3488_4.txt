Question: How does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration? Answer: By transforming it into an existential alienation parable. Yes, we returned in the early 1990s, shortly after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the subsequent flood of immigrants in the European Union. How to deal with the topic better than a film about an existentially alienated journalist, an existentially alienated politician, to turn his existentially alienated rich wife and so on. In the background immigrants ask for political asylum in a nameless Greek village near the border. I think this way Angelopoulos can show some social awareness while dealing with the existentially troubled upper classes. I mean, frankly, the scene where a high-ranking officer curses his fate for sending his daughter to London to study, enough to puke you. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it can not be that bad, Angelopoulos is a master of cinematography, right? Not correct. At this point, his behaviors begin to become artificial, much like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual tricks are: there are blurry windows, blurry lights, a strange wedding, a walk on the riverbank and people with yellow water-jackets. Mastroianni is also breaking new ground for the most sleepwalking services ever. Really avoid. Go for his early films.
