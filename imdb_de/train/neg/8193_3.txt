Okay, in the past thanksgiving break, everyone decided to watch a movie, and while the whole family was together, and since Fred Clause voted for a majority, we said that. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, there were so many storylines that it was pathetic. Simple explanations of why a particular event took place were void. Example; Who the hell is trying to "shut down" Santa Claus? Is it a kind of company? A little explanation would have been nice. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the movie has thrown you with threadbare characters who do not sympathize with your feelings or actions. Example: The little elf named Willie and the only tall girl in elf village. They see each other twice and then they are a couple, and I could not care less about it, because I'm not interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> Third, I assume that this should be a family movie? The rating was low only at PG. For a family movie, there were several articles with suggestive talks. It did not bother me, but if I were a parent, I could see a problem. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Paul Giamatti was extremely bored with his role, but frankly he was the only one worth watching in the movie. Vaughn had some fun moments, but played the same character as in the last two movies. muffy frat boy. (Nothing against Vaughn, he was good in other movies.) <br /> <br /> So this movie gets 3 out of 10 stars from me just because somebody had to bother producing, filming and making this movie publish. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I would definitely pass this strip on or if you need to rent it for a rainy day.
