And that comes from someone who withstands almost every look. The spectacle and the sound is terrible. For some, this could be described as "so bad it's good". But I take my horror movies seriously and that's just crap - it's so cheap, I think that's my main complaint. The dialogue is often funny - to watch how often you "scared me". The "child" actress is seriously dreadful - I pray that her acting career has ended here.
