When Stanwyck's husband is murdered on the eve of her wedding, she retires to a mountain lodge where she somehow slips off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy attorney Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, resulting in a definitely one-sided marriage being spent on a huge Chicago property (which seems to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck has been tempted by the racing Cortez, but eventually returns to Morgan with a very reserved and unconvincing resolution. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great cast (especially Morgan is one of my favorites) and a good director, but the script winds up and sometimes seems pointless. I was so ready to enjoy this movie, but was ultimately disappointed. It is still worth seeing for the cast, and it's good for anyone who likes 1930s movies.
