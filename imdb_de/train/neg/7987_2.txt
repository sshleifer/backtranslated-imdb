I am sure that this is one of those "WOAH!" Attractions in 1982, when Epcot was opened, but now it's just stupid. The message of the film is a clich√©. The Circle vision is disoriented. And the terrible song in the end is scratching. And I really wish they would install seats. After walking so much, you just want to sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear, there is a movie that looks like it sounds pretty glamorous! You talk while sitting, right? NOT CORRECT! You are standing there for 18 minutes and lean against a short little railing. Disney was to create a newer Maelstrom attraction to liven things up and replace that boring, lackluster movie. NO FUN. Skip it. Skip all over Canada if you do not eat there. Move directly to the UK.
