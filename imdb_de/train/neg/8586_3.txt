What a disappointment ... admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rash and the end result is just a collection of bits and pieces that are poorly put together and put together in an amateurish way. There are numerous continuity flaws that blatantly collide with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader was handled so horribly that a legendary moment in modern cinema is now a cheesy fool who is mocked for many years. I'm not going to complain about the abysmal dialogue, because this is Star Wars ... The three original films had style, cult feel, and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were superficial attempts to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades. Extremely disappointing.
