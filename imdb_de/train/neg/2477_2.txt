If you want to know the true story of Wendigo, we suggest you get a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. Not only was this movie bad, it had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved the book when I read it as a kid (in "Campfire Chillers" by EM Freeman) and was so excited to see a movie based on it comes out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there were too many PC (Politically Correct) undertones in the movie that had no place in the movie. When the book was written, there was no PC. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that you do not waste time or money. If you see it in the video library, LET IT HERE.
