I simply give this presumptuous piece of trash a 1 just because I do not think there is a worse movie in the world directing it. I hope everyone involved in this movie burns and rots in the darkest part of hell. Damn this disgusting waste of time. I pray every day that this movie is just a fantasy of my imagination. I pray that I dreamed the movie and that I will never have to see it again in my local video store. <br /> <br /> BURNING IN HELL
