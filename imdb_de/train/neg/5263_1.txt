This is undoubtedly the worst movie I can ever remember. Everything was incredibly clich√©d and left behind. The acting was also terrible. The camera work was not bad, but still could not redeem it. The author / director of this film has to suffer from Down syndrome if he thinks this film will improve his career. I want the one and a half hours of my life back, wasted with this crap. I would rather watch a video in which the grass grows. I can not believe that IMDb makes me write 10 lines to publish, but I think this movie is so bad that I still have to warn others about it. The reason I came across this movie is that my friend requested it from the local library, assuming that it was the movie by Kris Kristoferson, who eventually got the title of "Disappearance." I do not know whose fault it was that this garbage landed in my DVD player, but I feel someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. Finally, the director / writer of this film hopes better that I will ever recognize him on the street.
