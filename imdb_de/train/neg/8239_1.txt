This is really the most horrible movie I have ever seen. I just have no idea how anyone has the audacity to publish this. The production standards are disgusting. There is no excuse for cinematography here. The camera work, the scripting, the acting and the sound are incredibly crass. I think there is a conspiracy, but it could have been done in ten minutes to save us the time to look at it. The hysterical-neurotic girls in the middle of this piece have no credibility. It is really cruel. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
