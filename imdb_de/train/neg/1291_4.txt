I am sad that an event that is so intriguing and rich in footage can make an event. Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film, probably the most intriguing figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned. Cole Younger, ditto and Bloody Bill Anderson, who would cry for his murdered sister every time he went into battle, did not exist in the script. Instead, we had to watch fictional characters who never developed into someone we cared for. how sad. The costumes, however, were wonderful, as was the shooting in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will shoot another movie from that time and try again, or another filmmaker will look into the sheer wealth of material to write a script about it.
