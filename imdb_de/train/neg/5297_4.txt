It really overwhelms me when someone comes across a movie like this, claiming it's one of the worst Slasher movies ever. This is far from the worst out there, still not a good movie, but not the worst. Look at something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think Charlie is bringing the night, the worst thing is. The film has decent camera work and editing, which is much more than I can say for many more opaque Slasher films. You see his backpack saw torn in one neck, but all the other deaths are hardly interesting. However, lack of graphic violence on screen does not mean that this is not a Slasher movie, but a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The film should obviously not be taken too seriously. The film came into play at the end of the second Slasher cycle and was thus certainly a reflection of traditional Slasher elements made in a tongue-and-tongue manner. For example, Charlie goes after a kill to the welcome sign of the city and reduces the number of inhabitants a lot less. This is something that can only make you laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in Slasher movies, be sure to give this movie a watch. It differs slightly from your usual Slasher movie with the possibility of two killers, but not much. The movie's comedy pretty much tells the audience to relax and not take the movie so damn seriously. You can forget the movie, you may remember it. I will remember it because I love the name.
