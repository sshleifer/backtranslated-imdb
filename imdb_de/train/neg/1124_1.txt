The opening picture was the best thing about this film because it gave you the hope that you would see a passionate, well-made independent film. Damned start because I filled hope. As the "film" progressed slowly and laboriously, my thoughts about this "film" were different: was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors have to pay the director to be in this "movie"? Did I validate my ticket at the box office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie in the theater! That would be the only exception I would make when I watch a movie over a movie at home because you can turn it off at home. Were there salvation values? Peter Lemongelli as a standard nerd had his moments, especially in a dog collar. Apart from that, this "movie" went from trying to become a comedy to a spiritual uplift through a family drama. None of these fronts had succeeded. Oh, and the girlfriend was really bad. Her performance was the only comedy I found.
