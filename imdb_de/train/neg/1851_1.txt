A "friend", obviously without taste and class, suggested I look at Ron Atkins' work. If this is representative of his work, I never want to see anything different from him. It's amateurish, selfish, criminally sloppy and selfish garbage. The title's "Whore Mangler" is a furious low-budget filmmaker who kills a lot of hookers. There is a bit of nudity and some erections, but not a single element could save this from the hangman's noose. The lighting is horrible, the dialogue is pueril and mostly screamed, and the direction is unaware. I saw a documentary about American commercialization filmmakers during the last Fangoria gathering. Atkins was one of the featured. He said there was something important about his work, but after looking at it, I do not see anything of importance. There is also no style, and the terrible video effects (such as solarization) only reinforce the laymanship. Not so bad, it's fun. Avoid.
