Personally, I hated this movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotyped, and the whole idea was a rip-off of The Cutting Edge and Cadet Kelly. <br /> <br /> The main character is a snotty girl who is taken to a place she does not belong to. The whole place hates them, and to make matters worse, there's a hot guy who does not seem to like them (well, the whole damned school can not stand you). Amazingly, she finds a way to fit and make everyone like her, and makes the man falling head over heels in love with her. Then comes the choice of where to choose between figure skating and hockey. She chooses hockey, then goes to the figure skaters and participates in the Olympic team. No real surprise. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was so damn predictable. They knew what would happen before you even saw it. It was so horrible that I almost puked, and when I finished, I had a terrible headache and the urge to shoot myself for seeing such crap. Do not look at it unless you're under the age of ten or you really like fucking Tween movies.
