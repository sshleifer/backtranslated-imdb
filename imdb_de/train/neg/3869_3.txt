This is the second time I have seen this movie in about 12 years. These remarks come from someone who thinks Kane and Ambersons are amazing, worthy films. But the rest of Welles' career is unfortunately wasted on material that is not worthy of his talent and too weak to resist his cinematic embroidery. And if he makes a potboiler like Shanghai, the lack of anything about his cinematic tricks is pretty sad. I could not tell you what he researched here. It's all as yielding as Wave's Irish Brog, which costs a lot of effort, but adds absolutely nothing to the movie. Several Welles projects became so overdeveloped and baroque. Mr. Arkadin (choose one version, each version) is a similar project. The material is irrelevant. It just can not stand the weight of this pasta. For a director who (as here) deals with reality drama, he never feels compelled to reconnect his bundle of dizzy spells to reality. or to a coherent story. The murder trial is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Welles for getting Hayworth to cut her hair and get this performance out of her. The camera loves her. She is the noblest, most elegant, most sultry and gorgeous femme fatale ever to be filmized. But her betrayal comes so late in the film that it feels like a desperate decision that has been made to make the movie a genre it fits. The movie can not be saved by a Noir convention used in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> If in L.F.S. Everything is said and done, the turns are all for what? to convince you that you have seen something thoughtful? Welles to give more? to let you roll your eyes? Welles has no sensitivity to the extent of a story or telling a story directly. One wonders what Shanghai has to say to anyone who is not a crippled billionaire and an intermediary murder-to-four-cross-murder system or a fanboy who is in love with cinematic ideas, without any sense or content. <br /> <br /> Revised, absurd, incoherent.
