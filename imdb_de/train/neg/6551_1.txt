A study in bad condition. Bad drama, bad music, bad script, bad editing, bad direction and a bad idea. Schlockst√ºcke are neither cheesier nor unintentionally funnier than this ... thing. At the end of the movie, you'll wonder why they bothered at all. Poor Malcolm McDowell, did he have little money or something? Are you still thinking about seeing this? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you have not died laughing in the first thirty minutes, you'll see the Cyborg-populated city of Cytown. Avoid that, my movie-loving friends. Avoid.
