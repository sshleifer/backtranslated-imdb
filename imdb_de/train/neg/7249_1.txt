This movie competes with "Plan 9" as one of the stupidest movies ever made. Always be concerned if the same person is: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Author 5. Stuntman and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink has done all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were western stuntmen. Maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> Here is just one example from the movie: In the movie, the sheriff has to take a witness to another city to protect himself. Of course, the bad guys find out and wait for them. But what happens? The good guys come along and a shot sounds and hits a nearby tree. When the camera shows us the bad guys, they just sit on a log and chat. What's up with this picture! <br /> <br /> I could go on. Maybe this movie was meant to be a comedy. If so, it did not work that well either.
