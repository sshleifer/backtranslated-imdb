NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CLASS REUNION was a failure on its release. In my big cities it was not long in the cinemas. Why? Because it is BAD !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good way but bad in a really painful, not funny way. The entire cast of actors was then largely unknown and has remained unknown to this turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea is really great (a parody of Slasher strikes), but the execution is missing in every way. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire.
