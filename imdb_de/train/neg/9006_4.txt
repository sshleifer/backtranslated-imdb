<br /> <br /> After ignoring some of the implausibilities, this was actually a pretty decent horror / monster movie. First I give some of the good points: - The dragon was quite convincing, especially when she was looking through the tunnels for lunch (hint: she likes people). - The action was rather incessant and after a weak start I was completely drawn into the plot. - Sorry, I was rooting for the dragon - she was probably the most compelling and consistent character in the movie. <br /> <br /> Now to the implausible things ** maybe a few spoilers **: - if you hunted a fire-breathing dragon in 1100. Would you storm into the cave with a shot of powder under your arm? Moron. - a female figure with a strictly American name, blond hair and an obvious Slavic accent trying to pretend she is Spanish? Huh - a senior scientist whose Slavic accent you can cut with a knife, and he was said to have been born in Chicago and trained in the US? - A military helicopter pilot doing his own repairs, flying a huge transport helicopter without another crew and being a seasoned rifleman and combat soldier? OK. Um, I will not even mention that in two minutes he gave 3 different call signs while communicating with his base. <br /> <br /> It's still better than some of the 60s Japanese monster flicks, but not much. If we're lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, although the end of course leaves it open. Or maybe they'll hire a real director next time. <br /> <br /> Despite everything, I gave this movie 4 out of 10 points. Add 2 more if they rewrite the plot, and Dean Cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes. <Grin>
