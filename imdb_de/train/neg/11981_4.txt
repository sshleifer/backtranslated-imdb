Yes, Marie Dresler drinks plum juice, which she considers poisonous, and leaves the race. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea, but she is a solid actress who is sure to hold the screen. I saw that for Polly Moran, whom I saw elsewhere. Here Moran is fine - just fine - as Dressler's mischievous friend / foe. Too bad that she is almost forgotten. <br /> <br /> The plot is kind-hearted. Bad guys try to rob the city dwellers. Dressler triumphs and all ends well. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised about the central plot mechanism: bonds. This came out during the Depression, so maybe everyone was familiar with the bonds and what they can do when they are used well and wrongly. However, I am not vaguely familiar with them from that time. They are just like stocks, are not they? It seems strange to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary unit.
