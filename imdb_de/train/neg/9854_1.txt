This documentary (or should I say, a mockumentary) is the perfect example of how ridiculous people can be when they are so excited about something. Honestly, I hate cryptozoology. It's ignorance, it just destroys it. Positive though were the visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some information in this mockumentary was totally fake, and that's really disappointing because it came from scientists. That's why it deserves a 1 in 10 and not an 0. An example of false information would be the hydrogen idea: It is true that according to Chemystry, hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but it is impossible to be produced in that ratio, that is Case. You need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon's belly. There are many substances with hydrogen in nature, but not the need to fly such an animal out loud, and the hydrogen does not appear out of nothing, so it is impossible. In fact, there is something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: this element is harder to find than gold, and I can not explain how dragons depend on it. It's ridiculous, they present dragons and creatures with little chance of conquering the earth, but at least they explain why they were wiped out. Probably cryptologists call themselves scientists, but they are not. People like them say lies like in this mockumentary, and worst of all, some people buy them. But I do not believe that a person interested in science believes in dragons after seeing this. These fake scientists are wasting their time.
