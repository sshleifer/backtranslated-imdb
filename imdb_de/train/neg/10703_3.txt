But Thomas Ian Griffith simply does not have the glamor of a great actor, assuming it was made over 5 years ago. Some of the humorous lines could have been timed to be not just action but comedy as well. And how do you bring KC out of Katia Koslovska anyway? Plummer's character was so crazy that he could have better fit into a Bullwinkle-Toon. Personally, when action flicks show skin - I would have liked to see an equal time between women and men, otherwise none.
