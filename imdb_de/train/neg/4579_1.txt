"What the bleep do we know?" was one of the worst times I spent in the cinema. It was less a movie and more of a post-school special, but nothing special at the same time. The attempt at a narrative in which they founded their ideas was utterly pathetic, which almost everyone will say. Marlee Matlin in her underwear just should not happen. I will not go into that further. What I am going to reveal is a criticism that many can not formulate. Although this film was boring, but also had a big mistake. It was terribly contradictory because it was so manipulative to become a creator of your life, a manifestation of abundance, shoeless propaganda. Interconnectivity is declared as a big party of our existence. However, the film encourages us to control our environment with our minds. It completely neglects that there are other people with brains who could control us, which seems to be more the case. Or at least the structures in which we exist restrict us greatly. In this way, the film was inappropriately solipsistic. Solipsism and networking just do not mix, unless you are the Almighty God. If you are, you will be impressed (?!?) Of all the nice things this movie will show you can do. If not, you'll be painfully disappointed, an idiot, or maybe both. Besides, the title is so ridiculous, I have trouble warning people not to watch the movie because I feel left behind when I mention it by name. Shame on all involved.
