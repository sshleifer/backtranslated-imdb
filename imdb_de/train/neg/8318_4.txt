I have seen fantastic stories, but the space of these is so incredible that it is almost ridiculous. A rich and young man undergoes a heart transplant on the day after his wedding and somehow experiences his own surgery and his surgeon's plan to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for such a phenomenon, what happens next is a mixture of dialogue between ... say ... souls? ... and in real life, where the dedicated mother will do anything to save her son's life. There is no tension or tension, just a combination of a bad and simple plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life. This does not mean that the film is of no quality - For the first time, director Joby Harold does a decent job of directing a good acting team, with Hayden Christensen his first starring role after having the costume Anakin Skywalker, the fabulous Jessica Alba and the gifted Lena Olin had moved out. Everyone deserves a better story.
