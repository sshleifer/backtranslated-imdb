I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison situation, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, an absolutely vile 80s touch, and it's a directing actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad one (you guessed it) a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror movies. But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish / frightening moment. It just goes on and on and on and then it has to end (logically). More exciting and bolder images and his fate as a cult classic would have been sealed.
