Let me first say that I am LDS or rather, I am a Mormon. When I saw this movie, I automatically gave him the doubt. I can usually find something redemptive in every movie I watch. And this was no exception. It has its redeeming moments. But there are few who are far apart. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed, which bothered me a lot, was that it seemed like Halestorm was ashamed of our church! In the LDS Church, communities are called "stations" and the basketball court is located in the "Culture Hall". NEVER call both names. The church is never mentioned by name, and "the standards" refer to what our church believes. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the directors are really LDS or LDS wannabees? This movie had so much potential! It could really have shown our church in a positive light and help the public see not only what we have to offer, but also what we believe. Instead, it was little entertaining and left much to be desired. If I were not already LDS, I would think that Mormons are stupid, idiotic, and ashamed of their beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie I would recommend to my non-LDS friends br /> Sorry Halestorm. You can do better!
