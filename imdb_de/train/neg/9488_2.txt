I have seen some horrible horror movies in my time, and although this is not the worst, it is certainly in the lower half. The script starts with OK. A young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern, hoping that he will make him and his future wife a better job. Sweet, right? The movie then goes straight to the bathroom when you realize that something is killing patients. It turns out that there is a demon in the cellar that harvests people's souls. It is the job of a doctor, a nurse, and a guard in the entire hospital staff to pull those mental patients down, perform a ritual that is basically just cutting the tongue out and then allowing the ghost house support of a demon to come out and his soul to steal through the magic of cheesy special effects. At this point, the movie becomes so ridiculously stupid that I begged it to be over. It was an hour to go. It looked like half an hour of "Tales From the Crypt" episode, which somehow had stretched in an hour and a half. From Tiny Lister, whose name is John Coffey (The Green Mile), to Tracy Scoggins, who plays the stereotypical, icy Nurse Ratchet, this film fails in every possible level. I forgave these 2 stars for only two reasons. 1) His fianc√© is pretty hot, she has eased the pain towards the end and 2) The movie actually looks OK, much better than the current trend of horror films made with Wal-Mart quality home cameras. <br /> At the end, avoid this hustle and bustle, even if you have the blockbuster movie passport (which I do and I feel cheated anyway). As a bonus drinking game, you and your friends will meet each time Matt Stasi (Dr. James Bishop) shakes his head while you speak. They are drunk in the film for 15 minutes.
