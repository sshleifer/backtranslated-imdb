Something very strange happens when you talk about global warming: science is coming out the window, and "faith" and "consensus" are becoming topics of discussion. <br /> <br /> For this reason, I give a failure Al Gore's documentary. Instead of promoting intelligent discussions, he kept the debate on the level of "faith" and "consensus." Of course, if you try it To sell the world to spend trillions of dollars to stop global warming, it may be a problem to tell the scientific truth: we do not know how much of the current warming caused by humans has been. Maybe none of this, maybe some of it, or maybe it crossed the next ice age and we were lucky not to have cooked the planet. <br /> <br /> But the fact remains that we do not know how to do it. <br /> <br /> We are therefore asked to believe in the "consensus". It does not matter that a scientist who deviates from the "consensus" is ostracized. It does not matter that scientific research is about deviating from consensus. Einstein did not "believe" in the consensus, not even Copernicus or Galileo. <br /> <br /> So why despise those researchers who would advance the field of hard questions? If global warming is so incontrovertible, some people testing that theory may not be so threatening. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? That was the movie I was hoping Al Gore would shoot. Istead, he decided to support his support of the true "believers" of the "consensus". <br /> <br /> Really sad.
