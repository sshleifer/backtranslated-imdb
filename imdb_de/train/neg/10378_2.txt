While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells may be intriguing, the execution is downright pathetic. I'm not even sure where to start because I have so many problems with this movie. I suppose I'll just number a few of them: <br /> <br /> 1. Acting? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure, and Susan George (and their teeth) are the stars of your movie, do you know you're in trouble? Not that it matters to me, but these are hardly A-list names. Susan George has starred in a few movies I like, but I've never considered her the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this movie, her acting is embarrassing. For the other two, the less said, the better. <br /> <br /> 2. The ghosts ?? The ghosts or spirits, or whatever you want to call them, reminded me pretty much of the ghosts in the enchanted villa at Disney World. And they are about as scary. And why did they have to be so obvious? Subtlety is not a feature of the house in which evil lives. <br /> <br /> 3. The act ?? How predictable can a movie be? The result of this movie is painfully obvious as soon as you meet the three main characters. If you could not see where this movie was directed after about 15 minutes, you will have to watch more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. The comfortable priest? What is the chance that the haunted house you are buying is in front of a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your home and comes over, knocking on the door and asking if you need help removing evil spirits. Absurd is a word that comes to my mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else ?? It's very hard for me to think about positive things that I can write about. I suppose I give a point for the opening scene and a point for the architecture of the house. That's a sure sign for a winner? To mention architecture as the highlight of a movie does not say much about the actual movie. <br /> <br /> I stop. You should be able to get the idea of ​​what I mentioned earlier. I have not even mentioned the annoying little girl, the invasion of the crabs or a host of other problems. Be warned, this thing is terrible.
