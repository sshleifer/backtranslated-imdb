I rented this movie yesterday mainly because of the good-looking art and the abstract on the back of the jacket. After putting it in my DVD player, I examined the jacket cover again, and although I had taken it out of the plastic viewer, I still could not read any details about the movie about the movie. The film is titled "Evil on the Jacket" and had to find it by looking for links to IMDb on the Faith Films website. <br /> <br /> The film and special effects in the film looked pretty good ... THEN a line reading actor spoke. Oh dear ... this actor's reading sounded like a pimple-faced pimple whose voice just managed to change pitch, and there was no attempt to go beyond reading the lines in the script. At first I thought I had a bad audio-sync disc, then I had to assume that it was a foreign movie because I could not read the jacket ... English dubbed dialogue. If they had cast the right person to sync the dialogue, this movie MIGHT be decent. I gave him a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when I discovered that the bad reader would not be killed, but remained a constant main subject. Yes, it is so bad! The cover of the jacket and the art of the film are great, so there was a star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for the lazy dialogue. I can not recommend this!
