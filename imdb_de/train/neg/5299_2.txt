I really like Slasher movies, but this is really awful. The acting is lame, the script is bad and the atmosphere does not exist. That's right - that's the plot. Very original, eh! "The Night Hols Charlie" is not even bloody enough - if the movie is not scary, they should at least make it bloody at all costs. If you want to see some good Slasher movies, check out "Madman", "The Burning", "The Prowler", "Just before dawn" or "Humongous" for piece of garbage.
