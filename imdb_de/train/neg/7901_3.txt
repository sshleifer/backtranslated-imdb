, , , And that's a bad thing, because at least if this was a Troma movie, it would have had wanton violence and a stronger sense of anarchic devotion, which would have raised my rating a bit. <br /> <br /> So what? Instead we have a very tame (PG rated), barely lukewarm, low budget (Roger Corman produced it with an unknown director who later remained unknown). Gremlins (1984) / Critters (1986) -wannabe with almost exclusively flat humor, little of the logic that Gremlins worked so well - fantasy logic or not, no suspense, no sense of adventure and no violence or nudity to make up for it do. <br /> <br /> Although I'm sure that some of them are convinced The problems with the film are inherent in the script - let's face it, nobody could bring these jokes to make them funny - it seems like the biggest one Blame the director, Bettina Hirsch, in the lap. In better hands, munchies could have been entertaining. <br /> <br /> Finally, it starts, how many great adventure films. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are in Peru on an archaeological dig. Simon is a bit of a crazy archaeologist, always floating theories about the links between ancient sites and extraterrestrial civilizations. He believes, for example, that he sees evidence of laser cutting in old masonry. So in Machu Picchu they are looking for more proof of Simon's theories when they get into a secret chamber. Inside, they quickly find the animal they later refer to as "Arnold", one of the title artists. <br /> <br /> You bring Arnold home with you to your little Californian desert town. Simon, who thinks that Arnold is probably an alien creature, has to go to a coworker talk and plans to tell his colleague that he finally has an alien copy. Paul and his extremely sweet girlfriend Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde) are left to Arnold, but since they have not seen each other for a long time, they leave Arnold unattended as they jump into the sack. <Br /> <br /> Simon's brother Cecil (also playing Korman in a double role), owner of a successful snack company, wants to buy Simon's house and land - they're lying next to his own. Simon does not want to sell, so Cecil comes up with a plan to steal Arnold. Things are starting to get out of hand, and the munchies, who are down on their cravings for junk food, are starting to take the city by surprise. <br /> <br /> This reads better in a summary than it plays the screen. The best shots in the film are shots of natural landscapes in the background, such as when characters drive on the edge of the desert city. Interiors, with the exception of Cecil's home, usually look like badly decorated, inexpensive sets and show, above all, that Hirsch is not particularly adept at blocking recordings and making settings. Oddly enough, given the small size of the production design, Cecil's Home is quite a gem, steeped in the lingering 1980s style down to the smallest detail. Cecil's stepson Dude (Jon Stafford) was an amusing counterpoint. Too bad he is out of the movie so fast. In any case, Korman is a funny actor, but he's much better at Simon here than at Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon is absent for most of the movie. Cecil, who is physically characterized by a ridiculous wig and facial hair, is not only the "evil capitalist" of the film, he is one of Korman's classic ruthless Boorian characters - that was one of his specialties, which were often capitalized in "Carol" Burnett Show "(1967) Skits: Unlike The Carol Burnett Show, which tended to be successful as directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers pushed the skits to the brink of chaos, Hirsch Korman tore far too far away, and the Cecil character does not do this work as it should. <br /> <br /> There are many other problems associated with directors, not the least of which is awkward timing and editing, causing any potential tension or compelling dramatic impact Even scenes that are supposed to be all around the drama - like when the munchies bother an old lady on the street - are a lot too cumbersome for them to have much influence. <br /> <br /> There are also serious logical issues with the story as it is. Where did the Munchie come from in the Chamber of Machu Picchu? The trailer of the movie seems to give an answer, but was cut out of the final cut. A more serious problem is that, unlike Gremlins, there is no clear reason that munchies of cute, cuddly furballs become threatening monsters. It just happens. Since Munchies remains PG and violence remains weak, the creatures in their monster phase are never very threatening. They are also easy to send, at least temporarily. <br /> <br /> Granted, the main focus of the film is not the tension, the horror, the stirring drama or anything else, but the humor. It is meant more as a parody of Gremlins and the countless prints. The only problem with that is that the movie is just not funny, even though I laughed a few times. A surprising percentage of the jokes are mild clich√©s. Too much of the rest of the material is non-sequitur. Everything is going smoothly with Hirsch's bad timing. It was possible to shoot a film that was a parody, at the same time funny and scary, funny and disturbing, cheesy and exciting at the same time, all simultaneously killer klowns from Outer Space (1988). A pity that Munchies does not get very far.
