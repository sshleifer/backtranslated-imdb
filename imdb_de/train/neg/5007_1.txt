There is no reason to watch this movie. A good idea for action is treated very badly. In the middle of the film everything changes and from then on nothing makes much sense. The reason for the killings is not clarified. The spectacle is terrible. Nick Steel obviously needs a better director. He was excellent in the bedroom, but here he is terrible. Buffy's Amber Benson will one day have to change her character. Even those of you who enjoy casual sex and violence will be disappointed. Although the movie lasted 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for it), there are no deleted scenes on the DVD, which means that the missing parts of the characters have never been filled in. <br /> Do not spend time with this.
