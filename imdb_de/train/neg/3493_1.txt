I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is awful. Just terrible. I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not a hater.) And I had high expectations for this movie because I've listed it on many of the "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies" websites. (I am now convinced that these 10 best-lists are just cut-and-paste jobs.) First of all, there is hardly anything in the film. The main part of the movie is talking about the plot, which is an amazing feat because it's thin at best. The action itself may have been impressive in 1978, but is routine by today's standards. A special warning to Netflix users: The DVD they are delivering is terrible. the picture is awful and it's not even improved 16: 9.
