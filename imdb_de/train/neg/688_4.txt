I've always liked Fred MacMurray, and although her career has been tragically disrupted, I think Carole Lombard enjoys looking at her. Combine these two big and attractive stars, add top supporters like Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, connect them to the well-known director Mitchell Leisen and you get a mediocre movie experience. <br /> <br /> Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) meet "sweet" during their visit to the Panama Canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid is a great trumpet player, so he starts a musical career that is predictably meteoric in its rise and fall. On his way to musical fame, he neglects Maggie, who later inspires him to start from the beginning once he has bottomed out. Oh yes, it's the true Hollywood happy ending that does not come too soon. Stars and director of this caliber should guarantee the success, but this movie is so predictable and slow that it is hard to see. The early scenes in Panama are so confused that they seemingly go on forever, and later, an alcoholic skid wandering endlessly in New York. Fred and Carole do their best, but the tired script and the S-L-O-W directing give them no chance. Even the last scene, in which Maggie asks Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment, simply does not sound true. <br /> <br /> This movie should once be seen to some early appearances by the stars MacMurray and Lombard. I guarantee, however, that watching lasts about 48 hours.
