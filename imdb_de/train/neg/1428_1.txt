Although this film was made before dogma was the predominant method of filmmaking, and before digital success prevailed, it struck. They get the point. This masterpiece of 1991 clearly anticipated these developments. Corin Nemec is simply outstanding, as the authors and storytellers never feel better. The pace is slow, but elegant, because the cinematography is so beautiful. Next time, record it on TV, because I guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgic rip-off for TV movies. Direct-to-video has never felt so good!
