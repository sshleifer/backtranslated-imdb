- I had planned to write something that said what I do not like about this movie, but it gets harder than I thought. Honestly, I can not remember much. I only saw it three days ago and it makes almost no impression on me. This is usually the mark of a real stinker. The only thing I remember was that most of them were incredibly bored. The novelty that a Humphrey Bogart looked like the detective was slowing down. It would be different if he could act, but he is an entertainer with a touch. The kill scenes were amateurish and there was no tension that led to them. If you can not spot the killer after five minutes, you'll have to see more Euro horror. The casting is a dead letter for the identity of the murderer.
