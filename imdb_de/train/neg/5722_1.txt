First, I want to apologize for my bad English. <br /> <br /> I'm not a HOSTEL hardcore fan, but I liked the movie anyway. Live feed, however, sucked big time! I have never seen a Gore movie with great acting, but who is surprised? The drama in Live Feed was ... well, not there! I have seen some who have commented on this, as it must have been a school project or something. Okey, but not from students in media or drama school. That was NOT a class at all! And what about the story? A really sad rip off at the hostel. And what about the blood? What about the psychopathic torture scenes that cause your guts to twist and make you sweat cold? That was the most disappointing of the whole movie! Short, fast and NO edge. More like an execution than a torture. Okey, there were buckets of blood, but it did not even look real. The slaughter and the act of violence reminded more of Braindead than Hostel or one of the Saw movies. And Braindead was fun! Okey, I laughed about Live Feed a few times, but that was more of a disappointment than fun! <br /> <br /> So instead of spending 80 minutes on live feed, look at EVERYTHING!
