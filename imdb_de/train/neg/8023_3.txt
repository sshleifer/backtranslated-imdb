After seeing this movie on DVD, I saw the trailer. The voice describes the movie as surreal. Well, there is surreal and surreal. <br /> <br /> There really was only a part of the film that seemed surreal to me, but honestly it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual pictures, especially the lunch scene, where everyone is on the floor, were so nonsensical that they had no meaning. I have nothing against images that mean nothing, but these scenes were simply irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My impression is that the director has tried to convey Logan's inner monologue. I do not know what else would explain what was going on. Unfortunately, nothing that I saw gave me any indication of what Logan was thinking about, about his perspective or even about his emotional state. I could only say that he was not very happy with his physical appearance and had fallen in love with an older boy. <br /> <br /> I thought the end signaled what had happened to the relationship between the boys but not much else. No doubt comparing scenes with the more straightforward scenes seemed more like a police officer than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> Although the movie was annoying and empty to me, it was definitely a tempo change. I really enjoyed Madagascar Skin, and I felt like this movie was looking for that kind of narrative and maybe even style. It did not even come close. For me there is no question: this movie deserves an A for trouble, but a D for the performance.
