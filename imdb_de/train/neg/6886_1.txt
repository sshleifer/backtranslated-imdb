John Heder was absolutely terrible in this movie. I felt like I was seeing a bad college kid for the first time in a student movie. Anna Farris was on par with the course, not good but not terrible (and she is cute). Dianne Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only saving grace in the film (though it was also his bad judgment). <br /> <br /> All in all, I would avoid that at all costs. I'm just glad I did not pay for it! <br /> <br /> John Heder will forever get stuck in the Dorky Kid's typography, unless he's seriously working on his actors.
