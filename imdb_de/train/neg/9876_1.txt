I did not know anything about this movie and went out in half an hour knowing everything about it. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm generally a nice person, but if someone told me that they liked this movie, I'd probably never talk to them again. Anyone who likes it through and through probably has an extremely dry, reclusive personality. I'll also add that they think they're pretty smart as well, just like the selfish fart pockets that make the voices for the movie. I know that everyone has different kinds of humor, some may not even like mine, but that's fine. I do not think that covers any area of ​​humor. This movie is as flat and boring as Wes Anderson's mind. Go in and get ready to go out; It is best to get your money back as well.
