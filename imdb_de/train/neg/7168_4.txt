The author had a pretty decent idea for a story, but many mistakes in the conspiracy brought the film so far that it became almost incomprehensible. Basic elements such as character development were at best glossed over. Inconsistencies also raised their ugly heads. A massive villa in the countryside of Ireland? Characters that "pop up" in the gardens on a stormy night (at very opportune times could I add)? All in all it was not "bad". I rated it as a 4, mostly based on the story and talent of Alison Elliott.
