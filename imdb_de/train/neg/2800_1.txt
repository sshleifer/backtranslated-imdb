One of my best friends brought this movie overnight with the words, "Want to see the worst horror movie ever?" I always have a good laugh about a bad horror movie and said yes. I had expected your typical cheesy B-Slasher, but this was beyond B. This is Z-Slasher, the lowest of the low. With obviously low budget, extremely poor actors, bad flashes, no conspiracy, really bad so-called special effects, shaky cameras and a terrible soundtrack, movies like House of Wax look like Oscar winning masterpieces. The only good thing is that one of the characters is topless for 15 seconds - she had some very nice tits. Most of what I said in this movie was like, "Wow, that's so bad," "This is the worst movie ever," and "I'm not drunk enough for that." Bottom line: do not waste your time (or your money!).
