Aside from the fact that George Lopez is a presumptuous jerk, his show is awful. <br /> <br /> Nothing about Lopez was ever funny. I watched his stand-up and never said anything like laughing. <br /> <br /> His things are vindictive and his hostility to white people spills out of every single pore of his body. <BR /> <br /> I have laughed at white jokes from many comedians and love many. <br /> <br /> This guy has a grudge that will not end. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for Hispanics who only have this show to show themselves. <br /> <br /> The show plots are always Hispanic-style cookie cutters. <br /> <br /> This show may always be in repeat at 2am.
