I was one of those "few Americans" who grew up with Gerry Andersen's wonderful creations. Thunderbirds was a great show for the time and would have made a great action / adventure film if only the writers had figured out where to aim and should not expect it to target such a low age group. Like Lost in Space, this could have been both visual and exciting. It should have focused on more action / adventure and the goal of the original series ... to save people in trouble. Instead, it focused on Alan to save the day instead of his brothers (who were also cast) young anyway against the original). The outbreak was Lady Penelope and Parker. The characters in the original did not interest me much, but I was grateful for them in the movie. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed Thunderbirds more and more for the high-tech scene than for the stories, and even that did not have enough screen time for me. I would like to have seen more cool gadgets. <br /> <br /> But then I'm just a big kid ...;)
