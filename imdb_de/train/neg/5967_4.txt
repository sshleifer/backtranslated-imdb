Just keep in mind that it costs $ 250,000 to make "clerks." How the hell did they spend $ 45 million making this transfigured music video? A virtually unknown cast, two or three movements, no special effects I could see ... I know it must have been written for this professionally designed, thrifty and suspenseful script. Shoot, the bar set must have cost a bundle. I think Jerry Bruckheimer would not be caught if he had produced something for less. I'm just surprised that he did not blow anything up. <br /> <br /> It was not a horrible movie, I think. The female leads seemed to have good chemistry and the soundtrack was fine. IMO It seems only a pity that this mediocre project could be made for $ 5 million without loss of production, and another $ 6 million worth of quality films could have been made.
