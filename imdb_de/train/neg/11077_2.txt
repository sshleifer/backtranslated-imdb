The only reason I chose this film was Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. I can only say it was the biggest waste of a good actor ever made. As far as I could tell, Borgnine was the ONLY actor. The other performances were so uniquely horrible, I am amazed that a studio would actually pay the "performers" for it. Pair this talent level in the drama department with a story so boring and bland that I thought my eyes would bleed when the credits roll, and you have a perfect movie disaster. Obviously, the film was made to appeal to children's audiences, and to his credit, it was better than most of the original programs on the Disney Channel and similar child-focused networks. But honestly, that does not say much.
