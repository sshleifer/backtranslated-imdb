Well, I think I know the answer to that question. For the money! We were so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise products that we almost believe that this movie has something good. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give a chance. Well, I should have gone with my instincts. It was a complete piece of Hollywood trash. Once again, it must be proven that the average person can be programmed to believe that everything he considers good is good. Apart from the insulting fact that the movie lasts only about 80 minutes, he obviously started with a moth-eaten script. It's full of failed attempts with pointless humor and terrible pastel landscapes. It jumps throughout the universe without destination and direction. This is then connected to ............................. Yes, I say it, BAD ACTING! I could not help but feel that every time Mike Myers opened his mouth, I saw "Coffee Talk" on SNL. Was the cat a middle-aged Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were also not prizes, but Mr. Myers was supposed to disappear somewhere under a rock until he was ready to shoot another Austin Powers movie. F, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save your money!
