I just want to make one thing clear: I love Michael Vartan! But this movie really lets him down. His acting is still great, he is still as charming as ever and still looks great. But the movie itself is garbage! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say, comes a little bit masculine ... They're always waiting for her to run away with her best friend, whose own negotiation is a bit weird. Me and my family (who watched the movie with me) were scared off the soundtrack to the movie; Sometimes the music simply did not match what was going on in the scenes. But even that was not the worst aspect of what I found very disappointing. I could forgive the main character's slut, I could forgive the crazy characters thrown into the mix, and the poor choice of musical accompaniment and skip right to the end ??? The end was obviously planned from the beginning, but how it gets there remains untold. If you're a fan of Michael Vartan, skip this movie: Buy a poster instead.
