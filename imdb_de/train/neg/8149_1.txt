What an absolute bunch of pants. After reading Chris Brookmyre's books religiously since I came across "Quite Ugly ...", I was very pleased to discover that this drama had been commissioned. I obviously had too much faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best on this show - and he does not quite fit either. How anyone can read the book and then adapt to this piece of slag is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Whole characters are changed, situations dropped and the dramatic slump of Parlablane on Nesbitt lowers the quick chin and pushing a bay window ... it brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to think about what's going to happen with "Country Of The Blind" if that's the standard ... <br /> <br /> Please just avoid it ...
