Like Orson Welles thirty years ago, Mike Sarne received the "world's biggest train" to play with, but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything other than see his train turn into a wreck, which is still talked of shock and a strange kind of awe. Despite postmodern interpretations, which gave the impression that it was a gay or even feminist treatise, it was found that this was a grave calamity in 1970 and is still a disaster. So royal remains a closely guarded secret. Only Michael Cimino was close to the political and artistic Armageddon, which is Heaven's Gate. Both movies seemed to be ego trips for their respective directors, but at least Mr. Cimino had made one of the great movies from the 1970s before they squandered the generosity of the studio, while Mr. Sarne just shot the rather crazy "Joanna" in his Locker had. In addition, "Heaven's Gate" had some memorable and well-traded set pieces, in which "Myra Breckinridge" closet was tragically nude. Simply put, the worst example is biting the hand that is in Hollywood history.
