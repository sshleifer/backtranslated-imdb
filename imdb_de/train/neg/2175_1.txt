Carlos Mencia screams hatefully "B ** ch!" For women, it's like "n ** ger!" to scream. with black people, unless it's worse. Keep in mind that unlike the N-word, the B-word is the only derogatory term that is still associated with violence on a daily basis. "Bitch!" is the last thing women hear before being raped, beaten or murdered. This guy adores violence by hatefully using the language of violence. Sounds like he's a gay guy trying to cover up by woman-bashing so that he sounds like a hetero. And how about all the white Nazis in his audience who gave the fascist greetings, while their stupid little white women with bimbo whimpering stand by their side, hee hee hee hee hee, who are clearly afraid of this tidal wave of hatred of women protest. Tea hee hee. Bet Mencia does not believe or support free speech for YOU! Come on, Carlos? Do you want women to have freedom of expression to beat you so loud and violent and with big mouths like you, or do you think that "freedom of expression" is only for men who crave women?
