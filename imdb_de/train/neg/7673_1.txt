I do not know where to start. Tara Reid must be stopped before she is inserted into another film. Stephen Dorff looks like he's got the motivation of his character from Val Kilmer in "Top Gun". Slater sleepwalks through this muck. Direction, cut, sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a shootout?), Costumes (bulletproof vests) and hey, there is no discernible plot either. It amazes me that no one was sticking to the project and said, "hey guys, that just does not make sense, let's start from scratch". Hopefully, Slater's career can recover from this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen.
