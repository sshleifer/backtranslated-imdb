This movie reminds me a lot of the anti-drug movies of the 50s and 60s, as it was made by people who obviously never experienced the social evil they warned us about. Tom Hanks and his buddies are "role-playing games", but there are no dice, lots of candles, and then you're just swept away in a bad assembly where Hanks falls on the lady in the group. quite funny, but misguided. I wonder how many poor kids destroyed their D & D stuff, and they were told that their imagination was the path to destruction. As a movie, it's basically a special, bad show (though Hanks shows some of his talent) and relationship talks, and nobody seems to enjoy themselves. It appears that these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the path to adultism, which seems to be more serious and requires you to settle down and do the things that everyone else is doing. Despite my vote of 2, this is worth watching because of its unique genre of scare movies, which I personally find pretty funny.
