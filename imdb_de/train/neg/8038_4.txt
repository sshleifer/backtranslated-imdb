** SPOILERS ** Redicules Slasher movie that does not make sense when a killer walks in a black robe and wears something that looks like a Peter Lorre rubber retractable mask. It was told early on in the film, almost the very first scene, that the young Beth Morgan was in a detoxified hospital due to heavy drug use after her boyfriend was murdered in Tennyson collage about a year ago. <br /> <br /> It was also released This FBI agent Sacker (Jeff Conaway), who is obsessed with catching the killer, was also murdered in Tennyson at the same time. When the movie "Know a Secret" is over, it never becomes clear what these two killings in Connecticute have to do with the slaughter of half a dozen collage students a year later. Unlike the killer, at least in the murder of Beth's friend, the same stupid Halloween outfit. <br /> <br /> During the spring holidays in the Sunshine State, the six students spend their holidays in a beach house. Before you know it, they are cut off one by one. Starting with computer geek Brad Clyton, Chad Allen, the murder even spilled into the city. A number of people who have nothing to do with the target student, including Chief of Police Gavin, Jack McGee, who was slashed. <br /> <br /> The masked killer rescues Beth at this strange ceremony in an abandoned church in a style that looks like the Florida Everglades. Then he finally reveals who he is and what his intentions are, that make as much sense as the movie, no one. Trying to scare the public is all that the movie does and confuses it with a series of unconvincing slasher scenes. The most effective victims of Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, survive at least three attempts at life and end up with Agent Sacker, the film's hero. <br /> <br /> Oz also had a nasty cut on his foot from a large piece of broken glass that nearly cut and crippled him in half, but later, after recovering from a murder he later miraculously recovered had not been arrested. in fact, he had it with the killer two more times, not so much as a slight limp in his gait! It also made no sense at all why Oz and Beth set off alone to catch the killer and instead of calling the police with a cell phone that Oz had, instead of calling the police? <br /> <br /> Beth's friend, who loses her head about her, is as unconvincing in the movie Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, as the two girls in the beach house. They end up with Beth Oz being the victims of the killer and then somehow disappearing from view! They did not know for a moment if they were really killed, or if it was a sort of hallucination on Oz's or the local police. Until the off-the-wall final scene in which they appeared in the church. <br /> <br /> We also get a glimpse of an earlier relationship between Tina and Hank with her, drunk and embarrassed, and try to get her on with Hank as Beth steps in, without Hank and Tina even noticing her , That seemed to bother Beth even more when her boyfriend was murdered at the beginning of the movie!
