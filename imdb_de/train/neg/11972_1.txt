The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" set the direction that the movie usually needs. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy who lives in New York in the 1950s. He has a burning desire to see two people see sex. Who are the best people he has in mind? Well, of course, his own mother and stepfather! How pleasant Unfortunately for Lenny he gets caught before he sees anything and is sent to his uncle and his uncle's wife during the summer. <br /> <br /> Lenny's next plan is for his uncle and wife to have sex. However, the woman is quite pregnant and they are not sleeping together at the moment. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his buddy spend most of their free time with a few girls. They have a small club where they just sit and talk about sex. The problem is ... it's not done in an innocent, charming way of the fifties. I'm not proud of ALL means, but I found it rather disturbing when these kids talk about masturbation, blowjobs and anal sex. This kind of rudeness may work in a movie like "Kids" (1995), but in this movie it just seems to be perverted. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol, as Hedy, a former bra model that becomes an object, is completely wasted on Lenny's carnal desires. Jason Alexander has to stay as far away from the director's chair as possible. "For Better or Worse" (1996) was awful and now that. What a waste. 1.10
