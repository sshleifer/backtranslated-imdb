John Scott (John Wayne) and his partner Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are companions on their way to the Rattlesnake Gulch Rodeo. Scott is a pretty fair candidate, but realizes he has to collect his profits at gunpoint if he is not ready to accept twenty-five cents of cash from a crooked promoter. Coincidentally, bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide they want to take the rest of the rodeo with them; They shoot Promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall) and make it look like Scott and Kansas Charlie are the killers. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler use a running gag in the movie as they use their fists to tackle various trifles. Every time Chandler makes a wild swing, Wayne stamps his foot and hits him silly. <br /> <br /> If you are very attentive, in one of the scenes there is a pretty Lipton's Tea ad that interests Scott's love Anne (Mary Kornman appears. <br /> <br /> Later in the movie framed Jim over a stage robbery villain Jim, who has experienced a change of heart and acknowledged his mistakes, wants to go in and confess to the sheriff, but Pete shoots him down while Jim is patting his story telling the doctor and his sister Anne: In an incredible scene, Anne marches in the midst of a gunfight between the good guys and the bad guys to face the sheriff. <br /> <br /> "The Desert Trail" is one of the modest John Wayne Westerns of Lone Star productions Remarkably absent are George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt, one or both of them are usually seen in these Oaters, but if you're a John Wayne fan, you'll have to see it, but you'll see to be enough.
