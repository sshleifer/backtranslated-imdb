This movie for an afternoon special is not that bad, and that's the problem. Nothing happens. They feel like they are still in class. A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paintball players. We never see these underdogs perform badly while the good player trains them. They suddenly become good players through meditation. Also, there are too many characters and no character development. Too much time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids. This could have felt like 'Bad News Bears' (the original) because there was a girl in an All Boys team, but this movie had no feelings at all. It has no feeling and leaves a dull ache in the bones, it's no fun to pack it, it's no fun to watch it, and it's just ... somehow there. Easy. Boring. Something you would see after class before lunch. As boring as the day is long and it was a long, long day to watch this movie.
