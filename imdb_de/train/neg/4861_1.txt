In the glory days of the 90s (divine tranquility of his soul), you can turn to the great Comedy Central anytime of the day and watch the biggest sketch comedy show of all time, Saturday Night Live. What a glorious show that was, whether it was the original non-ready-for-prime time players or the second golden age of SNL - the big ones - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then everything became hell. I first encountered MadTV about a year and a half ago, and I think I have to faint before the shock. How could such a horrible show last so long? There are so many terrible shortcomings. I assume I start writing. Writing is terrible for the most part. It's nothing more than kindergarten bathroom humor. The cast is for the most part talentless. There are a few sketches I have enjoyed, such as some by Ms. Swan and Stuart, and there are some talents on the show, such as the great Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, just not as a comedian. Although there are some sparse ha ha moments, they are not enough to save this endless line of terrible tugs populated by babbling idiots.
