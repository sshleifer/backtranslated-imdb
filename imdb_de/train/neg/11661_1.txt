Basically this is an extra-long, listless action / comedy. First of all, I want to say that I enjoyed Wayans brother Scary Movie (1), and the sequel had its moments. Unfortunately, white chicks do not even make half laugh. <br /> <br /> The humor is absolutely crude. If you like burping, farts, stupid proverbs, then you should probably look at that. If it's not rough, it's idiotic. The first 10 minutes of the film have betrayed everything to me, totally unsteady, just idiotic. <br /> <br /> However, I've been watching the whole thing since I was with a friend (otherwise I would not have cared). The story is undeniably thin, it was also in a scary movie, but the laugh was at least fast and constant. I think that's probably one of the main problems with this movie as well, the laugh does not come fast enough. Some jokes are pulled out too long if they are disgusting rather than funny from the start. If you prefer your comedy with few brain cells, just avoid it. If you want a stupid comedy with more laughs, then watch the scary movie, the plane, the Hotshots 1 + 2. What if we dressed up as white girls for a movie?) But just did not have enough material.
