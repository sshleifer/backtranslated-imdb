I only rented Creep and was not impressed at all. I did not feel anything in this movie. I felt sick because the blood alone was shocking. I walked out of my living room several times, desperate that something would happen to this movie. Did not we already see that? I did not like any of the characters for the guy in the sewage cask. I felt bad for him. But on the other hand, I could not think about why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep? So many questions need to be answered. Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill, and I can easily see similarities. <br /> <br /> No bad movie, no good one. Judgments themselves.
