Another cult starts again. This is not a spoiler, because the REAL ending comes after you have researched the people who have brought this extra-long, pseudo-scientific infomercial ... Ramtha's School of Enlightenment To hide behind an OZ-like screen of deception, I go away. I thank Ramtha for looking at a borrowed copy of this film on the recommendation of a "friend" ... wasting valuable resources on this New Age lobotomizer would have been tragic. I can only hope that they "really believe that they can walk on the water", enough to bring this guide to their "logical" conclusion ... in other words; go for a walk, drown ... or shut up :-) As a movie ... he earns a strong "1" on the entertainment value, especially for creating the most unpleasant figure in movie history (roommate of the photographer ... eeeeeek!) , If you need to watch this movie, lend it to a brainwasher who recommended it.
