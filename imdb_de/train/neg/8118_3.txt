Well, EYEboy, I have to say that if someone locates me and tries to make fun of me, it will stop me, especially if it is someone who seems as intelligent as you. My favorite part of your post was "But no big bang-bang good guy here, kimosabe, I suggest you stay with Lotsa bang bang on the movie." I like action movies, especially if they are well done, but I also like movies that do not have much action as long as they are well done. I'm sorry, but Secret's and Lies does not fit into this category and is just a very bad movie. I really do not see a lot of non-American movies, so maybe I was pampered and did not know how bad foreign films really were when I saw Secrets and Lies. If I judge foreign films to a different standard, I might one day see how Secrets and Lies may be among the highest rated films in the IMDB. Hmm ... If so, that's very scary.
