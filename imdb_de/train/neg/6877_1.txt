I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico, and in the end I saw one about nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I do not see the 50% living in poverty. When I see fighting people, these are usually Haitians, Dominicans or Cubans who have recently come to the island. There is no Spanglish ... either you speak Spanish or not ... and from what I heard ... you do not. Pedro Albizo Campos is not an MLK for me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man for those who want 1% independence. By the way, he was as loco as Osama Bin Laden. Puerto Ricans who want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want proof of all the dreamers of an independent Puerto Rico, check out Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, all of South and Central America, and Mexico. It worked wonders for her. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary is about the Nuyoreans and their struggles. <br /> <br /> For the person who complains that not enough of Africa was in the series ... it should be Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will make one for you shortly. <br /> <br /> Finally ... for all those ignorant whites who think we need green cards to come to the US and want to know how the Prime Minister handles things. This is not a good documentary about the Puerto Rican culture. Tell your children to pay attention to geography and history lessons. <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc." was about Nuyorican. She promoted it as if we all felt that way. Should have worn the title ... "Your soy Nuyorican ... lunche ... can not speak Spanish." PLEASE ENSURE THE USE OF PUERTO RICO, RICAN, BORICUA OR ALL RELATED TO PR WITH THIS NUYORICAN HISTORICAL LESSON. God forbid that they play this on the island.
