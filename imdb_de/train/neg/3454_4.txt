Cut tries to be what most post-scream slashers wanted to be, a parody of the horror genre that had tried to be smart by referring to other famous horror movies. Well, I do not grab 'Scream' because I think 'Scream' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of mixing horror and comedy. The cut fails on most levels. It has its moments, but overall it just does not work, not even as "so bad is it good" movie, just a below average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes or so OK story are pretty good, except for the fact that Kylie Minogue can not really act and, ironically, she pulls out her tongue. Go ahead for a while and a group of film students want to end their movie, which seems to be cursed. And as you've probably predicted, the cast and crew are gradually chopped off by a masked madman. Unoriginal conspiracy, bad acting and a predictable ending are some of the following elements. The film contains many references, everything from "Scream" to "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". That's not smart either, it feels like the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror movies like Scream. For a slasher, there is minimal blood and no nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher who does not have much to offer. Actually, I should support this movie because I'm Australian and we're not that good at horror (we have our jewels), but Cut is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, it has been watching me for 90 minutes, so at least that's a good thing. I would not recommend this to anyone except Hardcore Slasher fans who may want to know what this movie is about, but if you're looking for a good movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
