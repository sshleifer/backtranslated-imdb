Jenny Neumann (from the sexploitation strip MISTRESS OF THE APES, the US American HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who gets a starring role in an Australian stage production. She is a virgin because when she was a little girl she saw her mother having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her. In the meantime, a black-clad killer wanders around the theater, which slashes people with glass splinters. <br /> <br /> *** MAJOR SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> The murderer is obviously Helen (she speaks in the voice of her dead mother, washes blood from her hands after the murders and becomes seen as a child molester being killed with a broken bottle as a little girl!), but this has a dizzying POV camera work and hides the killer's identity to the end, as if it should be a big surprise. <br /> <br /> The entire cast seems obsessed with talking about having sex, having or having sex, and in one case even laying the ground for blackmail. There is a lot of nudity and blood, but there is no sense of continuity, the photography is bleak and the editing (by Colin Eggleston, who was also a writer and producer) is terrible. The setting for a Slasher movie is five years before Soavi's film of the same name and Argentos OPERA (both are better than this), and Neumann is pretty hot.
