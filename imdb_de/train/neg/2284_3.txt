Well, I can not deny that I had high expectations when I bought it on eBay. This was an incredible out of date work by the comedy master I like so much. However, I soon became disappointed. Sorry for all who enjoyed it, but I found the Compleat Al hard to see. I got some smiles, sure, but most of the comic comes from the music videos (which I have on DVD) and the rest was basically a filler. You could say that this was not Al's biggest video performance (this honor goes to UHF). To be honest, I doubt this will ever make it to DVD. So if you're an ultra-hardcore Al fan and just need to own everything, buy the band on eBay. Just do not pay too much for it.
