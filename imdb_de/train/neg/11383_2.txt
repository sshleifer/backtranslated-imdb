This is a really awful "B" movie. It's funny and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic routine that turns into show business, is almost nonexistent. In fact, the film is just a pretext to spur the war effort on and highlight some popular 1942 music groups, including Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby, and Freddy Slack. Each group receives about three minutes, with the exception of the Mills Brothers, who for some reason offered two numbers. Ann Miller can only dance in the last few minutes of the film, and she has little to do, but to entangle her stuff amidst a flood of patriotic propaganda. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment in the movie In my opinion, the Duke Ellington segment appeared. The band seems to be playing in a move that stands in awkward positions. (At that time, the band was separated in the south by railroad cars.) Johnny Hodges can be seen next to Duke, and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the final moments of the movie, the trumpeter / violinist Ray Nance storms down the hallway to the camera and makes an "Uncle Tom" who wiggles his eyes and wiggles his head like Willy Best did in many films. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this tribute to racial segregation is sad. Some movies are best seen unseen.
