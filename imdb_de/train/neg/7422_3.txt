Well, I could not get into the plot, but maybe that's just me. At times without camera movements, yet this film has a charming vintage quality. The drama is sometimes real and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence with lightly clad ladies, which was nice. The climax is confused and incoherent, but still ... annoying, thanks to Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> The stunts are interesting, especially because of the 70s Las Vegas backdrop. In the end, there are a few jerky hand-held camera movements that make me guess for a while. But I do not think I'll hunt the DVD.
