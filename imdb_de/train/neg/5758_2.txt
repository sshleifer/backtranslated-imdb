You could say that the actors are going to do a movie, but that clearly proves that this statement is wrong. Most of the characters in this film lack something to cling to. They play the role of cardboard cutouts that are moved in a predictable and uninteresting way. The story is very simple. It could be summarized in a few words, but I will hold back if anyone wants to see the movie. <br /> <br /> I had to rewind the parts in which Jack showed us how to be a movie is disgusting eater. I have to say, 70% of this movie was about cooking, eating or eating. To be honest, I would rather not spend my time chewing Jack open-mouthed. Personally, I could have renounced the footprints and jokes that also produced the first half of the movie. Outside of my own dementia, the movie really had everything it's worth, to have time. There were countless scenes and camera images that felt like it was pulling. When something happens, the reactions of the characters are indefinite and dry. <br /> <br /> It's best not to look.
