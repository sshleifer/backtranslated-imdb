This slim, sexy movie is a must. Only with multiple viewing, you can really understand the uniqueness of this film. Personally, I enjoy the narrator for his intelligent narrative style that is unaffected by any topic. The introduction grabs you instantly and keeps you at the seat edge throughout the movie. It provides a wonderful insight into the world of trainables and allows the audience to really connect with the inner horror that this movie presents. The script itself keeps the movie together beautifully. Not only for children, but also for older people, a better understanding of the exercise options and the modern understanding of the sexual experience is conveyed. Before his time and groundbreaking in cinematography, it certainly defines the word "masterpiece".
