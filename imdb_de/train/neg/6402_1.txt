When I saw this movie around 1979, it was the first movie I ever came out in the middle of. There is nothing worse than a comedy that simply lacks humor, and this is missed every time (though I can not speak the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about one of the skits. Although I like funny humor, these sketches were unnecessarily vulgar. Even more annoying was that this film was advertised as "Robin Wilhelm's first film," based on his new fame in the television series "Mork and Mindy". His role, however, proved so insignificant that you can not even see him on screen.
