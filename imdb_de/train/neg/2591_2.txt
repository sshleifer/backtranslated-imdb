At the beginning I would like to say that I am a fan of the American Pie series. Although "the naked mile" and these two are the worst, this seems to be the downfall of the entire series. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best thing about the movie was that it's a movie American Pie movie that's always appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, there is a lot of bad evidence about this movie. First of all, the story has a very outdated "bow" structure. First the introduction of the characters, then the pledge of the betahouse and finally the Greek Olympics. Each of them is exactly 25 minutes long. Apart from the general staleness of the plot, there is little to no character development, which makes a bad act twice. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I did not like the stereotyping in this movie. That said, the jocks are the extremely cool, just about sex-thinking and the geeks explicitly as inferior. Moreover, it shows women only as sexual objects and men who only want to treat women as sexual objects. Apart from that, the action was bad too. With maybe the exception of Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> So in the end, a generally disgusting movie when viewed critically. If you look at it from a youthful point of view, I think it's better, but this movie is rated 18+ in most countries and should not really be seen by minors.
