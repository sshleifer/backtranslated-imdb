Watching beautiful women sneaking around, playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film pleases me. So the house on Carroll Street was not a waste of time, even though the story was invented and the script was uninspired and somewhat irritating. <br /> <br /> There are many allusions to various Hitchcock images, not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the lead role. She's disguised as Grace Kelly, and she's not far away. Not at all. But her character does not convince. As she is presented to the audience, she should be someone with political beliefs and a purpose in life. Finally, the film deals with a clearly defined period, true events and a specific theme. However, in the first few minutes, the story degenerates into a sad, defunct thriller with unbelievable coincidences, high predictability and a series of two-dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable as the performers perform well, as do the photography and set design. <br /> <br /> The final in New York Central Station is breathtaking. It starts in the underground area and then moves to the roof. The film can be praised for its good use of architecture.
