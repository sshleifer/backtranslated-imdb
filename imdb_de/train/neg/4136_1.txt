I read the reviews before watching this movie, and I did not believe them. I love crap movies and I expected this movie to be average. It was not This movie makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like big ones. The movie contains bad acting, bad sound, bad confusing plot, bad makeup - and it bored me so much that I turned it off. Even the nudity was garbage! Did you even have a budget for this movie? I do not think they did. You can tell if you like this movie for the first 5 minutes or not. If you want a good cheese gory movie, take a look at Toxic Avenger 4 or even Lagerblood. Avoid this garbage - I saw it on TV and felt torn off so do not spend anything. The best is probably the end.
