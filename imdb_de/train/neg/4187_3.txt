A film written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale" is little more than an 87-minute music video set for a dozen of the songwriter's works. Instead of dialogue, the film relies solely on Young's lyrics, which are heavily infused with sociopolitical commentary to tell the "story" while the actors play the scenes. <br /> <br /> Given the slanderous performances and the barren grain The effect of the image is the equivalent of Young blowing up some of his own home videos and releasing them for public use. Although there is supposedly a "story" going through the film, we really do not know what's going on, mainly because of the film's unpolished appearance, lack of dialogue, and amateurish inability to act. All we get for eighty-seven minutes is a bunch of aging hippies mumbling about in an incoherent narrative while Young's songs are played endlessly on the soundtrack. The whole thing becomes a boring exercise for self-realization. "Greendale" gives Hollywood's low budget films a bad name.
