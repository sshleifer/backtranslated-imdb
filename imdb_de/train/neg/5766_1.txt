It was assumed that this is the flagship of the open source community, something that should stand up and cry out to the world's media to notice, since we are not in the marketing trap with our options, with open source Tools to do a good job. After downloading the basic version (the hard fan here via a dial-up modem), I finally came to my first hook. Media Player, Mplayer Classic & winamp could not open it on my xp box, and then Totem, xine & kaffeine could not open it on my server. Mplayer could run it error free. It will be difficult to spread the word about it when ordinary users can not even open it ... <br /> <br /> The movie. Beautiful soundtrack, excellent lighting, masterful camera work and flawless texturing. Everything looked real. And then the two main characters moved ... and talked ... And the movie died for me. Apart from the lip-synching and the actual animation of the two main characters (except Proog in the dance scene), it was fluid and fully alive. The two main characters were so badly animated that sometimes I wondered if there are any games on the market with cutscenes that involve less realism than these. <br /> <br /> Every frame in the movie is fantastic .. as a frame, and the thing is great if none of the actors moves. I'm so glad I did not recommend it to anyone. I would ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the last fantasy had a more tractable and crafty plan. <br /> <br /> this movie would get 10 stars if it were not for the movie tragedy that sits right there on the screen.
