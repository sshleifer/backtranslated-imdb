Having known Enki Bilal's comics for some time, I had to watch this movie. I thought that this would be a good way for the artist as Bilal to make his art and ideas accessible to a wider audience. I also thought that this is a good movie to recommend, and I thought I would enjoy watching it ... I was wrong! The movie was a real ordeal that needed to be watched. The idea has potential ... but the film leaves a lot to be desired, and basically everyone watching this movie feels like he could do better. I will not suggest if you should watch this movie or not. Chances are, if you read these pages, that you've already seen them or if you'll see them - but be prepared for a very poor 102 minutes.
