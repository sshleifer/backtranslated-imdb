"I went to the cinema to see" Beat Street "/ it was not bad, it was kind of" decent "/" Krush Groove "was a movie I did not mind / but when it came to" Rappin " I pulled the line.

This movie is seriously shaky (that's 80s speech just because it's awful). Mario Van Peebles is a real hero of an actor. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is a hell of a bodybuilder. Any movie called "Rappin" should better deliver at the highest level of this genre of its time. So why did 6-year-olds roll in the hallways, even back then, when the standard was knee-deep to "Webster"? Because this rap is weak. So weak that not even B.E.T. or Comedy Central will touch it with a 10-foot gold rope chain. Blondie's "Rapture" is a poetry alongside this piece by Dr. Sweet in the hood. So do not be a fool, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
