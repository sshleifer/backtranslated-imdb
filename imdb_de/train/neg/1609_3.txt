The first part, Che in Cuba, is about this part of his life. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che that serve to many indistinguishable wounded (remember that Che was a doctor). It ends when Castro wins the revolution; Che never comes to Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, is about what happens. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and che that serve to many indistinguishable wounded. When I realized that this should be an "epic" (I never knew anything other than the title before it started), of course I was thinking of the biggest epic of all, David Leans Lawrence of Arabia. More of that later. <br /> <br /> Not to be a racist, but apart from what I've already mentioned, the fact is that there are too many characters that are indistinguishable - unknown Hispanic actors who look alike especially considering that they all wear "Che" beards and all Che fatigue. This means that the viewer can not identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel plays only a minor role). Think deloriously about "Lawrence" with Peter O'Toole as the only recognizable character during Del Toros: No Alec Guinness, no Omar Sharif, no Anthony Quinn, etc. You have the idea. <br /> <br /> Because the other signs are interchangeable, this leads to a loss of reference. If bosses are killed by Che, you will not feel remorse, because you do not know who they are. Even if Che is killed (I do not think that's a spoiler), there's no public empathy - he's just been killed. <br /> <br /> He is too one-dimensional to deal with as a human. In addition to being a revolutionary and being of secondary morality in moral sincerity, we learn about Che only that he is married to five children (he tells another character who is about to finish). What was his motivation? A complete puzzle. <br /> <br /> Maybe Soderbergh deliberately throws up lean. Like Soderbergh's Che, Lean never lets us know about Lawrence, the mysterious Arabian man. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and co-workers (Guinness, Quinn). He was as brave as he was insecure, so he had human qualities. Che is like a machine, about as warm as The Terminator. At the beginning of this year, there was another war epic, Mongolia. Che makes the Mongol look like it's a wonderful life.
