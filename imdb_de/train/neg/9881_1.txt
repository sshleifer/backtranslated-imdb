Bo Derek's debut film was out of sight for eight years. and that's how it should stay! John Derek was a competent actor, but as a director, he is virtually the Ed Wood of erotic cinema. This is not particularly explicit, considering that Bo (atypical sporty dark hair) was only 16 when the movie was made! Johannes also wrote and photographed it; The latter leads to some decent movies of the Greek island scenery against which the narrative is set? but the conspiracy is puerile and the dialogue cruel! <br /> <br /> The character played by male lead actor Peter Hooten grew up with Bos's family: they grew up as brother and sister, but now, at the age of ten, they discover they are different from each other feel attracted (but, as I said, do not expect any sexual fireworks!). The worst part, however, is the fact that throughout the film the protagonists harbor an obsession that is not only stupid in itself, but confused in its intransigence. Hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized coastal resort, and continues to expect a cruise ship to come into view (which, of course, is the case in the final). Dereks is even crazier? she wishes to own a large antique bathtub !! For the record, the couple is married at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The mayor and a photographer taking a model from Bo (who, of course, suffers the wrath of the jealous Hooten) are also involved in the non-events. Occasionally, for no good reason, we are even spoiled with excerpts from the showcase of old Hollywood classics in an open-air movie house that houses the entire city (among the titles shown is THE PUBLIC ENEMY [1931])! At the end of the day, while Bos's naivety is undeniably charming everywhere, it's not enough to offset the film's overwhelming boredom and whimsy.
