I like British humor, I think it's one of the best in the world. I like almost every British sitcom (okay ... maybe not Monthy Python, some of the jokes were great, but I did not understand some of them.) But this League of Gentlemen is just something that makes you sick. This show was kinda good; It helped me to lose some weight, because when I look at this piece of rubbish, I feel like I'm not hungry anymore. This is really just disgusting, sick and not even a funny TV show and I wonder who really laughs about it. I watched and switched it off for about 10 minutes. It was so disgusting to see men in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car ... I mean ... what's so funny about that ??? I want to puke. No humor, just disturbing pictures and cheap, toilet laughter ... I do not know if you like this stuff ... you go on ... look on ... but to be honest, people look and enjoy That must have some emotional issues. Rubbish.
