I will be brief because I know that I do not have to say much. <br /> <br /> "Alive" is a strange little movie that obviously appeals to some, but I found it shockingly boring at the beginning. The film has done very little to sympathize with the characters, and the story became so complicated at times that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know others enjoyed it, but I found that Kitamura's "Alive" was anything but a lame, extremely boring drama that disguised itself as a thought-provoking action sci-fi movie. I felt I was thrilled to see this movie based on its intriguing premise and over-exciting cover. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Submit it for Kitamura's far more enjoyable beginner's effort "Versus" or his 2004 revolt "Godzilla: Final Wars". <br /> <br /> ... And do not get me wrong, I'm always ready for a good-thinking man's movie, but it certainly was not. There was not a moment when I was really interested in a single event that took place in this overly preachy, dialogue-heavy film. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boring.
