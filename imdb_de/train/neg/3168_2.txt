I had to switch that off after about 15 predictable moments. <br /> <br /> I was hoping it could improve. <br /> <br /> What I saw was poorly played, directed and written. <Br /> <br /> This movie should never have been released directly to DVD. <br /> <br /> The main character, who is a bride of HELL, has a huge ice sculpture that kills her. She was such a repulsive person that I did not even regret her. It wraps up there in a kind of sky and was still disgusting. I left shortly afterwards. <br /> <br /> Eve Longoria portrays her and I hope I never see her again, she can not even act annoyingly. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd, an actor who usually can not go wrong, was in this guy too. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (not a teenager anymore) is also present, <br /> <br /> I like comedies, BUT not stupid about stupid people. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (from 4) 30 points (from 100) IMDb 2 (from 10)
