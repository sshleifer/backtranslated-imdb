This is just a horrible "comedy" - it's really a bad movie. There are no funny elements. no jokes that are funny. I do not know how some people claim that this gritty short film could be "intelligent" or "quality". If this is the only film a person has seen, you can claim that from the brothers. but I've seen thousands of better movies: leonard part six (now it's funny)! I do not know how the brothers are even considered for inclusion in the Internet movie database: It is more of a home video than an actual movie. A root canal is more comfortable than this clich√©-rammed, undisturbed material.
