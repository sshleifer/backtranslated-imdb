The Wicker Man with Nicolas Cage is by no means a good movie, but I can not really say that I regret having seen him. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie, like the terrible acting and the long scenes Cage is looking for in the girl, hallucinating, followed by another hallucination, followed by a dream sequence - with a hallucination etc, but it's not worth it to stay when it comes to a movie like this one. Here are five reasons why you should watch The Wicker Man, even if it's bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It's hard to deny that it has some really scary ideas, the only problem is the cheesy, unintentionally funny version. This is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 movie or even to read the short story it is based on. <br /> <br /> 4. For a kitschy horror / thriller it's really aesthetically pleasing. It's pretty obvious that the film was filmed on location rather than using green screens or elaborate sets, so we can see a great landscape. There are also many beautiful composite shots. It is a very good looking movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is less an actor than a force of nature. Whether you're a fan of him or not, it seems like it's impossible for Cage to play a "normal man." There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness that he brings to the characters he plays, and I personally am always fascinated to see him in every movie he does. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his unique energy into the game and it's never boring to look at him. It's awful in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student could probably write a damn newspaper about this movie, as this seems to be the strongest anti-feminist movie ever made , "See?" You could write, "This is when women are allowed to lead a society!" The similarities between this "Summersisle" society and a bee colony are quite interesting and worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> 1. If you're reading this, there's a good chance that you've seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of "highlights" from the movie, including Cage, which is in running around a bear suit, and of course the infamous "AAGHH !! THE BEES !! MY EYES !!!" Line. These scenes are funny in context, and they are still pretty funny when viewed in the entirety of the movie. <br /> <br /> I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about $ 5 ... if you find out, it's about a dollar a reason. It's a pretty good deal. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The unrated version of the movie is best viewed, and it's better to watch the theatrical version just because of its little addition to the epilogue, which contains a James Cameo Franco.
