This was a great book and the possibilities for a really great movie were definitely there. But the casting decisions have completely destroyed the movie. Although Hanks is a great actor, he lacks the smarmy, morally ambivalent qualities needed for the lead role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice. <br /> <br /> Melanie Griffiths for the sake of eye-catching is understandable, but again she has not portrayed the depth or ambivalence /> <br /> This film is an excellent example of how every decision, even if she occurs at an early stage in film production, can hit or break a file.
