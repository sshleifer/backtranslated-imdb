In a recent biography of Alec Guinness I could not find much about To Paris With Love. I'm sure Guinness made the movie for a free trip to Paris. There is no other reason for the film. <br /> <br /> Of course Paris will be photographed with this wonderful opening of Guinness and his son driving the Champs Elysee with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there. <br /> <br /> There is simply no chemistry between Guinness and the young girl with whom he flies briefly in Paris. According to the latest Guinness biography by Piers Paul Read, Guinness positively disliked the girl and found his behavior unprofessional. There is no record available for what Odile Vernois thought of her co-star. They have as much chemistry as two castrated cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good moment in the movie, which comes directly from one of his Ealing comedies as he climbs a tree trying to fetch a badminton shuttlecock. But I would not wait for it through the movie. <br /> <br /> At least Alec got a trip to Paris from the deal.
