I saw that this was almost unknown, except for the brief description I read here. After seeing it, I originally wanted to say that the director is promising, but a bit amateurish. Then I looked at the other things he did to see if this was his first or second movie, but no, he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. In both films he somehow missed the spot, and with this movie it was the same. <br /> <br /> The story was pretty awful too. Could someone just fall in love with a girl because she's pretty but has the mind of a kid I gave him a 3 because there were some visuals that I ended up enjoying more, but overall this movie is pretty awful.
