Dear God! I've always been waiting for this movie to "get started" ... then I waited for it to redeem itself ... and if it did not, I just sat there talking in astonishment: 1) it could possibly be so bad and 2 I had wasted only a few hours with sheer stupidity. I had the confidence that Drew could not have made such a bad movie ... and boy, have I ever lost faith? Do not bother about this! Drew tried it, but the movie was poorly written, badly played and just poorly designed! I can not believe that such a bad script was ever funded! It had a million chances to actually do something with the idea (the word "concept" is too big for this movie to qualify for!) And it NEVER went anywhere! It's just pathetic! Where the other critic had the idea that it was not the worst baffles me! Believe me, if it got worse, I would have slashed my wrists before I finished it!
