As someone who has both read the novel and watched the movie, I have a different opinion on why the movie was such a flop. First, comparisons between novel and film are superficial. They are two different animals. <br /> <br /> The novel is probably intended as a satire, but comes as a cross between tragedy and polemics. All comedic elements, as they later formed the stylistic basis of the film version, are just a coincidence of the author's uniform cynical direction. So the author's omnipresent white suit will not make you think this is another Mark Twain, think again. A more fitting literary precedent would be the ghost of Ambrose Bierce in cylinders and tails. Tom Wolfe is equally clown and hack, more celebrity than writer and always on the lookout for new millbase for his selfish mill. <br /> <br /> It is therefore not surprising that the excellent production capabilities and directions used to create the film were doomed from the start. Contrary to true satire, which can be translated very well into the film, polemics are not based on generally available observations of any kind of human behavior, but on a targeted attack on certain humans - whether real or fictional straw men - who somehow deserve this the wrath of the writer. Any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start, with no influence or influence from the writer. <br /> <br /> After I said that, I also find casting errors. It's not just that incompetents like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith can not compete, but real talent like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham, and Morgan Freeman are either completely wasted or have roles that are just cartoons. <br /> <br /> There's plenty of up-to-date material for a really great movie satire, but it does not even come closer.
