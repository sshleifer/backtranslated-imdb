I can not believe this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I laughed a few times. (probably because it was so stupid) If someone had paid me to watch this movie again, I would not do that. The plot was so horrible that it made no sense, and the acting was so bad that I could not even say if they tried. this movie was a terrible rating: F
