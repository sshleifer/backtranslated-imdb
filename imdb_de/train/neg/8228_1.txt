The problem with this movie is that it is taken with the worst camera and the film is blurry and grainy. Maybe it's just the fact that the one holding the camera in his hand could not stand still because he had a seizure or something. There's too much shit and vomit in this movie too. There is someone who vomits every twenty minutes and it makes me believe that this was done by some bulimic or something. It was disgusting. Then there's the annoying shrill screaming that goes on and on and does not stop until the credits roll. I did not like it when all her friends got shot (or I do not know) and she gets in the van and puts on patches. It was really stupid to have that even in a movie. How much gas can a person aspirate to get a van running? It has to be a lot, because they do not run out of gas for the rest of the movie. It was a horrible movie and I would strongly suggest never to see it in your entire life.
