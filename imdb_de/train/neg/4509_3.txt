"Memoirs of a Geisha" is a visually stunning melodrama that looks more like a camp, drag queen satire than anything that has anything to do with real people. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film insists that geishas are not prostitutes nor concubines, that they are the embodiment of traditional Japanese beauty. Apart from a breathtaking dance, the rest of the movie degenerates to "Pretty Baby" in the Storyville area, or at least to Vashti and Esther in the Purim story, as all of the women's art and craft efforts are much older than entertaining. drunken boorish men. Maybe it is the Japanese culture that is prostituted, and not just for the American louts after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is the effort to speak English, but Ziyi Zhang hardly shows anything of her big torch demonstrated in "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero (Ying xiong)" , Michelle Yeoh may occasionally project a glimmer of assured performance in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Where hu cang long)". Only Li Gong shows a real life. Otherwise, I imagined Charles Ludlam in various roles, or even Cillian Murphy, as in the Kabuki Theater, especially since the action in the cat fight after the cat fight pulled down. <br /> <br /> The alleged love story has zero chemistry, mainly because of the age differences, and I felt especially sorry for Ken Watanabe, hoping that his Hollywood paycheck would compensate for losing his dignity as a mysterious "chairman". I remember more emotion in "Portrait of Jennie" when the young girl wanted to grow up with Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton. <br /> <br /> We see brief glimpses of reality as the geishas take photos of normal women's attractions, and as a timeless Ziyi Zhang, the war years come to life in a very colorful kimono dying operation. The finale has little sense of normalcy. <br /> <br /> The score includes many cut-up traditional tunes, with cello by Yo Yo Ma and Yitzhack Pearlman's violin instead of traditional instruments that sound wonderful in accompaniment. The beautiful movie art, as long as you make the conspiracy and the stiff Completely ignored the spectacle. <br /> <br /> As my thoughts wandered, I wondered how the great Japanese directors of samurai films dealt with this story, which would probably have been more formal, but much more emotional.
