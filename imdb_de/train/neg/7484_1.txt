Within fifteen minutes, my entire family had caused the death of Goldie Hawn, or at least Steve Martin's character, to leave her. After 40 minutes we turned it off. There are only a few films a year in which we try to be so annoying that we can not bear it long enough for the story to establish itself. <br /> <br /> I usually like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, and I remember enjoying the original by Neil Simon. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director of "What's the worst that can happen" and the author of "Miss Congeniality 2," and I think that's what we end up with.
