This is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not care what the critics say, it's bad. I think the problem lies with Kundera's novel. It's not that it's not filmable. It's just like 99% of his work, it's presumptuous and oversubscribed. He seems to be in love with himself, his characters look like a navel, and his novels are misogynistic. I have read many of his works (even his socialist realistic poetry, that was really terrible) - I just do not understand what the uproar is about. Features (such as self-absorption) in his novels make for annoying reading. In a movie, all the things I do not like about Kundera have been magnified. Maybe I missed something, but I do not think so. By the way, I can not believe this is a Criterion Collection DVD. By no means is this movie so important.
