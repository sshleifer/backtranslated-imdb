I still have not seen all this. It's wired now, and I always seem to be in the middle of it. My main reason is that I'm a fan of Bill Paxton. He is a pretty good actor and has done a good job over the course of his career. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that while I was never really a fan of the old series, Thunderbirds did, but somehow I liked Thunderbirds ships and effect work. Derek Meddings was probably the best in the industry in the sixties and seventies, and his designs for the international lifeboat are wonderful. The current team has done well to transfer its work to the big screen. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> This is a bad story. The kids are asked to drive the car, and although they do a good job, it's hard to lift their disbelief, especially if you let the eight-year-old son of Brains T2 fly, a huge multi-ton van with all the aerodynamics of a Buick Wo Anytime you look, you will see a Ford logo. The product placement is exaggerated and annoying here. Ben Kingsley does a good job as The Hood, but he can only achieve a lot with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the movie with its very thin merits, Thunderbirds is a fun and enjoyable ride. Do not look at the machines that propel them. <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: I've finally seen all this and it's worse than I thought. The drama is pretty equally bad, and although the effects are pretty good, the story has become cheesier on several occasions. The exaggerated product placement for Ford is annoying and the kids as key characters are reliant on my remaining nerves. Like The Avengers, it's bearable if you ignore the source material. But not very much. Watch the original show and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> And a tip to Jon Frakes. Join a refresher course with the Director's Guild. You can do better, old friend. <br /> <br /> One more footnote ... <br /> <br /> I saw that again. Last night. On Telemundo. Synchronized in Spanish, with strange sound effects. And yes, I came around in the thick of it with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I did not think that an already lame movie could be worse, but it was. It was awfully bad. <br /> <br /> If this had been done directly, no child rescue, no funny jokes, it could have worked. It's just another popular childhood joy that has been ruined.
