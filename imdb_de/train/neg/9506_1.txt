Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 is the pinnacle. It's been said, that's what you get when half the crew fell asleep at work. Do not get me wrong, it's fun, but you'll be tired of mixing buttons. As for the action summary AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no action. Beat the guy in the end and win! Eh, who does it?
