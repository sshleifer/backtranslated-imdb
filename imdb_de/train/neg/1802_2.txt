A bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, my ... this is one of the movies that does not even have a positive effect. From the actor to the story, everything stinks. I just wonder how low I.Q. You should see and enjoy this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Is there something worth paying attention to? Well, there is a lot of nudity, but it's nothing special. And if you just think it could not get any worse, you realize that all the naked ladies were 40 years old. Come on, guys, where did you look for these actresses? Maybe in the retirement home. <br /> <br /> In any case, the leading ladies have sex appeal and know how to show it. Too bad that she is too thin and old. All in all, skip these. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points
