Why do all movies on Lifetime have such anemic titles? "An unexpected love" - ​​oh, how provocative !! "This Much I Know" would have been better. The movie is nothing special. Real people do not really talk like these characters and the situations are really abhorrent. The smooth woman who "shoots" lesbianly seemed more than just the lesbian character. If you want to see two hot women kissing in discrete ways, you can enjoy it. Although it looks like it was written by someone who does not really go out to see people. Why am I spending my time writing about it?
