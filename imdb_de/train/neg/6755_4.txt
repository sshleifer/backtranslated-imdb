Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past that gets more than she expected when she goes to a pool party with a handsome colleague. When her date and friends jokingly say they belong to a "Murder Club," Maddy takes it seriously and goes straight to "Level 3" by tinkering a woman's brain in a parking garage (to dent her car!) , But is Maddy the one who puts on a plastic mask and kills other members of the group, or does someone else lose them? <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie (originally titled "MAKE 'EM BLEED") is very poorly designed, full of holes and spirals, completely out of control, before a ridiculous end standing out of the left box ends. Part of the dialogue is downright ridiculous. I had no problem with Rochon's performance, but the understudy was horrible. However, I managed to thoroughly entertain this full moon release. There's plenty of skin and blood and it's the perfect way to sit around and peck at a group of your buddies. Horror fans can also look forward to the cameos of Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (an early victim). <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
