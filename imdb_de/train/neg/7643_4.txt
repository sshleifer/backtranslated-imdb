A big action star who has fallen from the ground ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a corpse of a federal agent. Reunion with some former co-stars to clean up the city. <br /> <br /> Unobtrusive, often to the brim of modesty, "Action" comedy just does not work. Part of the problem is the casting of Chris Klien as a former action hero. He is not bad, but he really is not believable as someone who was considered a tough guy. Like I said, he's not bad, he's just a miscast for his backstory. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which is really not funny and sometimes seems artificial, and the direction that is pedestrian to the port of stupidity. There is no life in the way things are set up. It's as if the director had a list of recordings and went to that list. It makes a non-binding film. Yet, the film occasionally comes to life, such as the last show that ends the movie. This sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the movie have dropped a lot. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend the movie. It's worth a try if you're a fan of the actors or a big fan of independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise this is just a disappointment.
