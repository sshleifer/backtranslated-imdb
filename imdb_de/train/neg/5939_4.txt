I thought the film was alright, but very disappointed that they did not make the true picture of his life. I had expected his mother to be a true Jamaican, that drives me crazy. Looking at the film's beginning, I was told that the film was not accurate. I lost it only a few seconds from the beginning of the film. I am very disappointed. It's like seeing a bio story about Mark Anthony and playing the role of Arnold. I do not know what the author thought of missing out on a valuable piece of the film whose mother has certainly played a major role in his life. I'll say the movie was fine next to the big bottle !!!!!!
