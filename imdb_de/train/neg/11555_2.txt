A great Slasher movie - too bad were the producers and not part of the script. Basic Story Summary - A man with red-haired fetish enters such women in his apartment just to go into some weird coma and leads them to success in various ways. Only the behind-the-scenes crew would have thought that the movie was as good as mine and hewn the movie out of the movie. Nothing flows, you get lost in the redhead he was with at the time (did not he do that earlier?), And most of the time it looks like the cameraman is going to pass out and continue filming as he does awoke. Not that I can blame him for having fainted or rewound 2-3 times to try and regain the little plot that exists. Warning when you see the end DO NOT attempt to connect it to something that happens before - you only get an aneurysm. Is not it worth the time, effort or God forbidding money. Just a reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 - the small chance that the hacking took place between the movie release and the horrible version I saw.
