Man, that was definitely one of the worst movies I've seen all summer. Granted, it was on Sci Fi, and I do not watch much Sci Fi, but one talks about a gossamer action and two-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped and exaggerated, The plot and setting were incredible, the vampires were less intimidating, funnier, the gore was unnecessary, the special effects were really horrible and the end? The only thing that was unpredictable in the end was when the tomboy suddenly turned into a lesbian and it starts with the female vampire, who by the way is not that hot considering he's about three seconds closer "What the hell?" then "man, that's hot." If this ever appears in repetitions, God forbid it, DO NOT NOTE IT.
