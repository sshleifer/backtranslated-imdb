This was a stupid movie with a predictable plot and terrible spectacle !! Willy Nelson was as stiff as his braids. The film seemed to be a very long advertisement for the bright red lipstick that Jessica Simpson was wearing, mostly because her face had so many close-ups. The premise was not amusing and as I said - soooooooo predictable. Whatever was spent on the film was a shameful waste. Any references to other old Marilyn Monroe movies did not improve the reputation of Blonde Ambition. It was also so incredible that Jessica Simpson was able to suddenly join an executive secretary - that was ridiculous !!!
