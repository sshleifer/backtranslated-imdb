I borrowed this on DVD yesterday and did not know it was a "character study" movie. So I had to watch for about an hour before I hit the stop button. <br /> <br /> Even with a character study theme, I just could not get into this movie. Maybe it was my mood to want to see something different, or maybe I had other expectations, but besides, I tried my best to cope with watching, but gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the global combination did not come together to protect my interest. The only interesting thing was that the sergeant's gun was stolen, and he hurried to buy a new one and painted it black to appear as a police task. I think this movie should have been titled, "Who stole the sergeant's gun?" The scenes were well done, but once I put them together I felt once again taken for something that would make me see. <br /> <br /> Since I did not see it finished, I would say that it's a merit to rent this movie. .. could be. For me it was a waste of good vision and time. I leave it to you to try it, but I would not recommend it.
