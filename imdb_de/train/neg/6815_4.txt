The eight Jean Rollin movie that I've seen may be the strangest; The intriguing storyline (as it is) seems initially too weak to sustain even the cut 84 minutes, but somehow it manages to get confused indefinitely! A suspected female vampire (lightly clothed as promised in the title) is held captive in a secluded castle and only appears to "feast" on the blood of willing victims (who are obviously members of a suicide club), where this would lead , is the author-director ultimately the human villain? actually the kinky father of the bright-faced hero ?? ridiculous as a mutant (?!) Revealed from the future! The slow pace and dreamlike atmosphere (the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their facial features from the protected girl) are of course both for the filmmaker (as well as the coastal landscape at its height) and typically the "Euro-Cult" style, as well as the swarm of nubile beauties. Personally, the best thing about the entire visually pleasing, but intellectually empty, matter was to mess up the well-known character actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in six recent Luis Bunuel films) from time to time!
