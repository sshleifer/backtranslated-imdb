This is the last time I lend a video without having checked in to the IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote the really awesome Night Watch with Ewan Macgregor and with the anti-talent Jennifer Lopez directed garbage like Out of Sight. Terence Stamp is a good actor and it's a shame he got involved in such a bad movie. There are often confusing edits that look like a last-minute decision to make up for the lack or the story, the filming and just common sense. This movie is doing everything wrong. What did they think?
