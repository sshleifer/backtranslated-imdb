I rate this movie with 3 skulls just because the girls could scream, the movie could have been better if the actors were better, the twins were alright, I thought they were evil, but the oldest and youngest brother really bad sucked, it seemed like they read the scripts instead of playing them ... Spoiler: If they are vampires, why are they freezing the blood? Vampires can not drink frozen blood, the nurse says in the movie, we drink them as long as she lives ... but when they move to another house, they get a cooler, which is frozen blood. End of the spoiler <br /> <br /> It was a huge waste of time and that drove me crazy. I read all the reviews on how good this movie was, how many awards this movie won and this movie was fucked !!!!
