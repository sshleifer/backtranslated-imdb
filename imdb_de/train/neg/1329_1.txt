This movie is WONDER. I did not laugh so much about a movie that was unintentionally funny for a long time. Leno should have stayed to get up and watch TV late into the night. The cars in the movie were cool, but the movie is the stupidest movie I've ever seen. it is pathetic, the spectacle is terrible and the plot could have been written by a 4-year-old. Do not get me wrong, Jay Leno is weird, but not in this movie!
