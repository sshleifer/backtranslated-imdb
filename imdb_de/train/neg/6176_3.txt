I'm not a big fan of Stooges slapstick, but I find her story interesting. I've recently tried to check things from every Stooge era, but the opportunity to see Joe shorts does not seem to be easy. This is the only thing I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Some say the quality issues with the Joe era shorts are not really Joe's fault, and I suspect that's the case. Joe as a performer is far from the worst. The thing that bothers me the most was highlighted in another commentary: The pitting of the other guys against the third party violates the entire comedy team / Stooges ethos. Maybe Joe's style was perceived as not fitting by those in charge-though there were no real conflicts between the cameras between him and the others-and that was their way of getting around that. <br /> <br /> And what about the titles of this and some of the other late Stooges shorts? Definitely a lack of creativity that is going on there; Was that the cause or effect of the short market?
