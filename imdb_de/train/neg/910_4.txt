The plot was straightforward and easy to follow, and contained a lot of uncomplicated comedy to a point where it got boring. Some viewers seemed to find it funny, but I like more intelligent humor. <br /> <br /> There were several well-known Swedish actors in the film, and their performance was decent given the script. Lena Endre looked good as always. <br /> <br /> I can not remember the original movie, so I can not say if it's better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan this movie might be worth a look.
