Hey everyone, If you've seen "Singing in the Rain", remember the scene where Gene Kelly dances in the rain. They also remember the dance number of Donald O'Connor, "Make 'em Laugh". If you have seen "Royal Wedding" you will remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling. If you've seen "Jailhouse Rock," you'll even remember the title song number choreographed by The King himself. <br /> <br /> That's what's missing here. There might have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation. Next up was Chuck McGowan's "I can do that." The mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance movie. Richard Attenborough was responsible for this failure. He aimed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Yelling at people who are auditioning for part of a Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be just as badly occupied if he were in a western or in a comedy. He's alright when he's in a Michael Douglas movie screaming at someone we love to shout at. It does not work here. <br /> <br /> Apart from Michael, the cast was good, of course. A good movie could have been made with the songs in the stage production, but someone would have had to think about how to film it. <br /> <br /> Next time you make one of these songs, I hope you call me first. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
