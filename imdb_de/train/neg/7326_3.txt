This movie has an interesting plot, but the drama is pretty bad and the script is bad. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma faced by the main character is intriguing, but due to poor writing and casting, this potentially winning condition is looted. 2 of the 4 other theatergoers left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 laughed about how bad the movie was. I kept it up to the end, but I have to admit that I played blackjack on my phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable.
