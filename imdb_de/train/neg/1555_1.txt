When I decided to star in THE BARBARIANS with the two bodybuilders Peter and David Paul, I thought it might not be so bad as the movie was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has a reputation for sombre movies, but good to make made, dirty films. Well, THE BARBARIANS is a remarkably trashy action / adventure movie that wants to become another CONAN THE BARBARIAN and fail on all levels. The look of the film is wrong. Some scenes were well received, but the tone and the shabby, sticky "disco" look of the clothes and hair that people are adorned with makes no sense at all, even for a low-budget movie like this one. <br /> <Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairstyle and this costume. He is supposed to be threatening, but he looks like a buffoon. And it is funny to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN, running around in her first movie in tight fur bikinis. I'm sure she wants this filth to disappear from the ground! The so-called barbarian twins are fine as muscle-bound heroes, but it's almost impossible to adequately criticize their play, since their roles, like everything else in this mess, are really poorly thought out. The only way to try the movie to distinguish one twin from the other is to have a twin wearing a loincloth covering his ass while the other twine's loincloth barely covers his muscular bottom. I'm not joking! Do not ask me who's who. <br /> <br /> Deodato must have been really desperate to make this movie. And his despair is perfectly reflected in this trashy movie. It's just bad.
