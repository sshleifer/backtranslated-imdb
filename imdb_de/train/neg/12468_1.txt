Simply put, the movie is boring. Cliché on cliché is confirmed and storylines never come together. It seems that the director was unsure whether to shoot a film or a documentary. The main rendition is very thin (a CIA agent is asked to kill an oil prince, gets caught, and warns the prince (why?)). Therefore, some elements have been added to make the movie more interesting. Thus, a child dies, which leads to a "natural" reaction of the father: the free counseling of the person indirectly responsible for the death of his son. The lawyer has a drunken "friend" and keeps him around, why no one knows. Some children become suicide bombers and blow up a ship. All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I was neither entertaining nor intellectually challenged. I did not laugh or cry, I did not understand myself, nor was I forced to learn more or accept anything. It did not mean anything to me, which in my eyes is the worst thing you can say about a movie.
