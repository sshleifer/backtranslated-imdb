The stupid Griswald win the TV game show "pig in a poke" and all fly together to Europe, where they cause one stupid disaster after another. Of all the ridiculous, inglorious money-spider sequels, this one beats a lot. Harold Ramis' film of 1983 was a below-average mishap in which the inappropriate family went on a nightmarish "vacation" across the states. This time, Amy Heckerling ("Look Who's Talking") is leading a catastrophic "comedy" that annoys you more than it will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Hughes script (with Rob Klane) is terrible, and you're wondering why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo were dealing with such a dead-beat project, as even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca had the meaning to reject the offer. Even almighty Michael Palin is unable to bring the process to a level that could be described as entertaining. <br /> <br /> But as unimaginable as it seems, "European Vacation" was successful enough to justify a second sequel! Surely it could not be as unbearable as this one. You know, I have not seen a National Lampoon show that was worth the effort. Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
