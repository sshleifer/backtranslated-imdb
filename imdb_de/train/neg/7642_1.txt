Everyone just seems to want to rave about and not really notice how the movie was made. The deaf, dumb guy is fine, the underdog wins - that's good, the cricket aspect is great, but the movie is overall average. I think it could be done much better than it is. <br /> <br /> The plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real event. I'm sure the movie could have been made more interesting. The songs are just stuffed, and I literally had to relay the scenes where it would be shown from different angles. observable
