I understand it when I want to make a movie that is nervous and different. I understand the comments of the previous reviewer that this is an incomprehensible film. My point is, as soon as this movie ended, my first comment was, "This happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent" ..... She uses papa's money to make a movie she wrote, directs and pays for ... obviously close to the movie to realize that there was no character development and no instructions like start, middle and end ... the voyeur part was good and nervous but what was the spot? I saw a woman who went to a house, found some pictures, screwed the janitor, came out on a very cold night (not believable) to check the noise and walk over her caretaker's love .... movie ends ..... someone is raising my ignorant ars? I really want to know what it's all about .... what was the vision of the directors ... why not develop the dead lover? Why not a background for the caretaker? What is the purpose of night vision? What is the meaning of the lipstick on the car? Why a dead caretaker? Why are you telling us about an escaped patient patient? What about the urn? Oh, and the lamp shall mean that whose house is that? Territorial Why? Why should the caretaker feel like in his house? this aspect was never pursued ...... as for William Defoe ... I rented this movie because he was in it and known for edgy characters. Write back and tell me what I need to learn .. ..I am just a mother in Central America who loves movies .... Chris ....
