Prom Night should be a horror and thriller movie. I'm a big kiss and was scared to see this movie in the beginning, but when he saw it, it's neither horror nor thriller so predictable. They were able to predict what would happen next. The young actors were able to play their characters, but I have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game. It was good, but it's not exciting or scary. There were almost no scenes where you could "jump on the spot". So do not waste ten dollars to see it in the cinemas, wait until it appears on DVD.
