Tobe Hooper made great movies, so I'm sure that could not be bad. I read no reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film. Sometimes that made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes I almost made CRY for Hooper. <br /> <br /> I rated this 3/10 because its 1990's "horror" movie and many interesting or funny things happened there. Throughout the movie, I've been thinking about something: "They just can NOT add things in this movie anymore ..." ... but they did. <br /> <br /> Some say this is a kind of Firestarter clone, but really it is not based on this idea, but that's all. This is a combination of horror, comedy, funny religion / gospel, witty gore, simple effects, drama, horrible drama, incredible script ... and much more the ultimate weapon with nuclear power or something and fails while process child for 2 test persons to be born. When mother sings after birth to her child, both the husband and the wife burn and it is a SPONTANEOUS BURN. The government buries everything and lets this child live among other people and ... then the child grows up after x years and realizes that he was born for a reason and who he can burn with his brain. Then everything becomes incredibly chaotic, nothing really explains everything and ... Well, when the government realizes, "Okay, now he can use this fire element," they take him to a normal hospital where there are some nuclear toxins that they put on this You can kill him, no, you can not shoot him! .. and argh, I think that's enough to say, I promise there are 100 more weird things left in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want good laughs, have a look. My goodness.
