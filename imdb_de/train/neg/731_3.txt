Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Currie) witnesses the brutal murder of his mother and the suicide of his father Morty (Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of his friends for a Halloween party in his family's cabin in the woods. While playing a game where guests confess and confront their worst fears, Mike tries to summon the ghost of his dead father. Soon it is discovered that Morty's spirit inhabits a wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life and the bloodbath begins. <br /> <br /> Most F / X are not very convincing and the movie has a cheap teen slasher theme. Stale history was pathetic. Performers include: Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon and veteran Betsy Palmer.
