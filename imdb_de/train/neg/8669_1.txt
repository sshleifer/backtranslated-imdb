First and foremost, I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury. It's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and stays with you later. It was one of his best books, with Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I just hoped that this movie would be alright. It had many chances with a great cast like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And then there's PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How could it fail? <br /> <br /> There may be spoilers in it. <br /> <br /> First of all, it was crushed. The horror of the book was largely lost as Bradbury was forced to minimize violence. All pictures from the book ... disappeared. Everything that made you wind up ... is gone. <br /> <br /> And then there's the acting. Like many Disney releases in the '80s, the children can not perform in this film. And that annoyed me a lot, none of them looked 13, but 9 or 10 out. Her strong friendship was not addressed. It was more like they were acquaintances. <br /> <br /> You'd think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could do that in their roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here it is as if they just do not care. All they want to do is somehow mortgage or something to pay. This is by far not just one of the best services. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was fine with the witch, but the Dust Witch draftsman himself was not in a good mood. She is much less evil and does not have the presence she did in the book. <br /> <br /> And everything that was not in the book. The nocturnal chase, the marking of Jim's house, the true death of Mr. Dark, what happened to Mr. Coogan in the carousel, the fate of the rod dealer, the true death of the witch and oh so much more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad even for the 80s. The carousel of doom for a cause with the superimposed horses was not really scary and that crazy green fog that really had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on how this movie broke up the original novel, but it makes blood boil. Do not watch this movie, but read the book. It's a classic from Bradbury.
