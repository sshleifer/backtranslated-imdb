Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it's ridiculous to play him as a cuddly romantic lead. The fact that he dances so well, sounds so effective and so completely throws himself into the role just makes him look even scarier. In his cute moments (with the girl in the station, in the last number with Rosie) I could not avert him, he was so repulsive. You keep expecting him to drop the nice guy and growl. Vanessa Williams was the real star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 film. When you see a production of the stage musical, the 1963 movie, and the 1995 movie, you'll see three versions with more revisions (different songs , same songs that are assigned to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical I've ever seen.
