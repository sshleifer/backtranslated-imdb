Today I visited with my two children (6 & 8 years old) an Athenean Cinema, paid 3 x 12 Euro (about 45 US $) and gas, popcorn & soda. I was asked to return my 3D glasses after leaving the theater and was "forced" to see something that could have been a great 3D movie masterpiece, but it only turned out to be sick propaganda film as in a "cold war "as I had not seen him in the last 20 years ... TO BE A CHILDREN'S MOVIE ... IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN! <br /> <br /> PS 1: The average working Greek does not earn more than 850 Euro per month (about 1050 US $). <br /> <br /> PS 2 My kids liked it ... but then again they're not more than babies> in Greek: Mora, idiots> like the one who wrote the script & the others who wrote this "3D Shame "have made possible. <br /> <br /> PS 3 3D animations are fantastic, but who gives a ....!
