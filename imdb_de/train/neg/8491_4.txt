Despite some occasionally original elements, such as the "virtual sets" that form the backdrop for the Victorian interior with Ada Lovelace and her circle, this film remains behind and eventually disappoints. The newcomer Francesca Faridany seems to be talented, but is wasted as Emmy, a character who stares at the middle of the film only a monitor that tells Lady Ada an autobiography. 'Conceiving Ada' takes off briefly when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; The camera sticks to her facial expressions, her manners and even makes them appear invisible or momentarily invisible. She assembles herself in scenes to dramatize Emmy's "virtual" rendition of her. It has been worthwhile, but unfortunately, this film makes one in both Lady Ada's life and that of a modern computer scientist (and her broad-minded, stupid friend) Hashish.
