I was really looking forward to seeing Nana after seeing Renoir's amazing debut work, Whirlpool of Fate. I had read that Nana was generally considered his best silent movie, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, this felt like a big step backwards. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessling is the main problem with this movie. Her acting is exaggerated, even for a silent movie. Her acting is more like what one would expect from an early teenager in a movie, not the late 20's. She usually has the same face, which reminds me of someone with constipation pain. It was also very hard to believe that every man would fall for this femme fatale. There was nothing lovely about her. <br /> <br /> The movie was also quite long, the camera work was uninteresting (apart from a horserace setting) and the cut was boring. The story reminded me of Pabst's Pandora box. It's interesting to compare the two, as there are only three years between these films. Pandora's Box simply scores at all levels where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This movie is only for Renoir's executors or very serious silent movie enthusiasts.
