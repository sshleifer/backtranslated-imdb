In this film, Ben Chaplin is a bored bank clerk in the UK, who orders a mail order company from Russia, receives Nicole Kidman by mail, and gets more than he expected if, surprisingly, that's not what she appears to be. The story is pretty predictable and Chaplin submits himself so much that it gets a little annoying. Kidman is actually pretty good in this role, making her character the only thing interesting in this movie. GRADE: C
