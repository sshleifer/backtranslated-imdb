I like monster movies in general. Even if they are not plausible and stupid. But it's hard to like this movie when it's so implausible and stupid AND tries to take it seriously at the same time. Like in a very noble way. <br /> <br /> Although the idea is somewhat factual, as orcas are known to kill Great White Sharks, it is really difficult to scare them when I can not help but see an angry Shamoo Things destroyed. Especially the one scene in which a building exploded because the orca erupted ... and as it explodes, the thing jumps out of the water and it feels like I'm watching a show with a fireworks display in Sea World. They also kill many of those fearsome moments before even hinting that they will happen. In addition, JAWS needs a few bumps. It's like "Hey, we're factual and we can find BETTER reasons why the orca is attacking". <br /> <br /> Yes, you are and ignore your monstrous tricks in logic. But JAWS had one thing your movie does not have. Its scary. Yes, it is implausible. Yes, it is something outrageous. But honestly, whether factually or not, a killer shark is not as scary as a white man. And the bad attempt to develop and write character only hurts it more. Even JAWS the Revenge is scary.
