A hint I think may contain the various comments on this thread. <br /> <br /> I was quite surprised at the number of people who liked this movie, who wanted to make it "compulsory" or "compulsory". <I think that gives us some insight into the reason for this film and the underlying problem is so polarizing. <br /> <br /> The issue of global warming speaks to people who want to force others to "do it right". Above all, it appeals to "more liberal" people who are leaning because it has nothing to do with bedroom morality, which usually causes conservatives to be "good." <br /> <br /> And that's the problem with the movie. Al Gore is a politician. And very successful. He just can not help but turn to those who want to force others to do as they would. The political attraction is just too big. <br /> <br /> And this leaves us with a scientific problem that can be of great importance, reduced to a political problem that appeals to those who are in the political body and who have a preference for others " ". <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how the environmental movement was abducted by such people.
