Jeremy Northam battles a "Total Recall" script and a disposable romantic side play to bring a confused character to life. Lucy Liu completes her play from a wooden beginning to a worker-like finish. When you watch your interviews on the DVD, you need to laugh when using the words "femme fatal" and "romance". She is not the French film noir actress, and she lacks chemistry. <br /> <br /> This film does not fail in action or action sequences, but in the lack of attention to detail in film photography and the shitty fist depicting the world of technology that surrounds the main actors. There is little attempt to disguise the scenery to depict a coherent cinematic landscape or period. Automobiles are from the 1990s and the architecture is barely contemporary with open plans that suggest a more limited budget than deliberate set-dressing techniques. <br /> <br /> The technology is extremely funny. Massive "2001: A Space Odyssey" - Mainframes powered by portable CD-ROMs whose data was inexplicably collected, despite the growing communication network that even the most ignorant technologist would be aware of nowadays. There is obviously a lack of research here and given the open-source nature of the cyber community, research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal time. DVD Interviews Also Reveal The Original The name of the film was "Company Man," but this was probably set to exploit Matrix hype. The title "Cypher" has only the slightest connection to the film. Terry Gilliam would have done wonders with this concept; and completely rewritten the Decalogue. <br /> <br /> This is tele-movie quality and extremely disappointing for a movie length. It could have made a good signing for "alias".
