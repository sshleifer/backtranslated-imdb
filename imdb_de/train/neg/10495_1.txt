I think Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I do not have the guts to be less than a meter from a Croc. <br /> <br /> But everything in this movie is bad. Princely jokes, people being eaten, and the sketch about the president make the movie one of the worst of times. <br /> <br /> It's a really bad movie to stay away from. All "jokes" are so young that you will laugh because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that Croc Hunter did not ask the crocodile to eat him after he saw this.
