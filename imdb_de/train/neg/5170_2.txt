Wow, could have been such a good movie, starting with Brittany Daniels tied up, I think cool that we'll get a retrospective, but nothing, the movie starts afresh with the child's shooting. Without the acting, this film would probably have been better. I mean, acting was mostly awful. Although the poor actors had to do with the lines, they probably did the best they could. Still, she really ruins the movie for me. The twins were the only ones who seem to have some acting skills .. The film takes too long after the supposedly shocking conclusion. All in all, I have seen worse low budget movies, but considering that this was a hype with the 8 movies I had to die for, I was very disappointed some critics said it was gore and stuff. Did I watch the same movie ... Well, that's 4 out of 8, and so far only one was good.
