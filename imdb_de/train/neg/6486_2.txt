If there is one thing you can rely on at Disney, it's her uncanny ability to tell a story and tell it over and over again. Even seeing the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a terrible experience. Disney is going to ruin one of their greatest classics ever. There was even this spaghetti meatball scene. It was done before! And I say that unfortunately directly to the video (the whole concept should be banned). Everything is just a remake of the original movie and even some of Bluth's really bad movies. The penguin and walrus duo (I even forgot their names) are just a bad copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats almost all her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really miserable. I have never heard such bad songs from them. And the dialogue is cruel. It is pathetic and simple. On the positive side, at least they took the time to make the animation a bit decent. All the usual characters are not as annoying as they used to be (or maybe that's a disadvantage for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, Melody is just so disgustingly sweet that you could easily vomit. I almost did it. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. Do not waste your money on it. It's not as terrible as Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but that's no comfort.
