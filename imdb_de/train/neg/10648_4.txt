The final of the Weissmuller Tarzan films is rather weak. There are a few things that derail this movie. <br /> <br /> First, Tarzan spends much of the movie in floppy sandals. In my opinion, any Tarzan footwear, be it sandals or boots, as it is sometimes portrayed, takes off the figure that is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle. Second, the character As mentioned in an earlier post, Benji derailed the film as a comic strip. For me his character is not necessary for the plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Even though Weissmuller still makes an outstanding figure as Tarzan, it is obvious that he was not in his best shape. In his later jungle Jim films, his physique had improved slightly over this film. <br /> <br /> Fighting the Octopus is a great idea, but I think it should have been done in a previous Weissmuller movie when it was at its peak. Likewise, the battle, which lasts only 30 seconds, would be much more exciting if it extended to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and His Mate. <br /> <br /> And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are overwhelming to the eye, it does not manage to save this last Weissmuller movie - a disappointing conclusion to a great character run.
