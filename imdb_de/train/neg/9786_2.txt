OK, I bought this movie from Woolworths for my friend because he had a joke on his birthday because there was a sexual allusion on the cover picture. <br /> <br /> But we decided to see it anyway. Just for fun. <br /> <br /> And I'm sorry, but that must be one of the worst movies in history. <br /> <br /> It all started well and we thought "Ok, that could be okay". But after about 10 minutes we were wrong. <br /> <br /> It all started when the "mysterious paintballer" was the most obvious character, the Scouser / Australian (I say this because he had an accent that can not be identified), who I could say was miserable. <br /> <br /> Then it was over and until then we all had the will to live. The paintball final. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this story is that they did not really win, but annoying enough that they won by default. <br /> <br /> And I know It has nothing to do with it, but the name the team received was awful. Critical damage. I mean, they could choose a bigger name like "The Destroyer of the Anti-Christ" or something. Or so the movie should be called anyway.
