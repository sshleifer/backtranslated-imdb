I only rented this movie because I liked the cover. As soon as the movie started, I had regretted it. It seems they used a home video camera to shoot this movie and let a little kid do it. They also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to frighten and scare people, but I had to laugh, I could have put this together and doing a better job had some really good ideas, but they were dodgy and in some cases they became overshadowed. It had no direction. <br /> <br /> I did not want to go through it all because it was causing me physical pain, but I always finish what I'm doing, so I took a deep breath and let it go on. In any case, you were wasted in 98 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> I would save the embarrassment of knowing that you saw "Haunted Boat" and would find something more entertaining. I'm a fan of low-budget horror movies, but that was a big disappointment. I thought nothing could get worse after "Terror Toons," but that made me think it over. A disappointment to his genre. <br /> <br /> * out of ***** (The star is for the ideas to have the worst fears for her)
