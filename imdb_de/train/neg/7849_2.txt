The film begins after a remake of recent years, when the military set up electronic surveillance equipment in the desert, where the attacks took place in the first film. The crew is killed not long before the appearance of a group of soldiers who find no one around. You can fill in the rest. <br /> <br /> This is an all-around picture. There seems to be no passion in anyone's performances, or in someone behind the camera. This is a movie made for the money and nothing else. At some level, it should have worked, it could have been a dreadful Southern Comfort (where the National Guards meet some people in the marshes), but instead, it's not much of anything. For the most part, the script, written in part by Wes Craven, can be held responsible for always having the same old goals. Add to the chaos the fact that the direction is boring and the arrangement of the sequences is so lackluster that any inherent tension in any scene is eliminated. <br /> <br /> It's not bad in itself, but it's bad and boring. Let me put my feelings into context: The reason I saw this movie was that a local multiplexer filmed this movie instead of the kids flicking the Last Mimzy and I wanted to see what made the scream (me my, the movies have so much in common - he says sarcastically, I'm convinced this movie will scare only those who like the last Mimzy.
