Anyone who has seen Tammus Child Eaters knows that this is a director who can do better. Let's hope there were not too many hands in the pot (Telefilm?) And that was a case of Second Feature Jitters. The characters are one-dimensional and are used too often. However, the scenery is magnificent and beautifully presents the Pacific Northwest. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is great. Almost completely taken outside, the pictures are sharp and beautiful. You can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie is as good as it comes - it just does not have a heart.
