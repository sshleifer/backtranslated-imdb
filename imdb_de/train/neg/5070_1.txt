Television is affecting society ... just look at the popularity of cappuccino stores after this little, small work debuts. Besides, real people who look as good as these people have no problems. <br /> <br /> Also, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a beautiful Manhattan loft, considering what they are doing for a living? NBC loves to insult the viewer's intelligence, even if it's just about Gump's level. I know a person who, as a web designer, earns $ 100,000 a year and lives in a small one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $ 2,200 a month. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a show called Phriends with six nasty nobodies in dead-end jobs living in a lousy neighborhood where sirens are constantly howling and someone is robbed every week ... and then The landlord collects the rent. Well, I would see that.
