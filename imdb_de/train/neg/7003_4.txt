(aka: TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME) This sequel looks like it was done to capitalize on THEY CALL ME TRINITY's stellar European box office success. Only this time, Joseph E. Levine and the Avco Embassy pictures wanted to participate in America as well. Too bad that they did not get very far, as the Hill / Spencer pictures here in the US had little success, and this largely boring, drawn-out film does not help. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Bambino swear to their dying father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other. Later, they engage with arms dealers who smuggle weapons from a monastery and falsely believe they are a pair of federal officials. Despite a few funny scenes, the end falls flat, especially the one in which Trinity and Bambino are in a chic French restaurant and do not know how to carry themselves. And also the scenes with the sharks were a bit humorous. <br /> <br /> The song music sung by Gene Roman sounds like a Bobby Goldsboro-style pop song of the early 70s, while the music notes sprayed throughout the film are pretty good. I'm not sure I want to buy the CD soundtrack, but maybe others too. <br /> <br /> The film would have had half an hour and would not have attracted so much time. It looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed here. In fact, I lost interest in 2/3 of the way. The DVD is also terrible, with a constant drone in the soundtrack and a bad print that looks like it should have been sent to that big junkyard in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step from the previous movie <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 points
