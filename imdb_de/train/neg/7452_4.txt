For me, this movie just seemed to fall on his face. The main problem for me was the casting of Glover as a serial killer. I do not know if this is due to the type casting or just his behavior, but I doubt Glover would ever be a compelling villain. He's a good guy, and that's always obvious in his performances. Apart from that, the movie is your story of the mill's serial killer story. Nothing very innovative.
