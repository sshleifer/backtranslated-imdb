After the success of Scooby-Doo, Where are You, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. Unfortunately, they added a new character that spoiled the success of Scooby-Doo forever. They invented a new show with the new title Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo that made this show a complete failure, probably for adults and children together. Scrappy was the stupid, brave puppy who always seemed ready to beat someone up. Scooby and Shaggy were afraid of the villain and tried to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not need any annoying bastard puppy nephews. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they either killed Scrappy or never thought about it. That was just poor, maybe your kids would prefer it!
