I could not believe how lame and meaningless that was. Basically, there is nothing to laugh in the movie, hardly any scenes that interest you for the rest of the movie. This movie attracted some big stars, but they were all in vain in my opinion. I think that Keanu Reeves must have taken acting lessons some years after this film before staring into The Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple and humble. Luckily I got this movie for a very reasonable price, because for good reasons it's certainly not a movie to remember. I will not write anything about the story of the movie, but as you should know, she is the most famous hitchhiker in America because of her huge thumb. I would give this movie a 2/10. Before I saw this movie, I wondered why this movie has only 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. A very disappointing movie. Do not buy it, even if you see it for under $ 5.
