Now, I'm the first to admit something that may be blasphemous or unfair, and I apologize in advance for complaining about how much I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> That's about it, too. I did not like this movie. More specifically, I did not like the concept of this movie. The cinematography was good. The mood was good. And the acting was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The story, however, is grumpy, inaccurate and misleading. It is also offensive. <br /> <br /> I'm a quarter-Cree Indian, and for some reason I feel personally offended by the nature of Whitaker's character. First, he is a black man. And that's not a racist comment, I swear it. The thought of a white, Spanish or even Native American swinging a katana on a roof offends everything that the katana represents. The katana represents the soul of a samurai, soaked in the souls of his ancestors, who guide and protect the samurai. For Ghost Dog, it's an insult to the blade and the souls to use their weapons instead of the katana, and where the hell did he get a katana? It must be one of those replicas that offends the samurai caste even more. <br /> <br /> Ghost Dog also showed no honor. Toward the end of the film, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then kills a man by shooting him through a tap drain in the face. Not only is this a coward to kill an enemy, it's also more of a ninjas. silent assassin; A group that samurai denies exists but hates nothing. <br /> <br /> He then tries to kill his boss when he finds out his boss is a villain. You know what a true samurai does when he learns that his master is evil or dishonest? He kills himself to prove that he would rather die than lower himself to the level of his dogmatic master. Everything about the character was a huge contradiction to the real code that all samurai follow: Bushido. <br /> <br /> So, we have great cinematography, good ambience and acting style that includes a satirical plot and premise (which is unfortunately the most important aspect), making it an unsatisfactory movie insulting everything What an Honorable Bushi (samurai) loves. <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Bleah
