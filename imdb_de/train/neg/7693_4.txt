Is there something that is unpredictable in this movie? I do not think so. Basically, the movie is cliché for stereotype and really nothing surprised. It makes the movie extremely predictable and therefore it lacks the movie seriously. For a thriller, it is not tense and unpredictable, but even as a drama, it is a failure. This is because the movie's story is highly unlikely. I mean, in no way could this happen in real life, as is the case in this film. So the film has a real tension and credibility problem. <br /> <br /> But it's really the clichés that killed the movie. It sometimes rippled. Everything is so formulaic in this movie. The predator is portrayed as a cool, heartless, almost psychopath like a sexually frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman who looks like she does not see it coming. Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and everything seemed to happen for a reason. Such as the order in which the "predator" repairs the broken car of the "victims". That must be one of the oldest clichés of the book. I knew what the movie wanted after that. I tried to look like the teacher and the student were really growing together through the eyes of the other people around them. It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost did not want to watch the movie after that time. The movie is filled with moments like these. <br /> <br /> The title suggests that this is a cheap porn movie, but in reality it is a film made for the TV movie. This means that everything is going on slowly and the film halves its time for character development and unnecessary subplots to make the movie even more dramatic. <br /> <br /> I admit that Elizabeth Berkley is doing pretty well in this movie. It sometimes makes some clichés and events almost realistic. Her Hollywood career is almost over after her appearance in the Paul Verhoeven movie "Showgirls", so she's likely to appear only in film and television series like this one. It's a waste of her talent and she deserves better. All other characters are a disappointment. Corey Sevier plays the cliché of a pretty "untouchable" rich boy and the way the husband's husband is portrayed is even worse. He looks more like a sexually frustrated predator than the movie's true predator. He basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence. He wakes up, he wants sex. Before going to sleep, he wants to have sex. He comes home, he wants sex. It may be a realistic thing, but I do not know, it just did not feel right for a movie like this and history in general. <br /> <br /> A cliché-filled movie, and I can not think for some reason why anyone should ever see this movie. It is predictable and therefore also in tension and credibility. Not a "horrible" movie and it's certainly a temporary movie, but all the weak and clichéd elements in the movie make it far from a recommendable one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
