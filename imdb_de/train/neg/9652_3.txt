The film was written 10 years ago and another director planned him with SRK and Aamir in leading roles. The film was finally shot with director Vipul Shah. Ajay and Salman co-starred after a decade of HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999) <br /> <br /> However, due to its handling in the 90s, the film becomes too short and at worst loopholes. <br /> <br /> The film tries to pack too many commercial ingredients and we also hav the love triangle <br /> <br /> Everything is predictable and cinematic and too clich√© <br /> <br /> There is Loopholes as Ajay runs away from London airport and does not get a seat with anyone? The way he starts his band is not convincing. The second half gets better as Ajay has destroyed Salman, but the climax is enough and the film ends with a bad mark. <br /> <br /> Direction by Vipul Shah is normal to below average Music is the worst point, most of the songs are mediocre. <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ajay gives his best, although he is not convinced as a rock singer, but as a negative role Salman is outstanding Irritated, however, with his punjabi and speaking nonsense he only impressed when he drugged and Asin is nothing special. Only a show piece that Ranvijay should stay with MTV Om Puri is okay
