I remember one particular Tuesday, the morning of 06/18/02, to be exact. I had fallen asleep trying to convince myself to get out of bed when a terrible explosion was heard. I went to the kitchen, where I could visit several neighborhoods in the south of Jerusalem, and saw a column of smoke rising from a distant spot. The sight of the smoke followed a minute later by sirens. I remember storming into my bedroom, taking out my binoculars, running back to the kitchen and seeing the picture of a broken glass bus. The bus was still near the pickup station where a terrorist boarded, and with a single click on a TNT device, 25 passengers were killed, many of them on their way to school. The wife of a good friend of mine sat in the bus in the back row. A seemingly arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life. <br /> <br /> I'm sure every Israeli has at least one terror. He wished he had never thought, and it was only a matter of time before someone made a movie about it. As it turned out, the movie soon became a repressed memory. <br /> <br /> Haim Buzaglo (pictured by, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo Who) wrote and directed the film that spends most of his day on the film to seek contests with his empty word processing page. In the meantime, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli trade channel, decides to make a play about an indebted ex-officer. Buzaglo, bored and a bit paranoid, because the medical term for "What in the world this hot baby dates me" syndrome, asks a private investigator to make a stake out of his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As a detective As his investigations progress, his observations infiltrate the game and later the lives of his actors. Meanwhile, the game is turning from a comic book into an indictment against the seclusion of Israeli society. As far as the movie is concerned, the film becomes an exercise in the frenzy made up of little cardboard figures and unreliable dialogues, while miles away from the topic it should be dealing with. <br /> <br /> When I say "cardboard figures", I'm referring to the characters who, under the writer / director's obsession for a "meaningful" movie, had no real dialogue and no trace of reliability. I will not talk much about it. Suffice to say that I am sure that homeless, barefoot male prostitutes rarely go to the theater. With the intention to see a play, that means. <br /> <br /> According to Haim Buzaglo, this film is itself the first part of a current Agenda trilogy. I sincerely hope that the other two films come from the experiences I wrote at the beginning of my review, as opposed to the secluded world of characters that are anything but existent, and an action that is anything but captivating /> <br /> 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter. <br /> <br /> PS This film was a milestone in austerity. It was shot in ten days, all the actors were free and the total cost of the film was about $ 12,000 (no, I did not skip a zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). You're wondering why it cost $ 34,000 to complete Blair's witch project.
