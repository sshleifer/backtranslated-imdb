I did not really expect this movie, I saw it in a pack of 5 movies that were pretty awful in their own way for a fiver. So what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and some stretches it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very much like a drummer, damn annoying and damned Well, that's the point, the problem is that it's just so boring. In what I can only assume, it was an effort to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it gets really boring (I had my thumb on the fast) forward button, ready for the most part of the movie too squeeze, but tried it) and seriously, the lead singer of the band is great looking, because they do not half mention how pretty he really is, I thought he looked a bit like a Meercat, all that and I have the killer I do not even mention it, it's just not worth explaining. As far as I'm concerned, Star and London are just the only reason to look at it, and with the exception of London (which was actually pretty funny) it was not their acting talent, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but I've got a lot better too seen. Avoid, if you are not bored, to see the paint dry.
