This movie is "riveting," but in a sense, a car crash is riveting. It's hard to look away. All in all, this movie is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment - and a futile, biased experiment. The filmmakers are manipulative and do not seem to have problems with the least possible denominator. The way in which the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intervening steps that forced the filmmakers to join Ted (meeting so-called experts) were empty and had no substantial attempt to connect with Ted. It is painfully obvious that they serve to cover the back of the filmmaker and take advantage of Ted's situation. The worst thing is that the filmmakers will not follow Ted after 6 months. and seem to be completely cut off from the topic that they had followed months earlier. If they had taken care of that, they would have found better "experts" to help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted would do, they should have spent the money without intervention. This movie is at best a Jackass stunt and not a documentary. It is sad to think how many $ 100,000 could have actually changed a homeless person's life if given the right hands.
