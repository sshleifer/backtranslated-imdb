Judging from this film and THE STRONG MAN from the same year, I would not put Harry Langdon on the list of big silent movie comedians. It just is not enough there. Perhaps he was on the way to developing his style, but sabotaged by taking his first big achievements too seriously. In any case, all his tricks are reminiscent of the larger funny men, but he lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the amazing ingenuity of Lloyd. He also undermines his own personality by dressing and walking like Chaplin's drunken character. His trademarks are childlike innocence, shyness of approach and a tendency to respond to misfortune by looking puzzled, eye-popping or touching the pursed lips with the tip of the index finger. The comedy in Langdon's films is due to the fact that fate throws various obstacles on his way, which he tries to overcome in a shaky or naive way or with a minimum of physicality, for. For example, by throwing stones at an approaching tornado to drive it out and assist a collapsing building by rocking a boulder twice or four by dipping one leg so that they roll under it. In this story, about the son of a shoemaker taking part in a cross-country walking race to spread the shoes of his competitors, he manages to win by sheer luck. There is nothing that has not been done much better by the Big Three.
