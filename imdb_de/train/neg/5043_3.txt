I'm a big Ziyi Zhang fan and will go to any movie to see them, which brought me to Purple Butterfly. As much as I wanted this movie, I have to agree with many others who have commented on it. It is very confusing and extremely slow. Since the film was apparently taken with a handheld camera, significant parts of the film are out of focus. <br /> <br /> The film has very little dialogue and there is not much that says it. There are endless scenes where people just stand around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other without talking. The way film time is changing is also very confusing and difficult to follow. Even after reading some reviews and having a general idea of ​​what the movie was about, it was still hard for me to understand what was going on. <br /> <br /> I knew beforehand that the movie was not far away from the previous Ziyi Zhang movies, but I was glad to see them in something else, but unfortunately I was ultimately disappointed. She never smiles in this movie, though she does not have much to smile about most of the time. I could have done without the sex scenes as they were about as sexless and without any obvious feeling between the participants, as you might hope.
