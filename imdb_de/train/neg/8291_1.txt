An idiot dentist learns that his wife is unfaithful. So no new storylines here. The authors, however, managed to make a stupid, disgusting film. If you enjoy observing children vomiting, or seeing a dentist who imagines he's pulling out all his wife's teeth in a bloody horror type, then watch the movie or hire him. If not, continue with something else (MY FAIR LADY, anyone?)
