This movie was just crappy. Okay, it's basically about a girl being raped, and to get revenge, she gets another man raping the rapist. The rapist is a shower, but the girl victim is partly to blame. I mean, both are in the mood and starting to kiss each other and all, but if the rapist tries to have sex with her, she will not let it happen so the rapist rapes her. The thing is, the girl's rape scene is very short and does not really reveal or show anything, but if the rapist is raped, it's a pretty long rape scene. There is basically nothing in the story that is worth to be seen. <br /> <br /> 3.2 / 10
