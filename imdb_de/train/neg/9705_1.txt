I saw the movie as a kid when it was released in the theater, and it was so bad that it turned into a family joke. If the ranking had a zero, this movie would get it. The dinosaurs were terrible. The plot was ridiculous. The drama is really not allowed to be called a drama. The only reason I even remember the name of the movie so well is that my family is still talking about how bad it really was.
