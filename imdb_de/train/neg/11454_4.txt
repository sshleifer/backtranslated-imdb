So I had low expectations for this movie, but he could not fulfill it. While there were some funny parts, even one or two that laugh out loud, this movie laughed terribly, which I would call good. The funniest jokes were unexpected and very fast over and left us sitting and went "WTF just happened?" In addition, there were a few jokes that were pulled on and on. The part where he falls down the mountain made me yawn. In addition, the cut was really missing. There were a few bad scene transitions, but that seems to be the style these days. It made me laugh, but I would not look at it again and I am very glad that I have been waiting for it to be rented out. Give it a try, maybe enjoy it, but do not think that you want to have something in the way of 40-year-old Virgin or Superbad.
