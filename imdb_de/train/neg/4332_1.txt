This film is a poor attempt to give the original fans a sense of completeness. The only thing that people have forgotten is the fact that the reason why the original got so much recognition is solely due to the fact that it should cause you to feel incomplete the washroom I'm not a negative guy but the acting in this movie is .... no comment. The conspiracy reflected the life of Carlito Brigante. I am sorry that I had two hours and my money was wasted on this film. I still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my mind.
