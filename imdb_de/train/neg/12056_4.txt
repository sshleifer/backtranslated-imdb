This movie is a good example of how you can sell a film that is nothing more than a very listless TV sitcom through media manipulation. In Puerto Rico, the most widely circulated daily newspaper has constantly written about the wonders of this film, silencing almost everyone else. Coincidentally, the newspaper with the second largest edition belongs to the same owners. The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the form and content of the film, and has drawn attention to all its shortcomings, clich√©s and bad writing, laughing with light and obvious jokes, and recognizing actors and sceneries no acceptable movie.
