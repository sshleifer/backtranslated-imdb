The movie is boring, the characters and scenarios are unrealistic, unbelievable, the action is weird. This movie is a big mess. It almost seems as if the action music sets in, the most impressive stunt is running. Either the voice is dubbed with Mr. McGregor or Steven sang too much and it changed his voice. There are far too many dialogues in this film and extremely bad acting for everyone. The movie is a great sleep therapy. The fight is ridiculous. The eye-shape shift effect on the nasty designer drug addicts was decent. The main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed. The main villain was used to explain the story by interrogation. He simply threw random acts in (Spoiler) "CTX (his designer drug) will be in the water supply," which in the conclusion is never received or not entered again in the film. This movie is highly recommended.
