I only hired this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I have not seen since Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this movie was a big disappointment. The plot of all parties was bad, except for Mr. Lundgren, who was okay. Kata Dob√≥ was beautiful despite her ridiculous outfit and make-up. <br /> <br /> The plot is not smart at all, it has been repeated millions of times in several films. The crooks were absolutely stereotypical and Lundgren's character had no depth. I did not really expect a movie masterpiece, but that's not even a decent action. Every twist in the plot is extremely predictable, and the incredible amount of exaggerated unrealism and comic-like characters pretty quickly annoyed me comic-like action, but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I think the current average score of 7.0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by someone involved in this movie.)
