I did not agree with any of the theologies in the Left Behind series, but still I found the books exciting and I read 8 out of 12 of them. Incorruptible good writing and interesting story. However, I did not have very high expectations for the movie. In no case would the mainstream Hollywood have recorded a Christian series and produced a movie on a large budget. So it was made independent ... and it just felt like I was watching a really long television program. It just did not feel like a movie; It had no experience with this movie, if anyone knows what I'm talking about. This undermined the movie, and the low-budget low-budget specials were another distraction for me. <br /> <br /> In addition, I feel that Gordon Currie became wistfully miscast as Nicolie Carpathia. As I read the book, I had the impression that NC should be a charming, dazzling, amazingly handsome man who spoke English with almost zero accent traces. So I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found a Clay Aiken pencil hunter who looks like a Best Buy employee of the month and gave him a really bad fake accent. So it lost a few stars for me. A movie is simply not convincing if the big bad guy does not look or sound the way he should. <br /> <br /> The acting was okay, but nothing to write home about. Some of the scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (I can not remember which ones) - were a real sit-ins for me. And some of the Christian rock music or whatever it was was really inappropriate for some scenes, like the one in which Kirk Cameron prayed in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In short, it was not a bad movie, but it just did not work for me. Stay with the book, people, it's much better.
