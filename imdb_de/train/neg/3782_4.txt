Here are the good news first. "Spirit" is the visually most incredible animated feature in the current home cinema release. The artwork and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend giving this movie a look just because of the visualization. <br /> <br /> And now to the bad news. I'm serious when I say that the animation is the only thing that promises this movie. You may recall that "Spirit" was hit hard by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person to claim that Disney is more established and has better advertising can write me a four-page essay entitled, "Why Lilo and Stitch's Script Do not Stink." <br /> <br /> For all the incredible new animation technology shown in "Spirit," the story is almost * amazing * boring. Here's a lesson that (of course) is not just for animated films. You can have the most impressive visual effects that ever grave a mortal's eyes, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, your characters do not interest us, then it's bad filmmaking. It's that simple. The animation is still overwhelming. I can not wait to see what someone with more imagination does with it.
