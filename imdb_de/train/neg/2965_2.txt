This movie was kind of interesting ... I had to look at it for a college class over India. The summary, however, shows that this movie is one thing that does not really have much cold, hard information about these details. It's not really true to the summary to the end where they sloppily try to tie up all the elements. The gore factor, however, is excellent. Even at the beginning you want to look away, because the Gore is pretty intense. Watch this movie only if you want to see a cool gore, because the plot is thin and makes you sad that you have wasted time with it. I've seen rumors on other sites that this movie is based on true events, but you can not find any information online ... so this movie was basically a waste of time to watch.
