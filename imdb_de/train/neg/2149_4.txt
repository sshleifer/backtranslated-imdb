Well, the big ATM has done it again! Disney cleverly uses idiots like me who feel that we need to own every video (good or bad) that has the Disney nickname. Why am I still looking forward to these "sequels" that make Don Bluth look like Leonardo DaVinci on a bad day? Cinderella 2 consists of three storylines (a bad choice!). Does one of Disney's most endearing creations deserve at least a straightforward story? Of these three, only the last comes close to the quality of animation and storytelling that I would expect. The music is disgusting and modern (which means that it will be dated in 2 years) and adds nothing to the story. Why does everything have to be updated? You know, the original cartoon is still popular because it's timeless. So why not be respectful and true to the original, with songs that reflect the same style? I can not wait to find a sequel to Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on the themes of Tchaikovsky, we are inspired by Britney Spears. So, Disney, if you listen, remember, we are not all indiscriminate kids out here. How about you throw a bone or two at the fans who have been around long enough to see the difference between craftsmanship and manure?
