I can not stand most reality shows, and this one is worst than Paris Hilton, and it sure is his company. But "you're fired" or "you're hired," for how many seasons? After watching the show, I did not want to work for the guy with his ego and everything, and I think if you see paint drying, it has more entertainment. Say, "Donald, I'll stop taking some of your money and buy a decent hairstyle ". I see, he even tries to win fame in wrestling WWE. I hope he gets hurt, so I do not have to see his wretched face anymore. It must be sad to want fame so badly and have no talent and make an attempt to buy it. I would give this show a negative note if I could, but she gets a 1 and does not deserve it.
