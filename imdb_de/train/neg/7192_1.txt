After 5 minutes I hyperventilated, shivering and writhing in pain. And not in the good way. The story is about a group of idiotic kids making prank calls with a psycho, which is always a good idea. It turned out that psychos do not want to play tricks because he's in front of her door in 2 minutes, killing poor Williams, mom and dad. Now skip 15 years and guess what? Prank people are still talking on the phone. Yeah, you'd think a terrible murder would stop them from doing that all the time, but no. After about two hours later and too many screams, I realized that this movie gave me just a terrible taste in my mouth and a strong desire to take my own life. This crap is not worth laughing at over the lousy production, the "drama" or the dwindling career of Rutger haurs. I love fucking horror movies, but this is the most unsatisfactory piece I've ever seen. Simply not.
