My first opinions on this movie were of course bad. I expected a terrible, shitty acting, bad conversation and ridiculous special effects. What I got was not that bad. The special effects were absolutely terrible, but I found the movie itself quite interesting, and the script was actually pretty good and decent. The acting was not so bad, and overall I had fun watching this movie. It's still a pretty bad movie, but it's not totally worthless as I imagined. And I'm pleased to know that this movie has managed to get me excited, even if it was not so good. Overall, it's a movie that should be avoided, but for me it was not as bad as I expected it to be.
