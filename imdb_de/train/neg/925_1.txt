Okay, this movie fits the rules. It is without question one of the most technically inconceivable cinema pieces ever made. absolutely terrible, but you have seen it. Rent it with your friends and let's come up with a drinking game or just have fun, it's funny. And the behind-the-scenes feature proves it can do anything with paper plates and fingerpainting. ingenious. Okay, just lend it to this one scene: two characters actually walk in a shot for about 3 minutes. the director (comment) says "yes, the tracking was so smooth that it looks as if it ...". Yes, real man, they run completely in place. its so funny.
