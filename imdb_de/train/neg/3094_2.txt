**** MINOR SPOILERS *** As a bad movie connoisseur, I must have seen hundreds of bad movies, yet "Hobgoblins" is different in its own way from everyone else. Classic villains like "The Creeping Terror", "The Mighty Gorga" and "Manos" are equally bad from start to finish. Hobgoblins, on the other hand, start off poorly and get worse over time. At my first sight of the notorious rake fight scene, I thought this was a really bad movie. I did not know that I had just seen the best that this film had to offer. The film brings its most massive dive into celluloid hell during the painfully incompetent "Club Scum" sequence, which is an uninterrupted sequel of one jumbled joke at a time. With this film, director Rick Sloane proves that he must be mentioned alongside Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? Look at "hobgoblins" and do not wonder anymore.
