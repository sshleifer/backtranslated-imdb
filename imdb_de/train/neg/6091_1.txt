I bought this movie excitingly a wonderfully gratuitous, exaggerated, entertaining bloodbath. I did not get any. This film fails on virtually every level, not the least frightening or funny, it is just a terrible movie and never offers the audience anything worth seeing. The worst part is that it is so far from being as raw, violent and brutal as it had promised, there is hardly any violence. Virtually no blood shed and no excitement. Acting, directing and dialogue are absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it's really ridiculous. I could barely get through all this trash once; I will definitely never want to see it again. Do not waste your time on a waste of celluloid like this one; It's really the worst movie ever made. If I could give minus stars, I would do that.
