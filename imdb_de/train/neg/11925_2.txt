This is a very strange movie ... I was not really sure what it is about, some N Londoner lowlifes find a dumb kid in the woods that they all believe is some sort of oracle, and somehow it does them all in their own way, change something in their lives that usually ends in disaster. The movie ended after about 90 minutes and I felt pretty dissatisfied, almost annoyed by the futility. I was not interested in any of the characters - none of them have the chance to be popular with the crowd. <br /> <br /> What was the message? Am I weak? It was just too strange. What happens to Runner? Why is Emilio shooting the child? ... that made absolutely no sense, pointless. Can someone help me to understand this mess of a movie?
