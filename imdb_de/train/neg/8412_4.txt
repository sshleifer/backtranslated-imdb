I saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was REALLY oppressed. Despite all the Oscar enthusiasm, this is nothing special. Everyone who was really impressed by this movie never bothered to see one of the true classics of film music. Apart from Eddie Murphy's great musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is just a glorified television movie with no style and flair. Just a bunch of amateurs who sing each other! <br /> <br /> Well, the first half hour was good, but I was confused about how Eddie Murphy's terrific raveup performances were interrupted and interrupted by Mondays. These were by far the best songs and best performances in the film. And the film's "upward climb" was the only part of the film that had a unified viewpoint or impulse. The remaining hour and 45 minutes were an informal, confusing mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting. It was also visually boring and contained too many sound-like pieces. <br /> <br /> Condon did not try to turn the pieces into big show pieces, as I expected. Each number in the second half was just one close-up after another of people "singing" each other. And the way they shot Hudson's big "love me" number was criminal! Condon just shot her around the stage - no drama! God, it was shit! <br /> <br /> AND note all involved - that "singing talking dialog" things could work on stage, but it does NOT work in movies (see embarrassing mistakes from Evita and Phantom). All this "I'll give you some efff-heeee teaeeel!" Crap should be on the bottom of the editing room. These are not "songs". <br /> <br /> Again, apart from Eddie Murphy's amazing performance, the film was nothing more than a glorified television movie. There must have been megabucks for the PR work for this movie! I wonder how much money was spent to release the Oscar buzz "one to beat". Overall, this movie, with the exception of Eddie, NOWHERE NEAR was an Oscar-caliber movie! (with the exception of Eddie) I would rank it with Grease 2 at the top. Big disappointment, especially after all the (very expensive) hype!
