Massacre is a film by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground), produced by the legendary Italian horror film Lucio Fulci. Well, with that mix of great talent, you'd think this movie was a true gore feast. This could not be further from this. The massacre falls right in the face, as one of the most boring slasher movies I've seen in Italian cinema. I really had trouble staying awake during the movie, and I've never had a problem with Italian horror movies. Massacre starts with a hooker who is slaughtered with an ax by the roadside. This scene was used in Fulcis Nightmare Concert. This is not a bad scene, and it raises your expectations of the movie as an ax that wages battles. Unfortunately, the next hour of the movie SO is boring. The movie is turned into a horror movie being filmed, and there's a lot of character development during all of those scenes, but the characters in the movie are so boring and badly played that your interest slowly fades. The last 30 minutes of the movie are not so bad, but could have been much better. The blood in the movie was pathetic, and since Fulci used most of the blood scenes in Nightmare Concert, there was nothing new here. The end of the film made a nice turn, but there were still too many unanswered questions and continuity fell through the floor. <br /> <br /> This was not a very good movie, but for a true Italian horror freak (like myself) this movie is a must, as it is very rare. 4/10 stars
