It's interesting that everyone who seemed to like this movie (so far) had no expectations - I think that's the trick. Unlike them, I had optimistic expectations, and that was a mistake. Once I saw how close the camera was to their faces, I knew we were in the hands of an extreme amateur director - it's always a clear sign that they think it's artistic or effective or intense, to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors. The actors in this film, however, had only one facial expression. <br /> <br /> If the close-up camera is not enough, it will be destroyed by the lack of light in the film. The movie seemed to be completely in the dark. Now we know that the cameraman was also an amateur with rank. "Ohhhhhhhh, we will light the set with a flashlight! That will make everything intimate!" No, it all seemed to be invisible. <br /> <br /> Apart from the serious technical flaws, there was absolutely no story beyond the mere idea of ​​an idea that had never been developed, and nothing new about this kind of relationship was highlighted. (Maybe this is a new kind of movie for Germany, but forget the movie in Los Angeles.) <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie has won a couple of film festival awards is not proof of the quality of the movie Film, but soiled the quality of these special festivals. I can assure you that this film will not win anything at the festival where I saw it. In fact, it seemed to be twice during the movie that it was finally over and people were getting up to leave (this was one of the side effects of the cameraman's "total darkness" technique). But as the movie continued to shudder, there was instead moaning from the audience. And when the movie finally ended, it was clear that it did not matter if he had actually ended at one of the earlier two points. An earlier end would have saved the audience from even more monotonous scenes of domesticity (folding bows, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). Yes, we got it, the lonely old man's life was boring - but we found out at the very beginning. <br /> <br /> I recommend that the audience miss this, it has absolutely nothing to offer discerning moviegoers.
