I've been known to fall asleep while watching movies, but this is usually due to a combination of things, including being really tired, warm and comfortable on the sofa and having just eaten a lot. However, I fell asleep on this occasion because the movie was garbage. The action development was constant. Always slow and boring. Things seemed to have happened without explaining what caused them or why. I admit I may have missed a part of the movie, but I've seen most of the movie and everything seemed to happen on its own without really worrying about anything. I can not recommend this movie at all.
