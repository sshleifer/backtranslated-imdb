Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I was bored. I looked in my little comcast box to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. Says that the filmmaker has some kind of cult in the description. Funny that it does not warn me not to see this movie. I could have used this advice. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 because it's called totally wrong. It has little (if any, depending on your point of view) to do with zombies and everything happens inside a city. This movie is about a crooked policeman who behaves as badly as possible (he has to try and suck so much) while arresting women for trivial bullshit and then killing them. Yes, he is a serial killer. Not only is this movie flawed in the notion that it is a zombie movie, it also completely misrepresents the serial killer's facts. Serial killers love to kill, they live for it and they leave it to themselves. This guy strikes the women and injects them with some poison. He does not even have sex with the body or dismembers her. Talk about boring! Eventually, one of the five women he kills has voodoo protection, and for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and kill themselves to kill this guy. They were all buried or thrown into the sea, but they would not know they were buying the sharp, clean clothes they all wear. The women act very bad and take revenge. Oh yay. <br /> <br /> This movie was crap in every category. Crap-Acting, Crap-Writing, Crappier-Sets and Crappier-Make-Up-Effects. The women do not look like a zombie, unless you count a really dark make-up around the eyes as the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. They can all speak perfectly human, behave, think and act. Compared to many other PG-13 films, the Gore is weak and nudity is indescribable. You see a look at the breasts in the opening sequence ... then exactly the same breasts later! Imagine that. Presumably only one actress was willing to go upstairs without this fool. The police station is so poorly built that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse where they are obviously filming. You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the equipment that's too sparse, even if you're not blind, you can see the director fail. Steer clear, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
