Snow White, who just came out in Locarno where I could see it, naturally refers to the world-famous fairy tale. And it also refers to coke. Finally, the real snow of the Swiss Alps also plays a role. <br /> <br /> In this movie, all three aspects of the title are addressed. There is a lot of dope in the scene, and there is also a pale, dark-haired girl - with a prince who has to make every effort to come to her rescue. But it is not such a fairy tale. It is probably a realistic drama in Zurich, Switzerland (according to Tagline). Technically, the film is almost perfect. A weak plot, predictable dialogues, a mostly unrealistic scenery and the mixed spectacle unfortunately do not give any authenticity. So I stayed untouched as a spectator. <br /> <br /> And then there were the clich√©s that drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled upper-class daughter - of course her parents are divorced and she I never got enough love from them, because they were so busy the whole time. Her best friend, however, has loving and caring parents. They (a steel worker and a housewife) live in a tiny flat, poor and happy - ignoring the desperate situation their daughter is in. The Good (= Prince) is a musician (!) From French-speaking Switzerland (This is considered a less economically successful, but emotionally fitter, part of the country.) He has problems with his parents, migrants from Spain who do not enjoy his wild way of life until the father gets seriously ill and confesses his admiration for his son from a hospital bed. <br /> <br /> And so it goes on: Of course the drug dealer is brutal, the bankers are heartless, the club owner is a playboy and the photographer, though a woman (!) only has her career in mind when she shows Snow White in artistic-pornographic images of a show. <br /> <br /> For this test, no spoiler is required for you to access these parts Since I like other films by Samir, such as "Forget Baghdad," I was pretty disappointed, let's hope for the next one.
