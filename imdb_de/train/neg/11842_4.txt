Kirsten Dunst is terribly overrated as an actress. You always notice that she is only "acting". I like Izzard, however. Plot is terribly boring. The viewer has no real connections to the characters and never knows who to really sympathize with or even care about. Slow, boring movie with a few laughs, but little and still not very funny. The plot is in the least not captivating or exciting. You can see every curve that is a mile away. What should this movie be? Comedy? Theatre? Who cares? They will not be until the end of this movie.
