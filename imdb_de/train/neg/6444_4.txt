Most college students feel lost in the bubble of science, cut off from the communities where they study and live. Their conversations take place with their fellow students and the faculty of the college. The documentary by Steven Greenstreet is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community due to limited contact with a small number of his members. The documentary focused on a small group of people who were portrayed as actors representing large sections of the population. Most people who scream the most get the most media attention. Apart from the misrepresentation of the community in which the film plays, the documentary was well done. My only controversy is that the feelings and turmoil that are portrayed in the film are attributed to the entire community and not to the few people who have expressed it. Of course, it is important to examine such a controversy and make people aware of the differences that exist between political views, but it is ridiculous to involve a whole community of people in the actions of some radicals.
