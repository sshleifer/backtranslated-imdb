This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful, but here it ends. It seemed like a lackluster sentence hitting the West. The story made little sense. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personality. There may also be unnecessary things that did not relate to the conspiracy or that brought the story forward. There were also long empty moments when the plot could have been explored, but was used for silence or unnecessary conversation. The script should have made more sense than the director. I had a big question mark on my head when I saw this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion. If you're just looking for eye candy, this is the movie for you.
