Is it just me or is the kid really annoying? <br /> <br /> Hideos sister, spends most of her time running around like this after the disobedient little one. I know he's a kid, but his acting skills are as wooden as a dead tree. So far, I'm only halfway and am fascinated by the story, but the people in it, let it down, I just hope that it gets better in the end, because I can not know what it's about. Although some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and in a notebook indicate that everything is backwards, e.g. B. Dog is God, Live is evil, etc., seems a little obvious at the moment, but nobody mentions its obvious meaning (as far as it goes anyway) If my opinion changes at the end of the film, I will update this post, but if you read this, then good ... See above.
