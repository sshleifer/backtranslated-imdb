There is not much to say about this film, it is terrible. <br /> <br /> The acting and the dialogue are far from self-decent, the story of the hybrid werewolves is not very well explained and the whole here and there are holes. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you do not want to see. It's so amateur that it makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the DVD was in the extras. The gag roll. Everything else, just a waste of time and money. I hope nobody will buy it, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Just stay away.
