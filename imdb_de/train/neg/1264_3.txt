This movie does not have much to do with its predecessor "Robot Jox". This must also be the reason why the most common name is "Robot Wars" and not the alternate name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was basically an entertaining movie. It had a nice premise that huge robots would fight each other in the near future. This concept was abandoned for this film and instead contains a completely boring story that is also not very original or cleverly written. Too bad that it really wanted to be so different from its predecessor, otherwise it might have been more fun to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Like "Robot Jox," this is a B-movie, but with a big difference it's just not very good. Maybe this has to do with the fact that "Robot Jox" was made in the 80's, when B-movies still had a certain charm and class, even though the movie was released in 1990. That really can not be said about this movie. It's just lame, badly made, bad looking and not exciting enough. It also has an end that makes you think: is that it? That's all? '. <br /> <br /> What is missing from the film, whose story is missing, is the clear plot. Maybe a good head villain would have been a good idea and a few other things, such as an actual reference to the story, some action or sympathetic main characters. <br /> <br /> Seriously, what did they think when they picked the actors for this movie? They are all just not sympathetic in their roles and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as a main character who behaves as if he were God's gift to Mrs. and Mr. Perfect, who can compete with anyone. Was not it easy for them to get the actors from the first movie? <br /> <br /> For such a futuristic movie with the concept of having great battle droids, this movie is certainly lacking in action. Had they added more and more action to the movie, the movie would have been at least more entertaining. Instead, we now have a movie that basically does not impress in any way imaginable. <br /> <br /> You can watch a series of "Mighty Morphin 'Power Rangers" for more action and sympathy. <br /> <br /> 3/10
