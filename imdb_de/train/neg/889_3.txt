I've never been to Paris, but after seeing Paris, Je t'aime, I'm crazy to visit this city! I've been to New York several times and I love the city and its neighborhoods. I was expecting to be touched by this movie, getting on a plane and flying there at once, but I'm sorry to spend time and money on it. There are no love stories between people or a person and the city. There are many dysfunctional meetings and relationships or people who know each other and it just does not work well. Perhaps this reflects a peculiarity of the city, where thousands of people live alone. Can not you find love in New York?
