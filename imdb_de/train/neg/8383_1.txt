... Je. This is the floor. I am not joking. The theater should have had a warning. "Give up all hope, whoever comes in here" would have been appropriate. <br /> <br /> I do not have the words to describe the hell that describes this film. His debilitating stupidity can not even be amused. This movie is definitely geared towards some of the slower turtles in the sandbox. The story was apparently stolen from a 10-minute Bugs Bunny cartoon and stretched to 90 unbearable, painful minutes like Mr. Fantastic. I remember when the Wayans were funny. I think Hollywood's pressure on producing products is to blame for the feces erupting at a constant rate. I'm sad and insulted that they think we're stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of jokes with a kick-in-the-ball and a thin, cartoon-based storyline. <br /> <br /> I did not like almost everything about this movie. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the baby is actually a dwarf with Marlon Wayan's face, which lies badly over the dwarf's body. What I wanted was the end. Not the dissolution of the film, but the real end, where we all got up and went out. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a star, but it definitely earns less. I do not feel like the six minutes they wrote the script are worth a star. This deserves a Razzie and I pray to God that he will get it. <br /> <br /> When will people learn? If you stop paying to see this idiocy, they will stop unwrapping it. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this movie. Avoid it at all costs. You were warned.
