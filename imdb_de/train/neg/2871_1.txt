I rented this horrible movie. The worst thing I've ever seen. I think a 1st grade could have done a better job. The worse movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some bad. Nothing scary, except I paid $ 1.50 for the rent and that was $ 1.49 too much. The acting is awful, the characters are worse and the movie is just a piece of garbage. The Slauther House scenes are so low that a B-movie looks like an Oscar nominee. All I can say is, if you want to waste a good evening and rent a little money that terrible strip. I'd rather watch killer clowns from outer space sitting in a bucket of razor rather than sit by that flop
