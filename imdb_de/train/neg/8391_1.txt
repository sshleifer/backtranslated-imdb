Now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his Crapfest "House of 1,000 Corpses", I can rest now. Nothing about the somnambulant performances or the banal script would raise the dead in "The House of the Seven Corpses," but a groovy ghoulie will come from his plan anyway (ha!) To kill the bloody amateurs who make a cheap horror movie former residence ! In Hell House (sorry, I do not remember the actual name of the residence) there was a long list of mysterious, unexplained deaths; Some, such as the arthritic Lurch representative John Carradine (whose small role is the film's only worthwhile moment), attribute it to the supernatural. The roaring film director John Ireland dismisses him as a superstitious Hokum. The result looks like "Satan's School for Girls" (catchy title, TV production values, intriguing plot), crossed with "children should not play with dead things" (low-rent movie about low-rent filmmakers who wake up the dead) ; Trouble is, it's not nearly as entertaining or funny. "The House of the Seven Corpses" is dead in the first picture and spends the rest of his 89 minutes through the rigors of the dead, dragging us along for every sore second ...
