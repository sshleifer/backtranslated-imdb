In this film, Chávez's followers (either Venezuelan or non-Venezuelan) only lie about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that the conflict started because of Chavez's announcement that many of the best PDVSA workers had been fired for political reasons. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about more than 96 TV interruptions, which were broadcast by Chávez for only 3 days in "CADENA NACIONAL" (a kind of confiscation of private television signals). Each had a duration of about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> They did not tell us anything about the cessation of General and Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, General Inspector of the Army, who is a traditional follower of Chávez. Despite his announcement, he is also today the Ministro de Interior y Justicia. After the return of Chávez he occupied the charge of Ministro del Defensa (equivalent Defense Minister in the US). <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about Chávez's orders that they were shooting at a pacific popular concentration campaigning for elections. They said nothing about the people in this concentration, the followers were killed by Chávez (either civilians or military officers). <br /> <br /> You present some facts in a wrong order. to lie. <br /> <br /> You said nothing about Venezuelan civil society, which is even now campaigning for elections to solve the crisis, and Chávez actions to avoid elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I'm telling you ... This movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie.
