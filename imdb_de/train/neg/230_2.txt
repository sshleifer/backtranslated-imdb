That was awful. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. Made of wood she makes a rocking horse, as if it could do a better job. But then remember this turn in Four Weddings, just as distressing. Another film depicting England as full of chocolate box cottages and village greens. I mean this school, how many schools except maybe Hogwarts look like this? The police station looked like the set of Heartbeat (a brutal British series from the 1960s). This movie just could not decide what he wanted as a comedy or a serious investigation into the undercurrents of female friendship. If it had stuck to the previous one, then the sex scenes in the cemetery and the very stupid storming of the wedding might have just worked (I'm just saying). But these scenes simply did not work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that Kate would ever speak to Molly again after her horrible behavior. One final note: What does a decent actress like Staunton do in this bunch of poo? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should stick to the advertising fold cream.
