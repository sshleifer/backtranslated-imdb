I have to say, I usually like horror movies that I've never seen before ... but this movie was just too pathetic for my bloody taste. I'm used to having bloody guys ... but this movie was lame. The acting was awful (but the crazy (no pun intended) one-liners were cute). And the sequel, Scarecrow Slayer, was even worse! Yes, probably when it first came out, there was a lot of excitement and people liked it. But when films like The Ring and The Exorcist come out of Emily Rose, movies like these make movies like Scarecrow childish. If you want a movie to sell time, choose it! The special effects are pretty cheesy. But since it's a low budget movie, I can somehow see where that would look. This somehow reminds you of the movie "Children Of The Corn". Independent films rock ... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corn on the cob, or if you're going to have two scarecrows in the sequel, then those movies would be for you.
