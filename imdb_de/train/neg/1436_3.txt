Oh man. Some of the best talents on British television have made this series, and so I can only assume that they worked under incredible time pressure and had to be content with the first scenes of many scenes scenes in this Highland mystery (usually when the " Monster "attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid I found most of the story unintentionally funny! Like the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: Oh, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand over there ... hmm, that's a bit confusing ... < For years, fans of British cult television have been making sure that this series has been released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said no. Now I think I understand why!
