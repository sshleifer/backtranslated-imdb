I read some comments on this movie on the internet like "... harder than hostel ...", "the camera never shows up when it gets really brutal ...". But none of them is true. The camera never displays a screen because nothing is visible. The same scene is repeated a hundred and a hundred times. Women are lying on a table, murderers raping women a few times, murderers shattering women (you never see that during the whole movie!). The police arrive and arrest him. Murderers deceive the jury. Film over In Germany we would say: "Much ado about nothing". All in all one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Absolutely not recommended.
