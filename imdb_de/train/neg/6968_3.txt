An elderly man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse, which seems to wither. He is stung or bitten by something. He gets sick quickly and spits out a large white larva in the hospital. A later attempt to resuscitate him with paddles leads to a splash of blood. <br /> <br /> A policeman is in the hospital because his partner was seriously injured in a shootout. Somehow the policeman mates with one of the doctors and an entomologist who is brought in. There are several young children walking around in the hospital, and I think we should be adorable, but they are not so annoying. They go to the room where the sample is located, and throw growth hormone on top of it. Horror movie logic would say that they deserve to die for it, but they are never in danger. <br /> <br /> The creature grows and begins to breed. People run away from it and sometimes for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by military who are ready to destroy everything, if need be. <br /> <br /> There are no really compelling characters in the movie, and most of the time it seems that people are looking for the monster. It was pretty boring. Obviously, it is due to the alien films, where the monster was born in a human and has several stages of growth. There is also a character named Bishop, and the lead actress has Sigourney Weaver's hair.
