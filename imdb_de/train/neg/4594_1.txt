I had many problems with this movie. <br /> <br /> It contains some basic factual information about quantum mechanics, which is fine. Although quantum physics has existed for over 50 years, the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to say, "Are not you thrilled?" Not really. These are no more terrestrial shocks. In any case, quantum theory was already familiar to me, and the fact that particles have to be described by wave equations, etc. is not new. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this film, however, is the way these people use quantum theory to provide a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. I have no serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with these things, and it should stay separate. The people who interviewed you for this film start with the ideas of quantum theory, and then take the leap to say that simply by thinking about something, you can change the matter around you. Therefore, we should think positively to positively affect the world and make our lives better. The reasoning is completely ridiculous and the conclusions do not follow logically from quantum theory. For every so-called "expert" they have interviewed for this film, there are many theoretical physicists who would absolutely disagree. You would rightly point out that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not support the mystical conceptions of our spiritual interconnectedness. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that people will see this movie and eat it completely because it gives them a nice positive feeling. The main message of the film is based on a complete misinterpretation of quantum theory and is just as bad in its justification as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudoscientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. At one point, one of the "experts" says that since history, most of the assumptions people have made about the world have turned out to be false. Therefore, the assumptions that we currently have about the world are probably wrong. Huh That does not follow completely. And even if, then I do not see how that helps his argument. I mean, if his ideas ever became general assumptions, then we'd have to assume they're wrong too, based on his own considerations.
