This movie is considered a classic by some - I do not know why. It's terrible that you're ridiculous. The only saving grace in this film is the delivery of cheesy lines that are so curly that you have no choice but to laugh about it. <br /> <br /> There are some good songs and good choreography movie, but something like that! There is no action, it is set in a theater without scene change and Michael Douglas is as depressing as ever. My brother once forced me to watch this movie because he said I would not believe how bad a movie can be! He was right. <br /> <br /> Normally in a movie that is so dreadful, I would recommend people not to look at it, but in that case, I think people should do this, as this is every other bad movie, that You have seen, bring in perspective.
