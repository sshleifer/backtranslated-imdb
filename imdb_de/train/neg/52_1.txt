I was thrilled to see a movie by Catalu√±a in the Berlin competition. But after the presentation I was totally disappointed and angry. Too much blood, too much time, too many topics for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was terrible. Revenge, a very humane behavior, not at all beautiful, is shown in countless films and plays, as is the relationship between homosexuals and Spain's skepticism about Catholicism. But what Mr. Villaronga is trying to do is a pseudo-tragedy that can be one of the worst in film history. It's a shame to see Angela Molina in this movie. I do not recommend anyone to see this movie under any circumstances.
