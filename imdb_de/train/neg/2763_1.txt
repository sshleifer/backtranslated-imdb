I went to D-War on a whim and with very low expectations. The movie did not meet them. <br /> <br /> I do not mind when it comes to stories that lead to credibility - do you remember Reign of Fire? - but I expect that they are internally consistent. This movie jumped from Howler to Heuler with no respiratory arrest, all interspersed with special effects far behind those of LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> A figure-changing mystical warrior from Korea who is strangely transformed into a transformed movie. Caucasus antique dealer popping up like Deus ex machina to bring the hapless protagonists out of their latest chaos. An FBI special agent who seems to have completely lost to Korean folklore of antiquity due to the outstanding "paranormal department" of the Fed, which remains inconspicuous to this day. Lovers kissing on lonely beaches calling out "I never thought this would happen". A reincarnated couple of long dead Koreans who "died like star crossed lovers". Mystical devotees, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (who owe much to Peter Jackson's orcs) and a snake who wastes so much time shying away from them that every time their chosen prey is in range. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is appalling, the acting of wood and the effect of the whole thing was, to be honest, boring. The crowning moment, however, came to an end for me, after the final, when the music was the credits - Arirang! This is more akin to Akira Kurosawa completing "Ran" with a karaoke version of My Way - and let me make it clear that I do not compare director Shim with Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> In short, a self-indulgent, lackluster collection of clich√©s and narrative non-sequents that can appeal to the meaning of melodrama in the popular Koran culture, but not the price of a serious moviegoer - or even one so serious movie seekers - should be worth. I would suggest that this completely bypasses the cinemas and goes straight to the video, but I'm not even sure it's worth it.
