I'll just post it here, this was the worst sequel to a classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney released one of his greatest films of all time. Now take away the great songs and add a bad plot reminiscent of a lost TV show. "Put it together and what do you get?" the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen. After seeing that, I thought that everything is over for Disney. Cinderella should have ended with "and they lived happily ever after." Not this garbage. This movie does not deserve a sequel like this one. I thought it was like "a turn in time" that was moderate but better than this. What interests us Anastasia? She changed sides like Iago, but it did not help anyone.
