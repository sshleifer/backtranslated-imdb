Comedy Central has a habit of running great programs - Chappelle's Show, The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, and then there are those who love or hate some people - Stella, dr. Cat. Then there are some shows that have their defenders, but are just terrible - Mencia and now Sarah Silverman. <br /> <br /> This show is based on the fact that Silverman is self-centered, which can be funny (Colbert report) but can be awful (Mind of Mencia). It should not shock anyone that I believe the latter is the case. This show is a parody of a sitcom and a society, a program so absurd that it loses its absurdity and it's just not funny. A farmer's wife was often made in the comedy because it's not something that's common. We do not need 25 minutes. When a criminal is disarmed by a Queef, he just loses his attraction - we saw it in Jay and Silent Bob Strike, only the women were hotter, and the whole scene was more absurd, which made them better. But the best comparison of this show is with Stella, except that Stella was more subtle, which made the absurdist comedy laugh. It should be better, and I suppose, a little bit more from a fantastic realistic point of view. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the fact that some reviews are so negative (I'm very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not dispute the fans' reaction) to this show is the amount of advertising on it, very offensive advertising through many programs that are far surpassed in other programs. Many wonder why Sarah makes Silverman's career, and others are still embittered when better shows have been canceled. This show would never have made it past the unmanned pilot phase. Back to Norm was more promising, but this show makes it even better. And as far as critics are right, the status of many things has become widely known. Recently I checked that Britney Spears also gets good reviews. Take this comparison, however you like, because someone will undoubtedly accuse me of being psychotic at IMDb because I do not like this show.
