I heard about White Noise for the first time when I saw the TV commercial. I did not know it existed before. I looked at the trailer online and decided that I would watch it. As a fan of films like The Sixth Sense, I thought that this film would give me everything I wanted. It has Michael Keaton in it and he rocks. Unfortunately, the film did not deliver. It tried to be another sixth sense or a stir of echoes, and he succeeded miserably. It has a promising start, but the middle retreats only at repetition and ends with a completely bad turn that any monkey could have figured out. Unfortunately, most "creepy" movies these days rely on loud noises and pony to make the audience jump. This movie could have been so much more. It's a shame, because it was a good idea.
