Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. His films are small and amateur and not exactly funny, unless you are 14 years old and have an underdeveloped sense of humor. <br /> <br /> He is certainly not famous as unripe fans like to believe him by harassing people on Wikipedia or stopping the ratings here on the IMDb. Certainly he was not profiled by any major media company that speaks volumes about his and the fame of his creation and his creation. Benfer has some skill in limited animations, but he has to move away from his sycophants and learn to write really funny material before being taken seriously as a true entertainer. From that moment on, however, he is just a kid with a camera, and that shows it.
