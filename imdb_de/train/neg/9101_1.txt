This movie was like "The Disney Channel after Dark". Take out the language and the topics "Are not we naughty" and you have dialogue and plotter devices that insult everyone's intelligence, which does not call "Saved by the Bell" quality television. The dialogue was so ridiculously clich√©d and knowingly dirty, you'd think the script was the result of Aaron Spelling's and Joe Eszterhas's blocking in a room that was told to make a mix out of every bad script that everyone had helped shape , If this was the intention of Roger Kumble, the mission was accomplished.
