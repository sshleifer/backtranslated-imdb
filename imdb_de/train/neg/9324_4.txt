OK, I own this DVD. I got it new on Amazon. I mean, I think it's a badass and a pretty cool patch and Melissa Bale Polt just sucks the clown, a huge guy wears a mask and is disgusting, but it's okay. I would not recommend it if you wanted to rent a good entertaining movie after a hard day's work, but if you have nothing else to do and obsess about with those stupid movies like mine, look at them sometime and I do not know how DVD by Sisle is on DVD in his DVD collection sick is not good enough to own a halfway decent movie company. OK, that's all
