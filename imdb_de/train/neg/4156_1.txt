Yes, this movie is bad. Worse is that it does not take advantage of its own title !! In the WHOLE movie zombies and vampires fight ONCE or TWICE. In addition, we're never really sure if the main character of the movie DEFINITIV is a vampire. It could be argued that they were trying to "break it down" or "make it realistic," but it just gets boring. More than half of this movie takes place in the car. The scenes that take place elsewhere are also not particularly boastful. Besides, there is no clear antagonist, and in the end, you have no idea what really happened in the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> However, I'll say that for a movie with such low output, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (either with an original score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /> <br /> I'm all for independent movies, but it does not look like it's ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "worse than the scarecrow slayer."
