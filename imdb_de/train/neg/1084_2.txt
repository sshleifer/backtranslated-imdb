I borrowed this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors and the director, though Robert Altman can be a hit or a failure. In this case, it was a big failure. Altman's attempt to create tension fell on him. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good movie like Dead Again, I did not think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey, and I hope that did not ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to be giving way to most of the former Oscar winners. On a downward spiral that includes filming in money-laughter movies like this one. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films, though his best performance was not "Tender Mercies," but "The Great Santini." This movie was really a big waste of time. I give a 2 out of 10 points.
