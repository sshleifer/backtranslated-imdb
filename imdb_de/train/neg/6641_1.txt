I saw this movie twice. I can not believe that Pintilie made such a fantasy movie. I'm also a movie / theater director and I know what I'm talking about. This is no longer Romania, but I see the events at the same time as the September 11 incident. No story, no conspiracy, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Only empty pictures. <br /> <br /> What most Romanians do not know is this film for the French audience, not us. You really believe that this is the reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making films. I'm not sure if we can call that a movie, maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we have such an image in Europe. This was a reality, but not anymore. A good friend from the Brithan embassy said, "You have no idea how far the Romanian people went from Ceausescu"
