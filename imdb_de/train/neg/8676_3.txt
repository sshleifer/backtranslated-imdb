Avoid the US version. It's with additional US footage and the worst dubbing you've ever heard, probably from New York amateurs. The synchronization is so bad that it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a black guy from the Bronx makes Chiba's voice. I could not see the whole movie, it was so bad. Instead of this Americanized version you can watch Chibas other greats like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
