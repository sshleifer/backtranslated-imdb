Prior to this film, I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the trashy zombie strip Le Notti del Terrore (1981), which is famous among the horror fans for its unforgettable performance of man-child Peter Bark, and the enjoyable slimming film Strip Nude for yours Killer. None of the films was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema, but both were entertaining in their own way (and the fact that they had a lot of gore and nudity did not hurt). The massacre, however, is boring, boring, boring, despite a good deal of splashing and the strange stain of free naked meat. <br /> <br /> The story of a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew are living from a horror movie while filming is confusing and oh so boring: when the blood does not flow and the skin As you can not see, the movie is a real struggle to sit through (I've had four attempts to finish it), with endless scenes of unlikely characters arguing and ignoring each other. <br /> <br /> The only point the film is interested in is that its producer Lucio Fulci used several of his death scenes Pad from his mega-gory movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you've already seen this movie, there's no reason to be concerned with Massacre.
