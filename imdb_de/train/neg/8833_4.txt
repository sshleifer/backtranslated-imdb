With no flaws in the actors (they all performed well), the overall story was not very well executed. The movie begins with a great zinger: a crazy old guy forces a car of the young Aborigine from the street. But then we have to go through 40 minutes of character development with a whole new set of characters ... and we do not know why until the 40 minutes are over. It turns out that they eventually discover the girl's body ... and the story continues from there. <br /> <br /> While the story starts at this point, it really does not move on. After two hours, I wondered: was there any point or was it just the characters fighting the charges of racism and stupidity as they deal with the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfactory and felt unfinished. Although it plays well, there is no strong backbone in the film to justify the recommendation.
