When I was five years old, I tried to see this abomination of cinema. I have never been like before. Filled to the brim with drug-induced images that smell like the usual rubble of an average asylum seeker, this "movie", despite its colorful appearance, is not for people, especially children. <br /> <br /> It starts innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins his classmate's drum by pulling his head through; Yes, pass his HEAD through. But do not worry, my friends! He is quickly comforted by his chirping flute, which is strange enough. I admit, but still acceptable. THEN: The film turns into a combination of Wizard of Oz and Where the Wild Things Are, but loses all the "warm and blurry" aspects of either of these books. <br /> <br /> So, this seven-foot-long yellow relative from Barney makes friends with this poor boy and plunges him even deeper into despair. <br /> <br /> And to add to the pleasant array of horrible themes, a carnivorous boat, formerly a friend of the colorful crew of hobbling grandfather clocks and stuffed "dragons", is added to the mix of chaos. <br /> <br /> The most comforting image in this chaos is the villain aptly called "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, she has her own problems: what about an obvious plastic mask that limits her expression, how to handle a broomstick whose gas concentration at the worst moments always seemed the lowest. As a result, one of her favorite pastimes was nasal diving into the waters that separated the land of Pufnstuf from her degenerate, decaying abode (I do not know where I would rather live). <Br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is scary ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that has effects similar to The Exorcist on its audience, then this movie is for you You. Enjoy.
