Have not watched children's movies for a few years, so I missed "Here Come the Tigers" when it first came out. (I have never seen "Bad News Bears" although I worked for the guys who arranged the financing for this movie in the 70's, "Warriors", "Man Who Do Be King") and "Rocky Horror Picture Show" , ) Now I like watching old or small films and find people who have made a great career, even though they were in a less than great movie from an early age. Just a few minutes into this movie, I could not afford to straighten myself and jumped to the end of the credits to see if there was a young actor in this film who had come to bigger and better things - at least it would be interesting for him, after to look for his performance because the plot and acting did not do the job. Lo and behold, I spied the name Wes Cravens in the credits as an electric lighting. He had already made two or three of his early shockers, but had not yet done Freddie Krueger or the "Scream" movies. Maybe he owed a favor and helped with this picture. Surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in the cast as "Aesop", a crazy character in the film. F. J. Lincoln, from the 1970s until a few years ago, appeared in and produced adult films. He has been associated with the adult parody "The Ozporns," and this title is more comical than all the "tiger" attempts at humor combined. The fact that a grown-up actor was included in a children's film is an indication of how the people who made the movie must have slept at the wheel.
