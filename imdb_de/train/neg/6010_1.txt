This movie is perhaps one of the most boring movies of 2000 I have ever seen! Especially the music does not create tension when people suddenly disappear. Also aspects like the martial law are not treated with the necessary seriousness. History itself has problems: the United Nations could never take power over the world, as the US alone would not allow it, but nations like China, Russia, Japan, and so on would not. This would also be against someone trying to take over the world, as Nicolae Carpathia does. This reminds me of James Bond movies, except that they have more action! Of course the movie is for Christians and only for Christians and they are allowed to enjoy it. Since I can not count myself as a Christian, I find the whole idea ridiculous. This prophecy also seems, if one believes it to be true, to be dangerously close to other sects through cults for the end of the world. Why fear such a possibility if we can make life as good as possible here on earth?
