Hey everybody ... <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say for this movie. The basic plot is that a guy (Brandon) takes some friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods to spend a weekend away from work. After finding a girl on the way, things are going badly for everyone. <br /> <br /> The plot alone (written by the actor who plays Brandon, I believe, though I might be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing and will act accordingly. The "Clown Killer" itself is a rather sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark, mysterious, but above all, intelligent robber, we are instead being offered a rather clumsy nursery rhyme-singing buffoon, who is apparently going through a small mid-life crisis. The only thing that justified the writing of this comment was the sex scenes and whatever was in the movie (the quality of the movie made me enjoy such things). <br /> <br /> In short This film is beyond any standard. Granted, I shared a few beers with a close friend when I saw this, so we managed to scrape a relative entertainment value out of this movie, and it's only to mention that SICK fell just below a rating of two is. In reality (and in retrospect), star ratings are more than a legitimate rating for this movie. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars.
