This movie is really a curious egg that is partly good. Unlike other reviewers, I found that the main flaw is that the viewer's interest in the characters and plot is unrecognizable. I've been through it because I'm interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of bands, but if I rated it purely because of its merit as a movie, I'd have to thumb it down with a few thumbs up: Jason Behr good in the role of John Livien and quite convincing as a rock singer; The narrative regarding his childhood trauma is unclear, although Livien's well-restrained relationship with his parents contains clues, but his behavior is ultimately bizarre to the viewer (which it should not be). Nevertheless, the idea of ​​using a stage personality to solve internal conflicts is interesting, although neither new nor completely thematized in this film. The allusions to John Lennon were irritating, but I admit that I'm not a Beatles fan. In any case, Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that there was something inferred. Another frustrating thing about the film was the way it opened with some interesting - albeit middle - and high - school philosophical reflections on the main character, but left the threads of his mind there, only to resume them in the middle of the film the film very briefly, as Livien says: "before God there was music" (ever seen this ad for Tia Maria in the 1990s: "Before the time there was Tia Maria", which came to mind anyway); It seems to be an idiotic conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he got it, but he has the right to it. Fortunately, his bassist and friend, played by Dominic Monaghan, seems to acknowledge the fallacy of this thinking when he replies "you do not know that." <br /> <br /> The Limited Strengths of Direction and The plot could go in future projects either towards pointless banality or in an interesting and more mature perspective.
