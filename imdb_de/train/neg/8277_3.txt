That may be unbelievable, but this movie brought in $ 878,138 in Russia! It is shown in almost all cinemas and is still running! Well, I have no idea why distributors had this particular er "movie" in mind, which was hardly ever shown around the world. That's a kind of puzzle! Haha! Perhaps it was based on the fact that another film, "Pledge This" with Paris Hilton, which was released almost everywhere only on DVD, had big screenings in Russia and brought in more than $ 1 million. In addition, both films had a lot of advertising, as there were banners all over the city, TV commercials, etc. When I talk about film, I would say that it is boring and absolutely boring. It could really be better. Even if it has Jessica Simpson.
