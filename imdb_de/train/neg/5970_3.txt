Coyote Ugly would have been much more effective if the filmmakers had made it into a R-rated movie with a bad conscience (with a lot of nudity). But since the PG-13 rating is what all the studios want nowadays, we end up with a movie like this: a "tease" stick from PG-13, which should not go as far as the movie would have been should. <br /> <br /> The script is more generic than what it is It is easy to guess which plot point occurs 15 minutes before the actual occurrence of the plotpoint. Acting is appropriate, but the characters are as thin as paper that nothing can be done with it. There were also a lot of points where it seemed like I was watching a music video rather than a movie. <br /> <br /> The only merits of the film are the amazingly beautiful female characters. We see them in extremely tight and pretty revealing outfits ... but due to the PG-13 limitations, only a lot has been shown. There's a lot of cleavage and tight bodies with well-choreographed dance numbers, but there's no nudity or sex to talk about. Tyra Banks (getting madder with age) is also in the movie for a very short time. The sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very eye-friendly (and she has a stunning smile) and shows a real acting potential. <br /> <br /> The only people who approach this film are pre-pubescent boys. R-Rated movies may not be viewed yet. The crowd might get a lot out of the thrill, but the adult crowd will feel upset and cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: The 10 Women's Movie-1
