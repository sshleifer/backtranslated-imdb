After a first release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION has managed to scrape the bottom of the run with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I have NOT found any bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. A mysterious count invites several actresses to a small holiday in his castle. After a few softcore sex phenomena, the girls are gradually beheaded. Who is the murderer? Who knows? There are more red herrings here than at the local fish market on Friday. <br /> <br /> The pace is unbearable. The story is stupid and the skin scenes are not great either. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this.
