Here is another blasphemous European story in which they blast the religion of their country. (These atheist filmmakers are relentless.) Here we see a brutal demolition of Catholics and / or the Catholic clergy (and I'm not a Catholic). <br /> <br /> This won actually won an Oscar for foreign films. This is probably because history has made Catholics and faith in general look extremely weak. One of the main characters is a priest and he is more interested in food than anything else. He is only portrayed as an idiot. No wonder the secular-dominated Academy loved this movie. <br /> <br /> There is also an overreacted fool who plays a man who abandons his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters featured in the story. The daughters take turns seducing the "seminary" (who says he studied for six years but says he is an agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemous is this movie? !!! <br /> <br /> This is a shame and another great example of the secular-progressive bigotry of the movie business worldwide (not just in Hollywood).
