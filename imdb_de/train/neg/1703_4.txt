A Vietnamese veterinarian decides to take on a rampage of the backwater city, and anyone who steps on his path is eliminated (including women). Immediately before "A Star Is Born," which turned his career, he was released in the cinemas. This action drama mishmash with Kris Kristofferson is wild and unconventional, unthinking and mean. The results filmed in Simi Valley, California are truly unappealing. Redneck clich√©s and mindless violence make up most of the screenplay by director George Armitage. Armitage has garnered a highly curious 1970s cast for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters and, to some extent, Loni Anderson; The center of the whole, however, is Kristofferson, who is consistently rude and rude. It deserves points that I think are a totally disagreeable drive-in thriller, but the bad mood (and the ridiculous climax) smear the whole project like an ugly spot. * 1/2 of ****
