After hearing and enjoying Harvey Bernhard's Omen II commentary, I was shocked to discover that he was also behind this absolute garbage. It's like a really bad TV movie that you could see in the middle of the day, if you have flu and are too ill to reach the remote. I think that the moment Michael Lerner is confronted with what I can only describe as a college cast of Les Miserables, my mouth was open in disbelief. And then my mouth went up and down because I laughed so much. Dire I do not know why I have to write at least ten lines, in a nutshell, there's nothing clever about all these modern words.
