Not the best movie that Paul Naschy of Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) can remember is probably the worst swordsman I've ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came because the competition was just as bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is called adventure and horror. Forget the horror - there is none. No nudity, no blood, no monsters; Just a Robin Hood adventure against a bad baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to become king. <br /> <br /> The main part of the film was to see Graciela Nilson, who only shot four films in two years and to our disappeared regrettable loss. Where did she go?
