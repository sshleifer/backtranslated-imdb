Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were awful. It's hard to believe that anyone except John Cusack would have put money into this. With a series of anti-military / anti-war films that have already been destroyed at the box office, it is almost unimaginable that a studio of any kind wants to connect to this script. <br /> <br /> At first it may be I have resurfaced as a kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack (s). But only about 90 seconds into the movie's beginning, it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt by DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> <br /> I liked so many Cusacks movies that I thought I could watch the DVD of this movie. I have to say that I do not know if Cusack is so sensible that I could even watch another movie starring him, unless someone else can vouch for it. Cusack seems to be so irrevocably damaged by his hatred of George Bush and the Iraq war that he is ready to drive a career to his death. Tom Cruise never got close to being so far away. Not even close.
