Usually I try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my god !!! This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Bad drama, bad effects, bad script, all bad! <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of youthful clich√©s on the way to a rave (held in broad daylight) on a remote island. When the group arrives, however, they find only an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the other partygoers, the clan set out on a mission through a zombie-infested forest landscape. In this crusade, they are assisted by a police chick and a sea captain who happens to have the right number of weapons he can give each child. They also meet with Jonathan Cherry and several other survivors. The rest of the movie basically consists of a collection of poorly directed action sequences, including a far too long shootout outside the "House of the Dead". This fight was completed with cheesy Hollywood violence, superfluous clips from the HOTD video game, and sloppy, matrix-like camera shots. One of the characters even volunteers to sacrifice themselves to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because a part of his face was acid-stained when a zombie spit it out, after beating the creature long after the disability! I'm supposed to apologize for this guy?!? <br /> <br /> To sum up, there's no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself how awful it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I am sure that the money I wasted when I saw this piece was light, the cost it took to make it could cover. GRADE: F
