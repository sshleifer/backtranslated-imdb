I myself am a big fan of low-budget horror movies of the 80s. This is not the worst, but still not too spectacular. The plotting line is decent but stretches out way too long. You're through half the movie before you even see zombie action. The kills are not very creative and the zombies are not too smart. I really believe that this movie would have been better if they had omitted the zombies and made it just a mafia movie. It's visible, but I feel like this movie stole at least an hour of my life. I give the film the honor of being something original. If you are really interested in B-horror movies, this is worth a visit, but if not, do not bother. But you do not have to take my word for it.
