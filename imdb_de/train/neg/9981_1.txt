This movie was billed as a comedy and mystery. Both are bad. The only mystery here is why someone should make such a poorly constructed movie. The only comedy is the laughter when I saw how tall the readers were here. Could there be two films with the same name? In the movie I saw, there was a girl with pretty blue eyes and an action that was not there. <br /> <br />
