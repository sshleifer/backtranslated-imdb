In a usual run of the mill, a mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties (the subtle era of "free love"), the creators of this film stack up after ridiculous scenarios after ridiculous scenarios and crown everything from small cherry on top, happy to the end. At no time did I have any sympathy in their arduous bourgeois carefree life with Diane Lane or Anna Paquin, not even with the depopulated Liev Shrieber. The plot is slowly coming to its predictable, pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and visible about this film is the stunning Diane Lane topless. Here's a hint, it's about 30 minutes into the movie. Quickly forward to this part and skip the rest.
