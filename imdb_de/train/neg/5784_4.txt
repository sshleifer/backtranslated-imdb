I was not nearly as enthusiastic about it as many other critics. Sure, it has some beautiful girls who play erotic, lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two lovely sirens with razor teeth running to cars on a road in front of the cars, driving to their homes in the dusk and inviting their prey ... sex-hungry men into their boudoir. What happens there ... well, after they have mostly undressed and kissed, they kill their visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larraz has some highlights with his camera. Some scenes are quite scary and effectively filmed, but sex alone does not stop a movie (no pun intended ... at least consciously). There is really no big story here. We have the two girls. We see some inexplicable and inexplicable beginnings where we see them being shot with a pistol. Why? What does that mean? "Why did we greet a man who stays several days, a man in the hotel who insists that he knows him from years ago? Does that have any purpose? Of course, I have even more general questions like a pair of pretty-looking girls who when vampires are traveling the English countryside and filling a wine cellar with Carpathian wine, the screenplay is riddled with such shortcomings (literally) and then goes to bed in the tomb, ending with some juicier scenes, but it's anti-climatic There are, as I said, some effective scenes of the director ... I especially liked the way the girls dressed and filmed in the forest in search of their prey. The house is also an impressive set, and both girls are, as I said, very charming older movie fans, silent movie veteran Bessie Love has a short cameo a The end of the movie.
