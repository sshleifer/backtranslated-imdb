I never saw the original movie in the series ... I just hope it was a much better movie than this or the '80s sequel, as if those two terrible consequences were not exactly justified. This movie had a really good lead as it advertised one of those old independent channels that are now a thing of the past. Anyway, it looked like it was a pretty good scary movie. It was, however, a movie that would make some Walt Disney movies dark. Really, this movie was just a bunch of light lint that had virtually no boggy brook creature on it. The only real observation is in the end when you see the shape during a very heavy rain. Apart from that, there are virtually no signs of the creature being truly disappointing as a child. The story is essentially the old evil hunters must kill everything they see and are behind the swampy creek creature and kids are looking for, or just any hairy guy in the woods who likes to pull boats through the water. Not really worth seeing. However, I would like to see the original, although the creator has created the bad swamp creature of the 80s, but he has made in the 70s, a very good slasher movie "The Town the Dreaded Sundown".
