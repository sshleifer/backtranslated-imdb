Let me first say that I like watching "bad" movies. It's funny that some of these films are more likely to leave a lasting impression than the really great ones. This movie is disturbingly evil. This instrument for Sam Mraovich's insane ego not only borders on talentless inability, it has redefined the meaning of the words. This should forever be the barometer for bad movies. Sort of the Mendoza line for the movie. Mr. Mraovich writes, conducts and plays stars as a blunt object. Arthur Sailes fights against despised wives and the Christian forces of evil while he and his partner Ben are "dead behind the eyes". As a volunteer, I believe gays should have a right to marry. Ben & Arthur hurt this cause more than an army of homophobes. The depiction of all Christian things is so ugly and shitty, Mraovich's trademark that you can not take any of them seriously. Arthur's brother Victor, the bible that hurls Jesus Freak, is so grossly exaggerated that you have to wonder how he played in this role. That's because Sam "multitasking" Mraovich was also casting director. The worst thing is Sam Mraovich himself. If you think, leader, do you remember the words pasty, bald and chubby? Sam also delivers lines like Dominos Pizza, cold and mostly wrong. The last record: They suck on writing, directing, acting and casting. This is the fourfold crown of Ed Wood. Congratulations, you terrible little man.
