Yikes, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights when I was surfing the canals and banging into that stinker of a movie. For some of the names in the cast I would expect a much better movie. I'm almost embarrassed to see Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham reduced to such a dreadful part. I hope the money was worth it. And the students talked about fencing as if they were talking about surviving in a war or a terrible disaster. I mean, I've fenced in, it's a fun sport, but I've never been so intense. The only reason I ever saw the movie was that the remote fell under the couch and I was too lazy to get it back.
