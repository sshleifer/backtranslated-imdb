I've always wanted to see that because I love kitschy horror movies and with such a title I was sure that "The Incredible Melting Man" would be a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> It really was not like that. I mean, the drama was entertainingly bad, the script contained some classic bad lines, and the special effects looked like someone was sneering over the lead actor, so I should have loved it. Unfortunately it is very unpleasant between these highlights. I decided to watch the last half of the movie during my tax return. So boring is this movie. <br /> <br /> Even so, if you love bad movies, you'll see the dramatic outcome of the Fat Nurse and the outstanding role of the man who Dr. Ted plays, enjoy. To be fair to the poor man, he has to show amazingly inappropriate lines with a straightforward face - just like the conversation he has with his wife about the IM man: <br /> <br /> "I find him with one Geiger counter. "" Is he radioactive? " "Just a bit." <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot has Dr. Ted gets to find a super-powerful zombie killing machine armed with only a mini Dyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately, his plan fails when he finds a lot of goose bumps on a tree. "Oh God - it's his ear!" says Dr. Ted to the audience. I'm so glad he clarified that. <br /> <br /> I realize that I can make this movie pretty funny. It would be if it was only 10 minutes, but unfortunately it goes on and on, and the Incredible Melting Dude just depends on creating a sticky mess if I think he should eat more people. I think if you were really stoned, you probably would love it, there are only pop-tarts during the movie, because the lead actor is really similar to an end.
