SAPS AT SEA <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and White) <br /> <br /> Ollie suffers under "Hornophobia" and does a "restful" boat ride, but he and Stan mingle with a trapped convict (Rychard Cramer). Chaos follows. <br /> <br /> This feature-length comedy - an OK entry still dismissed as a mere imitation of Laurel and Hardy's best work - was the last collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach. The film is episodic and culminates in an unforgettable sea voyage after The Boys are taken hostage by villain Cramer (who shoots a seagull to prove how hard he is!). The gags are alright, but lack of inspiration, perhaps due to the recruitment of actor Gordon Douglas, who was previously responsible for Ollie's first solo performance in the sound era (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but whose work here Dimension is missing from pzazz. Nice, but nothing special. L & H regulars Charlie Hall and James Finlayson are visiting.
