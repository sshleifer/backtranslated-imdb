As has been said countless times, "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is NOT a remake of the (generally disregarded) 1980s successor to Wes Craven's 1977 original. Craven himself (a double threat to his son Jonathan), however, has chosen this postmodern successor to give the official stamp of Diminishing Returns. However, he has decided to write a film of equal quality - in plain English: TERRIBLE. The former director of music videos, Martin Weisz, takes over Alexandre Aja and is clearly above his head - yet one wonders how anyone could have made a movie from the Cravens' Screen 101 Scrawl. Not only that, the characters (in this case, a group of Goofball National Guardsmen (men) were sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake) are totally vile and prone to really annoying genre-pitfalls (played without a joke of Irony)), but they are always making jokes that are not funny. After seeing their complete inability during a workout, their fate against the repugnant, roaming cannibals is painfully apparent. Only this time, as in the '80s episode of the original, the script is so simple that it drops potential subtext in repulsive shocks in favor of increasing the ante (we are treated with a combo birth -murder during the Prelude, plus a baseless rape for those who have not ejected the DVD to the midpoint!). Even the mutants in this excursion are personalityless freaks without memorable stature - the sticky, rubbery makeup effects seem like the rest of the movie trying to hide their faces from embarrassment. I groaned at the lame "surprise" at the end of Ajaa's otherwise brilliant movie, and the producers literally go bankrupt at the end of "Hills 2" and stage - VERY lame the stage - for a third installment ... and yet they have Cravens and Weisz created a movie that is so cynical that the 1977/2006 version worked that they would hardly find an audience after this offensive slap in the face.
