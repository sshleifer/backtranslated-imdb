I found this movie an interesting study of cause and effect, but little more. The basic action follows the life of a handful of people and how their actions (intentional and otherwise) influence the lives of others. The premise of the film is promising, but I think he does not keep what he promises. Too much time is spent informing the audience about the chaos theory and too little time to really show it. As a result, I have not got any real feeling for any of the characters and have not made any emotional connection to them. At the end of the film, I had a "something like that" attitude to all. A stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great, but the way it is, it's just so-so
