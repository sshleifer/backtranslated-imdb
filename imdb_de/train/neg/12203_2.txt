I think it's time for John Rambo to go on with his life and try to leave Vietnam behind. This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a soldier, but a cold-blooded killer. Whenever he appears on the screen, someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place and frankly I'm tired of having Hollywood what it looks like. This is not the worst movie about Vietnam John Waynes Green Berets brings to honor. In any case, John Rambo, who carries around a 50-caliber machine gun, apparently carrying half of the Viet Cong army and many Russians, is an insult. Worse is the cheesy speech of Rambos at the end ... Please !! Oh yes, I heard that they still make one ...
