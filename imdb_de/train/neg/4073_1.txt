NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but this must be the poorest attempt ever to make one. Calling "film" is also a stretch. This "random staple-of-obvious-fake-and-tacky-violence-and-an-ugly woman trying to work-sexy-edited-bad-together-together" is not worth watching It's about as interesting as showing a casual family's vacation photos, and it's the same quality you'd expect when you send your 10-year-old son into the woods with your new vid cam and ask him to do a movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
