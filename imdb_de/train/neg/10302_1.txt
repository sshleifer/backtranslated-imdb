Since "Rugrats" were in the last three or four years on the category of the good and funny cartoons about a mediocre and very terrible indeed price for two-year-olds, the tyrants at Klasky-Csupo should obviously have no idea. After I stupefies all characters, new added yet duller and replaced some voices (although I like Nancy Cartwright, it is NOT Chucky Finster!) And had no sense of continuity (Example: In a Kimi episode I looked at the other viewed An the day got Tommy and Chucky each have a new puppy, but subsequently the dogs above never appear). One might think that the creators could kill the show by grace. But no. <br /> <br /> All I will say about this special is that it sucks! Although not as terrible as Kimi episodes, all of which are even more stupid than them, including Grandpa (my God! He used to be the best character in the series, but now he has no real purpose). The end is unnecessary fluffy and the only difference between this and other crappy new episodes ('98 -'01) is that children can interact with adults. Whoa, what fun! <br /> <br /> No stars for "The Rugrats All Growed Up". Klasky-Csupo, please destroy this show before it gets worse.
