A typical Goth chick (Rainbow Harvest, which looks like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) gets along with people whom she believes have hurt her with the help of an old haunted mirror she has in the new house finds that she and her mother find (horror) mainstay to buy Karen Black, the only good thing about this travesty). Acting is pretty ridiculously bad (especially when Rainbow interacts with the above-mentioned mirror) and there is no fear or tension. Inexplicably, this film has been thrown up for 3 sequels, each a little more cruel than the last one. If you are looking for a similar but far superior cinematic endeavor, it's a good idea to just locate the episode of "Friday the 13th: the Series," where a geeky girl finds an old cursed, compact mirror. In just under 40 minutes more disappointments are recorded than this whole franchise has made available for his 4 films. <br /> <br /> My degree: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Charlie Spradling offers compulsory T & A
