This film masquerades as a social commentary, though it is as ridiculous as the racism it condemns. The premise of this film: African-American = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst is when Rapaport pulls off Omar Epps and a Jew with a gun. The Jewish guy stereotypically breaks down in fear and asks for his life ... but the big, strong, defiant Omar Epps is strong without fear. We also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as an arrogant adoptive, who gets drunk or raped. The raped white girl, of course, thinks about Lesbianism, since she is only a weak white girl. Of course, if the Nerd White is rejected by the Brotherhood members, he must fit in with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the big muscular guy who is quickly knocked down by strong black men. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES WAS TWO HEADED HIGH SIZE ??? Yeah right. <br /> <br /> Of course, the black men NEVER reject their own people and Omar Epps moves easily. The scenes in which Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are stupid - of course, he is the dominant, while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and finally move out. This movie was just awful and the end actually made me laugh. The extra-slow slow motion between Epps and Banks becomes hilarious from the faces they make - it's like watching my nephews and cousins ​​make faces at each other (and they're all under 5). Do yourself a favor and skip this Crapfest.
