You should know that I am the kind of person who watches even the worst films to the finish, often out of pure curiosity. I even saw Leprechaun to the end, before giving in to the temptation to rip out my eyes and stamp on them. You should also know that this movie was in my VCR for less than half an hour before I jumped the stop button frantically and withdrew the pawnshop to have as much distance between me and him as possible.
