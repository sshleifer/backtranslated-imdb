This movie was awful. I thought with all the decent actors, it would be better. Do not waste your time. Eva Longoria Parker was terrible. She should stay with desperate housewives. Paul Rudd becomes a B actor. The mess he made in the movie that I could never be your wife was the epitome of what I say. and Lake Bell she was cute, but she definitely needed more acting classes. Look at the sky with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a bit better. or any other ghost movie. You will be grateful not to have wasted your precious time. PS I love you is also a good beyond the romance! Time to watch movies that are over 7 out of 10, and to hear the people who have already seen it.
