"The Winners" was recommended as one of the few good action films in Germany. I saw it last night and have to admit that I am deeply disappointed. If that is "the last best hope" for the entertaining and challenging German action cinema, then there is not much left. <br /> <br /> "The Winners" tries to be sexy, brave and angry, but it's nothing like that. The characters are made of wood and stereotypes, and when they do something unexpected (which does not happen too much), it goes against their nature. That makes it difficult - almost impossible for me - to follow them or even identify with them. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is a very bad cast. There is no character that I believe in. Maybe the chief officer of the SWAT unit - but that's about it. Those people who try to look like special forces like elite cop or behave - I do not believe them. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. But I think it's badly told. You do not get to know the evil - for example. And when Karl Simon (the Good One) asks his already dead opponent after a "very dark" show, "why? ... what for?" The same question I asked myself, knowing that Dominik Graf had no answer. I sincerely hope - no - I think that Germany is doing better with action films as well.
