I will not take too much time here, just to say that Darkman 3 is awesome. I've added all 3 to DVD to my collection of DVD movie sets. Darkman ranks there with the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars and The Hard, you get the point. There are not too many good scares, Thriller, out there. Many thanks to the entire crew and ready to give us the Darkman trilogy. By the way, if you're wondering how I came here on DVD. I bought it over the internet, but it's Region 4. As you know, most of the US DVD players are Region 1. If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player, since it's one All-region player acts. Just go to setup and then select the desired region setting (1-9).
