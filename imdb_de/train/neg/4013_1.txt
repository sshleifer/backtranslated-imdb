After watching some great things from HBO - Band of Brothers, Rome, etc. - I have to say that I had pretty high expectations before seeing the first episode of "True Blood". Goodness Often, the script seemed to be written by an 8-year-old, some parts just filmed horribly (The scene where she "saves" Bill, I mean, come on, she throws a chain at the guy and she's done It was pretty embarrassing if you wanted my opinion, or a few moments before that scene, when she finds out that the couple is gone with Bill, she is ridiculous Plan things and like 5 seconds later, magic! The 3 of them are gone, and without any effort, noises or anything! <br /> <br /> I mean, the idea of ​​the show seemed interesting, mysterious, fascinating, vampires, who coexist with people in our modern society ... but I do not think they really wanted to do more than a little soap show that the average teenage girl watches all the time but nobody else cares about Unfortunately, the script is poorly written, mediocre at best, flat and extremely predictable, I often thought that was a joke or something. <br /> <br /> The actors really do not deliver convincing performances if you want my opinion. They seem to take the show very lightly, as if it were some sort of regular low-budget family show (well, maybe that's what it takes to take the family part away). The only actor I liked was Stephen Moyer in the role of Bill, considering the poorly written, extremely short answers "What are you doing ...". "Can I call you sometime ..." I think he did well to highlight the somewhat mysteriously frightening part of a vampire that everyone with a vampire role really needs to have. Anna Paquin was okay too, but not anymore. But the guy who plays her brother is terrible. The scene in which he is arrested is simply a shame for modern television. Acting is bad, the site looks spotty, and the other two guys, "Why is he arrested? Uh ... I do not know ..." That was pretty embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Another thing I totally missed was the way they presented Sookie's psychic powers. They let us hear what people think AND talk at the same time and that's just wrong. Often, it just seems to be unnecessarily chaotic, as if people's thoughts were a kind of annoying radio channel, and as it approaches, it reaches the right frequency and needs to hear everything they think. <br /> <br /> And finally, the sex scenes are just superfluous and the vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong: I did not write all those comments because I thought the show was bad but because I was very disappointed. I expected quality things. I did not think it would be like that. It's definitely not a good show. At best mediocre.
