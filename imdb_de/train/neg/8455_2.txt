"Arahan" adds nothing positive to the kung fu genre. Comparing this confused film with the inspired madness and quality of Stephen Chow's films is a mistake. <br /> <br /> First, the fight scenes are nothing new. Everything presented here has been made earlier and better by Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Battles in intelligent movies need logic. It does not seem to make sense to use punches that have no harmful effects, as in the "Matrix" Fords. <br /> <br /> So-Yi Yoon's attractive female lead captivated the screen, but she did not convincingly overcome the physical requirements of the role Ziyi Zhang had made it so easy in "House Of Flying Daggers". Having a martial arts background is good in Kung Fu movies. It is a grave mistake to fill actors with these skills (see Aya Ueto in Asumi), unless you are a very talented director who proves to be "Arahan" that Seung-wan Ryoo is not.
