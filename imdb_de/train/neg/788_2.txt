A movie that has little to say. <br /> <br /> First, it has zero speed and is positive in every drama. <br /> <br /> Besides being remarkably slow, The Empty Acre seems to be dedicated to using the same footage over and over again. I have not counted how many times I had seen "that" field at night or that piece of cracked earth. <br /> <br /> It also has the fundamental mistake of thinking when the audience knows nothing about things is being seized and not just confused. With no sign that there are any problems, we suddenly realize that marriage is not what it seems to be, even though it gives the impression that it's okay. We find that Jacob may be the worst peasant in the universe, as he does not seem to spend any time on the farm and seems to have bought land with a completely useless East Country. Beth has a key to a storehouse for books? There are countless other questions, some of which are resolved later, far too late, in fact too late. <br /> <br /> And on the point of the farmland. Horror filmmakers find that large inanimate objects are not inherently frightening. and also, if they are to be a morning tall, then they do it like that. <br /> <br /> There is also a frightening lack of sanity as Beth (the best performer of the play, followed by Jefferson, the cop) Suddenly, everything seems to be charged under the sun just because they rely on "medication" located. With the full ten minutes and running around the field looking for the missing child (is he crawling out of the house? The window is six months old) The film is translated into poorly written scenes for poorly written scenes. Poor plinky plonk "horror" music creates no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Often bad movies are amusing, but not The Empty Acre, which is just bad.
