I saw this late night on the cable. At the time I did not know that the girl named "Shannon Wilsey" was actually pornstar Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and so often naked, thank God) that I actually rotted through that brain. I like kitschy flicks as much as the next guy - actually more than the next - but that was more than cheesy and more rancid. The really annoying exaggeration of the crazy scientist and the virtually total incompetence of the directors, writers and special effects has a negative impact on the unfounded nudity that is the only salvation of the film. Savannah, before she turned into the plasticized Barbie doll, she became a porn queen, and it's really interesting to see - she's gorgeous, sometimes breaks into an uncontrollable giggle, takes a look away from the camera, and laughs and shines in general to be a really good time, which is more for the audience. For although Savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this image naked, the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, bad-made, and annoying movie is undeniable. If you know someone who has it on video, or if it comes on cable one night, look at it, but do not waste your money on a rental.
