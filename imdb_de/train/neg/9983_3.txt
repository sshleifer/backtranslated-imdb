This movie is a huge yawn proving that Americans have no farce. Even if it was already written for you! The original movie "Hodet Over Vannet" is a funny error comedy that I would rate at 8/10. It's not just a linguistic translation, it skips certain absurd chains of events altogether, robbing the movie of its original, crafty Farcical nature and turning it into a cheap style of farce.
