Maybe lately I have only had a bad run with Hindi films. I asked the video library about Apharan (Prakash Jha), but since it's a new release, it was not available yet. So I had to settle for it. It was the dumbest Hindi movie I've ever seen (and I've seen a few). No wonder BOllywood laughs the whole world! If IMDb had negative reviews, I would give Garam Masala a -10. <br /> <br /> I remember watching a TV show about the jazzy premiere they had for their release in Mumbai. All the usual celebrities and their sideys appeared. For some strange reason, people expect good stuff from Piyadarashan. I did not like Hulchul, Hungama or his other films. Hulchul, probably baptized by Tamil or Telugu, seemed like a very loud, looking-into-your-face food that did not make much sense except in a Bollywood movie. This latest piece of CXXP has proven that this guy has NO BRAINS. Who made him a director, even a Bollywood director ??? <br /> <br /> Now for the movie. What begins as a romantic escapade becomes a nonsensical female hunt. Two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment (is not it similar to No Entry, where the two guys work for a gossip magazine and share an office - a cook or a cook trying to get one of the dodos on his? Seeking multilateral love to help (aka multitasking + multitiming) What happened in the end I have no idea I switched off halfway What a ridiculous garbage I can not believe they even published it And how sadistic to wallow in their own filth, what kind of audience have they done - the poor Indian illiterate (last 700 million) or the well-traveled NRI who's in Phoren? Either way it does not matter Groups have a clue what makes a good movie, and probably deserve such awful stuff. <br /> <br /> It's a quick review because there's nothing to write except the usual garbage in class F. Bollywood should change its name to Follywood. And yes, this review is much better than the movie itself.
