I think this is probably one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> When trying to reach the same characters with different people, * a * bad idea. If they could not get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this case, they should have just reduced their losses and said they should come to terms with it. Instead, they get NEW actors who are terrible in what they have done. I felt seriously like in high school or a (bad) college game with the leverage to behave these people. <br /> <br /> Where do you get some of these people from? Was this your first movie? It sure seemed like that. <br /> <br /> This movie is similar in some lines to the original. I just finished the first one and watched # 2. I was excited to see the second and it was the worst show I've seen in a long time. I can hardly EVER * EVER * turn off a movie, but this is definitely after about 30 - 40 minutes canceled.
