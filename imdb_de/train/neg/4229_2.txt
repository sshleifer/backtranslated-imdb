I'm a big fan of low budget horror films like this, but come on! This is the worst monkey S @ # t I've ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this website and found that it would be scary with horror, but I got bored and turned it off from the main depot. The masks were made of tin foil. <br /> <br /> The Gore: The Gore was pretty good, I have to give it. But Ittenbach's Burning Moon was better for a low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Acting: Was terrible! The synchronization did not bother me. I find it humorous as in Ittenbach's "Premutos" (great movie). The combat and action sequences were very bad. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Do not watch Schnaas films. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with films of the same topic and topic. Check Premutos, House of Blood, Schramm and the Necromancics.
