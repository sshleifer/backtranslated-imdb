This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it takes only one and a half hours, it feels somewhere near 4. I've never seen a movie move so slowly and without purpose. This is also a "horror movie" that often takes place during the day. My friend and I laughed incredibly often when we were probably scared. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why such a horrible movie has been released in so many countries. It can not be that popular. <br /> <br /> The supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to the modeling, because although she is beautiful, she has so often lost her accent in this film.
