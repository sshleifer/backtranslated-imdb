Please, make fun of me by reading the back of the ALLEY CAT VHS box for a minute. It says: <br /> <br /> In this part of the city, every street is a dead end - buy something on every corner - a different way to die in each alley - to survive, you have to be the best - exactly like the Alley Cat. Alley Cat - this lady owns the night. She knows how to survive in the streets where even the predators become victims. Cross them and you are out of luck. Alley Cat - This animal is excited. <br /> <br /> Is not that one of the most miserable sounds you've ever heard in your life? The one who wrote this must be crazy if he thought such a terrible description could look at the video. Unfortunately, the faceless person responsible for the tragic use of English has done their job too well. The film contained in the small plastic case is as bad as it sounds, and then a lot more. <br /> <br /> Karin Mani plays the title role, and the script challenges her during any given scene, either a) pouting like a goldfish, b) a male butt, or c) showing off her female 'attributes'. No complaints about the latter, but with respect to the other two ... Let's just say that she is not a big actress and even less convinced as a martial arts expert. But even Meryl Streep with Cynthia Rothrock's body (what a scary thought) would not save this movie. The storyline unfolds incredibly boring as we progressively get an inappropriate battle sequence pausing only for hysterical courtananans and the occasional gag-inducing love scene with the intriguingly named Robert Torti. The camera work also follows a similar path of shame, with far too many unnecessary close-ups and continuity errors. <br /> <br /> The part I think is right is that this scum bucket of a movie is here Our heroine is sexually assaulted. She testifies to a corrupt judge while her rapist of rich mind laughs at her out of the box. In spite of the overwhelming evidence against him, not only can he get away with it, but she herself is imprisoned for daring to protest the sentence before his honor. Behind bars, she then has a group shower, a lesbian swarm, a few cat fights, and a nice, sweaty volleyball game before being released on bail to continue her fight. This ten minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and the script stops to capture it. I can only imagine that the producers wanted to add a little more T & A to the mix and thought up this unnecessary negotiation as a means of achieving that goal. <br /> <br /> What kind of question raises the question An exploitative movie or a serious drama? Nor is my answer to that .. it is not sloppy or camped enough to appeal to the fans of the Troma Cinema, and it does not make any sense of exploring a woman's fight against the system it is so abhorrent. Who in the world would want to see it? I think Lunatics ... or IMDb reviewers who stay awake until 3pm and watch old garbage on the box as they try to fall asleep. Unfortunately, I have occasionally failed, and the horrors will stay with me for some time. Do not make the same mistake as me. Have a hot milk or something .. 1/10
