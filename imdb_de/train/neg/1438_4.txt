Well! What can one say? First, this 4-hour adjustment is far too long for the complexity (or lack of such) action. The actors are really trying to make something out of this movie, but there is not enough content for the time. Swayzee is NOT really a Quatermain character. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen," Swayzee really does not impress. This guy with the repetitive Winchester rifle has no strength, stature, subtlety, or humor needed for the role, and is outraged by everyone, including the witch doctor, who by the way, in my view, seems more convincing than the rest of the actor Occupation. Some of the prospects are pleasing, but there are stupid mistakes in cinematography. For example. When the happy team arrives at the waterhole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible all the way to the oasis, just waiting for them to run in it. The exit from the mine leads to an exit (on the next shot), which is nothing more than the exit, which is seen from the passage through which they have passed, and so on. I was waiting for Doug McClure at any moment. In a way, I wished he had it. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians following Quatermain is a modest, stereotypical character who only shoots at everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee is fine, as the sad father returned to London, who can not get custody of his son. Swayzee should stick to that. He is unable to play the role of a courageous gentleman with a firm heart, life experience and a sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
