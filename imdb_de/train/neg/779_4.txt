Seriously, I mean it very seriously, when I started watching the show, I thought it was good. But the conspiracies just got worse. The plot was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, sometimes he seems stupid. His jokes are exaggerated. His mother is the dumbest character of the show. How can a mother treat her own son that way, okay, if it was the daughter-in-law, but this was her own son. I'm giving this show a 4/10 just because the first shows were a bit funny. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha are doing a great job. I do not know how these shows will play for so long. <br /> <br /> If you are really bored and can not see anything else, I would suggest you to have a look.
