In my humble opinion, this version of the great BDWY musical has only two things to offer - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script. (OK, Vanessa Williams is good to see.) But for me that's all. Most cast seems to be going through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is, and no wonder people are running over Harry McAfee when played by George Wendt. Jason Alexander is passable, but this wig has to go and I've seen better dancing in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned earlier, it's good to have a version of the stage script now, but I hope the boys out there, who have never seen a musical, DO NOT judge by it.
