This show seemed to be good somehow. Kyra Sedgwick is an ok actress and I like police shows, but somewhere in the production this program went awry. <br /> <br /> First of all, the authors should have more suspects than one, you know who did it EVERY TIME !!!!! That makes it boring. The main character is incredibly annoying and in no way credible. I know you wanted her to be tough, but you mean, stupid and a bad chief. The crimes are uninteresting and boring, and they are only lame. Like I said, I hate it ... All in all this was a big disappointment and very bad ...
