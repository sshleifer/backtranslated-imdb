This was supposed to be a great movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson as two newspaper writers. Mike Nichols Director Um It's boring boring! Futile and predictable! Slow and blurry! <br /> <br /> It's a cookie cutter 'Boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy has affair, girl leaves the boy's story. Now there is an original concept! After twisting for two hours (were it just two? It felt like six.) I was not sure if it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy, or a soap opera. It was made in 1986. I'm sure we all did things 16 years ago that we'd rather forget. I hope the damage to the reputation of Streep et al. Starts to heal and the emulsion on the master begins to fade. It's not that it's such a bad picture. It's just that it's so bad.
