I really felt cheated after seeing this picture. It felt like I sat this movie for 101 minutes without a reason. I do not understand what they thought when they did that. It hardly comes in Jeffrey Dahmer's murder and it has no end. It almost felt like they were leaving this film open for a sequel. It was like watching a television episode of the sopranos. It ends suddenly and you will know there will be another episode next week. It also felt like I just saw part 1 of a two-part movie. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here. They became lazy, they had no more money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to make a doer. After watching this movie, they all sounded very accurate. I saw Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods. Suddenly I hear this music playing, then it is written on the screen how Dahmer served two years of imprisonment and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34 forest forest to his death in prison. How about showing how he got there? How about presenting Dahmer's trial? How about some more details. I can not even explain what happened in this movie because he jumped everywhere. I actually said incredulously, "That's it, that's the end?" Finally, I want to say that there is still a good Dahmer movie. I want to tell the filmmakers, if you do, do it right.
