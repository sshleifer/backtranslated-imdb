Let me wave my hand over the keyboard, I'll tell you which salad she'll order. works like a charm again and again: he is such a genius, omg, how does he do that? My Bullshit Detector Freaks If I go through this show once, when I scan channels, I have to be very careful (it's too often useful these days, so I do not need it to be so broken in idiotic crap ... careful .) with this remote control!). Is this supposed to be a fascist propaganda to believe people in an invisible realm of Ubermanic control and mastery? or what? Why is this? <br /> <br /> This is the most incredible show, absolutely incredible and invented, and I can not understand why it is still in the air. So, Geeks may give so much better shows (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but give that nonsense moron a run. Shows like Firefly (if there was such a thing) fall away after a season, but pointless stuff like this, which makes no sense, just keeps marching on. Yeccch.
