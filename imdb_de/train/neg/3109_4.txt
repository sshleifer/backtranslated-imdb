This movie was not terrible, but not very good. I'm a big fan Toni Collette I think she's a very beautiful and talented actress. The film begins with writer Robin Williams, who receives a book from a 14-year-old child. The book is great and he can not believe that a child wrote it. Toni Collette plays the guardian for children you do not know if this boy really exists or if she invented everything. I will not ruin the movie, but I say the movie is not scary. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good and Toni Collette's performance was as good as Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The movie was a big disappointment. In my opinion, I would wait for him to come to DVD.
