Boy oh boy oh golly gee, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie was the hilarity of the blue screen effects that created Mom's "Invisibility". They looked like they were shot on cheap videos, and it looks totally unreal, and not even in a good way, where it's so funny that you end up loving the movie ... love this movie. The attempted "steadicam" shots were really pathetic. I mean, hey, if they had a low-budget streak, that's fine. You can still make a great movie on a budget. But a bad movie and a low budget AND effects. That makes a bad combination. In this case, such a damned combo created the craptastic movie "Invisible Mom." If you have children and your children have no taste, they may stay awake.
