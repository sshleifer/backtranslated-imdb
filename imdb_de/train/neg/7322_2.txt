I give credit where credit is due and say Linda Fiorentino does a good job as a stubborn actress doing what she wants. She is cheeky, cheeky, sharp-edged and very sexy. She is much better than this movie deserves. <br /> <br /> But that's IT. This boring suspense movie is a fragmentary jumble that is instantly supposed to be a stalker thriller, a murder thriller, a story of loyalty and betrayal, and an erotic thriller. The film, my friends, is not in the least exciting. <br /> <br /> Who, for example, thought of occupying C. Thomas Howell as a desirable lead actor? He's not ugly, but if you scream loudly, it looks like Fiorentino's hard cookie goddess is doing it with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither the authority nor the screen presence to take the lead. <br /> <br /> The script is by far the worst aspect of the movie. There are no tensions as the character of Fiorentino receives eerie phone calls, there is no mystery about their guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film <br /> Look for interesting but maligned cameos by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes and a really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. Apart from that, my first impulse would be to put away this sad trash and rent something else.
