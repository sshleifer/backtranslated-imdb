I just hate the Robert De Niro movie. It's a stupid movie with terrible actors (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma has to do his mafia films as usual like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved De Palma's Mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro also worked with Palma twice, greetings and wedding. I thought The Wedding Party was okay too (I did not see any greetings). <br /> <br /> Screenplay is really bad and unstable. There is no scene where I can even smile once. The movie lost the chance to be funny in a Be Black Baby scene, and I do not like the scene where a man's sexual organ appeared. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! worst of all I hate that.
