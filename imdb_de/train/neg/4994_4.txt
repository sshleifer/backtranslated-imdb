Good films are original, some leave a message or touch in a certain way, but sometimes you're in no mood for it. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, no thinking. It started well and was pretty entertaining, so why a bad review. In the end, the movie has lost its credibility. The story was not so cheesy, the action was not special, but overall good. The drama was fine, more than enough to meet my needs. But everything was ruined because things happened that were over the top, and I had a bad feeling. They would have needed to make a little more effort to make everything credible and would have received a 7 in the No Thinking category. So if you know, you get irritated because things happen that are utterly illogical: do not watch! otherwise I would say, go on ...
