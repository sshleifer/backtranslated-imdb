It's amazing that this movie is on one of my charts. It's by far the worst movie # 1 I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not only that I've ever been so bored (fortunately no longer than 1.5 hours), the attempts before the puberty of humor this property is not even close to getting, but one of the corners of the mouth is slightly inclined. After the first very awkward part, you tend to hope that the other parts will at least get a little better. They hope for nothing, it's just downhill. <br /> <br /> The film has no story worth telling, and it repeats this non-story three times. One can only hope that by a miracle, all remaining copies of this film will be lost forever and Trent Harris will never again put his hands on a camera ...
