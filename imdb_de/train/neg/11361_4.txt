It's pretty unreal what these flies can do ... well ... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen in it. <br /> <br /> First, I have to tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately, this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is nothing but a list of errors: <br /> <br /> 1) I have quoted the tag line. It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I have not seen any, at least nothing special that I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) The "flies" in this movie do not look like real flies. At least they could have made her black. But cyan flying, seriously? With huge heads and slender torsos? <br /> <br /> 3) The story. I think it was written for 6 year old kids. I could say it in two sentences, it's so overly simplified. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "They are American files!" Oh, give me a break.
