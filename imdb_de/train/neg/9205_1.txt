This movie is awful. Bad acting, bad writing, bad music. It's just awful. Not only is it unbelievably wrong for role-playing games, but the key elements of the movie are poorly executed. May the God, whom I do not believe in, have pity on the souls of the wretched fellows who have begotten and born this abomination.
