I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife, who loved the version she had seen on TV. But the DVD version was a disaster. The lighting was poor to nonexistent and whole scenes were simply removed. In one case, Adele is put to bed, and we immediately cut to another scene - in the middle of the sentence - in which it's the next night. Characters like Grace Poole and Mason are never introduced, and one wonders if they fell asleep for a few minutes during the movie. The DVD we saw was made by Platinum Disc Corp. At $ 6.32, it was a gypsy. <br /> <br /> Be careful which version of this movie you buy! We will send this back.
