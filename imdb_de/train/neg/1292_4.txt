Okay ... that was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I had heard a lot of good things about it and was very disappointed. I could see where the filmmakers came from and that they were trying to say that the two sides in this fight did not differ much from each other, that the individuals lost themselves in the fighting, etc. (well, that's my guess anyway) ^ =) <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie bores me. I've seen a lot of really long movies, but this movie always seemed to go back and forth ... basically because I just do not care about the characters. I just kept thinking ... who cares? I also found the acting quite dead and the dialogue was tense. I understand that these were the 1800s and all, but most of the conversation just seemed unnatural. No one seemed to have any emotions throughout the movie except in melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> The "romance" in the story did not seem to be anything other than "I'm a man and." you're a girl ", which I do not think is much romance, and yet I felt led to the belief that these people were in love, well ... I think it's the whole thing" all this horror around us "We have each other to hold on to," or whatever, I also hoped for a kind of dynamic between the two best friends (both of whom initially had an interest in the girl), but that had somehow gone down, perhaps avoiding a clich√© triangle do not know. <br /> <br /> Well, Daniel Holt was the only character I really liked, and Sue Lee was all right, I did not really like Jake, but he seemed a bit too ... with no backbone, I suppose, Jack Bull did not interest me at all, and I'm pretty sure you should hate everyone else, except for the poor normal people who are just mowed left and right, it was pretty graphic and had that whole "The Schrec to the point, but I have seen many other films on the same subject, done better. (For example, I enjoyed The Patriot very much, even if it was a bit of emotional manipulation.) But as I said, I'm a cynic. What can I say? :)
