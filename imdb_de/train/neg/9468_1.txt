The only good thing about this listless rubbish is that I did not have to pay for it. I saw it for free in college. And if a student can not find humor in something that was free, he is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Stale acting and bad jokes can not be masked by a superb, but confusing set design to market VW Beetle). I do not know what Michaels Myers did in this movie, but I have never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing more than a blatant effort to profit from the previous success of Grinch (who has his opponents but I enjoyed it very much). It is difficult not to endure this failure and to wonder which better projects have been handed over for funding. <br /> <br /> You would like a fun Seuss adaptation? Go with the Grinch.
