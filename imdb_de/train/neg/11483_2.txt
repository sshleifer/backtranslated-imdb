I was fully turned on to watch this movie. I had waited a year for it to be cleared here in New Zealand. I should not have built up so much because it was so disappointing and undoubtedly Clark's worst movie. So much is wrong with this movie. First of all, acting is great, especially Nick Stahl as "The Bully" and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can not remember her name), but most of it was so uncontacted and incredibly unbelievable especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of Clark's films and he was so brilliant in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he so solemnly stages his productions that his scenes virtually become a parody. The script felt like it had been written by a film student in the first year. No, excuse me, a high school student ... one who has never seen a movie before. And I could not understand Clark's intentions. Did he try to show the futility of the existence of these children? It damn well did not stop me from getting into a damn good pervert. I'm not careless, but I did not need to see teenage boobs and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still say that Clark's best movie is Another Day in Paradise. It's fantastic and I do not think he'll ever outdo it.
