I recently saw the documentary "The Revolution Is Not Televised", also known as "Chávez: Inside the Coup". At first I thought it was a real staging of events during the April 2002 Venezuelan coup. What bothered me, however, was the fact that the tone of the narrative and the accompanying music were suggestive and never criticized Hugo Chavez. This is strange, because if a documentary contains an impartial account of what happened, there should have been something about it. After all, Chávez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, since the documentary is several years old, many additional pieces of information are now available on the Internet, and it was not difficult to find "Dring Investigation for Chavez" - the coup of the five European TV corporations that funded the film blatant lies about Venezuela.

Available on video.google I recommend after watching "Chávez: inside the coup," "X ray of a lie "and then form your opinion, and my conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian (knowingly or not) were involved in the Chávez propaganda.
