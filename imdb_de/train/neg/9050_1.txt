I saw this movie in its entirety in the 1960s and 70s, yes, it is cruel and could be the forerunner of the popular "Faces of Death" series in the 80s and 90s. In view of the status of the so-called "driver training" of these days, this should be considered for all who are preparing to learn the driving, necessarily. If you see the violent death in all its gore and horror, you certainly have (if you have any sensitive behavior) a closer look at the responsibilities required for safe driving, a moment of thoughtlessness or carelessness at the wheel can cause. In the 70s and 80s, I worked for Bell Telephone. Once I was assigned to carry out a security class. I found this movie in the corporate library, showed it to the meeting, a number of people got sick and had to leave the room! Incredibly, most later said, "I never thought a car accident could be so terrible!" This film and another movie, "RED ASPHALT", is certainly reality in its most vivid form. I'll never forget it, I just wish I had found a copy when my kids attended "driver's ed" in high school!
