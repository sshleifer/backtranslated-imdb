SLASHERS (2 of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Not really a very good movie ... but I liked the idea behind it ... and the filmmakers did the movie pretty well, considering the low budget with work. The film is supposed to be an "episode" of a Japanese live reality show that sends several participants into a secluded "danger zone" and sends three costumed goose bumps after them to kill them. The survivor, if there is one, wins fame and fortune ... everyone else is just dead. The main disadvantage of this movie is that acting is pretty bad. None of the "real" people seems to be real at all. The actors who play the killers are somehow fun ... because they are cheesy and exaggerated caricatures of popular modern horror movies ... and that's exactly how they would be made if this was a real show. The film pretends to be done all at once ... There is a cameraman who follows the contestants in the "Danger Zone" and everything is seen from the perspective of his camera ... but the light flickers over and over again I would imagine the "cuts" from one take to another).
