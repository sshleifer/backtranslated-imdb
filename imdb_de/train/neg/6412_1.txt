I have just returned from the movie and am totally horrified. This movie is an absolute ridicule for all humanity. The theater I was in might have had 4 other people. This film was recommended to me and I could not believe that this person liked it. I can not believe that a healthy person would like it. There was no action that contained NO PLOT. It was a joke. How can you do a movie about nothing? This movie just shows why Hollywood is in such a mess. I can only look at the spiral of the "horror movie" industry and giggle. What a travesty for filmmaking, this applies to all new "Teen Horror Flicks" series Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw. It's all so rubbish. Do not support this type of Hogwash!
