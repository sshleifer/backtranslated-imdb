Where should I start? The terrible spectacle? The nonsensical conspiracy? The bargain basement effects? The completely vile characters? The choppy editing? Headache-causing Casio Keyboard Score ??? The embarrassing racist remarks ("Watch it, Charlie!", "Turn off, Jackie Chan !!") The constant misogyny ??? I'm a lifelong horror fanatic, and I have no issues with the current "torture-thon" trend of the movies, but this is a poorly made piece of garbage I think I have more pain in watching than the characters who died in it! They want girls to be forced to eat fried penis, really poor softcore porn and think lines like "I'll find that b **** and staple them c *** stop !!" are smart, LIVE FEED is for you. <br /> <br /> As for me I feel the need to rinse my eyes with a stove cleaner so I can never see the movie again!
