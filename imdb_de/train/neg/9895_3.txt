If this book has remained true to the book, we can only assume that the author does not know the story. Mark Anthony never died of injuries he suffered in the battle. He died of a coward by suicide and even then he asked his slave to do it for him. The slave decided instead to kill himself. In real history, Mark Anthony was ashamed of the slave's great bravery and decided to copy it. But even in death, Mark Anthony was a drunken failure and failed at his suicide attempt. He called to Cleopatra and was brought to her bloody. She pulled up his trash on ropes and Mark Anthony died a while later. If you want history, do not look at this movie. If you want a romantic poultry, you will probably enjoy it!
