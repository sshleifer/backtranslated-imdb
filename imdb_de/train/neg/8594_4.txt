At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) Neil (Cillian Murphy) says she's always looking for an adventure. She said "because I'm bored." This means that she can not really go on with her life with some compulsory activities. I think their reason and the way this film is going is very ironic. Because "Watching the Detectives" is in a good mood. <br /> <br /> Did some of these characters actually do something exciting? Neil is a geek who runs his own, very small video library. He and his other geek friends usually sit around in the shop watching movies as they discuss. But Neil's life is completely different when Violet goes to his shop. She is an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. After a few appointments, they decide to meet. The problem is that Violet is a person who is always joking about Neil and can not really do something normal while Neil is completely different from her. The question is. Will they be in love in the end? You bet. <br /> <br /> "Watching the Detectives" is a clich√© romance comedy. And they made it worse by pretending to be something else. From the first few shots, we know that Neil is a pretty laid-back guy who's not really committed to anything. And then Violet enters the scene and looks funny and annoying. At this point we all know that we will be sitting in all meaningless situations to find out how they will end up. Is it worth it to wait? I would say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they tried to give more to the audience. "Watching the Detectives" tries to talk about engagement. Watch how far people go to achieve something they want. We knew in the end that crazy things Violet did is the only test of how far Neil is prepared to win her heart (or whatever). Well, I think that's totally shit. This movie will end pretty quickly when Neil says to himself, "Forget it, the girl is insane!" After collaborating with many great directors recently (Danny Boyle's "Sunshine" and "28 Days Later"), Ken Loach's "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" and Neil Jordan's "Breakfast on Pluto", just to name a few Cillian makes a strange choice for Murphy to shoot a movie with Paul Soter, a Broken Lizard comedy. He is definitely not bad (as usual), but such a talented actor as he should not waste his time in this movie. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is terribly terrible as Violet. Her acting is a mess. I mean, it's everywhere and so exaggerated. Tony Montana would have been proud. <br /> <br /> The last and last but not least mistake made by the film is a completely irrelevant title. You just can not really connect a point between the drawing and the title. and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense at all. In short, "Watching the Detectives" is a pleasant thing to do when you make a forgettable movie that you can see on cable TV so fast that you can not imagine it. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday rating: 1.5 / 4
