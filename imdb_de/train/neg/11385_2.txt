Before I begin, let me say that my experience with this movie may have been affected by the synchronization I get from comments other than the original, which some consider inferior. So it is quite possible that subtitles or the apparently new DVD version make a difference. I have not read the book in question; I only know another Japanese manga and may not have a cultural context. <br /> <br /> Potential smaller spoilers in front of me. <br /> <br /> I usually like dark-tint science fiction stories (like Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I did not like this movie at all. While it was initially intriguing, it was only slowly getting ready when it was halfway through. There are all sorts of problems. Let's start with what is probably the most serious: the dialogue. The characters do not seem to be able to formulate complete sentences. Unless they cry each other for the nth time, they usually grunt monosyllabically ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr", etc.). Most characters are completely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It does not help in the least that many of them have only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting being said that would further develop them from the stereotypes the visuals propose. The grunt is complemented by a random pseudo-philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards. There is nothing profound and meaningful here - everything seems arbitrary, made up of different pieces and sci-fi ideas without any connection. <br /> <br /> What little of an intelligible storyline is nothing more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence consisting of escalating scenes of chaos and destruction. Of course, there is nothing wrong with a beautiful chaos and destruction. But in this case you will ask, "what is the meaning of everything and how long until it is over". The character development of the last 30 minutes is little more than Tetsuo, which turns into Pizza the Hutt for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> The end is similar to 2001 - a bizarre sequence of images that is far away When you solve or explain something, you make the viewer feel that he only looked at a kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm sure some will claim that this kind of art is art; but for me it was just an admittedly imaginative use of colors and shapes. (Part of the music was also pretty interesting). Unfortunately, everything is style and not substance. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Do you want to watch animated films that deal intelligently with "adult" topics? I am saddened to say that you will find something like this in South Park.
