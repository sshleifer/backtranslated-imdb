I do not know, sometimes ... They try and try and try to work in non-profit with all the B-to-Z movies, but now and then a certain movie tests your patience until you want to beat everyone involved. "Bat People" (which I have seen under the title "It Lives By Night") is such a movie. You can not see that without thinking that it really should have been an episode in "Night Gallery," and not one of the better. <br /> <br /> The film has something to do with a doctor who is bitten by a bat and turns into a had-bat that drinks human blood. (Actually, you would think if he turned into a real bat, he would eat mosquitoes on the gallon bucket, but because this is a cheap, scary horror movie, blood is the word.) Despite the fact that he has Grand Mal-seizures in the blink of an eye and dimming episodes almost every night, his friend and colleague dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme insists that he only has an "allergic reaction" to the rabies shots. Meanwhile, the world's most heinous and stereotypical county sheriff suspects that the doctor is responsible for the brutal murder and bleeding of several local girls (and one of them). Meanwhile, the doctor's wife decides that the refusal is a river in Egypt, and he is alternately supported by him and condemns him to distraction. <br /> <br /> It's not so much that acting is bad - you can say the actors make professional decisions and try to put some juice and life into the script, even the guy who does the sheriff plays. (Okay, it's pretty bad, but bad in a stereotypical, wooden, professional way). It's just that all about acting, the way the scenes run, the costumes, the dialogues, the script and the storyline in general, whip up your teeth and make you want to get everyone involved beaten become. <br /> <br /> I think the movie had a chance to be an eerie, disturbing little cult favorite, BUT: <br /> <br /> 1) The director had to deal with Michael Pataki, an experienced character actor Beat chair until Pataki ACT agrees and channels not only Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> 2) He also had to find a script that was a little more meaningful in the overall scenario of "Bat Bites Human, who then becomes a bat". <br /> <br /> 3) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find some more physically credible stage business for his "episodes," rather than resorting to the kid's "Man has a anure" side of the Golden Book with clich√©d mannerisms. <br /> <br /> 4) He had to revise the whole 'woman' character to make her more intelligent, less shrill and waaaaay more attentive. <br /> <br /> I would never watch this movie again, except with the help of Mike and the bots. It's bad, but it's not bad in a stupid, humorous or interesting way. Still better than Battlefield Earth or Waterworld.
