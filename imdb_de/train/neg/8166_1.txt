I was looking for a copy of The Forest because I saw a VH1 special, I think, "Where are you now?" And watched the video box flash across the screen during part of actor Corky Pigeon. He played the male child spirit in this terrible B horror, but I remember him from his character Freddy in the television series Silver Spoons. This strip is a big flop. Here is nothing. It actually took me four months to see it from start to finish. I kept it boring, put it aside, forgot it, stumbled over it and tried again to get through it. Obviously, the angle of this film, which was to distinguish him from his counterparts, was the supernatural element, the apparitions. And obviously this does not work here. I can not stand the male leads. I've always expected them to look at their palms during longer dialogue scenes to read cheat lines. The situation at the beginning, where the couples decide to camp separately, is unpleasant and simply stupid. I think the only positive thing is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg. You can see the bone sticking out of its flesh. It's pretty good Gore makeup there. Man, I'm really reaching for a positive result now. The only other no-budget horror movie on such a bad level would be Home Sweet Home.
