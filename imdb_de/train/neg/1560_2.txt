This film can not even be described as bad because it is sad, only painfully mediocre. Without real wit or imagination, a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the "jokes" (which are predictable and threadbare) are spun out in such an excessive length that boredom and yawning quickly overtake the viewer. Another step to the sad decline of John Waters and a reminder that what shocked or amused us 30 years ago is not working that way anymore. We've seen it all before and it does not break any more taboos because they've long since vanished. A big failure.
