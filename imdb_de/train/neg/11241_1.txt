If you're looking for eye candy, you can enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game with live actors. The visials are beautiful and interesting throughout the movie. Well, that said, the visuals are the ONLY thing that's good in Sky Captain. After ten minutes, I knew that I saw one of the worst movies ever. I was hoping this movie would get better, but he never got any interest. After thirty minutes, the urge to go grew and grew. Now I have more than 2000 films and have probably seen five times as many. However, this is just the second movie I wanted to go out of my life. <br /> <br /> Spectacle - there is none. The three main actors are pathetic. Jude Law (also in the other movie I was aiming for) is terrible in the title role. I'd rather sit in Gigli through Ben Affleck than see Law again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow tries so hard to be campy that he shoots back in her face. The last article I read said that Paltrow was more likely to stay home and be a mother instead of acting. After this performance, I appreciate this decision. <br /> <br /> Story --- Soap operas are better written. The story behind Sky Captain begins badly and gets worse and worse in the process. <br /> <br /> Director --- none. Everything has been put into the special effects of history, acting and directing. Even "The Phantom Menace" should act better and that does NOT say much. <br /> <br /> I would have to give this movie a "0" of "10". Avoid paying theater prizes and wait for the release of the video.
