I have been a fan since his first album. This movie is a disadvantage for him. The performances, except one by Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson, are just awful. <br /> <br /> Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony and Jarvis Cocker were especially annoying. Even the McGarrigle sisters were ruined by the so-called harmony of Martha Wainwright. I've never seen my wife get up and walk out of the room with a movie, relayed through the performances to the few interview segments that were hard to see because of the poor camera work. <br /> <br /> There are many who could interpret the songs of Mr. Cohen, Jennifer Warnes, KD Long, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Willie Nelson terrible. <br /> <br /> Hopefully there is another attempt to capture Leonard Cohen on film that illustrates his insight, talent and intelligence. <br /> <br /> So sad
