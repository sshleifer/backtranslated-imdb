Pokemon 3 is just over three or four episodes of the TV series, which are strung without the usual commercials. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, struggle and a solution where everyone is happy in the end), and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes in the storyline are filled in without explanation (about the credits!), And everything is just a bit too sweet. The only reason is to be a part of the world of your child. My two sons like Pokemon, and because of my interest in what they like we are closer. To see a movie in a theater is still something different than in the subway, and my sons enjoy the full cinematic experience. I gave the movie a 4, mostly from the point of view of my children. <br /> <br />
