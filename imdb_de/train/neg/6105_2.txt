If you are the type of person who can get a kick out of a very bad movie, then I highly recommend it. If not, stay away. This is a surprisingly cheap-looking movie, and sometimes you wonder if it's not just a joke someone pulls at you. The most positive comment I can make is that those responsible seemed to realize that it was a super-low-budget nonsense, so at least it's a bit of fun. <br /> <br /> But that's as amateur as it gets. Their idea of ​​gigantic killer mushrooms are simply types covered with beige leaves that look like trash can lids on their heads. It's obviously not meant to be taken seriously (to say the least), but even with this disclaimer, you'll find yourself shaking your head over the incredible cheesiness of everything. Or often laugh out loud as I did.
