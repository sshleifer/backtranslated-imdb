After finishing the book the same day I saw the movie, I knew what was going to happen. I had high expectations of the film due to the rating. The only reason I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars is that it was okay to be a movie. I have some important points because I do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS ********** <br /> <br /> 1. The casting. Jack Nicholson barely fits Jack Torrence's character. I NEVER chose Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I imagined Wendy in a different way. I can see why they chose Jack Nicholson, the grin, the pointed eyebrows, but he does not really want to look "evil". He should look normal and he will get angry. They also make one of the worst movie pairs. Danny was fine, but he needed more life. He played too much. <br /> <br /> 2. The script. They cut out so many things from the book and added things. Some of the things in the book that I was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted, changed or mistreated. Some of the things in the book that I was looking forward to were (the tails, the Roque Mallet, the elevator) not in the movie, and it was two and a half hours !! I was extremely irritated. <br /> <br /> 3. The end. The end was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack froze, Wendy was never hurt ... The Overlook was not blown up. The end was so cool in the book, and the movie screwed it up so badly that I got a call. Hallorann should never die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, Jack should use a bat. You've never seen a Roque racket throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There are other things I do not like about the movie, but there are things that were alright. The camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (which did not appear in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too irritated that the movie was not part of the book to be scared at all. I recommend reading the book before you see this movie. I greet Stephen King that he has actually agreed to sign a contract so as not to further discredit Stanley Kubrik. I would never have done that, I would have taken all rights to scream at him all day. I can not wait to see the 6-hour version, at least she has the hepties. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
