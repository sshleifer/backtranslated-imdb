Do not be fooled by the name of this movie. In fact, Jake Speed's character is probably the laziest action hero ever known. If Jake Speed ​​does not save virgin girls from the bad madman, which he often is not, then he relaxes seriously. Maybe this adds to its charm, but in my opinion, an action hero should not "chill" whenever he gets the chance. Unlike other daring heroes, who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has no, unless you call sleeping a talent. Anyway, this movie is basically worthless, the writing is below average and the action, if any, is very lame. (The machine guns on the Jeep were not bad, but that's about it.) So, if you're in the mood to watch a movie that's a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you. Not just yourself but also his audience.
