Normally, I have no incentive to comment on films that I do not like, but in that case, all I have to do is say something. This movie is terrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many mistakes in the story that I do not feel obliged to go into it because it is time to move away from that experience. The most annoying point, however, is that at no point in the movie does anyone explain whether the motivation for Bacon's insanity is based on a power outing or a physiological reaction to his condition. <br /> <br /> The Special The effects are impressive, and Paul Verhoeven has done a good job in the past (the Director's Cut from Robocop on DVD is great). However, this film is stupid and does not come close to the subject or the technical aspect of the topic in general. Instead, he settles for predictable action without being pleased. <br /> <br /> In short, as many other reviews say here (wish I had read them before ...) - Stay away from this movie!
