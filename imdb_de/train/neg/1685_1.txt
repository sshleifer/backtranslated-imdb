All children between the ages of 14 and 16 want to watch this movie (although you are only 18 years old). They've heard it's a scary movie and they feel so cool when they see it. I feel very sad, children can not see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is. This was one of the worst movies I have seen in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy of another movie. And the end? It's an open end ... why? Because it's impossible to find a decent story for such a stupid story. This movie is made just to scare you, and if you're a bit smart and knowledgeable about music, you'll know exactly when you'll be scared. <br /> <br /> When the movie was done and I turned to my friend and told him (a little too loudly) that this was a total waste of money, some stupid child stared at me strangely. That day, I could do an Oscar with a home video of my goldfish if I'm just using the right marketing.
