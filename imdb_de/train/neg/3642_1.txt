Unfortunately, the film is more about making lame social commentary a real event, but does not bother to document what happened. The constant rhetoric about how violent video games are not to blame (I have the impression that Ben Coccio is an avid player) or how media and music are completely without influence is the obvious message (we even get a ridiculous scene from the two guys ALL CD's burning, talking about subtlety!), but the film only comes along because it's a "fiction". Nice try. Yes, it is a great idea to relieve the media of influence, but how do we know that the children who actually planned and executed a school-influenced media shoot? or video games? We're not doing it, and we're not going to do it with this movie, because those kids are smart enough to give up the media completely, yet stupid enough to burn a Nazi symbol on the floor? haha I do not believe somehow. <br /> <br /> The film beats you with depicting the normalcy of families over their head, it's almost a downside if you believe that there is no serious family fault giving momentum to children who actually go out and shot her classmates. Why is everyone so interested in making murderers "normal" when they obviously are not? A completely wrong and fake representation.
