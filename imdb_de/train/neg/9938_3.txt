The Marxist polemic of Jean Luc Godard is as close to an incomparable film as you would expect from an internationally respected filmmaker. Parts of the political theater, stunningly boring and endless, are interspersed with the production of "Sympathy for the Devil," which features the Rolling Stones in the studio. <br /> <br /> The process of developing the song by Mick Jagger, who plays a demo on the acoustic guitar, to which the background vocals are approaching towards the end, is intriguing. It's worth borrowing this movie just to see the pieces with the Stones. Almost half the film is dedicated to this theme, so thanks to the wonders of chapter stops, you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the Stones put together a song. <br /> <br /> When I had this on laserdisc I bravely tried to look at everything, but I do not see how anyone can get away with it. I finally gave up and skipped the way to the Stones segments.
