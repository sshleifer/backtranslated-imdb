This story is about the romantic triangle between a ninth. African male prostitute, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waiter who does not speak French and never shaves. <br /> <br /> As a movie, it's boring, bleak and depressing, shot either on foggy, overcast winter days or in dimly lit interiors, each one submerged in a strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know, it's because the white balance was off. All are pale and depressed and look haggard, shabby and dirty. The bodies are bony and so big that they look pretty ugly and unsightly. Moles, greasy hair. Yuk. Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Well, Stephanie's mother dies. All three characters return to Stephanie's home village, where we see a bit of Stephanie's childhood as a boy named Pierre through a series of flashbacks to the lonely landscape and predictably grubby interiors. The mother dies. Well ... and that's it really. Character development is kept to a minimum, as is the dissolution of the story. <br /> <br /> I suspect the plot is not linear (that would explain many non-sequelers), but after paying my seven euros, I do not feel like constructing the movie myself: that's the director take my money for Expecting me to join the narrative process and get my hands dirty, so to speak, is far too much to ask. <br /> <br /> This film is a bunch of pretentious garbage, which consists mainly of a desire epater les bourgeois (ie the straight shock). I can see how it was a failure for the Berlin Film Festival, and I can see why it has come nowhere.
