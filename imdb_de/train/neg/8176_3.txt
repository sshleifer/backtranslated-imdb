I saw this movie with anticipation last night but was not really impressed. <br /> <br /> With the exception of "Combo" I thought that acting was bad and storytelling limited. It seemed like a drama "made for TV". <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was very resourceful. All the hammering in the context of the beginning (yes, we have realized that this is the '80s UK - you can stop now) was tiring and gave a very one-sided view of life in the' 80s Britain - Poverty, War with King, Margaret Thatcher, but nothing in between? There were indeed mid-sized companies that existed at the time - ordinary workers with decent pay and a mortgage. The Falklands clips also seemed to be randomly added at the end, for a "dramatic effect," I suppose. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events felt a bit incoherent as the characters moved one action to the next without moving, seeing how their thinking could have changed so quickly. <br /> <br /> The relationship between 'Shaun' and 'Smell' was rippling. I could not even look during the snogging scene. I find it very hard to believe that she was attracted to a boy who was not only much younger, but also looked much younger. I know there were only four years between them, but four years is nothing if you are only 20 years old, but there is a big difference in your teenager! In my experience, this age difference between teenagers only occurs when the girl is younger, as girls mature much faster and are more in line with boys a few years older. I'm sorry, but I did not buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for a shock. <br /> <br /> The end was a bit abrupt and was thought through again. If the flag weaving incident was to be iconic, it fell a bit too short in my eyes. <br /> <br /> It worries me that British films are only about the upper classes or the poor. Do not get me wrong, I love Trainspotting and Four Weddings has its charm, but can not we Brits come up with something different? Why are our films always in the class system? I was born in 1973, so age was not much different from 'Shaun' in 1983. I grew up in a lone family on a run-down city council in a city in England. My childhood experiences, however, are very different from those presented in the film - I can not even remember that racism is an issue (though I do not say it does not exist). 'This is England'? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I thought this film lacked substance, and I was completely bored and unimpressed.
