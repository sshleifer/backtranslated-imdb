This is indeed a pretty weird movie ... First, we have a former US gymnast trying to become an actor (or something), and this seems to be the only role he's ever gotten (which I have anyway know) - and for a good reason. Although he plays the role well enough to maintain some interest, it is a rather bland and flat performance. Second, we have the WORST EVER sound effects that have ever been used in a movie !!! I'm not joking. This alone makes the movie extremely funny, but in that annoying way. hehe And thirdly, while we have a generally decent performing actor (including the required hot woman!), a not-so-bad story and some cool visuals; The dialogues, fighting scenes with gymnastics (weird!) And the overall execution of the plot are weak. This film would hardly have been better as a network TV movie (Fox was not too bad in 1985). It's one of those movies that are just bad, but you can always watch it enjoy once you get used to it, especially now that it's found in Late Night TV and Cable the perfect eternal home Has.
