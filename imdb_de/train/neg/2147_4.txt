The original is a relaxing watch with some really memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the sequel, though not the worst DTV successor, lacks the sparkle. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment is the lack of a story. As with Belle's Magical World, the characters are told through a series of vignettes. Magical World does a little better, but still manages to mess up the story. Between the vignettes we see the mice at work, and I personally think that the antics of Jaq and Gus are the redeeming benefits of this film. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is the best that Cinderella gets used to being a princess. That's the best, because the mice were the funniest ones here. The worst of the vignettes when Jaq transforms into a human is sometimes cute, but they lack imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasia falls in love, was also sweet. The problem was, I could not imagine that Anastasia was friends with Cinderella because I took her for the stepsisters. This was also clouded by a rather ridiculous subplot about Lucifer's infatuation with PomPom. <br /> <br /> It was very pleasant to listen to the casual music, even though I hated the songs, they were really uninspired and nothing like the beautiful Tchaikovsky-inspired melodies of the original. <br /> <br /> The figures were the strongest development here. Cinderella, while still caring, had lost her sincerity and a lot of her charm from the original, though she wears very pretty dresses. The Duke had some really funny moments, but they were not enough to save the movie, as well as Prudence and the King. As I mentioned earlier, the mice were the redeeming merits of the film, as they alone contributed to the cuteness of the film. I also have to say that the animation is colorful and above average and the voice output was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> All in all, a sweet, albeit unoriginal, successor who was adversely affected by the songs and a lack of music made a story. 4/10 for the mice, the voice output, the animation and some pretty clothes.
