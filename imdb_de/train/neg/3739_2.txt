So that was an HBO "Made for TV Movie", right? Is that an excuse for such a pathetic conspiracy and terrible action? It's a shame to see Jim Belushi reduced to such a repetitive role (shot, survived, lied, beaten up, survived, shot, lied, and so much on). Call it a script? pathetic (or did he just take the P ***, depends on how well he was paid?), he tries a Southern Sheriff). As for the other British, the bleached blonde, what a shit! There is a trend to glorify these "English speaking" (sic) super-violent thugs lately. Maybe Mr. Madonnas manages two films to entertain and justify the violence. However, this film discredits and invalidates the genre. definitely overlooked.
