It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers work could be disappointed by this last disappointment. But surely every seller of Sellers will enjoy all his films simply because of the man's great talent. And the diabolical conspiracy of Dr. Fu Manchu is certainly no exception. Unfortunately, this would prove Sellers's last film (it was even released after his death), but it's still nice to see how the man managed to maintain his irreplaceable talent until his untimely demise. And not only do we get a salesman, but we get him, because seller not only plays the title role, but also his nemesis, the equally bizarre Nayland Smith, the detective on the hunt for the crazy 168-year-old Fu. The story is just as absurd as we follow Fu's outrageous antics to make his antiquated elixir and also Nayland and his group of collaborators trying to prevent him. Like all of Sellers's other major films, the film offers a flawless performance, as do many of his well-known co-stars - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn, and Helen Mirren, to name but a few. It is also nice to see that Pink Panther Burt Kwouk (Cato) enjoys a cameo with Sellers, although he plays the same role but is still nice. The story is indeed quite ridiculous, as are many of the characters involved, who refer to this as a film under the heavy influence of the Goon classic. And though it never reaches the climax of the Goon comedy, there are many witty jokes that seem to point in the right direction. The movie was commercialized on its first release when the world mourned Sellers' death (the movie was released less than 3 weeks later) and there's always that sad thought going on in the back of his mind when he saw it last Movie. It's anything but a great movie - it's often slow, too ridiculous and sometimes the jokes are just not there - but it's still fun - if only for another top performance by Peter Sellers.
