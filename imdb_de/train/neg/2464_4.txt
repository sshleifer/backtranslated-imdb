Beloved Part One, The Impossible Planet, but whoops, what a disappointment Part 2 is 'The Satan Pit'. The cliffhanger of something that obviously rose from the pit was - nothing that came out of the pit. Then the ages spent crawling through the circular vents to refresh the story. The beast was a roaring thing with no intelligence, so no confrontation between doctor and villain I had expected. The TARDIS is somehow in the pit, although the pit was opened long after the TARDIS breakthrough by the planet crust. And finally a ready-made solution that existed for no logical reason - I mean, why not throw the animal into the hole as soon as the pit opens? Why do not you dive into all these years before you imprison him anyway? Why not - I could go on, but I lost interest ...
