I read James Hawes book. It was pretty neat, not great, but entertaining enough. Without reading the book, I would not have had the slightest idea what was going on, and it was still a stretch with that knowledge. Literally every element of this movie is miserable in a way that I do not have the ability to describe. Semi-digested fish could have made a better movie with matches and dayglo lipstick. <br /> <br /> Never before or since did a movie make me so angry. The mattress extensions came closest, but even they never got such a deep, terrible dislike that this bilge did. <br /> <br /> Since spending 90 minutes of my life experiencing the plague in a human way, I can not even experience it anymore. Watch every book by James Hawes without feeling angry. That's the depth of hatred I have for this piece of shit. No, that's unfair. I apologize for all the feces that I have compared you to the otherworldly misfortune that Rancid Aluminum is. <br /> <br /> Simple and easy a cancer in the world of cinema.
