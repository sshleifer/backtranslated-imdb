(When will I ever learn-?) The enthusiastic reviewer from NPR got me thinking that the turkey was another citizen of Kane. Please allow me to vent my spleen ... <br /> <br /> I admit: The setting, presumably New York City, has never been so ugly and unsightly. I am reminded that the 70s was a bad decade for menswear and automobiles. And all the smoking! If the plan was to cheapen the characters, it was successful. <br /> <br /> For a movie to work (at least in my simple estimation), it has to be at least sympathetic. Only Ned Beaty came closer and I could not wait for him to kill Nicky. If Mikey had hit a leak, that might have triggered at most an indifferent twitch. I can not remember when I loathed a movie so much. I suppose I am a rube who does not seek "art" films. Well.
