* Spoiler and extreme bashing lay ahead of us. <br /> <br /> When this show started, I found it bearable and funny. Pretty oddparents was the kind of cartoons that kids and adults liked. It also had high ratings along with Spongebob. However, it started to fall as Butch Hartman and his team joined the show. <br /> <br /> First of all, toilet humor is not exactly funny. You can easily get a quick laugh from a little kiddie with a burp, but that's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a clich√©. Next there are the kids jokes. Lol, we see people in their underwear and we see people dressing up. LOLOLOL !!! I just can not stop laughing at this gay bliss! Help someone! But of course this show would not be so bad if there were no stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed the Australians? They saw her as nothing more than kangaroo-loving, boomerang-throwing simpletons living in a hot desert. But now ... WHY the coup of WHY this show is really the loudest of all ... Over-Usual Jokes !!! The show keeps on coming up with the same jokes (the majority of them are insatiable) and thinks it's the biggest thing ever! Cosmo is most responsible. I hate it, as she repeatedly mentioned "Super Toilet" (which also contains a mixture of kiddish humor), and Cosmo would freak out. And who could forget that stupid battery joke that all the goddamn parents in Dimmsdale would use in this one email episode? Do you know, the one in which every single parent (who did not speak out for other parents) would pronounce the exact sentence before entering the nursery? Yes, it may be first-rate humor for some people, but for others it is a letdown. <br /> <br /> If I'm not mistaken, I think Butch Hartman said something about the end of the show. Thank God! Everyone in my area says it's the funniest Nickelodeon show ever. I can not agree with that? I think it's just another bunch of horse manure that we get every day on our cartoon stations, only worse.
