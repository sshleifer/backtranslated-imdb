Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in Middleton. The four teens make up two love triangles. During an ominous full moon they drive and argue along a slippery and winding mountain road. If they do not look right, they will be thrown into another car, and one or more of them will be killed. The ghostly nightmare begins ... Pretty lousy and politically correct horror movie without blood and nudity. He is obviously influenced by "Carnival of Souls" Unfortunately there is no tension. 4 out of 10 - just another instant teeny-bopper trash.
