I do not write any comments, but I really wanted to warn people about this movie. It is an unfinished student film without any redeeming features. Technically, it's absolutely amateurish - constant inadvertent jump changes within scenes, dubbing of synchronization etc. The plot is completely clichÃ©d, the structure is ridiculous and the acting is embarrassing. I do not want to be too harsh: I did my share of student films, and they were all terrible, but there's no reason why this movie will be in the world where innocent fans need to see it /> <br /> Safe acceptance that - as with the cast - positive comments are filmmakers, friends and family.
