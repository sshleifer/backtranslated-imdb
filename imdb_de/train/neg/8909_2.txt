This movie is lame and not funny at all. The plot does not even make sense. A scientist working on the edge of science opens a door to another dimension (maybe hell ???) and his daughter gets sucked off or something, then one day she comes back for no apparent reason and now she has big boobs and Is she wearing a tight outfit (I think the demons in the other dimension did it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend, but she's gay, so she's obviously more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble across this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something ???) and the evil spell is finally reread, and so the evil demon comes down to earth, only the bikini top girl and the in love guy seem to can stop. There are baseless scenes for no reason, and a guy my friend says he's a well-known wrestler, but his role is completely unnecessary. Obviously, they have come up with something just to put it in, because then wrestling fans will actually see this pointless movie. I am sure that those without girls up there do not hurt either. The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie. I thought it might help to explain what's going on, but it just made things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically, this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie, but there are a number of things (like the other dimension and the book seller) that confuse it. I did not like the movie, but it was only five dollars that much. I do not recommend looking at it, although it was just too stupid. I can not imagine a part of the movie that was good.
