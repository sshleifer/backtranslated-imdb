I got this as a turkey movie and was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Acting - Although many have been in other films, it is clear that they had to work hard to behave so badly so badly without accidentally acting a bit. <br /> <br /> Plot - generous I could say that the screenwriter originally started with a plot, but did his best to ignore it. The action collapsed faster than a Chinese computer that had shot down the computer. <br /> <br /> Scrip - that was an abomination of nature now. it did not flow with any rhyme or reason. The majority of the characters' lines were at best pathetic for Fool. The script has worked hard to make sure no character manages to be memorable. I have seen other films in which the extras were more interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were short bus specials <br /> <br /> directed - until you can copy the style of your favorite director with your own directing ability, otherwise you'll just make mistakes like this. <br /> <br /> It's good to know that your friends / family gave you 10 stars for this movie
