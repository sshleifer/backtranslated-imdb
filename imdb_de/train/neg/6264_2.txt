Nightmare Weekend is a positive proof that some people are so desperately "in the movies" that they do almost everything. <br /> <br /> I'm not referring to the countless women who seem quite happy killers in this horrible piece of trash (after all, the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to play with a badly made hand puppet called George. Well, that's embarrassing !!! <br /> <br /> A bio-electronic creature created by the brilliant scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like a denied felt clown with green wool for hair) is artificially intelligent interface to an advanced computer system , which operates a revolutionary device (a silver ball the size of a golf ball), which can resolve character disorders if swallowed. Edward's personality experiments have been successful in the laboratory animals, but the cautious scientist is reluctant to perform tests on humans, because he fears that there may still be side effects. His evil assistant Julie (Debbie Laster), however, has no such qualms and uses three pretty young women as guinea pigs. They inevitably become vile killer mutants. <br /> <br /> With special effects for special effects, a talentless cast and an almost unsolvable storyline (I took notes when I saw the movie, and even then I'm not completely convinced that my summary is accurate ), Nightmare Weekend is a complete disaster that can not even save several softcore sex scenes and a touch of Gore. <br /> <br /> This movie Also, there's one of the most irritating characters I've ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), an idiot walkman who sets off for the music of the 80's to shit that makes me look compared to Justin Timberlake.
