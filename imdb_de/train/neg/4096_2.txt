This was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she did not live in any community with him (he was angry that Reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). I just had problems with the series back then - come on, I tell myself, is that the same noble Michael Stivic who opposed Archie Bunker's right-wing philosophies? The series continued, but she just did not have a pizazz. The momentum that Sally Struthers had won by All the Family was long gone. If the series had a different name and had been portrayed as completely independent of All In The Family, it might have worked. Well, that's show business.
