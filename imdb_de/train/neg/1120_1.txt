I saw this movie in my international cinema class and was maxed out from the start. This movie is nothing but a scene of blatant shock after the next. The fourth man is about an alcoholic called Reve, who has visions of his imminent danger. He meets with a woman named Christine as he gives a lecture at a local book club, and then decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is. Reve likes the Dutch sausage. So, Reve is working on a plan to seduce Christine's boyfriend so he can have sex with him eventually. Later, however, it turned out that Christine had three husbands who murdered them all. Now Reve and Christine's friend could be "THE FOURTH MAN". The plot is meaningful without the holes in the plot. The editing and everything else that's technical about this movie is perfectly fine. The film is just disgusting and I felt the need to throw up in some parts. Basically, this is not my thing. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Reve getting up in a T-shirt. So in the beginning, you see Reve's pretty cock fluttering around as he walks through his cramped apartment in a disastrous state. Later, he has a dream in which his pecker is cut off by scissors, and they show it along with the subsequent blood fountain. Reve caresses a statue of Jesus and has gay sex in a mausoleum. There is also a lot of blood. More blood than all Freddy Krueger films put together. <br /> <br /> Not that I'm against "shocking" scenes, but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shock. The whole movie is about shock. <br /> <br /> So if you have a part of it, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far away from this. My mind is still drawn.
