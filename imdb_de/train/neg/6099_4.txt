This was a less than exciting short film that I recently saw at the Turner Classic Movies. While the film came to life because of its very intense Technicolor quality, the film itself was not so moving and sometimes the plot looked rather kitschy - as if it had been done for the classroom and even WASNTT was the subject of a wider audience's attention. In particular, I really hated how many times in the movie things were repeated - for example, when the characters talked to her, they usually said "Clara Barton" instead of "ma'am," "Miss Barton," or "Clara." In addition, a sick Confederate soldier said he was a "Johnny Reb, a Confederate rebel, ..." - almost as if he were the cartoon character Mojo Jojo of the Powerpuff Girls. This was just a sloppy writing phase. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later "Perry White" in the SUPERMAN television series) bear in his hands as President Garfield. Yes, it is under that beard.
