I saw this movie for the first time today and have never heard of it, probably because of its bad message. <br /> <br /> First of all, the direction itself is pretty good, the actors have played well and the CGI (I'm not a CGI fan) is great. But that alone does not make a movie. No story, no message behind beautiful exploited talents. <br /> <br /> Or do I have to remind people that the art of a director is not just your vision, but how you tell a story. And that's what's missing the whole 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There for a simple rating of 4.
