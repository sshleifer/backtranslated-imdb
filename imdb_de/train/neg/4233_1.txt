I could not believe I spent $ 14.00 for that. The only redeeming quality is the outrageous blood. The synchronization was worse than I have ever experienced. It looks like it was shot with a VHS camcorder. I think every penny was spent on special effects because there was a lot of blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but I have to admit that it's not as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so stupid and unbelievable
