Your mind is not satisfied with this thriller. But please, who will do it? A young couple spends the very end of the world in the hidden lab of some aliens disguising themselves as church people. <br /> <br /> Small, apocalyptic-inspired outing, END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and lack of brio and style of 1950s-like movies. And not only that, but EOTW plays like a hybrid - not only the end of the world, but also the monastery creeps. The villain of the movie is a well-known character actor. <br /> <br /> This totally shameless slapdash seems to be a piece of convent exploitation that was a genre in the 70's that looks so weird today. Anyway, the monastery's secret laboratory is an unpleasant piece of futuristic decoration! Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World; but the end of the world is by no means his pride!
