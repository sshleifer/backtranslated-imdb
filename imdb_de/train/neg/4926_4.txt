I've seen this movie for two reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men had to make a pretty stupid movie. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot because it explains his contempt for anything Christian, but there was so much that this idea was not implemented as well as it could have been. I see this film as more of an opportunity for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his contributions before he is truly recognized, and as an opportunity for the legendary Christopher Plummer, the public (myself and the five other people who have seen this movie ) to remember that it still exists. I actually enjoyed the peculiarities of the DVD more than the movie itself.
