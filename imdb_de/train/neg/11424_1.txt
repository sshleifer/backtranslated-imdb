I've noticed that "Fire" was on cable the other day and I started to look at it because I do not remember anything specific, except I remember it was a horrible movie when I saw it in 1985. Twenty years later, the movie is still terrible. In addition to the synthesizer, the saxophone in the 80s, the most abused instrument in pop music, as evidenced by the title song. When I heard this song again, I wanted to stick a screwdriver in my ears to end the miserable sound. To reinforce this musical attack, Rob played Lowe's character saxophone, and there was a scene in which he played a solo that continued like Charlie Parker. Only his shrill tone and his playing reminded more of a monkey playing a kazoo. All the characters have been extremely unappealing, though I have to say that they did a great job in influencing equally unappetizing actors to portray them. Actually, I thought Mare Winningham would be appealing, and I initially felt sorry for her character for wearing funny underwear, but at the end of the movie she decides to have sex with Rob Lowe's character, who would most likely be a variety of sexually transmitted diseases when it has been voted on such things.
