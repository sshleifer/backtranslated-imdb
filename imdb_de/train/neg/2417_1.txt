This was undoubtedly the worst thing I ever spent money on. I feel dirty admitting that I rented this "movie" and actually paid money for it. This does not even evaluate the garbage. No no This is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters that are in a particularly humid summer. To call it garbage, you would mine garbage everywhere. It was so bad that I felt I had to register with IMDb and warn my fellow human beings. This luvahire character claims that this movie is great. You have to question your understanding of reality. Take some of his comments and analyze them. <br /> <br /> "The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a VERY good job." <br /> <br /> I understand. Well, if the director could imagine his audience writhing and twitching in every sentence Ricky said, or alternately bursting into uncontrollable laughter, if most directors wanted a grim reaction from their audience, then yes. Ricky did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> "I'm an up and coming actor who plays theater at my school, and I had to do a piece that made me cry, and it's not easy being so emotional in a scene Give props to actors who need to make an emotional scene and get them through. "<br /> <br /> Wow. I also have to give actors props that can show emotional scenes. Luvahire, maybe you want to look into another world of work, if you think those foolheads did it. They can help you if you have to practice crying. Just watch the movie. Ha. Ha. Ha. <br /> <br /> "BRING ON THE SEQUEL" <br /> <br /> If I were your theater teacher at school, I would leave you alone on this comment alone. <br /> <br /> I'm too disgusted to keep going. I will now hand the film over to my colleague Mr. Bangla. <br /> <br /> Hello! If you keep reading this far, I assume that you've already seen the movie, and look for one of two aspects in this comment: 1) Another demeaning effect of what you agree with was an exceptionally bad one Movie. 2) Another demeaning effect on what you feel was a good cinematic effort that has to be defended against such a slanderous scum as me. Whether you need help to articulate your disgust or ammo for a rousing exchange. If I say something good, you will only be disappointed. Let me assure you that such a disappointment is hardly possible. <br /> <br /> The other negative comments here at IMDb have already enumerated the particular flaws of the movie (eg drama, soundtrack, directing, dialogue, editing, etc.), however, all these mistakes can easily be made on and for to be forgiven. Few people will rent a movie titled "Hood of the Living Dead" if these elements are to be top notch. The last failure of "Hood", however, is the failure to keep the rich promise of his name. "Hood of the Living Dead" practically jumps out of the shelf in the video library, with its episodes of crazy one-line and cruel creative killings. Here was a chance to mix the gaudy horror of zombie film with the realism of ghetto life, having gangsta bat zombies on innocent creatures as they put on rock-do rags to put undead pimps on everything , to mortal policemen in their trolling rides. The mixture of the two genera could have been funny. Instead, the film is more like watching middle-school students perform the lines into a play that they perform but do not understand. To avoid a sense of betrayal on the part of the video rental company, I suggest to the brothers Quiroz to re-release the film with the following new title: "Hood of the Living Dead: A homemade horror video that we shot on our camcorder few friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored ". Or maybe they could release it as a documentary. "The Day Creativity Died: Exploring how a low-budget movie can still be without smart or original thoughts, despite the lack of connections to a major movie studio." <br /> <br /> The potential tenant, whose interest was not restrained, should find the following blurb on the back of the video ball: "The Quiroz brothers have once again proven that watching things you can easily do yourself , not the case is very interesting.
