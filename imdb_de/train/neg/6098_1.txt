Scotty (Grant Cramer, who later stars in the awesome B-movie "Killer Clowns From Space") agrees to help three middle-aged men "talk" to the ladies in this poor 80s comedy. Not bad as in the 80s, which means good. Bad as in Bad Without lovely characters, including, but not limited to, a kid who's been the craziest-looking guy since "Friday the 13th part 2" - a girl who leads men and then gets into fits and starts when she gets them wants to touch, and the sign Fat Slob, because what would a sex comedy of the 80s without Fat Slob? Well, this one has two. This movie is pretty much the bottom of the 80s sex comedies. And then came the sequel, which deepened the proverbial barrel. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Too numerous to count, you even see the freaky-looking kid showing off tits At some point, think "Bachlor party", but not so funny and very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Comcast Moviepass
