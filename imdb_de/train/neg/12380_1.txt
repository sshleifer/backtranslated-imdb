The creativity of this film was lost from the beginning, when the writers and directors left a good story behind, and then replaced them with terrible special affects. This movie seemed to focus on funny kids, but could not even achieve that. Many small, low-budget movies have the potential to become great movies, but this movie is not around. Fortunately, this will be another movie that's made easy and easy to forget. This movie was probably a chance for the actors to make some money until they played a real role in a good movie. Anyone who respects films should watch this movie at all costs.
