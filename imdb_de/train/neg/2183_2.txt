This movie was really bad, no matter if you take it as science fiction movie, horror movie or even comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The movie definitely looks cheap (and is definitely), the actors have no idea what acting is, and the script clearly shows it was shot with the shoot. It's obvious that the monster was added in the closet because the living head was not scary at all - it was even pretty - and they thought they needed something more impressive; They also failed here (the make-up is terrible even for the late '50s, quite funny). <br /> <br /> The film shows clearly why the career of director Joseph Green as such and also as a writer never came to expression. he was really bad at both. The same applies to the actors who lead and support. <br /> <br /> "The brain that would not die" - the best performance is the short duration.
