Look, there is nothing spectacular offensive about this movie, it's just boring. It's a typical Rome Com with an end that you can see before you've seen as much as the trailer. The key difference is that the classic Rome coms tackle their stories with wit and lack of pretension. This film has no claim, but it really has no sense of movement. One has the feeling that one could get up at any moment and go away. The production of the film also has the feel of a debut film made fifteen years ago. I would recommend watching a classic movie like "If Harry Met Sally" again instead of this flat imitation. Oh, another big problem ... no chemistry. If you're used to seeing Michael as cute as Vaughn in Alias, you'll be seriously disappointed with how they brought him here.
