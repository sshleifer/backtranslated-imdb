A crossover attempt to appeal to those who do not appreciate the opera, and who exploits the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time. All that is desired in this film is the opera, and it is best to find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his neck, which has suddenly become unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Just because it's been so long ago, it's largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence alongside his vocal talents, and nothing he does in this film negates that opinion. His fault lies in not refusing the terrible screenplay. Maybe because big operas can have stupid stories that he tolerates. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except the parties? Do we need to know it? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and banal. This movie is like trudging through cold mud to take some succulent treats (the opera music) over the mud. We have other opportunities to appreciate the great Pavarotti and he is not one of them. Just grab one of his many excellent opera or vocal concert recordings and recognize the master tenor he's best suited to. <br /> <br /> It would be one of IMDb's 100 Worst Films, if more people remembered it and there would be votes; it would fit well into a list that includes multiple efforts by singers, actors, models and athletes to exploit their popularity through film. Very often, everything goes wrong due to wrong acting or a horrible script. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor if he had not shown such a great voice. As effective as he is as an actor (the opera requires it), not even Jimmy Stewart could have saved that turkey of a screenplay. <br /> <br /> I give him a polite 3 out of 10 because someone has become a fan of Pavarotti's singing and opera because of this movie.
