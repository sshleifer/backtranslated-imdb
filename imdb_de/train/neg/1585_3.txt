::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Soooo, Arnie is really a good guy, but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and disobedient command he was put in jail (or rather in a kind of jail ) Labor camp). He flees, but after a short time he gets caught again. This time ends in a crazy reality show in which he runs in front of a bunch of tough guys with different topics and finally should die. We all know Arnie, and we all know he's harder than the toughest guy. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be an Arnie fan. However, "The Running Man" contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me. For example, The reconstruction of Arnie's fight in the helicopter, where the shocked crowd shows a brief summary of the incident, including 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras, one of which filmed the crew members, one of which defeated the eye of one of Arnie's crew members. <br /> <br /> There are more mistakes. and the plot, which seems to be very interesting and innovative in theory, works for a while, then it creates a kind of stupidity and unrealism in which it drowns. <br /> <br /> The spectacle can not really be said to be anything but below average, with Arnie in the lead role and an average Arnie performance. The rest of the cast does not look too good or bad. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fine without being impressive. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3/10
