This film connects the fine line between satire and stupidity. While a bridge system that has no rules can promote the marriage harmony, it certainly can not promote profitable bridges, so satire did not work for me. But there were some things that I found gratifying anyway, especially with the big bridge game between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk at the end of the film. It is treated like a championship boxing match. The arena of the competition is located not only in a square area like a boxing ring, but also a referee floats between the participants, and the radio station Roscoe Karns continuously delivers chatter about the events. At one point, he even mentions "one ... two ... three ... four ..." as if an offer of four diamonds was a knockdown event. And people stuck to everything at their radios, a common event for championship boxing matches. This parody indeed worked very well. Unfortunately, few actors provide the necessary comedy to sustain the intended satire. Paul Lukas has no nose for comedy and is Miscast; Lovable Loretta Young and the ordinary comic Frank McHugh did not receive enough lines. Glenda Farrell has a pretty comic twist at the beginning of the film as a forgetful blonde, but gradually disappears. What a talent waste!
