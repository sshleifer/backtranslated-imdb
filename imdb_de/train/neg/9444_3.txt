There's only one thing I'll say about a cat in a hat ... as a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie, it's shit ... I've lost track of how many horrible jokes in the movie were not just sucking, but were. It's just the right kid. By the way, the way the cat talked with the hat was annoying ... as for the conspiracy I completely forgot. Who cares anyway? I'm not sure why Mike joined Myers, but I think the writers tried to make it look like he was in Austin without talking to the swinger and it was overly successful - but it was annoying. do not see it - it belongs in the bottom 100 .............................. the jokes are so naughty that it is funny
