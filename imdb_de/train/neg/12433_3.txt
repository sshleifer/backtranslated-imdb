I like to keep my reviews short and simple, but that sums it up pretty well. You can not beat the original two for a variety of reasons, one of which includes the directing talent of Chris Columbous. <br /> <br /> This movie had terrible direction by even more terrible spectacle. I can not even believe that these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> It hurts to sit down and watch. The plot was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists making a painstaking search for their return. Terrible, rent one of the original cloths and enjoy it! <br /> <br /> The movie was not set for Christmas like the original one. Home Alone has been turned into a joke with no moral or conspiracy by an excellent family comedy movie for Christmas!
