TV pilots, do not you love them? Quinn Martin has tried this thing after being successful in a number of other TV detective films, but this is nowhere else but in the realm of MST where it belongs. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head, commanded by Aunt Mary to find the superspy Lovejoy, I mean, tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else. Tree is a bad guy, despite all his disguises, which make him look exactly what he usually does. There are more unnatural clothing fibers here than you can imagine (needed in the '70s), and the show itself is so anti-climatic. Why did not it go to the series? You find out, it's pretty blatant. Again it makes MST fun, but not much else !!
