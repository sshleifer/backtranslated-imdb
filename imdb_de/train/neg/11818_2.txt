On a distant planet, a psychopath is rescued from execution by a space monk. He releases some inmates and breaks out of prison in a spaceship. They dock on a ridiculously huge spaceship orbiting a supernova star. This huge craft is populated only by three people, probably because the budget of the film was not enough to hire many actors. To make a long story short, the three goodies end up in a cat-and-mouse game with the bad guys. <br /> <br /> The psychopath in this movie is curious because he's annoying. "Annoying" is generally not a term used to describe a lunatic - rapt, frightening, dangerous, but not "annoying", but it is. The three people who occupy the huge ship are really unconvincing as they play such an important role - this ship is practically the size of a city! Considering that the film is about 50 years in the future, it is reasonably optimistic that there could be such a huge man-made craft, not to mention the fact that it is used for such a relatively trivial task. Despite the size of the spaceship, the crew has all terribly equipped, tiny rooms and the dining room consists of a seemingly plastic table and chairs. But there are many corridors. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty well played and works like an average sci-fi thriller. But nothing great
