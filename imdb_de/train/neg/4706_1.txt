That's right, you've heard that this movie is a crazy 'ABOMINATION'. First of all, the band that is going to hell to see or hear a band called "THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! The name is not only terrible, the musicians can not even play! In addition, the singer sounds more girly than Geddy Lee and even more, his voice is terrible! Not only are they terrible musicians, they are terrible actors too. Led by a crappy director and a theatrical act, this must be the stupidest film ever made. I wish this site would allow you to choose a vote of ZERO OR BELOW from 10, as it is too much a tenth for this way to be overly generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if you can call that a comedy. If you're looking for comedy with music, go to this "Weird Al" Yankovic guy, because he does it a lot better than these untalented tweens.
