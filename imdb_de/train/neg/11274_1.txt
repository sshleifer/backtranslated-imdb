In order to convey the point about this film to your film colleagues, I have decided to write another review. Last time I missed a few things ... <br /> <br /> First the script. Second, the acting. Thirdly, Jesus Christ, what did you think you would do to make such a piece of garbage and then expect us to enjoy it when there are no signs of salvation from beginning to end, unless Joseph Fiennes finally becomes one blown away by the unabashed climax !!! I can not believe I wasted my money on giving it to a homeless person, a street vendor or something. <br /> <br /> Do you get the picture?
