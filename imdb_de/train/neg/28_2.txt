This movie is awful. You do not really need to read this review. If you intend to look at it, you are enough to say - do not do it (unless you study how not to make a good movie). Throughout the movie, I thought it was interesting to find someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen, just to find out that it really is him! A new low for him too !! <br /> <br /> The plot is terrible. People who say they are original or good have probably never seen a decent movie. Even with Hollywood action-action movies, this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Do not look at him !!! Run instead - at least you do not feel like killing yourself.
