Oh, these Italians! Suppose films about aristocrats with weird fetishes, castles drowned in gothic atmosphere, and stinging relatives trying to get hold of an inheritance are inherently interesting to everyone! If you've seen a movie of this type, you've basically seen them all (the MST3K favorite, "Screaming Skull," also fits in the mold) ... and "The Night Evelyn came out of the grave" is a by -die formula Numbers and dull as hell. Even the lush Erika Blanc is wasted here. <br /> <br /> null / 10 <br /> <br />
