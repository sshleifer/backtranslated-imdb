I have read all the comments on this film. I am a great admirer of the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book on which this <br /> <br /> movie is based. The film is an ugly and humiliating fictionalization of the truth. I do not criticize for <br /> <br /> to change small details or events for dramatic purposes. It is not a documentary. But the script CHANGES the effect, the reaction, the realities and the changes in EVERY main character. It significantly changes the relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the ridiculous rivalry over a Tibetan woman (who humiliates Tibet's culture), to Harra's gift box, to Harrar's change heart, everything about this movie is wrong - except <br /> <br / > for the amazing photography. I understand that the shots of <br /> <br /> Potala (the palace) were smuggled out of Tibet. <br /> <br /> to change a real story about the relationship between two people, <br /> <br /> one of them very important to this world, to a <br /> <br. Building /> movie star is sad
