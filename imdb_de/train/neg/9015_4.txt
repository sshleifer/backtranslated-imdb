The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are quite acceptable and surprisingly good to see. The characters are believable and interesting. The clone lab looks really highly technical. Then everything collapses. The characters behave stupidly, and from nowhere a new subplot is introduced via a fusion reactor (which is supposed to become "today"), the only reason is that he has to kill the dragon t The finish is incredibly weak. One wonders what became of a movie that started so well, so wrong. <br /> <br /> All characters except Dean Cain are played by Russians. This leads to strange situations and details, such as the character that Vessela Dimitrova calls "Bailey Kent" despite her strong accent (and although she inexplicably switched to * Spanish *). Because of the good start, I thought it would make sense rate this movie 5, but it was really more disappointing than that, so I only give it 4.
