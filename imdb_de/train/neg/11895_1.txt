Oh my god, what the hell happened here? !! I will not say that again, but what kind of backward movie is that? The synchronization in this regard is much worse than the synchronization in "King Kong vs Godzilla". Linda Miller had to be the worst actress and the suits are really cheesy. It's about a villain named Dr., who gets henchmen to build a robot Gorilla has the same strength as King Kong, but when that robot collapses, he builds another and tries to kidnap Kong. If he (which is when Linda Miller annoys), he makes Kong his slave, but everything goes awry and King Kong flees Then Dr.Who sends the robot after. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie later, I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started moaning. When I sat in misery watching the DVD While playing I was hoping that the madness in the movie would end until the fight. The end must be a really bad end because they could have shown Kong back on his island while battling dinosaurs. <br /> <Under no circumstances watch the movie or if you do ... beware of the disappointment you receive.
