Charlotte's deadly beauty and deadly kicks make the movie cooler than it would otherwise be. The story is so bad and Charlotte's character dies in such a stupid way that one wonders if this is the end that they had thought of this movie. I wish someone could say that there is an alternative ending, but I fear that this is not the case. As for the rest of the CST, I would say that they just did not do well. However, the blame should be on the poor script. This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Ziyi dies in an absurd way because she was the only one who had stolen the show throughout the movie. I could give this movie 2/5
