An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally stumbles across an old, well-preserved metro in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep it a secret, and to hire a Jewish translator to help them find out his story. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and one of several giants who apparently existed in "those days". In order to save his son from a devastating flood, which was predicted to kill everything, he mummified his son and buried him for centuries with several servants. In our presence, the fallen angels are still walking the earth and the mummy is being revived and it is expected that a ritual will take place. Most of the time in the film is slow, because he's dealing with a lot of biblical crap and a few lousy, airy battles. The mummy looks neat, but is almost not shown. It should have had more to do with that, but it followed a lot, so ... eh, do not bother.
