Thats is quite easy. Friends is a comedy of simple humor aimed at teenagers and young adults with a simple sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It's also painfully obvious that they ended up desperately trying to survive ten seasons, so they could probably say they beat Seinfeld's 9-race run of the season. The problem is, Seinfeld had 9 great seasons with great lyrics, friends had (and I'm very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons. <br /> <br /> It became a soap opera with recycled humor and recycled character traits that were not so good, so start and then get worse on the 100th time you saw them. I find it so hard to understand why people rate it that high. It is really terrible.
