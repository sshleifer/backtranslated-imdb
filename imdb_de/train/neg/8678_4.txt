After watching The Bodyguard yesterday, I felt compelled to write a review. <br /> <br /> This could have been a pretty decent movie, if not for the terrible camera work. It was more than annoying. The viewpoints were all wrong, especially during the combat sequences was nothing to see. The close-ups were even terrible. <br /> <br /> The story has prompted Sonny Chiba to hire himself as a bodyguard for anyone who wants to lead him to the top of a drug ring. He is addressed by Judy Lee, who is never quite direct with Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought as the mob and another gangster gang are after her. The story was decent and despite terrible dubbing this could have been a good movie. I'm sure that would have been a classic kung-foo movie. It looks more like another cheesy action movie from the 70s. <br /> <br /> Note: The opening sequence contains a quote known to the "Pulp Fiction" fans. Then on to a karate school in Times Square. No chance for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
