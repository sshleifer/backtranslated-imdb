In the third installment of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie chase the Tall Man, supported by a triggering 9-year-old, a black G.I. Jane and the ghost of Mike's deceased brother (he died in the original Phantasm). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, as the comic and black comedy is much less inspiring and exciting than in Phantasm II. I felt the stress was placed solely on Reggie's inability as a lover and his talent as a stand-up comedian , The humor in the previous film was much drier and more suppressed, which fits better with such a story. Besides, the attitudes here are not so macabre, and the constant presence of the Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious. There is still a lot of blood, but this time it is not half as satisfying. By the way, beware of the strictly cut version, because it shows the most beautiful killings outside the screen. The entire Phantasm series is the life work of Don Coscarelli, who has written and directed 4 episodes so far - the fifth in production. The first is a semi-cult classic, the second is a horror festival of violence and violence and the rest can easily be skipped. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, though James LeGros did much better in his character in Phantasm II.
