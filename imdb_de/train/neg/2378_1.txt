Why would a legitimate actor who read the script participate in this bitch? My God, it's actually embarrassing to even see it. I can not imagine how bad these people have to be to be a part of it. There is apparently some controversy over whether River Phoenix had a cameo in the film. He was not in the credits, but his role list (IMDB) gives him credit. By the way ... Rain is his sister to those who have ever asked. This movie is proof that no matter how many big "names" you have. Sow's ears do not make silk bags. I love Lorraine Bracco, but that was just sad, sad, sad ... Maybe someday somebody could explain the reason for this kind of movie. It has no lovable, entertaining or even funny features compared to anything else.
