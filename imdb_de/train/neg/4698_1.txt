I seriously, which group would sing about a crazy car? What if their ten, It is far too immature for a small child to sing that it is "my wives," I mean seriously! The name is also pretty hackneyed, naked brothers? just because you take off your pants ??? HOW CREATIVE. I do not understand why they need a TV program. I mean, most artists do not need a TV show about themselves, especially the Nude Brothers Band. Crap, how many of them are in the crazy group. And seriously, what about the movie? Jeez Nick was the highlight of my young years, but seriously the band of the naked brothers? Many parents did not allow it to their children, especially with the name of the band of the Naked Brothers. This is a stupid, uncreative show that should not be televised.
