If you are not twelve, this movie really is not worth it. It's obviously a low-budget movie with B actors and a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that is not good. I knew it would be bad if I rented it. I like to laugh about bad movies. I did not know how bad. It is bearable until after hour 2, then it really starts to burn. Combat styles go between normal battles that obey the laws of physics and wiretapping. There is no real explanation for the transitions. It has an action, but again it is obviously a children's movie. It seems that there are explicit moral teachings of the day that are taught, like Sesame Street or something. It is bearable. But much better when you are nine.
