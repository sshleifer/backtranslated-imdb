It's amazing how Nikhil Advani manages to get people into the theater until the day of publication. I mean ..... look at the cast here, the promotion is great, good enough songs and the trailers are alright. That makes it a house on the first day, but only when people see the movie do they realize that there is no way their money will be refunded. House full on the first day, the movie is out next week. <br /> <br /> This movie, inspired by 'Love Actually', did not handle the whole cast well. They tried to place big stars, but did not even manage to achieve average performance. The stories are hollow and cheesy, so the audience can not connect with any of them. It is a big disappointment for anyone who likes big stars or Nikhil Advani after his great success of "Kal Ho Na Ho".
