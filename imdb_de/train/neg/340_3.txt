I think the reason why this movie went so well at the box office is, of course, Eddie Murphy. I think that was his first movie since "Beverly Hills Cop", so he was hot then. Considering that you've made over two hundred million and it was R and this made about 80 million and it was pg, say it's not too popular. I've never been a big Eddie Murphy fan. That's probably another reason why I did not care about that at all. This has Eddie as a kind of finder of lost children. He has to find the golden child, or the world is in terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is, it can not be compared to the special effects. I had seen better things in the '70s than some of the stuff offered here. Ray Harryhausen did better things. Still, the main reason you see a movie like this is because of Eddie, unfortunately he's not very funny in this movie at all and it just seems stupid to get him into the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" scenes. I think they were hoping for a water-effect fish, but it just did not work for me.
