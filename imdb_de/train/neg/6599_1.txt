Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a well-known actor. Virtually every film he was in is the better way. Well, old George had absolutely nothing to do with this movie ... but he once said something that described the movie to a T. I do not remember his exact words, but basically he said that great writing can save bad action, but great action can NOT save bad writing. Never was this little observation more true than in "The New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mummy". <br /> <br /> The casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only look the parts, but they are also very good at imitating the true deal (mannerisms and everything). This film should be a lasting testament to their talents. Apart from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (who was very "in character") and a short short version, this film falls completely in the face when you (you guessed it) WRITE. <br /> <br /> If you need a taxi, this movie is an absolute must to go through. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort went into the storyline. <br /> <br /> I do not want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty Brit. What I WANT to do is see Stan and Ollie (or at least their deputies). Far too much screen time was used to explain the storyline, or the not very funny secondary characters who turned in the storyline. <br /> <br /> Even if this movie were all jokes, it would still go with us ... <br /> <br /> ... PROBLEM # 2: Most jokes are what I "watered down "Would call slapstick. <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "watered down"? <br /> <br /> In Slapstick, a character is comically injured in a comedic way (ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ..., or how about Laurel & Hardy?). <br /> <br /> In "diluted" slapstick (as I define it), a character is easily hurt or uncomfortable, and the filmmakers make that a comedic effect. <br /> <br /> Maybe an illustration helps: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck is shot by Elmer Fudd. His bill drops off and he puts it back on. This is a classic slapstick. <br /> <br /> In this "gem" Ollie accidentally bumps into some people. They turn around, ask him to be careful, and continue their happy journey. This is not slapstick. That's not even funny. That's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of such jokes. It's like they're the bread of this butter movie. The writers and directors simply take these boring moments and behave as if they should be funny. Granted, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only do so much leeway. <br /> <br /> Long story short: The movie just does not work because the script has no impact on Pinchot and Sartain's abilities to embody Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script uses plotting and lame jokes. If you look at this movie, you will basically see two great imitators who have not been provided with real material. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, but an incredible sleep aid. <br /> <br /> I say, give this a mistake and stick to the real deal (as long as you stay away from "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
