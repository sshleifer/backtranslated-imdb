Honestly, I did not watch the movie because of the actor, not because of the plot, but because he was 17 here in Luxembourg and a movie really needs to be brutal or pornographic to be classified in that category. Believe me, I'm a movie freak. I've seen quite a few brutal movies in my life (Ichi the Murderer, Irreversible, Hellraiser), but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal image I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is just stupid, the direction is terrible, the acting was mediocre, even though the music was a cheap copy of the so-called "horror soundtracks". There is not a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie and some scenes are really hard to bear. (especially the scene where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby scream - terrible). I can not understand why the film was rated 16 in Germany, where the criteria are usually very difficult (eg kill-bill (brutal), but he made fun of himself and had big allusions to Asian cinema and besides a great director) even a movie like Grace Status is rated 18. No one can call a horror movie because it was actually more about showing Gore than scare the public (the face of the "Creep" in the middle of the movie To show (excuse my expression) it's just a crazy director living out his disturbing fantasies, in some scenes you see violence that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot and nothing The plot has holes and flaws, the dialogue is boring, frankly I can not mention a single positive aspect of the movie besides the British and Scottish accent <br /> <br /> If I had something to say, I would do it If I banish this movie from the cinemas, I fully understand why none of the major production companies have invested their money in this crap. <br /> <br /> I look forward to receiving feedback on my topic and would be happy to discuss about one or the other topic. <br /> <br /> "Live the dream baby, live the dream" David Aames
