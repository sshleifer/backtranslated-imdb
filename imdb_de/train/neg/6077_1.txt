Would anybody really see this RUBBISH if it does not contain any little kids walking around naked? From a cinematic point of view, it's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Some perverts woke up one day thinking that I was making a movie with little girls and calling them art, putting them in the landscape, and there's no need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they did not appear somewhere or parents have, because porn movies do not need something like that. I would comment on the rest of the movie, but I did not mark spoilers, so I just say "avoid", "avoid" and find a real movie to watch
