Trying to capitalize on the success of "Deal Or No Deal" and "1" vs. "100" is this lame excuse for entertainment - "Show Me The Money", in which 12 sexy "dancers" appear in shiny red hooker clothing. A participant is given the beginning of a phrase, e.g. B. "Which team has lost ...". With three options, A, B or C, each of which completes the phrase. The candidate has three options to answer one of the three options. The host - William Shatner, at his disgusting gripe - asks the participant if he wants to "include in the answer", and if the participant says yes, he chooses a "dancer" to whom he "Show me the money! " She opens a scroll with an amount, and if his answer was correct, he adds that amount to his winnings; If he was wrong, the amount will be deducted. (So ​​it's theoretically possible for a participant in this dismal debacle to owe Shatner money.) There's also a "killer card" and if the contestant chooses the girl with that vile scroll, he has responded correctly. nothing happens. If he answers wrong, the game goes into Sudden Death and has to answer another question. If he understands that wrong, he leaves nothing. <br /> <br /> Before Shatner goes to the movies, he screams "let's dance" and Shatner, the candidate and the 12 dancers, shake the loot. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the ladies for "one last dance" and everyone shakes him even more. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this show a maximum of 6 episodes, at this time hopefully pitiful apology for a game being shown the door. (It could have been worse - they could have somehow acclaimed Cuba Gooding Jr as the host, though he's sure he's a better dancer than 'Shat', as they call him nowadays.) <br /> <br /> 7.08 : I think, what was wrong? It only took 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
