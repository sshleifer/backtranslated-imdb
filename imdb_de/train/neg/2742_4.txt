I just happened to stumble over this movie channel while surfing. My first reaction was, "Oh God, not again!". it's so hip to delay these days, it's overbearing and honestly despicable. For some reason, I stayed and watched until it ended. maybe it was my trust in the actors, hoping that they would give me something to cheer about. <br /> <br /> and certainly ken and helena can act. In addition, the movie develops towards the end something better and actually makes a point. Helena Bonham Carter also surprised me with her character. Jane has a mean side that she uses to keep her distance and ward off pity. then she has a soft side again, only looking for love. the only thing that surprised me even more was branagh's character ... that was a triumph of acting, the film itself is nothing unique. You can skip it in search of pure entertainment. it's serious to Sean Penn! Oh my god, that was a bit hard, but there are a few jokes ... not for escapists.
