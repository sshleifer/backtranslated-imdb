SPOILER ALERT! ! ! I do not understand why Pete did not help save Williams' life. I mean, it would be great to know why William was motivated or forced. I think members of the secret service are everyday people, and there is a rumor that the writer was a member of the Secret Service, now his motivations are clear, well known. But as a rental movie, this movie will not satisfy you, as the old but used phrases are the average acting - these are just things in this movie, just for you Wait the end. Clark Johnson, director of SWAT did a much better job than I did then, and I still wonder how the producers (like Michael Douglas, for example) put this movie in the cinemas.
