Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake (as Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is stunned when a defendant in the courtroom whispers "Thanks" to the testifying officer LL Cool J (as Rafe Deed) as he leaves the witness stand. In the opening sequences of this film you will receive the explanation. Dylan McDermott, the fiendish detective partner of Mr. Cool J (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov), will decide NOT to assassinate Damien Dante Wayans (as Isaiah Charles). The cops in the city of Edison are so corrupt that they shoot their suspects, steal their money and snort their schnapps. Whether he wants to impress his girlfriend (referred to herein as a "pussy") or win a Pulitzer, the corruption of the city does NOT suit the noble Mr. Timberlake. Timberlake decides to investigate corruption, which reaches unexpected levels and life-threatening dangers. The author / director David J. Burke keeps the film afloat, but just barely. LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the contest "Pop Star to the Movie Star" (aka "Rapper to the Actor"). Mr. McDermott has fun with his role. The main actors in the negotiations are Morgan Carriers (as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (as Levon Wallace). F.R.A.T. First Response means Assault and Tactical, but it's more important to know that "Edison (Force)" plays Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J and not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seems to be lost). <br /> <br /> ** ** Edison (17.09.05) David J. Burke - Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J., Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
