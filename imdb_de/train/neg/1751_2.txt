Seen on Hulu (far too many commercials!), It broke the pace, but even if you looked at a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were Indian, I would protest against the portrayal of all men as Venal and all women as Spitzm√§nner. They cheated on the music videos for Western sales and used many Western models for the men to touch. I usually enjoy Indian movies, but this was a big disappointment, especially for a modern Indian movie. The story does not take place in India (the uncle keeps referring to when Mac will return to India), but I can not figure out where to do it.
