William Lustig's successor to Maniac proves conclusively that without the spectacular effects of Tom Savini and Spinell's compelling performance, Maniac would never have been the cult act he made. "Vigilante" is ill-judged, with a simple-minded script that phrases everything for you and is predictable on every turn, as well as mediocre performances by all the actors. Judging by the meaning of "Deja Vu", this movie had seen "Death Wish" several times too many times before he did that. (* 1/2)
