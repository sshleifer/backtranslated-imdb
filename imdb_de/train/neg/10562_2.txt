This comedy capricious film with a very low budget is only possible on a low budget. Dialog is amazingly stupid, chase scenes are equally boring, and most of the money on the screen seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot in the last five minutes of the movie. At the beginning of this scene, it is certain that the main villain the film is ruined and crap is spilled (no prop is here without purpose). The whole movie is depressingly reminiscent of those who occasionally came out of Rodger Corman's studio when he first gave a director a few dollars and a camera - but without the discipline, Corman would impose this.
