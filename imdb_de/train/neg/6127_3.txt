Being from Hungary, I've heard many people say better and better things about Üvegtigris, but actually I do not understand the reason for all the excitement. <br /> <br /> I liked a lot of the movie's features, some of the quotes really cheer me up, but the stereotypical characters are back, as in any Hungarian movie, and the story is pretty boring too. I liked the first half, but then I was getting bored and then I just found the whole movie boring. Rudolf Péter is good as always, Reviczky is also brilliant, but the others are just there ... do nothing. <br /> <br /> How many years have passed for a good Hungarian movie?
