What we have here is a movie about how the pursuit of money and revenge can ruin your soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director known for his revision of the gangster genre, bites off more than he can chew on with this director. <br /> <br /> His use of the modern Noir movie to tackle the subject of a man free to swallow his pride, be nice to his enemy, and give away all his money, is flamboyant his face. When Jason Statham's character Ray Liotta no longer fears, Liotta seems to be crazy enough to take off her head in the final scene. Why? Basically, you can not set up mobsters like the Liotta character, who probably came to his stand in life through his ruthless behaviors that can be seen throughout the movie, only to turn him into nothing but a compassionate smile at suicide face of Statham's character. <br /> <br /> Before anyone starts saying, I miss the point ... I do not. I understand it ok Decide on the search for wealth and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy and this will lead to self-destruction. This seems to be the core of the film, and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story, though it is hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie, as a filmmaker, just does not have the ability to take it with him. The moment that even Guy Ritchie realizes this, he seems bored and begins to insert red pegs: the scene where Statham is knocked over by a car - Why? Filming some scenes as Marvel comic animations ... again, why? <br /> <br /> There are so many loose threads and unanswered questions left at the end of the film Try to find them or just accept that there are no answers. Every viewer will interpret things in their own way. Myself? I was so bored with the pompous tone of the movie that I just did not care. To be honest, the end could not come too soon, so I did not have to go through this presumptuous psychobabble anymore. <br /> <br /> A waste of two hours of my life.
