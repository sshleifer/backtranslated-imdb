For all my life I can not understand the good reviews of this bitch. It was useless. Matthew Modine was a terrible failure as a leading lady. Gina Gershon, well, others have said it, but I repeat, why the stupid accent? Totally unnecessary. And her acting was just bad. I do not know if she was thrown by the accent or what. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> And the girl in whom Modine fell in love suddenly puts half a head of lettuce in her mouth and looks stupid? Where does it come from? I think we should apologize when she saw her marriage crumble with a workaholic, but frankly I could not care for any of these people.
