Thanks to the BBC for this show. I used to have an inferiority complex, I hated to leave the house, talk to new people, and I had an overwhelming feeling that people hated me. However, after watching a series of 4 Non Blondes, my fortune changed. After the second episode I started to apply for new jobs, wear fashionable clothes and felt really talented. When the show ended, I ran the sales department at work, beat a wealth of women and often won the karaoke contest in my native. If you ever have a crisis of confidence and do not know where to go, make a detour to Poundland and get the DVD, which costs just 99p.
