6/10 actors, not great, but good acting. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Director, makes some silly decisions for this movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Writer, history makes no sense at all and has a lot of bugs. <br /> <br /> 4/10 total score for this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it could be too much. The characters are as exaggerated as they can never be in real life, and some pretty inexplicable things happen "story," not in a good way. Due to the style with which this film was shot, you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow movements and camera shake and fast forward). It's always good that the movie uses music to smooth the story, but there are too many titles in it. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music
