Just picked up this movie at National Wholesale Liquidators for a bit of money, and after looking at it, I feel like I got chopped off. Honestly. And I would never write a negative report about a movie if I do not have so much respect for the topic, d. H. Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First, what is it? It is a musical biography? Yes, many pieces of Foster have come through here and there are those pseudo Broadway Jerome core numbers that stink more than the Mississippi Delta. I mean, someone has PAID to write this jerk? Second, Foster's REAL story is intriguing. Why not come close? Third, what did they have on the great Ray Middleton to get him into this movie? Pictures of him with little boys? With communists? What a waste of a great talent. <br /> <br /> So, friends of Foster and the truth and good conversation, be scared ... be very, very, scared.
