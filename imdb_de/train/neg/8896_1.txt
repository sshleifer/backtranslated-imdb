I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (September 12, 2009). I'm 61 years old and have watched movies as far as I can remember. I can honestly say that Brigadoon is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. The accents were shameful. The local kids club would have produced better sets. The characters were so wooden they were likely to eradicate under the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them. It is to be hoped that the stars of this film had such thick skins that they were protected from the embarrassment they had to endure through the film. The owners of these tripe should do great service to humanity and destroy all copies of this movie.
