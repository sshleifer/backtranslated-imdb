Where was his criticism of democratic and republican administrations? After all, he worked for more than 17 years in a government apparatus in which his influence was irrelevant. Oh, I forgot the eight years when he was the most powerful nation on earth. The film is happy to show footage of a young Senator Gore asking why a NASA scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific work, but does not ask about Clinton / Gore's complicity in global warming , Probably too close to an election year, or maybe Hillary would hurt the chances for 2008. Either way, he is a political coward and party man to the bitter end. It offers no criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, no path to the history of industrial development that led us at that time. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film was more about Mr. Gore himself than any real issues facing our environment. Mr. Gore, if you really wanted to make a campaign movie - shorten it and name it the way it really is.
