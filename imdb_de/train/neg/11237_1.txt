I saw this movie with low expectations, but hoped that I could see my hometown in the movie. Unfortunately, that's all I got. The story covers a well-known area (the reunification of high school), but the plot is intricate and the supernatural element adds little to this well-trodden subject. Although the overall quality of the acting was good, the content of the film was appalling. The sexism of the film was blatant - women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, have stuff, or both (though this has been called a post-feminist decision). Even worse was racism - the shrill Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home - and unfounded cruelty (the classic tormented). We should be ashamed to assume that these characters represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and writers should be ashamed to have brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.
