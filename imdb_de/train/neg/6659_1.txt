For the first three seasons, Fairly Odd Parents was as tasty as candy, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol is what you need after watching the more recent episodes in which the sweetness was replaced by insults and violence that made no laugh. Cosmo, once one of Nick's lovable characters, has turned into an abusive, unenthusiastic cretin who did not even want to know the cast of Family Guy. Timmy has become a selfish, arrogant idiot Bart Simpson would like to beat the snot out of (and given Timmy's impudence, that would require a lot of punching). And poor Wanda ... a real charmer who has become the victim of her husband and her godchild. She is now referred to as a "gag" because she cares about the well-being of others. Besides, Cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else, but he's never punished, nor does he learn anything. That pretty much sums up Butch Hartman's attitude toward children: they're raw, vulgar, and not too bright. Thankfully, this terrible toon was canceled along with Butch Hartman's darling Danny Phantom. At least, Butch got what he deserved - unlike Cosmo.
