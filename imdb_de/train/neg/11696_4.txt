I started to watch this movie with low expectations, and I only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a S.K. Roman (a novel I have never read). <br /> <br /> I'm glad that my expectations were low because the movie was not nearly as good, but he manages to interest you. What really pulls this story down is the work of the director and the actor. The film is too long, has no "nice" recordings and no fear, the dialogues are stupid and the special effects are crap. <br /> <br /> The only things that are good are, as I said, it keeps you interested (I think the book must be good) without using a lot of horror clich√©s. <br /> <br /> My Vote 4/10.
