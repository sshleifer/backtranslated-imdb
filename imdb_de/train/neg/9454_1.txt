If my own kid asks me to leave the opening show of this movie, I know it's bad. I wanted to scratch my eyes out. I wanted to reach across the screen and beat Mike Myers for sacrificing the last of his dignity. This is one of the few films in my life that I have seen and wanted to be "unprotected" immediately, if only it were possible. The other films are "Troll 2" and "Fast and Furious", both are better than this crap in the hat. <br /> <br /> I can drink myself tonight in a futile attempt to forget what I've seen this blasphemy about the good name of Seuss. To Mike Myers, I say stay with Austin or even Wayne's World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey does not mean that Seuss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
