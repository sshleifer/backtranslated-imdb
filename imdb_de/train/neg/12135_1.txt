Although it's been two years, I still remember the complete waste that surrounds the entire plot of the movie. Unfortunately, I found this movie for my friends and selected it while browsing the new versions of Blockbuster. We chose the movie because it was the only one we had not met, and it sounded like it could be fun. Although I have not seen the movie for some time, I still remember the absence of the plot (seriously, there is no real plot) and the complete waste of time I spent on the movie. If you're in the video library and this movie gets your attention, go ahead and find a better movie. If you have seen this movie, I understand your pain :)
