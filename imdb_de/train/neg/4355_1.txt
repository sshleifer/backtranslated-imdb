Dreadful. I see a lot of user comments on how great this show is. It really is a Wanna Be Friends - Made in Taiwan Knockoff. The jokes are as lame as ... and the plot is ridiculous. Obviously, the actors have a hard time being funny, and they're probably curling up when they hit those awful punchlines (if you can call them that). The majority of other users who commented are obviously from another planet (or at least another continent). There are obviously reasons why television companies cancel shows ... and none of them is the case when shows perform well. Make sense? Nevertheless, even if it rains and there is absolutely nothing else to do on this planet, steer clear - instead, standing in the rain - more fun.
