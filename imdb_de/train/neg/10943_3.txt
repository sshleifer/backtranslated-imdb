This is a really bad movie, with bad acting and a very boring pace. Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! All the characters are just annoying (except llamas), and there's absolutely no one to roam or take care of, and the action is very boring. The movie gives us 3 villains that should be threatening and disturbing when in fact boring, ridiculous and just a bunch of idiots I wanted to silence! Besides, it looks very cheap and amateurish. Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma, but he can not save that crap, and whether he believed it or not, the opening was really cool, as was the end, but the middle is unbelievably boring and made me urge to push the fast-forward Button !, plus The dialogue is especially ridiculous !. There's a cool bar scene that I liked a lot, but as soon as Llamas walks to the dock, everything falls apart and the scene where the bad guys torture Jennifer's family and kill them should be annoying if it's actually ridiculous! This is a really bad movie, with bad acting and a very boring pace, Lorenzo Lamas is really cool, but it's not enough, not recommended. The direction is very bad. George Erschbamer is doing a very bad job here, with mediocre camera work, boring situation and a boring movie. Acting is pretty bad (except for llamas). Lorenzo Lamas is great, and although he is not obliged to act, he enjoys watching and he has a really cool character and a lot of charisma, but even he can not save him, and he did not have any chemistry with the cast! (Lamas rules!). Josie Bell is terrible here and although she looks decent, she is not very convincing and had no chemistry with llamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot but has not much to do except scream and scare, she got along well. Robert Scott, as the main villain, is AMAZINGly annoying and not threatening at all, he was just as ridiculous as the others 2. The rest of the cast is bad. Generally avoid! Avoid! Even if you like llamas (like me). * of 5
