I was interested in the subject, and only fans of Drew Barrymore's dancing on David Letterman's desk will find anything but interesting. OK, it shows some chest (or maybe a double body). The plot is cut to pieces and the spectacle is terrible. None of the lead has any material to work with as the direction of the film goes nowhere. Do not waste your time. Instead, watch Donnie Darko if you want a creepy Drew Barrymore movie, and if you want to see another, skip it and watch Darko again. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the Doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal. Read Charles Williams' novel "Descent Into Hell" for something worth considering. This is just an excuse to shoot a B-movie to go straight to the video and kill the people at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Why do some of them believe that acting here is commendable? Give me a break.
