What is that in the sky? Is it an airplane? Is it Superman? Uh, no? It is a TURTLE!?! Look, it's going to be from the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other problems! The Americans are firing down a Russian fighter somewhere over Artic territory, and the ensuing explosions literally defile and awaken the huge prehistoric turtle creature called Gammera. He / she is not a very friendly creature as it immediately leads to destroying everything and everyone on its way. The disputed governments finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and sophisticated ice bomb, but Gammera has another surprise in store? The damn turtle can fly! The first time this leads to an incredibly grotesque and funny sequence! Gammera lies on her back and looks downcast when suddenly fire blows from his shoulders and he shoots himself in the air. How can you not love this? Then there's a terrible negotiation about an annoying kid who can telepathically communicate with the monster, but that's just not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people !! There is little to report on this Japanese (and American revised) sci-fi effort. Apart from that, it's an obvious and completely shameless rip off of classics like the original Godzilla and The Beast of 20,000 Fathoms. The effects and monster designs are extremely hokey and unlike the aforementioned films, it never manages to create an apocalyptic ambience. Respectable actors like Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") do not seem to know which movie set they're in, and even the original Japanese chaos scenes are not very convincing. However, Gammera's very own and personalized theme song is pretty cool, so he gets an extra point.
