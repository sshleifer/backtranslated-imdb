Although I was a big fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films, I only saw "Follow the Fleet" about 6 years ago. I knew all the songs from an old Astaire / Rogers album (yes, vinyl) but knew nothing about the plot. Unfortunately the songs are catchy and the character of Ginger Rogers is cute and funny 'Bake Baker' I just can not like. In an attempt to make up for his longtime partner, he is constantly sabotaging her career. His character does not have the usual humor and verve of the Astaire characters of the other films. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out the songs and a great solo tap routine by Ginger Rogers.
