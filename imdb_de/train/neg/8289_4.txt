I'm sorry, but that's such a bad movie, it's weird. Football hooligans argue in a travel hut? Suits shade?! Alan obviously had no idea what he was talking about when he did that, it's as far from the truth as you can get. <br /> <br /> The casting was cruel ... Gary Oldman as football hooligan? He does not look weird, does not look weird or even looks like someone who likes football. And what about Yeti? What the hell? Suits, umbrellas, and sitting in a Travelodge, kidding themselves childishly, being "about the time you put on your diaper". You're welcome. <br /> <br /> And the Yeti gang spraying the ICC underwear? <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone can take this movie seriously! <br /> <br /> 4/10. It may be the most inaccurate portrayal of the hooliganism crisis of the late 1980s that I've ever seen.
