American Pie: Beta House is a kind of dizziness between genres. First, it is a comedy without action and a few really clever jokes. On the other hand, it is a porn that is a bit too soft to actually turn viewers on. Basically, Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some demeaning, others just lame attempts at humor - with a few thin action points aimed at cohesion. The characters are barely two-dimensional, the development is based on knowledge of Naked Mile, and the "important" action scenes are so far apart that one wonders why the authors even considered a story to be necessary. <br /> <br /> To be fair, I did not go into this movie without expectations. I liked the three original American Pie movies and thought that Band Camp and Naked Mile were good loans. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be shown in cinemas. So when I saw that some of the same characters returned for Beta House, I was excited to see this series. I was aware that there were many scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in various forms. And I was fine with it, because these scenes in the past were supported by the story and were well integrated into the storyline. In Beta House, it's almost as if the authors have forgotten why the formula works in the other AP movies. They spent too much energy working in the nudity where they had forgotten to actually write a story. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disappointment and is not even worth a dollar. The jokes are lame, the story is non-existent, and the porn aspect is too tame, just to care.
