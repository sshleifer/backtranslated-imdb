"Nightmare," supposedly a "social commentary" to racism and prison conditions in rural South 1970s, is full of poor southern stereotypes and false accents. It would not only offend most American South Americans, this shabby piece of work is just a thinly disguised "Baby In Jail" movie - especially in its original uncut version. Nonetheless, acting is generally above average, and the late Chuck Connors in particular, is pleased that viewers hate him - even though he seems a little uneasy in some scenes. The late Robert Reed, who appears as a lecherous overseer, also has a role to play in terms of variety, and Tina Louise (formerly Ginger of "Gilligan's Island") formed a fairly believable, sadistic jailer. My grade: D. <br /> <br />
