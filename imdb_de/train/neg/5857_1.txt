WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst events of 2001. His biggest mistake, perhaps, was that most of the previous Survivor Series did not fare well. There was only ONE survival series match. And the Survivor Series game lasted 45 minutes. Anyone with a functioning brain would know that the fight with The Rock against Austin and The Rock would end for his team. And do not let me start previewing before the event. No matter who won, it was obvious that nobody would die. There was no need for this pointless hype. Whatever the story, it was just a wrestling event. <br /> <br /> As for the remaining games, Christian defended his European title against Al Snow in the first match. It was a good, quick match and it's good to see that a heel has pretty much won a match. William Regal vs. Tajiri was boring and we've seen it two or three times. Edge versus Test was good, but not great. The tag title Steel Cage Match was the best match of the evening. The Royal Battle lasted 10 minutes and it was not important to anyone who would win at all. The title fight of the women was not so great. No, not in the least. The main event must have been the most hypocritical game in history. The alliance has lost, but guess, after 5 months, every superstar returned to the Alliance. The match itself was bad. The Rock eliminated 3 of them and Jericho defeated 2. The Rock was too busy with its acting to be there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one who endangered the whole game. If I wanted all 2 to be eliminated at the beginning, it would be them. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were just boys. 7 matches are not enough for a Survivor Series. If there ever is such a Survivor series, I will be so bad again
