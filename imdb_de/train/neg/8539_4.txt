This captivating (which it should not be) inferior Spanish exploitation (rather tame I can add) looks good, but what? Let me express that again. Actually the word "huh?" you would think pretty much about it. Nothing makes sense, nor does it try. I just do not know if it's complicated cryptic or just a messy mess, but there's no denying how laconically uneventful, strange and wordy it feels (dead cat and fire) in a scant story in which the photographer Mario ( played by a chest pounding John Caffari, whose mustache is a great alarm clock for Nintendo's iconic Mario What's the chance?), who digs his girlfriend's home and meets a young lady (a gorgeous fixing Patty Shepard), whom he turns into a photographic Order to bring along, where they encounter hidden witches at this remote mountain house. <br /> <br /> Look past the naked act and indulge in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing discomfort. Raul Artigot shows a few uncommonly unusual pictures and scary passages, but for the most part seems to be sporadically missing and out of focus, just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's impressive cinematography lenses shine with the gracefully rich landscape as we savor the scenic vistas and end the day with ease. However, there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly overblown and revised score blends in well with the compulsively dense atmosphere. The leads are capable, but there is also a firm bunch (the selection is VÃ­ctor Israel) of secondary performances. <br /> <br /> Slowly with little interest, but this dreamy build (that seems to go on and on) manages to keep you watching until the very end.
