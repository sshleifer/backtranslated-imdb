This movie was in a Science Fiction 50s pack that got me a friend for Christmas. It is very similar to the first Gozilla movie and like this movie has scenes with American actors inserted for no real reason. The interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that tension between the US and Russia is portrayed in the Cold War. As in Godzilla, Gamera is awakened by a nuclear explosion and riots around the world and pays attention to Tokyo, since no major monster movie is completed unless Tokyo bites it. All in all, that's an okay movie. Some of the scenes with Gamera, especially the scenes in Toly, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time. If you like Japanese giant monster movies, you will really get a kick here. I give a 4 out of 10 points. If this was the unedited Japanese version I looked at, she would probably have got a 5.
