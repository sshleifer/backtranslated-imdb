The fine cast can not abolish this routine story of a secretary who was murdered by her spouse. In fact, there are more questions than answers in this one-sided story of romance and murder; and since only the prosecutor's office is available to us, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of fare that appeals to the "He Woman, Man Hater" clubs of America. As shown, this is the story of an innocent woman who happens to be "caught" in romance with a married, senior lawyer. Is it possible that IF, when she was not two, would have made friends with her boyfriend and had an affair with a married man, could the whole murderous, dirty incident have been avoided? If you see this, you do not have to worry about going to the fridge. You will miss nothing.
