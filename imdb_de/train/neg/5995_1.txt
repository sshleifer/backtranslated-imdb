This is a really horrible movie. What they have done is a television program that was never intended for young children, and received the George Lucas treatment (ie, it ruined it by kidding it to appeal to the younger audience) Thunderbird's TV show was not exactly the most cerebral show, in fact it was pretty formulaic, but it was always nice to watch them (especially when the models were blown up) and the cast was not too bad. <br /> <br /> This suffers from bad casting and bad acting (with the notable exceptions of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope & Ron Cook as Parker, who seem to be the only actors who have any idea how their characters are played After this travesty, I did not allow Frakes direct traffic. <br/> <br/> Thunderbirds was all about the whole Tracy family and how they worked as a team to prevent disasters or rescue people involved in disasters. <br /> <br /> Avoid this garbage like the plague. <br /> <br /> I only give him 1 out of 10, because a zero rating is not supported.
