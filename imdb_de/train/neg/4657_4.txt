Remakes (and sequels) were an integral part of the cinema right from the start. However, it's pretty much a hit or miss venture. If you take advantage of the benefits of the original and build on it and bring the most important features up to date, you can succeed. Note that films such as THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) have passed their attempts. Others like KING KONG (1976) fail miserably. <br /> <br /> LETTER ENCOUNTER (1945) is the template for this film. It's as perfect as it could be for such a topic, and we rate it as IMDb ********** Ten. The story is simple: love, innocently found by accident and tragically lost. Well, it just happened for the two (2) involved parties who were involved at the wrong time. These are presented convincingly and sensitively by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. Neither conventionally leading star material, nor high-quality character actors. For the details, look at the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, what went wrong? A TV movie that has done scene by scene with the namesake actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN should have reached at least IMDb ****** Six. Both actors, however, seem disinterested just to beat their timepieces and collect their checks. None of them is connected to their characters or to each other. They do not think they are in love, or when they finally split up, it's a huge loss for each of them. That should not be and therefore it fails in its intention. Sometimes it's just better to leave things alone.
