I saw the trailer of the movie several times in the theater and was excited. It looked like a classic action thriller like the one from the 1990s. It also reminded me of fleeting movies, a cat and mouse hunt between Douglas and Sutherland. The Sentinel is, however, the tastiest action thriller of all time. I see many people say that this is like a TV movie. Not exactly. First, there are much better TV movies in this genre. Second, TV movies are sometimes a lot of fun, but this movie is the opposite of a good time. It's not stylish at all and the most important thing is that the sound of the film is unattractive. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes that consist of a pursuit and a clash. They are not big action scenes either, but the worst part is that these action scenes like the whole movie are very tasteless. The love relationship between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. In addition, the assassination of the president is the most clich√©d story in the genre, but they insist. And this is not a cat and mouse movie as it should be. Although Douglas is now very old, he still has the potential to act in an action thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas can not be like Tommy Lee Jones. Sutherland is also a wrong choice because you feel like you see Jack Bauer, and somehow the character is one of the reasons that make the movie a television movie right in this movie because she's an actress. The movie was not fun for a second, so I could not get over it for a while.
