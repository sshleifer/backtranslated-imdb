We saw this in the local video store on the shelf, saw "Coppola" in the credits and were excited. That was the only time that this movie aroused interest. I could never quite figure out if it was an attempt at a humorous movie that had failed miserably or an attempt at a serious movie that failed miserably. In general, the entire production seemed incredibly funny. Especially in the scenes that were recorded in the small bar, the sound was absolutely terrible; The dialogue was so hackneyed that it was incredible. Very disappointing.
