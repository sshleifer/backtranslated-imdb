TYSON <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Awesome - albeit painstakingly fair - about the life and times of the Champion Boxers Mike Tyson. Given his rape for rape, the film sure he does not represent him as a hero or villain, but a warts portrait of his rise to fame, the success of success and people that have shaped his destiny for good or ill. Limited by time limits, the script gallops through a series of relevant details, pays close attention to significant events, and ends with Tyson's (temporary) fall in 1995. Newcomers are enlightened by the chronology while boxing fans are entertained by Straight Uli Edel's Straight - Arrow approach to the material. It provides Tysons life is a circus, where he was ultimately led by the circumstances of its own success astray. In fact, the script retains much poison for Tyson's ex-wife Robin Givens, which marks it as ungrateful gold digger who used his naivety. The production values ​​are uniformly solid and the cast is excellent: Michael Jai White mimics the title character for good; George C. Scott plays Tyson mentor Cus D'Amato through gritted teeth; and Paul Winfield was certainly born to play Don King!
