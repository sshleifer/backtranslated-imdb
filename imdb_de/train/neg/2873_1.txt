This movie shows a gorgeous brunette named Danielle Petty. She has stunning green eyes and is in the first scenes and the last scene. She is the only one in this film that is not repulsive. She may have no future as an actress, because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers. It's not a good horror movie or a good fake journalistic report or a well-remunerated report. There are no obvious skills in production. It's like a bad student movie. The terrible elements of the story do not make you sick, it is the fact that it is made so bad that you get sick. I would give this movie NULL stars if I could.
