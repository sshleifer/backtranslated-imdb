This is another depressing and boring movie about AIDS and the tragedy. It begins very uneventfully and predictably and continues throughout the movie. I always waited for it to be picked up, but unfortunately not. The drama is fair, but the script needs a lot of work. And if you're looking for nudity, do not waste time with these not-so-hot actors. Due to the poor sound quality and missing captions, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you have never seen more than five gay movies or have recently resigned yourself to being gay, this movie might be interesting. It is one of the worst gay movies I have ever seen.
