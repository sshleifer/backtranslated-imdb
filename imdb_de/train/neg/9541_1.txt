I suppose many people comment / rate their first movie on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or horrible - I write for the latter reason. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to the continuation of "Wargames". I thought the original, considering its time and content, was pretty good, I thought it was more than worth it to look at it. This year, I had great hopes for what they would do with this film. Computers, games, terror, and military exaggeration have grown so much since the time of the first movie, and "Wargames: The Dead Code" provided the opportunity to make a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film has failed at almost every level, but I blame especially the authors and all those who have dealt with the realism of play aspects. "The Dead Code" was a 1990's flight simulator with some people swinging their arms on the ground. Meanwhile, Will Farmer blends about 7,000 commands with the buttons - none of which affects the action on the screen. Until he finally "wins" by clicking with his mouse on a field on the screen that releases gas that kills 20,000 virtual humans immediately (no one is near the gas). Because he has defeated 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes, RIPLEY (the real war machine) says that it is a high-level terrorist threat. <br /> <br /> Even if a 5-16 year old could fulfill this task - The government believes that it is a deadly threat to humanity. They say things like "He has expertise on bio-terrorism" ... He showed less knowledge than someone who read the first three paragraphs of the bio-terrorist wiki entry. Then follows a film-long chase scene with about 0.01% of the budget and the excitement of one of the Bourne titles. You have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the whole thing. Sometimes they are crazy, they will hardly miss him. On other occasions, they create opportunities to deliberately leave him alone to follow him. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I'd write more ... but I've spent 1.5 hours looking at it, I'd rather watch Broderick and Joshua Tic-Tac-Toe 1, Play for 5 hours.
