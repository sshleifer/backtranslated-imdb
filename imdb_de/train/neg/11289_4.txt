Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who will probably only be remembered as one of Bill Clinton's "Bimbo Eruptions" (who now have pills for it!), Is probably the weakest element of this show. The tired formula of the Highlander series continues in reality: the hero Immortal meets another immortal with flashbacks the last time he met, but there are conflicts and in the end there is a sword fight where you have a cheap one Have special effect sequence. <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically your typical unshaven hero of the 90s with the typical "Sexual Suspense" story. (Seriously, why do you think, Hollywood guys, that sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) This was a joint Canadian-French production, so half of the series takes place in Vancouver, which mimics New York, and the other half is in Paris ... like Highlander.
