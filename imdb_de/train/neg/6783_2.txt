There seems to be a surprising number of 8-10 star ratings from people who have never or ever since written an IMDb rating. Given the very low average rating other people give the movie, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I admit it, I found the concept pretty sweet, and I was pleased to see that the actresses Eve and Harmony played on Angel got their work, but it was not long before the horrible horror of this movie came to light. <br /> <br /> Acting: The leads seemed to be competent enough, but everyone else? Dreadful. <br /> <br /> Content: Chock full of holes, big enough to drive a truck. <br /> <br /> Direction: Not available. <br /> <br /> Humor: Do you really think people would laugh? Oh boy. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: OK. There were some really beautiful women in this movie. Not just the three main female characters, but across the bench. It was as if the producers hoped the scenery would distract the male audience so much that they would not notice how horrible everything else was. If so, they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> In the right hands this could have been a cute but dark funny classic. It was not even close.
