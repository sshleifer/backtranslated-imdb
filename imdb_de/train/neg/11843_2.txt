Just because an event really happened does not mean it's going to be a good script / movie. The Cat's Meow by Peter Bogdanovich claims to be based on the actual events that took place on a cruise organized by William Randolph Hurst. The author has put more emphasis on creating a bizarre character character than taking the time to create a story for the bizarre characters. The key moments of history seem implausible; For example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer and thinks he is Chaplin. To base a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is banal and fictitious. The story tries to be a dark comedy, but The Cat's Meow misses an important element of this equation, the comedy. All characters lack empathy. It does not matter who is shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is no strong character to cheer on. As a result, the conflicts are difficult to take care of and the result is random.
