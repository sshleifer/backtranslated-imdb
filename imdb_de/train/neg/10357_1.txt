I really did not like this movie because it did not really bring out the messages and ideas that L'Engle brought to her novel. We had read the novel in our English class and I was thrilled. I'm afraid I can not say that for the movie. There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version, and nothing was entrusted to the imaginative genius of Madeleine L'Engle! That's why I rated it so bad. Do not watch this movie if you are a big fan of the lyrics of L'Engle, as you will be very disappointed. However, if you watch the movie for entertainment purposes (or for learning purposes, as in my case), this is fine.
