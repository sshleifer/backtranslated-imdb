It would help to know why it took so long for a book to be adapted for film or television as "cinematic" as "The House Next Door". The book was copyrighted in 1978. One reason for this could be problems with the design of the house. The house in this Lifetime movie is really so ugly that I can not imagine anyone would buy it. In fact, it is so ugly that someone would probably have come as soon as it was built. <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy about horror genre books, but this was hard to come by when I came in about ten years ago. The main characters are not people looking for something occult in life, and this is one of the book's strong points. They are not people who conclude that the architect was a kind of demon (or the devil in person), without observing and analyzing the events so well described in the book. It's, for the most part, a downbeat book, and I do not think it appeals to people who run Lifetime. Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in the next few years. A better house ... better music ... a better script and darker light ... would certainly help.
