This is a low budget movie "Scream". "Maddy" is a new employee in a strikingly nameless office, where she meets with her colleague "Chris" and makes a relationship. During a hot tub party, Chris and his friends convince Maddy that they belong to a "Murder Club" where everyone kills someone for kicks. If Maddy loses it and really kills someone, Hijinks are born. <br /> <br /> The film looks good, and there are prerequisites for this genre and budget (nudity, blood, maybe a few cameos of slightly bigger stars) than the cast), but after the credits you would ask you why you spent 80 minutes of your life looking at it.
