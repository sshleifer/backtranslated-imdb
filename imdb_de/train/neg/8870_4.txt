Stefan is an x-con who was married to Marie five years ago. Her marriage was stable until Stefan caught up with her and he was offered to do a courier job. Stefan's job is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden, which should go smoothly. In Germany, Stefan meets Elli, a girl from Bosnia, who was sold to a strip club owner. Stefan likes what he sees and decides to help Elli out of her misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father had fled to Sweden during the war, Elli now goes to Sweden with Stefan. To make up for the past, Stefan Elli promises to help her find her father, no matter what. Back in Sweden, the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever thought. <br /> <br /> This film does not seem to fit into the ordinary class of Swedish films since it has been Americanized a lot. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist do everything on average, but the effects make the movie a bit too much. See it and jugde for yourself. <br /> <br />
