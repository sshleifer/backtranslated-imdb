It seems that some of the people who reviewed this movie first looked at it because it was filmed near their place of residence. How is that for a sounding confirmation? If this movie was shot near my place of residence, I would not mention it in my review. It is terrible! Several reviews say that this movie is a parody or a funny horror movie. It's sad to see this film being reviewed as a comedy because it's not just a bad horror movie attempt, but a comedy as well. However, I laughed at how incredibly bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> This movie has two good things, the mask and the weapon of choice. Unfortunately it would have been more interesting to watch for an hour half of the mask and gun lay on a table and watched this garbage. The social commentary behind the film is also ridiculous, youthful and stupid. Do not bother with this movie, you've already wasted time reading this review. Do not waste this movie anymore. Arrggghhh! It's annoying that films like this one are even made. I had expected the entire crew of a crew to be credited to Alan Smithee. This name is used when a person, usually a director, does not want to get a movie because it's so bad. <br /> <br /> There is nothing redeeming in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 on the rental and I feel like I was demolished. Avoid. 1 out of 10
