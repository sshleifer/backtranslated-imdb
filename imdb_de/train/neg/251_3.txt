I was so excited to see this movie after I finally read the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented it and snuggled up to a classic holiday story brought to life on screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed. This film has come off the book several times before it can be forgiven. George C. Scott is a great actor, but in this context, it seemed as if he was only full in character about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was pretty flat. <br /> <br /> I realize that in '84 this was done mostly with CG effects. But it seemed to be very B-movie quality, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley. The biggest disappointment was the fact that they had skipped one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas Scrooge takes a whirlwind tour of the world, watching people in the most bleak circumstances still see the light and love of Christmas to have. Reformed "Scrooge in the end, that was a refreshing performance. <br /> <br /> I wish Bob Cratchit had been presented a bit ragged and run-down, and Tiny Tim ... oh, do not even mess with nasty kid actors. ..
