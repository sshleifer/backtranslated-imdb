The story is about the life of the people of Antwerp who live their lives. So I said it and there's really nothing left to tell about the story. The movie is fast, like an MTV movie, well photographed and we believe that the director has talent and should make more films. So let's forget this and hope for the best with the next Deus Barman picture.
