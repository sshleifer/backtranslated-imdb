A minor and mind-boggling (haha!) 80's horror, as if it were thirteen in a dozen, but it can be considered amusing to look at it in the right state of mind. The special effects are sticky, the acting horrible and the script seems to miss a few key paragraphs! "The Brain" takes place in a typical American city, where every teenager works in the same restaurant and the cool kid flushes down the toilet in high school cherry bombs. Here begins a TV guru named Dr. Blake and his delightful pet brain searching for nationwide mind control. Under the label "independent thinkers" sends a huge cheesy brain waves through TV and forces innocent bystanders to kill! How cool is that? Now it's up to the teen rebel from Meadowvale to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain are actually coming. There are obvious signs of extraterrestrial life, but that's about it. Meh, who really needs a background in a movie like this? Unfortunately, there is not so much bloodshed and the "evil" brain looks like an oversized sock puppet. The only more or less interesting element for horror fans is a look at the cast and crew who made this movie. Director Ed Hunt and author Barry Pearson are the same men who made "Bloody Birthday" and "Plague". Both are much better films and they have cleverly decided to quit the film industry. The most famous face in the cast is undoubtedly the great David Gale whom horror fans will forever adore for his role in re-animator. A girl named Christine Kossak delivers the nudity factor and is obviously a great talent. She has exactly 3 films in her repertoire, of which DAS is her "masterpiece". In her debut she was referred to as a "runaway model" and in "3 men and a baby" her character is referred to as "one of Jack's girls". I'm really wondering how she feels about her career as an actress?
