This was a disappointing horror movie about a young girl and her nightmares. It's way too tame for a horror movie or "thriller" movie and hype. There are only a few exciting moments here, not so many, as it should have been for a film of this genre. Even these "tense" scenes were not much. The music made them more dramatic than they actually were. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of symbolism here, so the elitist critics refer to this horror movie as a thinker. Well, if you think about it, I'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion as I have - a waste of video rental and generally bad acting. Far overvalued and certainly not what it advertises.
