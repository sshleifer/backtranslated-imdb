I've rarely been so annoyed by a leading performance as Ali McGraw in this movie. God is it annoying or what ?! She says it all in the same tone and is terrible, so horrible that Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is not much of a story. He is rich, she is made of wood, both must sacrifice much for love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, her name is given by his first name if you did not notice the difference in the two of them that they overcame in the name of love. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nominations for this film show that it must have been a bad year. John Marley is doing well as Wooden's father, but a supporting nomination? At least Ali did not win. <br /> <br /> I still think Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but if it was up to me, Katharine Ross would have starred in many other movies. She's certainly a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I did not even cry when she got sick, it never crossed my mind to even feel sad. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see how Tommy Lee Jones looked like he was about 15 years old, and the score is good. But this one is so old that he has a beard for a kilometer, and the sin of it is not that old, but he feels it.
