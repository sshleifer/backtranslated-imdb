The problems with this film are numerous, but I will try to mention the most blatant and annoying ones. Most of all, while the theme suggests a series of vignettes about life in Manhattan, the reality was that everything that is common in movies and on television is something bizarre, usually sexual in nature. The storylines were thin or absent, and virtually every scene, camera attitude, line of dialogue, and expressiveness were absolutely and absolutely spurious. It finally reached a point after an hour of such absent garbage that I went out (something that was not uncommon to me in recent years). I would have thought that the film was directed by some would-be dropouts of a third film study program, but I believe that the (formerly as Amelia talented) director Mira Nair participated in this vile travesty, so is the directorial talent in America, perhaps, descended en masse into the cesspit.
