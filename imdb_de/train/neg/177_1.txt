If you are planning to watch this movie, please reconsider it. Usually I do not post my comments to something I've seen on TV, but this was a waste of my life, and I had to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth. The criticism of this film would take far too long, because so many things are wrong. I'll just say, please never see this movie. It was a complete waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours. Anyone who has rated this film positively is one of two things. completely unable or working for the company that produced it. I guarantee once again that you will really regret this movie!
