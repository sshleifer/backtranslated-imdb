To say that this movie stinks would be offensive to skunks. As the other commentator says, this film offends anyone who has passed the mental age of 7 years (especially for gays this is an incredible insult). It's awful - and not so "so bad, it's funny" - it's just awful. No, I have to say it: IT IS RISING! (Sorry, skunks). <br /> <br /> From the opening criteria to the most recent titles, there are barely more than 10 seconds left of this film, which is worth opening your eyes. The "plot" is incoherent, the characterization does not exist, the acting is the excessive attack "look at me, I'm funny!" School and so it goes on. The sets are (if at all) cumbersome and poorly executed, it's terrible on all fronts - apart from the music, maybe I do not remember that it stinks the music (apart from the songs). <br /> <br /> In order to be fair to the creators, they put their cards on the table fairly quickly: the header reads "Ertha Kitt in the voice of Betty, the meteor" (since the meteor in question never fails Never say anything, but occasionally make a purring sound. Perhaps they have raised Ms. Kitts's contribution from one of their records) and the second line of the movie goes something like this: "... and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus." Uranus - "Your Anus" Geddit? Got it? huh huh ?? Your anus? The humor is really so cheap. <br /> <br /> It says strange things about the "comedies" of that time, that the hero was quite allowed to kill people on the street on purpose, but not "sh *". I paid fifty pence (about 1 euro) for this movie in one sale. I feel demolished.
