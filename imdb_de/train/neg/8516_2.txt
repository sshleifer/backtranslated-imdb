Last week, I watched the weekly Nielsen reviews and there was Veronica Mars, supposedly "the best show you can not see." <br /> <br /> Well, you are right that you are not watching it. It aired twice and ranked 147 and 145 out of 147. <br /> <br /> Translation: This is the lowest rated show in a nationwide broadcasting network ... and rightly so. I've tried to see it a few times because it was a "great" show in the press, a "realistic look" on life and all that nonsense. The reality was different. Veronica Mars is boring. It's as unrealistic as it gets, and it deserves plenty to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only secret is why CW remembers commercial and artistic failure after two years of continuing the lowest show.
