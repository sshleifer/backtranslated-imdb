Is there anything worse than a comedy movie without humor? The answer is yes; one that does not arouse interest throughout the picture. The premise is not bad - a na√Øve front man for an illegal business - but this is a potboiler with a bad script and bad script and just does not work. <br /> <br /> This was a good "B" in 1942 Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast, which contains several familiar faces from the 30s and 40s, including Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always reject Richard Cromwell as the weakling who killed Gary Cooper in "Lives of a Bengal Lancer ", so I did not count him). <br /> <br /> Can not recommend this and has rated it with 3 - if you have the choice, get yourself a root canal.
