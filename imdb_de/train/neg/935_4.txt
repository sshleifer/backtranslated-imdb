Users who have rated this movie so highly can not have seen enough good movies to compare with. Were they all brainwashed? I've rarely felt so disappointed in a movie, and some of it has to be due to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie. <br /> <br /> BU is just a chase movie from the start. We take it up at the end of a persecution and go straight to another. And another. And another. And another. Do you see a pattern emerge? There is virtually no time wasted on action, character development or boring old reality. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the other two Bourne films, you are pretty much lost. If you - you just wish you were lost - are somewhere far away from a movie theater. <br /> <br /> Paul Greengrass's passionate style worked extremely well on United 93, which was an emotional overload that was desperate, but on Bourne and his endless suffering caused the audience to no longer deal with the character. He runs. He jumps. He punches. He is blown up. He clears high buildings. Blah. First of all - he survives. He survives like an Action Action Man made of plastic, which only makes the ridiculous stunts that he pulls, the more relaxed and tensionless. So he starts a building? So what? He will survive. Yawning. <br /> <br /> There's a girl thrown into the mix because Borows love interest has died in a previous incarnation, but she's just decor. In episodes of Captain Scarlet, I've seen more character depth and brisk dialogue. <br /> <br /> Bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is boring and informal and does not tell us anything we did not know about the first movie. He was turned into a killing machine. Big thing. He finds out his true identity. So what? It has no emotional resonance when it comes to it. <br /> <br /> The "Twist" end is telegraphic and weak. Oh dear, the more I think about this movie, the more I hate it! I already reduced my score to 4 when writing this comment! I should end better now, before the film goes on. <br /> <br /> I love a good action movie and I love a good thriller. The Bourne ultimatum is none. It's a loud, boring series of eye-catching arrangements, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> The idea that the Bond franchise "shows the way" is a total shit. Casino Royale blows it out of the water.
