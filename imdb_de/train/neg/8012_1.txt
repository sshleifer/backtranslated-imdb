As a lesbian, I'm always on the lookout for movies that relate to gays and lesbians. However, with this kind of crap out there, it would be enough to discourage any audience. <br /> <br /> I've always been waiting for something to happen - anything! - a story that is being developed, or just making sense of it. None has occurred. It was just meaningless scenes that were in no way connected with anything. The film did not give the character a story or depth. <br /> <br /> After an hour or more of this nonsense, I just turned it off. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this absurdity. <br /> <br /> 1 star - and it did not even deserve it.
