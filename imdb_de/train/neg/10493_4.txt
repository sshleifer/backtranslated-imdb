A difficult to categorize film. I never gave 110% concentration, and as simple as the story appeared, I could not say exactly who did what among the American FBI characters and what roles they had. Nor could I take the Irwins seriously as movie characters if their lines and scenes were all in the style of one of his shows and not played. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a glorified episode of a Discovery TV show, with a largely insignificant negotiation that just seemed to be in the way. However, since every Irwin show is always worth a watch, this movie is well worth a look, but not at Christmas. Speaking of which, I also have better things to do than being here. <br /> <br /> A high 4/10
