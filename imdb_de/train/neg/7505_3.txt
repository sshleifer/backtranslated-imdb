This lengthy film is not so much about Berkowitz and its impact on New York as it is about painting caricatures of a certain group of Americans from Italy called "Guidos". The problem is that "guidos" are uninteresting no matter what story or environment they are in. They already live on caricatures, so Lee only reinforces them, instead of only presenting them. <br /> <br /> When? Someone made a caricature, they do not go home and say, "Hey, let's make our ears and nose bigger!" That's what Lee did in this movie. The most interesting characters of the film are the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito), who want to escape the "Guido" lifestyle. Crown it with an uninteresting plot for the characters, especially John Leguizamo, and you'll get a nice movie to fall asleep. Especially in view of the long term. <br /> <br /> Another blow: For someone who has spoken out as a Yankees fan and grown up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to misspelling Phil Rizzuto spelled in the credits.
