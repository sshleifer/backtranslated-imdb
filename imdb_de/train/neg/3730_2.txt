First of all, it is not wrong to study Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophetic writings. There is nothing wrong with making a film like this to try to present the message of the gospel. My concerns with this film are therefore neither in the sincerity nor in the aspirations. As a Christian, though Amillenialist, I believe that there will be a great tribulation and I believe that Christ will return, as he has said. Although I disagree with this movie about the Rapture, I do not rate this movie that low. <br /> <br /> No, what makes me so low on this film is not its sincerity or its message, but rather the lack of production values, terrible screenplay, mediocre acting and pathetic FX. This film features some of the coolest scifi fodder of the fifties. No, this movie ranks with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This movie did not age well and was probably dated at the time they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> The producers of Apocalypse genres could have known how they could not make an end-time film out of it, but they failed. The Left Behind series, the Apocalypse series and the Omega code series did not all come out of it, as they address the FX issues and outdated look issues, but their scripts are still poor and their acting is made of wood. <br /> <There are great Christian films with extremely low budgets, but this movie is not one of them. I am amazed that the MST3K crew never went up in flames.
