This through-hearted chaos may have ranked Mr. Branagh as Kadosh as a Shakespearean adapter for the cinema. (Released 4 years ago, no sight of an adaptation ever since.) I've just finished it with cable television - Holy God, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I agree with the feeling of a reviewer who has said that reconsidering something so obvious and sad is a terrible act that is shrill. That being said, I'll take the risk, if only because * Love's Labor's Lost * is the perfect reward for those who have overestimated Mr. Branagh's abilities in the past. Branagh has always been a pretty mean director: grimly literal-minded; Sternhieb unforgivably incomprehensible to his fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but loves himself more and makes damn sure that he gets all the good lines) Lost * is hardly worse than the endless, terrible, bloated * Hamlet * of 1996 In fact, this film may be preferable, if only because it has only one third of the length. Branagh decided it would be a good idea to bring this bad early work of Shakespeare into the environment of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire and Yada Yada. So he sets the thing in 1939 and leaves about an eighth of the text in favor of the annoying interpretations of the Thirties (wait until you see the actors lifted to the ceiling during "I'm In Heaven") and performers Actors who are not known for their dancing or singing (he himself included). The result is a catastrophe that is so unreal that you are completely stunned that you did not set a horrified stop after seeing it for the first time. I do not even blame the cast. To tell Hamlet, "The script is that thing!" NO UNIQUE could be a good hit in this Hodge Podge: the famous RSC alumni are no better off than Alicia Silverstone. Who could possibly take action in this matter? <br /> <br /> Branagh's first mistake was to think that * Love's Labor's Lost * was worth a spin. Trust me, that's not it. It is an anomaly in the Bardenkanon that was written expressly for a trained courtesy group of courtiers - NOT the usual audience for whom he wrote. Therefore, there are many valuable (and TEDIOUS!) Puns, references to contemporary scholastic nonsense, parodies of Lylys * Euphues *. , , In other words, hardly any material for a broad audience. Damn it, it does not appeal to an audience already prone to Shakespearean comedy. The piece can not be staged without drastically cutting the text and "updating" it with every gimmick that comes to hand. What raises the question, why bother? <br /> <br /> Branagh's second mistake was to believe that Shakespeare's cream cake of a game could be served with a side order of Gershwin's marmalade. Obviously, the idea or hope was to make an incomprehensible Elizabethan exercise palatable to the modern public by simultaneously managing the nostalgic American pop culture in their throats. But this in turn raises the question of why bother. <br /> <br />
