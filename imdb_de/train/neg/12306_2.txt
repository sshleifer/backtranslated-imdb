This movie is a pure failure. I'm a Steve Martin fan, but even he can not save the tired idea and the Swiss cheese script. Think of "Police Academy 7" and apply it to a military parody. Yuck. <br /> <br /> I do not think the other comments made by users reflect (and rightly deserve!) the poor rating of this film. It is extremely misleading. I used to shut down this movie to $ 3.00 in the supermarket and now I know why. <br /> <br /> If only I could get my 90 minutes back ...
