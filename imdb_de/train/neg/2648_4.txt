I've just read a book about Anita Loos's work and the photo in MacDonald's TCM Magazine in her angel costume looked awesome (impressive wings), so I thought I'd watch this movie. I had never heard of the movie before, so I did not have any preconceptions about it. I thought Eddy had a nice start with Playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he does not know exists. The scene in which she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that are not staying was really enchanting. I even went with the movie when Eddy went to sleep and she introduced herself as a real angel. But after a while it started to fall apart for me. Eddy stays "sleeping" throughout the rest of the movie, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from there does not matter because he just dreams. The rest was pretty much less and pointless. I had to force myself to stick to it. And the last track, in which MacDonald changes from musical number to musical number in some crazy hallucination, was just crazy. Had Eddy "aroused" earlier and continued the original story, or did he really marry an angel? I think it would have been much more interesting. I wanted to see more of her true character. <br /> <br /> There were not really enough music numbers to call it a musical. The first songs were good, but the jitterbug that MacDonald plays was like nails on a blackboard. Quite wrong for her opera voice. Nevertheless, Eddy and MacDonald still manage to shine and show what true stars they were.
