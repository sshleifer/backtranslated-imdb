This movie is really crazy. There's really nothing nice I can say about it, except for the moral truth expressed in the climax of the movie where people in the neighborhood are involved in crime fighting. Apart from all that, the movie had nothing: no good attitudes, no good acting and no good script. I give this movie an F and a 2 out of 10.
