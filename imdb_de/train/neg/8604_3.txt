Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who had a tiny part of the classic "The Warriors") is the first in the community to realize that there are murderous slugs in his small town. Not just any snails, mind you, but a carnivorous killer that's bigger than normal, mutated by toxic waste snails (which are still going as fast as a normal snail, which is not that scary, but I digress). Nobody will believe him first, but they will do it. Oh yes, they will. <br /> <br /> OK, killer slugs are right about psychotic sloths and right under Johnathon Winters as Mork's Baby in the scary factor. The absurdity of the whole becomes clear from the beginning. The strip is fun and is from the "so bad that it is good". I appreciate that these are slugs: the film as opposed to slugs: the children's game or slugs: the other white meat. Probably not worth looking at more than once and forgetting it promptly, unless a rather obscure trivia was played. Director Juan Piquer Sim√≥n is notable for his earlier films "Pod People" (which rightly mocked MST3K) and "Peices" (which is probably the funniest bad movie ever made), Eye Candy: Kari, known to Rose T & A <br /> <br /> My Rating: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Only a movie trailer for this movie
