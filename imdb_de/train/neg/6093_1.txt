This must be the worst movie I have ever seen. I bought the DVD and it did not work. Well, the DVD worked well. It's just not the movie. In fact, it's so bad that I think none of the actors has worked since (or before judging by acting). There is no real conspiracy and no real horror. The output values ​​are even for a low budget movie garbage, and some outdoor scenes are barely audible due to the wind on the microphone. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was such a bad movie that a viewer felt it would turn into porn if they did not know any better (which was an improvement). There are only two lines in the movie that are funny and both revolve around the transvestite prostitute. (Although they hardly deserve to check every 76 minutes) <br /> <br /> As far as the marketing of the DVD is concerned, I feel completely cheated. I mean, when I read my back, I expected it to go bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapons. He has chosen his victims. He grabbed his nose. He has turned into a girl! <br /> <br /> But I thought it might be funny. The case also claims to have been digitally reworked, I would have liked to see it before, the print is so grainy that it could be used as sandpaper. The case also says that it is an absolutely disgusting movie IN HOW? PATH? say, buy "bad taste" instead, it's a much better movie and is funny, plus it has Peter Jackson, the director of the LOTR, in it.) By the way, if anyone talks about the actor white or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have been doing since, please post here, as I would like to know, just to find out if there is a worse movie or if anyone in this movie has ever learned acting
