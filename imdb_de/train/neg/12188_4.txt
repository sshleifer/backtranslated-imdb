While I can not deny that his films are often entertaining, I have always personally felt that Martin Scorsese is a bit overrated in his abilities. His use of eye-catching styles in a large number of his films seems to scream: "Look at me, am I not a resourceful director?". His best movie I've ever seen is the one with the least extra flourishes, the superlative "Raging Bull." <br /> <br /> But this remake seems like it's normal. The dull stock of film that was supposed to convey a 1950s attitude was so mild to distract itself. The melodramatic close-ups in combination with the sub-par imitation of the classic "psycho" score lead to ridicule rather than a sense of atmospheric terror. The score for "Psycho" was incredibly annoying, this "tribute" just sounds shrill and annoying. Even the cast, which can sometimes be decent, delivers histrionic performances that just scream "caricature." The notable exception to this is a smart turn of Lewis as an impressive teenage daughter of the Bowden family. <br /> <br /> The worst offender here is, surprisingly, De Niro. Sure, he looks appropriately threatening, but as soon as he opens his mouth, that aura will simply drain away. Well, I'm not an expert on American accents, I originally came from near Manchester in England and still, but he sure could have gotten a more convincing southern flair? As a gifted physical actor, he almost overcomes this deadly mistake, but not quite. For me as a De Niro fan, it was disturbing that I wish he was not on the screen and not impressed with his performance. <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS.) <br /> <br /> The end -The top style of the entire film extends to the ridiculously covered finale. When will Scorsese learn that playing the situation can sometimes create tension as effectively as visual and sonic bombardment to the viewer? I also thought that he had too high a respect to use the cheap "killer-not-dead-yet" trick less talented people could use. <br /> <br /> All in all a thoroughly ridiculous "thriller". , Scorsese and De Niro have worked MUCH better together.
