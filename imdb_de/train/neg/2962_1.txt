Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining. So Whoopi Goldberg can do movies. But whoopi AND dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex" I came to a conclusion: This movie is evil. Wicked, mean, evil and reprehensible despite his defiance for the public. Nothing bad is done by accident. This is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber. <br /> <br /> First of all, Whoopi does not do any good action movies (see "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), I do not care - she's a tough cop again. <br /> <br /> Did you see one million police officers this week? Well, there are a million and one, buddy. <br /> <br /> Do not you like cute, humanistic animated dinosaurs since the Spielberg TV show? Too bad, there's one more, and he's a cop too! <br /> <br /> You are one of those people who saw car chases, gunfights, sloppy dialogues, boring futuristic effects and talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) in a movie that looks like a tax write-off? A large tax write-off? <br /> <br /> And you read this report until the end. They MAKE a sequel. Seriously. <br /> <br /> No stars, no. And if they really make a sequel to "Theodore Rex", Hollywood deserves to have attacked a whole herd of wise cracking foam dinosaurs. Now I would pay for it.
