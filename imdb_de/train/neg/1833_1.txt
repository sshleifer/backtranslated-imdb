Please, someone keeps Ben Stiller from playing in any movie. Write the studios, damn it, even write to your local congressman. I got more laughs when I went to a funeral than I saw ANY Stiller movie. Jack Black is trying to make something out of a comedy about vanishing dog feces, and Christopher Walken, perhaps one of the greatest actors of his generation, just looks embarrassed to be there. Stiller is his listless self, but now, even if someone puts him out, he proves that he is much over-estimated as a comic. No wonder why this movie went bad and was available in the dollar cinemas after only a few weeks. I warn you, and you must warn your friends. Do not look at this movie, it's just awful, worse than Gothika then the golden kid. Please, Hollywood, stop letting Ben Stiller in your movies, he's not funny, he's a terrible actor and brings others along. The following movie was ranked # 1, as no negative ratings are allowed. While the board says one, I give it a zero.
