This movie is really terrible. terrible as in him is a waste of 84 minutes of your life. Special effects are so terrible. The acting was not convincing. <br /> <br /> It's about a crocodile attacking tourists while they are filming a documentary about "bloodsurfing". Blood surfing is when they are surfing around sharks, but it is terribly wrong when a 31 foot crocodile breaks his vacation. The sharks do not look real. The crocodile is even worse, and it becomes even miserable when it is run away by the creature, but the crocodile remains hanging and 2 females flash on it. The deaths are fake and the pirates are only ready on time. <br /> <br /> A pointless, horrible movie that is not worth watching !!
