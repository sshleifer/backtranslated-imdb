A question for you: A family goes to a new house and is persecuted by demonic forces. About which movie do I speak? Any horror movie you've seen? That's right, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I will narrow it down by saying that there are many youthful scare scenes. Does not that help? Well, there are many places where the characters are being pursued by a creature and you are seeing the characters through the creature's POV. No further forward? Okay, is there a dream sequence with a lot of blood? Could still be a horror movie you say. Oh god, that could take weeks, so I'm saying the movie that I'm talking about features of Aussies, many of which have appeared in NEIGHBORS and HOME AND AWAY. Yes, it's right, the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE (aka CUBBYHOUSE) and do you understand what the above exercise is about? I would like to point out that THE THIRD CIRCLE is not at all different from horror movies that have been made
