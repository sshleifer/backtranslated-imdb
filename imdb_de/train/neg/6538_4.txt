When I look through my account of THE HOUSE THE SCREAMED, many may assume that I'm about 14 years old and believe that SCREAM is considered a "classic" horror. This is not the case since I am 30 years old and have been watching horror movies most of my life. Granted, I'm an 80s kid who grew up with slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal, etc. in the style of horror movies. So I prefer horror movies that are more graphic and faster. Just as someone who appreciates other music, painting or, in this case, the movie - but not necessarily like them - can also understand why some people like this kind of movie ... I just can not ... <br /> <br /> THE HOUSE THAT IS SEEN is a very boring and boring movie about a stubborn girl school. The imperious mistress of the school rules with an iron hand (or in some cases ...) to keep the girls in line. She has a small son who sneaks around and looks at the girls while showering (not less in their nightgowns (?!?) ...), and in the meantime, girls disappear from school as they fall victim to a murderer lurking ... <br /> <br /> I can see why THE HOUSE, SCREAMING, is often compared to SUSPIRIA (which in my opinion is a masterpiece of a movie ...) as far as the atmosphere is concerned The school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this movie is so boring and uneventful that I could barely stay awake. I'm all for "suspense" and "suspense" in horror movies - but this movie did not suit me. Fortunately, I did not expect it to be busy, so I can not say I was really disappointed 70s This is not a fast and fast rule, but the ones I had seem to be the exception. Probably a "must" for horror fans, who like rather inconspicuous and suggestive horror movies. Since I do not really know many fans of this material, I can not really recommend this ... 4/10
