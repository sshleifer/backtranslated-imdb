I will be brief. This "adaptation" of the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more. Of course, there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans on this site, and this movie has mysteriously found its way into the top 250. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson is ridiculous like Torrance and Shelley Duvall as well. The story, which has nothing to do with the book, is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who has not read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story: stay with the TV series .... Oh, and the people Those who say that Kubrick had every right to destroy the king's story because King ... is not a good writer should stick to "masterpieces" like "eyes wide shut".
