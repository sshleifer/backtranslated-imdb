Simply put, this is the worst movie since "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you like this movie you will probably like it). <br /> <br /> What did you think? Some ideas should be just that, an idea. The fact that this idea is to film itself should be a criminal offense. <br /> <br /> What was so bad, I hear you asking. One word ... EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> Cost of hiring: â‚¬ 4.50 In-Time-to-Watch: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I would like a refund for both!
