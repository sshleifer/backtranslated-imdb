I read that "There's a girl in my soup" came out during the low period of Peter Sellers. When I watch the movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the movie. Apparently, the presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the film. it does not work The whole movie just seems to happen to film what happened without writing anything. Maybe I have not seen any movie about older people trying to be hippies, but this movie gives such movies a pretty bad name, much better movies than this one, so do not waste your time with it. Pretty worthless.
