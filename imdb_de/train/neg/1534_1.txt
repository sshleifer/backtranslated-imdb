From blocky digitized footage to acting that brings Keanu to "I'm so wooden, I could be a plank," Reeves looks like an Oscar winner biting this movie (pun not intended). The best part is the box of eRATicate in the 2nd segment (which seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and "twist" of the three). I wish I had spent the Â£ 3.99 on something else, like um ... Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut. If you buy this, you are really disappointed, do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague. If you're looking for something amateur and with actors that are more wood than a 2x4, then go ahead. But if you're looking for a high-quality werewolf action, look elsewhere, such as Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt.
