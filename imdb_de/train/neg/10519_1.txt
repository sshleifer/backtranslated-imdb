I've seen a lot of films and I would rarely classify a movie as "1", but this movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, the plot was ridiculous, the impact was unrealistic and the characters were annoying. When I watch creepy movies, I think it's DUMB when the characters hear a noise in house / forest / school / etc and then "hello, is anyone there?" - But at least they are credible when they do it. This movie could not even do it right. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that produces other B-horror movies like Venom and The Fog Looks like a masterpiece honored with Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> I'm always open to watching movies and all I can say is that this movie was a waste of time and I'm writing this comment so everyone else who thinks about it when they watch this movie You think again. IT IS TERRIBLE!
