The idea of ​​building a mini-series about the Berlin Airlift seemed to me to be one of the more interesting German (post) war films. It's a topic that has not been researched so far. However, the makers of this series have filled it with clichés. It already starts with the movie's DVD cover, which is a direct copy of the Pearl Harbor cover. Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) learns that her husband is a doctor (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and after the war she is fighting for survival. She finds a job in the American base, works for the coolest and highest ranking officer (Heino Ferch) of the city, falls in love with me, gets pregnant and suddenly her husband reappears. Come on!!! We have seen this too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their role quite well; But Bettina Zimmermann never seems to convince. For some reason, it always seems to be a bit too late to give the right emotional response to the scenes. It just did not work. <br /> <br /> The action scenes with the airplanes and the air lift are sometimes exciting, often not. Evil things always seemed to happen to the same pilot. <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of World War II films, I suggest you spend your money on something else: chocolate ice cream brings much more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
