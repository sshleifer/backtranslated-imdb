Serious. I just completed my first sight of Demonicus and I did not succeed in the words. <br /> <br /> I remember a time when I saw Charles Band's name in a movie and my heart was racing. He was never a Wes Craven or a John Carpenter. He was a bastion of hope for the little man. The guy whose films arrived at the video store instead of the multiplexer still rocked harder than most of the trendy garbage we had to endure. <br /> <br /> And now ... here <br /> A painful Californian trail doubles for "the Alps" and an abandoned train tunnel is supposed to be an "old cave". I mean, they did not even try to dress up or film that thing with moss, maybe it's something else than an old train tunnel! Pooh! Instead of a spooky demonic gladiator, as the cover implies, we're populated with a guy in Wal-Mart Halloween clothing. There's a pretty cool-looking corpse that occasionally comes to life to bump and wiggle his fingers, but he does not even learn to stand until the last five minutes. Why could not he be the bad guy? Instead we have a little boy Joe with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... You should be ashamed that your name is associated with such minds. I love movies that are so bad that they are good. Hell, I occasionally enjoy a movie that is so bad, it's just bad. However, this is simply unbeatable. A perfect example for making money instead of making a quality movie.
