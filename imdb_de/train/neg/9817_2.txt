Wow ... sheer brilliance. <br /> <br /> From a thriller / suspense / horror comedy. <br /> <br /> After watching this, I've never laughed so much about a horror movie ... It's a ridiculous storyline with 3 characters that are just so insanely developed - either not deep or too deep written. <br /> <br /> If you want to see an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialogue, confused storyline and pointless scenes, wasting characters, bad sound and poor development overall, then this is the one you should watch. <br /> <br /> Be sure to focus on the classic scene of the "food processor" and the totally inappropriate police investigation scenes /> <br /> This is a remarkable new weakness in screen performance and writing. If you last the entire duration, you either become stupid, brave or courageous.
