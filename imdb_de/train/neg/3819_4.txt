T.Z. Post, a college professor, receives a false letter stating that he has inherited $ 750,000. Now, with financial resources, he withdraws his savings of $ 4,000 and decides to finally go out and live. After sending his luggage to Chicago on a train, he meets a traveling vaudeville troupe and decides to settle there well enough for a show on Broadway. On the night of the show, poor Professor Post has to hide from his creditors, clarify the relationship issues between girlfriend Pansy and & Floozy Diva Eleanor, and still make sure the show has to go on. After seeing many of the silent gems of Keaton, it's a painful sitting, but I felt it could have been a lot worse. The side cast Durante, Todd and Selwyn are sometimes very annoying, but still sympathetic. A pre-Charlie Chan Toler is good as a frustrated show director. 90% of the script is poorly written, as MGM tries to portray this as a poor man's Marx Bros. film, in which many of the gags wane from the start. The film, which was then compiled with Keaton's drinking problems, is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating - 3.
