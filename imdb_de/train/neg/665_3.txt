In Bridgeport, confused high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed by teenage student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); She experiences murdering her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and put in jail for life. Three years later, the traumatized Donna is better, but she is still under psychological treatment and takes pills. On her prom night, she goes to the party with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two friendly couples at the Pacific Grad Hotel. But the psychopath Richard escaped from prison and is on the same floor of the hotel where he chases Donna and pierces her friends and hotel staff, who cross his path a collection of clichés with a lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and stupid, with bad behavior by Johnathon Schaech in the role of a lunatic killer. The predictable script is amazing, because you can predict what will happen in the next scenes. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Morte Convida Para Dançar" ("Death invites you to dance")
