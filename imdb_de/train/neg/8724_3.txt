OK - the cons first: The compulsory alligator of the 70s (alright, Correction - Caiman) with non-moving limbs gets worse in miniature underwater shots (with the entire length of the reptile compared to boat size) using a toy alligator. In Wide floodlit waters around the toy boat - even for nocturnal shots! <br /> <br /> Unlike most primitive, killing, exploitative Western movies, the superstitious natives seem to beat thugs and begin massacring vacationers this time unwarranted. Nobody really abused the natives - exploited, yes, but far from being abused. After all, it was one of the aborigines (crawling with a spoiled supermodel during a tabu full moon) that brought the curse of the River Demon on them, right? <br /> <br /> The vacationers are easily annoying (with the notable) except for the symbolic old souls / mild blasphemous little girls who make the heroes shine, which you often see in Euroflicks of the 70s), but far from deserving of violent death - unless they were your next door neighbor, mind you. A couple is actually killed as heroic - noteworthy that none of them plays the role of the buddy. There are only two straight rogues in the entire movie, so the sins feel more random than cathartic. <br /> <br /> The order in which the gigantic cayman crunches and throws thirty tourists in under five minutes will make you look hilarious as unintentionally. <br /> <br /> The point at which the natives decide not to wipe out the surviving Westerners and to say practically: "Hey, you are not so bad, excuse yourself for this excitement last night" - because they were blown up the monster lizard - makes you shake your head while the crass music breaks in. You know, the local military dictatorship is going to wipe out the village to torment the tourist business after the end ... <br /> <br /> Pros: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You all know why you are even interested in this movie, right? I also thought. If you're a Bach Completeist, you should have the DVD of NoShame Movies reissued earlier this year (remastered digitally without any real extras, other than the director complaining of the current state of international film distribution). <br /> <br /> The hero is not half bad, he's far from an idiot (always a plus in B movies) and the cynical little kid has the most comic relief. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look, but it's cheap!
