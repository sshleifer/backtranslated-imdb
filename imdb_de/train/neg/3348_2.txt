The 1963 version of "The Haunting" has been one of my favorite horror movies for years, so I was very worried about the release of this 1999 remake. It hardly seemed that a follow-up could exceed or even reach the original masterpiece. Unfortunately, my worries were justified: This film stinks. <br /> <br /> I do not know what those involved in this film think. Jan De Bont, who seemed to have a curse while leading the excellent "Speed", is just as bad (or even worse) as he is with the much hyped Duds "Twister" and "Speed ​​2: Cruise Control " did. "Hey Jan, stay with the cinematography, right? Liam Neeson is in his role as a doctor pretending to be a sleep psychologist - appropriate - I do not think he's capable of doing a really poor job Catherine Zeta Jones proves once again (as with Entrapment) that she lacks the theatrical ability to rise above the material she is given www.mjfriendship.de/de/index.php?op...80&Itemid=58 An episode of "The X - Files" was awesome here, lost like Eleanor, an insomniac hovering on the edge of sanity, and this blond guy, whoever he is, is more of wood than the ridiculously strange statuettes of children I do not think he will change the expression throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS AHEAD) <br /> <br /> The first film worked so well, because we are ourselves were never sure if that was the movie house was really haunted, or whether the manifestations are due to Eleanor's precarious mental state. There are no ghosts in the original that demand a lot from the imagination - a hallmark of other great horror movies like "The Changeling" and "The Blair Witch Project". Of course, in this updated version, we get tons of CGI ghosts, which basically make the movie completely insecure (given the weak script / storyline). The f / x are not even that great, considering that they were made by ILM. The frozen breath looks very phony. The effects in the undervalued Peter Jackson movie "The Frighteners", which I have just seen, were much better. The wood carvings of the kids, who are supposed to look scary, just look stupid (especially when they scream), and the CGI monsters are nothing to write home about. Instead of getting rid of the bad performances, the bad direction and the bad writing, the effects only contribute to the chaos of a movie. <br /> <br /> Some particularly stupid scenes: When the three other characters break into Eleanor's bedroom and none of them seems to be surprised that a huge, dark demon is hovering over the bed. The scene in which Eleanor "hangs" the former lady of the house depends on the rafters ... the acting here is especially bad. And last but not least, the unintentionally funny bit in which Wooden Blonde Guy uttered an uninspired scream about what is considered painful jumps onto a piece of furniture and begins tinkering with the painting of the old, evil man who built the house , We actually get some satisfaction in this scene when, seconds later, after the attack, Blond Guy is dragged to the fireplace by the old man's ghost and promptly his head is cut off by the fireplace. It was the only part of the movie that I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Stay in total with the 1963 original "The Haunting". 3/10 stars.
