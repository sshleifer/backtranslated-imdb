A very kitschy and boring road movie with the intention of being hip and modern, shown in a cutting style and with some strange camera settings that only lead to drowsiness. <br /> <br /> The cast is wasted, the writing is stupid and overbearing. The only thing that's worth it is Lalo Schifrin's first-class soundtrack, really cool and also the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Run, if you can, the bad opinions and comments on this movie are absolutely deserved; it is really pure garbage. Of course, this has its appeal to watch a movie everyone would not throw the beer glass at when it burns, but pick it up for a stormy day when you have absolutely nothing else to do.
