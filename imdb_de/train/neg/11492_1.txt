How can a big German television station send such a mess? It's amazing how the main characters avoid any acting talent - even the well-known Gottfried John is very poor - especially in the double murder scene - as amateurish .......! The screen plan is very, very extended - maybe to fill in two parts of the movie. Take care while you are not falling asleep! The set is obviously very often a blue screen, z. the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version the sound and the dubbing are very bad - probably because of different actor languages ​​- but: other international productions treat this much more professionally. Note: DO NOT pay attention - it's a hell of a waste of time!
