Although flying guillotines is part of the title of this film, but has no connection to the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and their continuation Flying Guillotines II (1978). The two originals are masterpieces of Kung Fu film and stand out as classics. This is a much inferior copy of the original, and even as a normal kung fu movie, it's below average. <br /> <br /> First, this movie does not have much acting. It's a pointless battle scene after another, and flying guillotine does not matter much. The story is about some Shaolin monks who track down some villains who have gone off with a holy book, and a bad prince who owns a part of this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince has plans to lure the monks in and use the flying guillotines. <br /> <br /> There are four movies with Flying Guillotine as part of its title. This is in my opinion of low quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this film differs from the other three, suggesting that this film was produced by a different entity than the other three bad ones. <br /> <br /> It's best to skip the two originals.
