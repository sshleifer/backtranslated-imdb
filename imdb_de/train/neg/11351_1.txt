With MASSIVE advertising, this goes to Nickelodeon and Nick Jr., and my son disturbed us to see it. Between DVD and the theaters, I've seen pretty much everything from the most outstanding ones (Incredibles, Shrek) to the really bad ones (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But that was probably the worst movie I've ever seen, kids or kids. It was a "when it will end this stupid thing?" Kind of experience? OK, it's aimed at toddlers (or better that way - it's insulting to the intelligence of over 3 years), but I've never seen anything so predictable, repetitive, and slow. Then, when you are finally fed up, but relieved that the movie is over, there is in the end this bizarre thing that you think is the setup for a joke you're trying to achieve. The 3-D Effects ... Yeah, if you've never seen a Viewmaster, they're a big deal, otherwise no (if you look at the screen without glasses, it seems to be the same process). Even my son was bored in the end. My wife and I looked at each other and said "wow" in the end. Bad in every way.
