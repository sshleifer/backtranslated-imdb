First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What the hell? Why on earth are they trying to sell a cheap bitch on low-night TV with the promise of creating disturbing, offensive, sick garbage that any normal person with soul can not see. <br /> <br /> What is the joke when a dog is injured, a grandmother bangs his head ... a guy who breaks his hand and two girls go to the bathroom? What the hell has this world gotten people to find comedy in something so completely sick. Anyone who thinks this material is funny should not even be allowed to enter the earth. <br /> <br /> But from what I hear, it's not even offensive ... so ... they promise comedy through garbage dumps ... and can not do that.
