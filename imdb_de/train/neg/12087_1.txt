I have seen all kinds of "Hamlets". <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was the most ambitious, Mel Gibson was quick and to that point Laurence Olivier was the best - no doubt. But now we come to Maximilian Schell's attitude to the Bard. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it is a dubbed version of a German television production of William Shakespeare's venerable Fox. If somewhere there is a slower, clumsier, lethargic, and poorly staged version, it must have been played at the school level. <br /> <br /> If you've seen it on MST3K, it helps to mock Mike and the robots with the old boy and the profundity of black and white television, Shakespeare and the wisdom (?) of the Germans too clarify English plays and makes it look as if an Ingmar Bergman refuse. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best parts are the MST riffs. Best lines? "I'll unleash the Great Dane," "I do not think so," "Breathe," "Meet the Beatles," "Hey, Dad, help me with my science project" and my personal favorite during a party - "Garrison Keillors leaves Germany (YAAAY !!) ". <br /> <br /> But then there is Schell playing Shakespeare's greatest character, much like a department store mannequin, just not so expressive. No doubt he's a great actor, but he gets away just as well as Paul Newman in "The Silver Chalice." Do you ever see that? You have to look at these two on a double bill! <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a case in which it is true that you are much better off just reading the book. At the very least, the book is not being synced by Ricardo Montalban. <br /> <br /> Only one star for this "Hamlet"; ten stars of course for the MST3K version. Good night, not so sweet prince.
