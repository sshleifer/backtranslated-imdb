And I thought The Beach was bad, except that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not blame him for the horrible screenplay. If anyone can understand what the hell was the meaning of the movie, give your self a pat on the back. It's a cross between The Village and a crappier script. It starts to stand out somehow, and then, if it goes further into the plot, it just does not make sense and does not bring me to the end !!!! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie exist is Nicolas Cage's usual great sense of humor and his ability to be funny in the craziest situations. If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie you see, save five bucks, just go home and set fire to it. If some of you ask for the reason, just say the stupidest thing that comes to your mind. and let's go!
