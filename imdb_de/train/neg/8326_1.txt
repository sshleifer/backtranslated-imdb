This is the most ridiculous and ridiculous thriller I have ever seen. Oh ... where should I start? <br /> <br /> Plot (which is little there): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire who has a bad heart, desperately needs a transplant. Clay was secretly played with his mother Samantha's PA by Jessica Alba, engaged. The night they marry secretly happens to have a heart donor with the same rare blood type. Go and find the chances! On the operating table, Clay realizes that anesthesia is not working, and he can feel everything and hear everything. Fortunately, Clay seems to filter out the pain of a razor-sharp scalpel cut Open his chest by simply focusing on his memories of Samantha, which is made us through an annoying voice-over that never seems to stop. <br /> <br /> If you have not laughed yet, then it certainly starts when you see the surgery scenes. <br /> <br /> How can a young billionaire agree that a heart transplant is performed by a surgeon, a nurse, a treating doctor and a drunken anesthesiologist? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was pulled. Not to mention the medical behavior that is too repugnant to be taken seriously. The operating room is not even kept sterile. People can practically walk in and out of the room without even being flushed. During the operation, the viewer hears the thoughts of Clay, none of which is too intriguing. Ah ... but here's what it's all about ... the doctors are trying to kill him to take his money. Believing that he is unconscious, the villains speak freely. My goodness! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... At least there is no interference from anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent doctor who has launched four official abuse cases against him is carrying out a serious heart surgery. Not even Clay's over-cautious mother seems to be able to check his status. The only one interested in keeping up to date is Samantha ... but oh no ... could sweet Sam be there ... you'll find out quickly in a Scooby Doo dialogue ... < In the end, it would not even matter if Clay went through anesthesia awareness or not, because the end would have been the same in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the feeling that the director is feeling / writers trying to make fun of the patients who have been victims of anesthesia awareness, maybe there is some silly fun you have could ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy ...
