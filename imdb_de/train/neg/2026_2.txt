There was such a hype about a game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially right after a deal or no deal and 1 vs 100. So everyone had to turn on, of course, to see what the action was all about. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein says so stoically and nasally: "Wooww". <br /> <br /> The only thing that was nice about this show was the fact that you knew it would be over someday. Sitting for an entire hour was like visiting a dentist ... You look at the clock at a 10-minute interval, only to find that only a minute has passed since then (but it seemed like an eternity). You last stopped the clock looked. Why did not I just change the channel? Well, probably for the same reason that most of the others were not out of pure optimism. I mean, nobody really wants to believe that a show with Bill Shatner could actually be that bad. <br /> <br /> Personally, from the first fifteen minutes I would never have thought that this would be the type of vehicle to present the talents of William Shatner. My main complaint was that the set was so dark. After watching, I felt depressed. They always wanted to experience some excitement, but there simply was not any. There was not even enough light on the set to get a sense of energy from the audience (that you could not even see). <br /> <br /> Dear Network: People do not watch any game shows to cure their insomnia. ..you see game shows to be excited and have a good time. Please do us all a favor and lose it in the vault.
