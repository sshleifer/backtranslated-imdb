Fidelity to Peter Falk is all that has kept me from giving that terrible picture the (1) it deserves. (By the way, fidelity to Mr. Falk made me watch this movie from head to toe.) Even if you forgive all the gross mistakes, this was just the poorest excuse for a TV program. "Columbo" movie ever. I'm glad I saw it on TV for free. I hated having coughed the dollars for a print.
