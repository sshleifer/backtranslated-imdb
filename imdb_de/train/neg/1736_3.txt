Let me start by saying that I really liked Betty Grable, especially from "Down Argentine Way", but when she came to this catastrophe, she was also "round" and frankly the whole movie was embarrassing. With Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must have been pretty desperate) the story was bad, the colors good and the movie way too long. It had some old acquaintances like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to arouse interest, but to no avail. The music was miserable, and I have to say that not a single song was memorable in any way ... Since I was such a fan of Miss Grable, I always wished I had never seen that song!
