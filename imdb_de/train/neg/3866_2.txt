I thought, this movie would have absolutely no moral. I mean, how would you feel if your fiance left you for your cousin on your wedding day? I would be heartbroken !! It's classified as a comedy, but I did not find it funny at all. I thought it usually found cheap laughs and took them with me. I usually love Julie Stiles movies, but that's an exception. Jason Lee plays the lead role in another nefarious show, proving once again that class and good manners are not relevant in today's society. There was a lack of taste and I do not like such films. I understand that people are going to defend this movie, and it's moral, because it's "just a movie," but I keep saying that this bad behavior on the screen should not be allowed. I'm not trying to say that if you enjoyed this movie, you are a bad person, because everyone has their own opinion and parts of this movie were enjoyable. I'm just saying that people behave that way in real life. The characters in this movie were shameful.
