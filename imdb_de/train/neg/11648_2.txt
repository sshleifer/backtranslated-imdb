As if there were not enough of those floating around at the time, here's another lame GODFATHER clone of the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) I saw earlier this year. The brand name tied up at this time is Telly Savalas, who enters the procedure late and is first seen from behind, fighting for his flowers rather without a fight and wearing a French-style beret! Apart from the fact that he does not look a bit Sicilian, he has no other accent than his well-known charm. So Antonio Sabato makes for an unlikely gangster - besides being a resilient man; His relationship with Savalas, who in no time on his father's side is, is not convincing (especially since he later dealt romantically with his spirited young niece)! There is hardly anything to mention about a gangster movie, and none of it is memorable in any way (although the finale used in a clinic is handled well enough). In addition, the score of Francesco De Masi is usable, but nothing else. By the way: The bargain DVD rented by me starts in the middle of the end credits, so that none of the actors - or the movie title - is ever performed!
