I read the comment from Chris_m_grant from the United States. He wrote: "A fantastic documentary from 1924. This geography of early Iraq in the early 20th century was powerful." I would like to thank Chris and people who are interested in Bakhtiari Nomads of Iran, the Zagros Mountains and landscapes and saw the movie Grass, A Nation's Battle for Life. These traditions you've seen in the movie have lasted for centuries and will last as long as life goes on. I am myself from this region of Iran. I am a Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but the Bakhtiari region in Zardkuh is not in Iraq in Iran, as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different countries. Taking an Iranian for an Irankian is almost like being an American to a Mexican. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Ziba
