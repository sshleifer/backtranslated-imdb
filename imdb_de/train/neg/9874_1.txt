A fabulous book about a fox and his family doing what fox does. that is to steal from farms and kill prey. Until a trio of farmers decide to have enough of this fox, they try in various ways to "solve" the problem. Of course, they are "out foxed" in each round and while the trio camps at Foxhole, the family raids against the land of the three farmers. <br /> <br /> The "movie" version and I use the term film very loosely, is more of a god horrible pastiche of American predator films, especially the Oceans movies. They even have George Clooney as Mr. Fox to add the insult and completely overlook the point of the story. A big compliment to her. You will earn a lot of money and destroy another classic children's book by Roald Dahl.
