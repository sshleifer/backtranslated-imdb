Do you like to stand up? Then stay away from this ... <br /> <br /> In the first few rounds, there are actually good comics, but if they are not cute, they have a shot at snowballs. Any controversial material and you are OUT! ... and I think I hurt as much as the discarded comedians when I see who gets the crooked judges involved. <br /> <br /> 1 of my top 4 has made it further than the preliminary round. Half of the finalists laughed at me. Some of them have raised their material elsewhere, something the jury does not seem to have any problems with. <br /> <br /> It's more entertaining than many others on TV, but incredibly hard to look at without thinking what it could have been. <br /> <br /> If the producers changed the name of the competition to "Last Clown Standing", all my criticism of validity would be lost. Maybe an idea?
