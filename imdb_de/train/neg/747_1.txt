Finally, I thought someone would do justice to H.G. Wells's classic, not another version that plays in a wrong area or a wrong epoch, but one that is firmly based on the book. Well, it follows the book pretty much in any case, and that's the only benefit to this mess. <br /> <br /> This is 180 minutes (yes 3 hours), the book is only about 150 pages long. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines had the nerve to come here and say, "If you can make it better ...", I would say "Yes, I could" and I have never had one Video camera used or was with some kind of or drama school in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid good money to bring this crap from the US to the UK, do not make the same mistake as me.
