I try to imagine the pitch for Dark Angel. "I'm thinking of Matrix, I'm thinking of Bladerunner, I think those chicks who play Faith in Angel wear shiny black leather - or a woman like her who leaves them with us - just - understand that! - we do it's no action, dialogue, characters, decent action or budget, just a few loud bangs and a hot chick of shiny black leather sitting on a big, pulsing bike, right? "<br /> <br /> Flashy, flat , dreary, formulaic, dispassionate, boring, stupid, stupid, humorless, discouraging, hardly competent. Live action anime without action or even life. SF just as Joe Fanboy really likes it. :(
