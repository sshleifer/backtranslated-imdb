Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. It's the cream of the harvest, or s ***, if you're more cynical, as it ranks up (or down) with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones (Viva Rock Vegas). In fact, it could be even worse than these two, because these two made me laugh, at least for a time, because of their stupidity. This only made me constantly shudder and clap in pain as the credits began to roll. No other movie made me jump in pain. Now I'll point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly cruel. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is ridiculous. It's about a chip in a remote-controlled car (?!) That's out of place and how these terrorists want it. Nonsense. <br /> <br /> The action that follows is similar to that of the other two home alones with boobytraps and everything, but the execution of these boobytraps is not funny but uncomfortable to see. I did not even laugh (or even smile), but kept jerking, hoping the terrorists would nail the boy. The bird offered no funny relief and was not funny and annoying. <br /> <br /> The acting, as it is made of a number of names without a name, ranges from poor to terrible. There is no good performance here. As a child, Alex D. Linz is absolutely unlikely and listless while the terrorists are acting (and judging by their credentials) as they have been hijacked off the streets ... and now that's it. <br /> <br /> I can see some people saying, "Man, it's for the kids, do not leave it, man." Well, MAN, children like that, but they can get much better. Look at Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before you think about it. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (the suck - see the reviews for more) are better than that! <br /> <br /> In short: This is an irrevocably cruel movie. This was clearly recycled for the money as it almost completely demolishes the first two; the only thing is, it also offends the first two completely. No person, no child or any other reason should be found to be alone at home. It is so bad. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
