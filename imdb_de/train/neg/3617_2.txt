Really, really bad Slasher movie. A psychotic person escapes asylum. Three years later, he kills a sociology professor, the end of the scene. One semester yesterday (hey, as it says in the title card) is a new professor of sociology at the school. She makes friends with another professor of sociology who works there, and begins to go with another professor. The students are all bored, just like us. <br /> <br /> There are a number of title cards that show how much time has passed. The scenes are quite short and tailored to other characters, which leads to a small progress. Many scenes involve walking and speaking of the characters or sitting and speaking and have little purpose. Despite the time, many characters always wear the same clothes. Sometimes, the unclear process of time means, when we see a body for the second time, we ask ourselves: how long has this body been there? At least one of the dead does not seem to have been missed by others. The killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the chest, another by stabbing him in the crotch and another by cutting his forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The video box has a cheerleader: There are none in the movie. On the back is a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown threatening a group of women in a dorm. The central redhead in the photo is in the movie, but nobody wears such an outfit and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly one on one.
