I can not believe that I'm so angry after seeing that I want to write my first review on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is nothing more than a revamped Planet Earth-Lite. Now I knew this was advertised as "by the people you brought with Planet Earth," but I had no idea that they would use the same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary miniseries. I just paid $ 8.75 to see something I already own on DVD. Be ashamed of Disney for not alerting people to the fact that there is absolutely nothing original here (except for a James Earl Jones voice-over and 90 second sailfish that I do not believe was Planet Earth ) The biggest crime of all is that while Planet Earth uses the polar bear's tragic story as proof that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for environmental change, Disney has turned this story into family-friendly triplets. After the demise of the male polar bear, they show that his boys grew significantly a year later and throw garbage at how they are prepared to bear his memory and that the earth is truly a beautiful place. No mention of grown-up boys threatened by the same plight of their father, no warning of future generations from trouble if we do not get together, nothing. Just a compilation of things we've seen throughout the movie (and much more, if you're one of the billions of people who have already seen planet Earth). I have never left the theater feeling ashamed and cheated in my life.
