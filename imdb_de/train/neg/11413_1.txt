Seriously - avoid this movie at all costs. I just saw it in my first preview, and even though I paid non-refundable money for it, I left the cinema after only 15 minutes. That already includes 2 minutes of discussion between my friends, whether they want to go or not. For the first time, when I even came out of a movie. And I have experienced some pretty bad. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies that gets synced (and so badly) though it's shown in its original language. She relies on the oldest, simplest and cheapest jokes in the book. In the military ("What do we do when we reach the combat zone?" - "They get out and die", actually it's way more funny to read here, as it was shown in the movie), about drugs (A guy eats couple of "space biscuits," behaves really stupid and misses his wedding or has to go through it at high altitude - all written and acted badly), with women in the army ("Why are we only getting trumpets? We were promised." Weapons! "-" That's right, it stays that way ") ... Argh. Okay, you'll find these really funny, but in that case, you scare me seriously. <br /> <br /> Also, in the soft- Porn films you see on European late-night TV, seen better drama effects, so it had lame jokes (poorly delivered), above-average bad drama, lack of tempo, poorly dubbed and edited, it just did not work, at least not at some level, as the measure from serving for movies. <br /> <br /> I would even be so brave to say that this movie proves that there are people who can be much less funny, zan zee Germans. And that says something if you like stereotypes. (Which I do not, it's nice to play with them, just in case someone thinks I'm not enough PC.) <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, do something useful , Try to teach crocheting shrimp, to paint the toenails in a really irritating color, to disassemble the bicycle, to change some light bulbs, to understand Einstein's theories, to change into another religion and back - in fact, go to " Last Christmas "by Wham! repeat endlessly. Everything, but do not look at this horrible movie.
