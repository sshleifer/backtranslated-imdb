Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever made in British Columbia, it was also the worst that never saw daylight. The director is not even Canadian, but British, and boy shows it. We're all made into a bunch of overpriced dope fiends and idiots. The spirit of what it means to be Canadians is absent, and that is why we finance this berth. Of course, the British character is normal. The rest is a piece of sitcom stereotype - you can "norm !!" say? The cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to gloomy indoor silhouettes. The actors always seem to waver. Are you as bored as the viewer or is this the idea of ​​the director of the cinema? Avoid this mess and watch some Bruce Mcdonalds films. A true Canadian boy with something original that he can say cinematically. You will not be forced to leave HIS movies after 10 minutes.
