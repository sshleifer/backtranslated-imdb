This is without doubt the worst movie ever made. There is no dispute here. That's it. End of the story. The story is youthful and sub-moral and looks like it was created by a three-year-old, fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is just stupid. It is unimaginable how anyone could come up with something stupid and think it was entertaining. The jokes are also completely lame. If you have not seen this movie yet, you can count yourself lucky. If you are curious how bad this movie is, please do not let me describe it. Words can not express how terrible this movie is. Not only is it bad because it's a bad movie. Even these have cohesion, if not entertainment value. These. , , This is. , , Pooh! Think of the worst story ever told, and multiply its bad score by 5,000, and you're still not so close to how awful this movie is. After Pokemon has given the film a point, it seems to be a charity. That's how bad it is. Did the producers and directors even take film lessons? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. It looks like an amateur made this movie. If you have rented it, please take it back and request a refund. And do not think about renting it again.
