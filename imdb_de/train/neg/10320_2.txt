I really hoped that this would be a funny show given all the hype and clever preview clips. And when it comes to hype, I even heard an interview with the creator of the show on BBC World Today - a show aired around the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show does not nearly come to a standstill. All the jokes are obvious - the kind that sounds funny at first sight, but then seems lame - and they do not receive any new treatment or twist. All characters are one-dimensional. The acting is - mediocre (I am nice). It's the classic CBC recipe - one that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you're a Muslim, in my opinion, you have to be stupid to believe one of the white characters, and if you're white, you'd probably do it a bit offended that almost all white characters than bigoted, ignorant, or both. It's not that it's a problem to make fun of white people - most of the better comedies are rooted in it. It's just a problem if it's not funny - like in this show. <br /> <br /> Canada is full of funny people - so many that we regularly export to Hollywood. How come that the producers of this show could not find one?
