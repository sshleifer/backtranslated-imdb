Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and co-wrote the script for Aronofsky's film. This film succeeded on every level, providing an intimate and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the lives of the characters and the vices that destroyed them. "Last Exit To Brooklyn" still has the vice and the many characters that lead a sad life, but they hardly have the same justice as Aronofsky. <br /> <br /> The film sometimes seems ridiculously anti-gay. Especially if homosexuality in the movie means death. A gay figure is stoned, shot to the sky by a raging car, and ends up dead on the sidewalk. Another is crucified and more are simply beaten. Another over-the-top piece of shock, which would have been compelling if done well, are scenes in which the trade unionists literally struggle with the strike-breakers. Who would have thought that would offer a drama about Brooklyn's action sequences and truck explosions? <br /> <br /> The director Uli Edel has a skill level like that of a TV director, but is far behind the cut films. The movie is clunky and can not even focus on one genre. Lake gets a useless role a mannequin could have filled out, and Baldwin just seems to know how to look stupid in his equally skinny part. And then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as our main character, a disgusting whore called Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not kidding). Her performance is nothing special and the fate of her character is dirty, to say the least. Due to the inadequate use of colors and compositions it looks cheaper than it is and takes the "real" advantage of the more provocative places. An error.
