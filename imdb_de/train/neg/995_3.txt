Rosario Dawson stars as a girl raped by date, then begins a decency in the dark until he gets a chance for revenge. While it's clear why Dawson has taken the role, it's a chance to showcase her acting skills and make a small independent, very un-Hollywood movie. It is also clear that apart from a stunning appearance, Dawson seems out of place in the role. Forgive me, I just could not find her. That's not a mistake, that's how I felt, I had no idea where she was. Yeah, I know she's on the screen, but even though I spent most of two hours looking at her, she did not make an impression on me, whatever it is. I blame it on the script because, beyond the end, not much of the action on the screen seemed to have any real meaning. People seemed to be more attentive than real, and what happened did not seem to fit together. Forgive me for being vague, but nothing in this movie except the end (which I would like to talk about, but it would not cause it to ruin it), and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than a picture stayed with me. What can I say, this can click with you, it can not be, for me it is time that I can not come back. Only for Rosario Dawson fans. Be warned, there are several reasons why this is NC17. (And Rosario - please, you're a better actress, take better scripts)
