This move was on TV last night. I think as a time filler, because it sucked bad! The film is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the beginning and somewhere halfway. (Not bad tits and ass though). But history is too ridiculous for words. The "wolf," if you can call it that, is barely shown to the teeth. When it is completely in sight, you can see clearly that some interns have been working on the CGI because the wolf is walking as if he were running on a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like it was grown and shiny Film is full of blood and blood, and it's easy to see who's being killed / cut / eaten next. Even if you like these splatter movies, you will be disappointed, they did not do well. <br /> <br /> Do not even let me start with the actors ... Very hackneyed lines and The girls are screaming about every 5 seconds. But then, if somebody asked me if I should act badly, just to give me a few dollars, then, hey, where do I sign up?
