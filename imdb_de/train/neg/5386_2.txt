Although I'm one of the "stars" of this movie, this is not necessarily a wise insight, but I do know a great deal about what came first ... and what ended up on the screen. I remember that I saw the original cut of "Incoming Freshman" and was very pleased. It was funny, sexy, slippery, everything a drive-in movie needs. you have to remember that this was shot and released in front of everyone else ... animal stables, porkys etc ... so in his own words, this flip was really ahead of its time. For some reason, the film was passed on to the main distributors who cut out half of the original film, and then in (should I say "mixed") the most random scenes of all time. the fat guy, the goat-headed people .... what the hell was that ?! I'm sure it was used for extra T & A, but it was so slow that everything was going on before it came to a squeaking and painful stoppage. But all in all, it's a funny reminder for me ... especially because I can say that the worst movie I've ever seen is where I am!
