This was by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I'm an open-minded guy and I always love a good horror movie. In fact, when I'm renting movies, I'm looking for good, underrated horror movies. They are always good for a laugh, I think I know, I have seen many. But this movie was so awful that he was not worth the giggles. I thought about turning it off in the first five minutes ... which I probably should have. It's no good thing, in the first place, the camera crews suck A $. The intro was as stupid as the end. Acting and special effects were terrible. Please, I implore you, DO NOT watch this movie, you will absolutely hate him.
