This is the stupidest movie I've ever seen (spoilers in front of me)! At first, the plot is stupid. The little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the janitor. We find that the child has a gift, the "Shining". This gift has nothing to do with anything except to make the child look cool. Then the movie gets boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy. He rages to kill the boy and his wife because ... well, he feels like it. Why else would he do it? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the tub. The man kisses her and realizes that he kisses a dead corpse, which is absolutely disgusting. Somehow a black man comes to the hotel and is beaten with an ax. Then the boy and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father, who dies of hypothermia within a few minutes. Most movies are not a complete waste of time, but this falls directly into this category. The music is trashy, the characters are hackneyed (except Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the end is very predictable, the plot is slow, boring and boring. This movie is extremely overrated. AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COST. I am surprised that it received such a high rating from IMDb.
