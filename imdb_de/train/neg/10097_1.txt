I passed BB and picked up 4 zombie strips to watch the weekend. Well, I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the acting will be below average, and the sets will be suspicious. So I do not expect much. But it should have at least one story. Stories do not cost anything except time ... apparently they had no time. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies that appeared at the end of the movie all looked like new waves hookers. The image of the zombie on the front cover NEVER appears in the movie. It was absolutely painful to watch and had nothing to offer the genre. <br /> <br /> The duration is only 81 minutes, but feels like 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear the movie since she was in another room on the computer), that sounded like zombie porn .... which, if you think about it, sounds a bit disgusting, but it was not So even the good. <br /> <br /> The only suggestion I can make is that the author may have tried too many things and got into an incoherent confusion. <br /> <br /> free rental and I still feel torn off. I rated it 1 out of 10 because IMDb does not allow me to use decimals.
