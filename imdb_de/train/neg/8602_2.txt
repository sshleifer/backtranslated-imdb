All you really need to know about this movie comes after the opening scene where a man falls into a lake and gets eaten. Then they start rolling off the title credits: they see "Slugs!" in large letters, followed shortly afterwards by "The Movie". ANGRY! I was worried that I had accidentally set "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show". Anyway, the film deteriorates from there to a killfest. You see a guy who cut his hand off because he had snails in his gardening gloves, two people are attacked by snails during sex, and a girl who falls on her back in an underground passage is stung to death by killer strikes. It's a pretty stupid movie that's in the category "that's how bad it is". It's also so poorly recorded with such a grainy film that you are shocked to learn that it was made in 1988 (my guess was 1974). I am very surprised that it received such a high score as here because most people here do not give love to these films. But if you want a movie that wants to be scary, but in the end is ridiculous, this is one of your best candidates.
