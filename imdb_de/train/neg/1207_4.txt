Kim Basinger plays the lead role as Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband who gets into trouble as she makes last minute Christmas shopping at the local mall. After putting a hastily scribbled, hate-filled note on a sheet of paper and pasting the paper into the windshield of a car that has occupied two parking spaces, she learns that the owners of the car are the Rainbow Coilition of bad guys made of a white man There are Mexicans, a Chinese and a Black. They confront them for the news, cut off a helpless security guard and the persecution is underway. During the film, Della will hunt while unleashing her inner bronson. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a bit of a tense little thriller. The acting was good enough (apart from a few scenes, the "Why God Why" biting was worthy in its wickedness). However, it is reversed a bit because the villains that Della chases from / to are insanely stupid. If they did not have the intellect of a particular home-alone bathing dad, their eventual defeat might be something to exploit instead of the meh-reaction that it produces. The unbelievable factor that I would like to overlook, as both the director and one of the producers contributed to bringing "shoot em up" to the screen (a movie that threw credibility out the window was immensely fun ). Although this film never reached the height of this film, it was good in its own right. <br /> <br /> My degree: C- <br /> <br /> Anchor Bay DVD Extras: Commentary with author / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; a 25-minute "making-of"; a trailer and two TV commercials for this film; and Trailer for Lower Learning
