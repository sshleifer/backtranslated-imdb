How Irish critics rave about this movie, I can not understand. Overclocked by the usual group of Irish actors who were pulled out for every Irish movie. Terrible script, with forced character tastes (the brown sauce). The romanticizing of all this is bad about Dublin. The attitude of "ah, it's a garbage dump, but surely it's not great". Numerous titbits for the American audience (the supermarket boss and his awful compulsion) And the nail in the coffin was Colm Meaney's character. A great actor had to play this role that a five-year-old could have written. Kringeliges stuff. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's bad if you have to say that. Well, at least he did not use his terrible American accent. Be forewarned: stay at home and look at Snatch and Lock Stock. You will have a better time. Break is an outdoor area
