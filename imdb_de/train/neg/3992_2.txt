Director Spike Lee is famous for his films that point to racism. In many movies like Do The Right Thing, most whites are brutal racists. In this film, marriage between different races is the theme, with racism being the whole issue again. What Lee does, however, is once again to demonstrate his bigotry against Christianity. It's amazing what double standard there is in the film world. If Lee or anyone else ever made that kind of bias against another group, would he be vilified except Christians? Hey, it's "open season" for her. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, a reverend in this movie, shoots his son and then places the smoldering weapon on his bible. You enlarge the view for another close-up, just in case you missed it. Hey, guys, here's another Bible reader and see what it's like! Lee does that in almost every movie he does. <br /> <br /> He shows the same hatred when it comes to race relations. Who could argue that racism is evil? However, Lee immortalizes it in this movie as in his other films. His obvious bitterness towards whites does not help the situation. It just adds fire to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: start doing "the right thing" and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet: "Overcome it." <br /> <br /> That's too bad, because the subject could have made a movie thought-provoking when it came to objectivity and intelligence.
