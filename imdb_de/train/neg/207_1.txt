This movie is a 90 minute Ramones concert with short stupidities and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is that? <br /> <br /> If you are not a big Ramones fan, DO NOT waste and I repeat, DO NOT waste your time like me. This is completely unusual from beginning to end. This movie should be called Ramone Fever. Everyone seems to like them in this movie. There is no plot in this movie. When it comes to teenage comedies, scratch the bottom of the barrel with this one.
