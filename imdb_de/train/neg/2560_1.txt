Well, I was watching last night and the only thing that did not make it terrible is that it was straight ahead. There was no blow around the bush that this boy was the anti-Christian. The film, however, was written poorly. For example, they have never explained how they made the dentist's incident "an accident" or, in the end, how the policeman miraculously ended up in the house in time to rescue the child without the police being called , The death scenes were just very bad and not entertaining at all. The child they voted anti-Christin was boring and could have chosen a better child. Do not waste your time watching this.
