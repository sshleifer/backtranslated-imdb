I noticed that this film had the brunt of many insults. It probably deserves some, but it was not that bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this movie, he tried to tell a story. As a drama, this movie could actually work very well. I just think the filmmakers misjudged the way they should go when they did that (they should have added more funny pieces if they wanted a comedy). With a revision, it could have been a great movie. But as a satire, it did not work in its current form - many scenes did not fit into the context of the plot: for example, the robbery scene makes little sense in the story. Still, it was not the worst independent movie ever made - is it the worst in the top 10? That is controversial.
