I did not really expect much from "The Night Listener" and I never heard of it until I saw the cover in the video store. However, the movie is very effective when it comes to building up suspension and tension. Sometimes it pulls a little, but it actually helps to ask you what will happen and, more importantly, when. As the movie progresses, the character played by Robin Williams is drawn into a kind of "cat and mouse" game where he is obsessed with finding out the truth and existence of a 14-year-old abused child that nobody has ever seen in person , The Night Listener is an interesting story that's great when it comes to building the excitement throughout the movie, and you're pretty much in the dark about who's lying and what's real. In the end, it disappoints and does not meet the potential it could have. It does not give you a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character that would have been helpful and interesting.
