I did not like this Bill Murray vehicle when it first hit the market in the 1980s. So I tried again to see if my distaste for this movie was in my movie taste in the 80's or was it "Stripes" is just a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in and "Stripes" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Well, "Stripes" could have been an innovative comedy in the early '80s, and it may appeal to people who have undergone basic education or who are Bill Murray fans, but it's still a bad one Movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it bad? Mainly because "Stripes" is meant to be a comedy, but it's just not so funny. There are some laughs, but there are only a few. Most of the film is consumed by the dramatic plot, which is incredibly complicated and uninteresting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable when you're used to contemporary comedies like "Anchorman" that are laughing at every part of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" also suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Rami's lack of acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but at this point in his career, he was not a particularly compelling dramatic actor. Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough actors to carry the dramatic bow of the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedy in Stripes revolves around Bill Murray's self-centered, crafty Alec man-child character. If you do not find this character funny (as I did not), you will not find most of the little comedy in "Stripes" funny. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is a film of its time, it has not aged and is worth a look. If you want to watch a "Buddy" comedy of the early 80s, I would recommend "Stir Crazy". Like "Stripes", the humor in "Stir Crazy" is not as fast as it is in contemporary comedies, but unlike "Stripes", he has aged much better and is still seen.
