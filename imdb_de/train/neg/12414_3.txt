Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good game, showing very different siblings, but only Winningham can bring something convincing or essential to their role. Leigh, the bar-band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, is constantly relying on the older sister Georgia, a celebrated folk singer in the form of Joni Mitchell. Perhaps due to her dual duties as co-producer in the film, Leigh seems to have crept into a corner: She is not credible as a singer and, even if this is intentional, is spending too much time on the screen microphone. Leigh is probably hoping for a tour de force and is nervous and jagged. However, we just do not see any talent within this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that keep us from her). If Sadie had the slightest attraction or attraction, we might be able to get used to the idea that she gets the (small) breaks she does. The likelihood that she will ever come on stage is low. Director Ulu Grosbard creates some intense dramatic sequences, and editing the finale puts Sadie's bar performance together with Georgia's sold-out arena show - both sing the same song - and it's a sad moment, but ... what's that? Point? * 1/2 of ****
