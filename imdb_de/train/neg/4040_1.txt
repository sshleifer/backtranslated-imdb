I think I'm a bit snob when it comes to anything, and although the movie experience is better for explosions than for high drama, I also have a lot to do with films. <br /> <br /> Not all art films are better than King Kong. I would probably give Kong two stars, double the double pull of this movie. <br /> <br /> My guess is that people were so excited because it was almost identical to what you can see in a play. For the less demanding art fan, a movie that looks like a play is "great art." <br /> <br /> This movie was useless. <br /> <br /> There was hardly a story so it depended on high drama. The only drama in this movie was whether the cat would fall off the roof or not. So a deep and meaningful dialogue? Great actors? Barely. <br /> <br /> To be exaggeratedly fair, however, some scenes were interesting: communist apartments, city views (Petersburg?) and the Soviet trams that are still in operation.
