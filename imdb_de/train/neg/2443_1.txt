This is not just a bad movie, but one of the worst movies ever. It is so bad that I found it very pleasant. the acting, oh my god, the script, you must be kidding. How can you imagine the writer experiencing the following: - A kid making a firework at school, a firework so powerful that someone hit by it flies a hundred meters backwards and explodes. - A girl is trapped in the cellar, the murderer tries to break the door. She gets a drill, but the wire is not long enough. She first makes an extension cord, oh the horror, and when she's done, she drills through the door and pierces the murderer's head. WOW - and there are many more examples. oh yeah, and what happened to George Kennedy, he was great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool Hand Luke)
