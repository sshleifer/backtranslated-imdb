If you want to comment on movies that get the script halfway through the movie, this is the way to go. A setting and a spectacle like in a porno movie, but nothing happens, just touching and touching the third kind. What actually becomes boring after 45 minutes of petite Feely, but no action. Some of the actors I saw in real x movies were much better there. All the special effects are performed by the great "Rondo", who exercises all the magic in his head. On the box is a cult film. Does that mean that this movie should not be viewed at all? <br /> <br /> Get drunk with friends and watch this movie on New Year's Eve.
