Wow ... I can not believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3) really is. I had heard the rumors, read the reviews - but I had to make up my mind. Well, let me tell you - IT'S CLOSING !!! The worst spectacle of a movie ever made that had to be made in sync, while everyone involved was completely wasted, incapable and ridiculous, no discernible storyline, "cinematography" that looked like my granny had filmed it with her camcorder, gun props No joke - made of aluminum foil - the list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Three guys are stranded on an island where some crazy guys are running around with plastic and aluminum foil swords. Two of the prisoners are released along with a rebel of the Inselfreaks and get a day's head start before being chased by the rest of the "tribe" ... that's about it all ... <br /> <Honestly - this is one of the worst movies I have ever had. The budget was about $ 200 and was fully spent on the gore FX (which was not a bad idea ...). There is NOTHING to ZOMBIE DOOM, except uncompromising-looking Gore scenes with many terribly dubbed dialogues. This movie makes other no-budget trips such as PREMUTOS: LORD OF THE LIVING DEAD look like TITANIC. Some may classify ZD in the category "so-bad-its-good" - and I guess if you're really drunk or tall and look at it with some MST3K-style friends - I think it could be considered that way , But not for me. I hated everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally disgusting and included as a "bonus" in ZD's Shock-O-Rama release) is an indication of Andreas Schnaa's other works, then it should be forbidden to have anything to do with it with a film again and again under the death penalty. There's an amusing kung fu fight in the last half of the movie and lots of blood - so I give this a very generous 3/10 - Do yourself a favor and skip that.
