*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I previewed this movie, I thought there would be at least a somewhat admirable story. But as with most Superstation original movies, I was disappointed. This gullible family eventually drives through this "abandoned" city to slow down and find this video camera where these people do everything they do, and they find that they all disappear. The family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or shows what the devil is pursuing. There are more gaps than I can count and they do not explain what, how or what happens. It ends where the family gets into a car accident and is under stress or brainwashing or what (which is never explained). The next thing you know hopes they'll somehow find out how it all happened, but it ends up being completely confused.
