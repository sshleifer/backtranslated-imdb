Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of bad script and bad alignment. This is the case with "The Tomb of the Mummy". <br /> <br /> The script contains leftover ideas from older, better, universal horror movies like Dracula and Frankenstein. The direction is banal and stale. Acting is mediocre. Even Chaney's Kharis is weak compared to Tom Tyler's The Mummy's Hand, and the producers are stupid enough to add Christy Cabanne's much better prequel and show the weakness of her own movie! Realized how bad this movie was and made it two years later as "The Mummy's Ghost" with a much better script and a better director from scratch. The result was probably the best movie in their four films "Mummy", though it's not nearly as good as the original Karl Freund's from 1932's at best a 2nd. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably glad to see theirs Characters bounced off, so they did not have to appear in the dirt!
