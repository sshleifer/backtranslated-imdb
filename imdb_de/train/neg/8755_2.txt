This movie was awful, to say the least. I had hoped for much better after watching High School Musical. The entire movie was a complete rip-off of "The Simple Life", only it was not a reality show. Amanda Michalka had her moments when she was not so terrible. On the other hand, Alyson Michalka was bad all the way. Chris Gallinger, who played the love interest of Amanda, played a Frenchman, but had a terrible accent. A good thing in this movie was the totally adorable Michael Trevino, who played Alyson's love interest. Just to consider, if this movie had aired in front of "High School Musical", he probably would not have looked so bad. But it was not a comparison. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give a 2.
