Given the title and the unusual boxing art I was prepared for almost everything. Maybe my expectation was a bit too high, because I was a bit dry. <br /> <br /> A film crew working on a softcore sex film ends up in a strange house when they get lost in the movies and decide that the best way to spend the evening is sex. Where was this setup not used yet? The difference here is the overly perverse nature of sex. It is not allowed to show all goods (bars shots have long been illegal in Japan, what is shown is fogged). The film tries to show the viewer how unnatural sex can be. <br /> <In the midst of all the kinky events, a mud monster (whose origin I can not fathom) emerges and begins to murder the men and rape the women ... and then murder them as well. Some of the sights are a bit much, especially a woman whose gut has been pulled out by her vagina, or another woman who spits a sip of ... stuff, but otherwise the blood is pretty common. <br />> Ultimately, the film is torn off its own designs; It's too overpriced to be a tight horror picture and too cruel to work as a sex movie. The media can work, but there has to be a balance. <br /> <br /> 4/10
