This is an attempt by the writer Edgar Rice Burroughs and the filmmaker on an Arab "Tarzan the Monkey". However, this desert movie shows nothing of the majesty in Burroughs' successful jungle adventure. The focus is on the love between the handsome English noble Jon Hall (as "El 'Lion" Chatham) and the exotic Arabic beauty Kathleen Burke (as "Princess" Eulilah), where revenge coincides with their urge for fusion. The opening says that the boy's mother lives although she behaves inappropriately, but she never returns to the picture. Unfortunately, "The Lion Man" has deteriorated and it looks like the material is missing. <br /> *** The Lion Man (1936) John P. McCarthy - Jon Hall, Kathleen Burke, Ted Adams
