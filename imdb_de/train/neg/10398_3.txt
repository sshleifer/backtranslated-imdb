There is nothing wrong with a popcorn movie that keeps you off the street. It's just that some are better than others. This is very bad. The drama is terrible, the script dirty; and overestimated the special effects. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood treat the public with such contempt? And why did they do a sequel?
