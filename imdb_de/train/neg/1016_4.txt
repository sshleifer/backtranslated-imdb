The movie itself is not that bad; Many comments have pointed to the obvious flaws of the script, but it is visible. What really worries me, though, is that people like Justin Timberlake are even cast for movies and movies like this. I must admit that I had not heard the man's name before I looked at it, but the moment he showed up, I was just annoyed. The voice is crap, the face is a bad rub of Legolas, the attitude is terrible and he can not coordinate all three properly. I was happy when he jumped after leaving the disco because I hoped to be just Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey from then on. Too bad that I was wrong. These two, and also LL Cool J, are doing a very decent job and they are the main reason why I do this with a 4.
