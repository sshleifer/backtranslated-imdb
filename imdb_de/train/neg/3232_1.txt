This movie has no storyline, no character development and no budget. it's really shitty to be brief. Since there is no development for the film, it can not really be considered an artistic attempt or an explanation against torture. That leaves two other reasons to look at it. To be shocked or to get away like a sick little freak. Well, it is too short here too. The girl's reactions are just stupid. It's very easy to say that it's a fake (honestly, professional wrestling looks more realistic than the crap they want to get along with in this movie.) They throw up their innards, but they sleep for the most part of it, well it's kinda stupid, the only part that's really worthwhile is the end, when they are cut quickly from scene to scene, before the needle goes into her eye, but to be honest, the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly unreal, with the exception of the eye's film about torture, look at Hostel and Hostel 2. Not only do they both contain realistic violence, there is also a real action that attracts you and cares for the people, and the Tow movies work on a deeper level Issues like American fears of foreigners, questions of morality, testing how far a person can go, human instincts against civilization, and many other things They are also carefully written and contain good humor if the story is not focused on the theme of V Iolenz These are much better choices about this crap
