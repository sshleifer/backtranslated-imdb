We have been served - a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit, since I'm white and had no hands-on experience in the "competitive world of step dancing," I could not do that. Be an authority on this type of movie. On the other hand, I know a bad movie when I see it. <br /> <br /> And, boy, I just saw him. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Low Budget Vision Directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid ("A Touch of Pink"), "How She Move" tells how important it is to follow his dreams - even if they are Dreaming to listen to loud, irritating hip-hop music and in conversation, the average person would not understand whether he or she would have an international translator. <br /> <br /> I will try to give a small summary of the "conspiracy". First of all, there are two actors who look like LL Cool J and work in a car dealership in Toronto (the mecca of racial diversity), but still have time to dance eight hours a day. <br /> <br /> There are a few other people in this "crew", including a white guy and a man who looks like "Denzel Washington" in "Malcolm X." There are also two women in the film - one resembles Serena Williams and the other looks like Geraldine from the old "Flip Wilson Show". One of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all their classes on a drug addicted sibling. The other girl, a member of Salt N Pepa, is undoubtedly just not good. <br /> <br /> There's another guy who looks like Eddie Murphy's Buckwheat while another actor is a Huggy Bear knock-off. These guys are rival stage dancers. Obviously, this activity is very hard at the core and they all practice for the big "Step Monster" jam in Detroit. <br /> <br /> Since I could not understand 90 percent of the dialogue (maybe some subtitles would have been useful, like in a Bergman movie or a music video by Snow), it's hard to explain what happens, apart from many Quarrels, the Serena Williams girl (which, by the way, never smiles). Becoming a freelance stepper (moving from group to group), there are a few step dances and a lot of irritating hip-hop music. <br /> <br /> It's a typical story from rags to riches; Like "Rocky" with a really bad soundtrack, "Rudy" with annoying rap music in the background, "Cry Freedom" without the laugh. <br /> <br /> But why does a film - which could have had a major impact on the black public - have to contain drug addiction, bad parents, and a title that sounds like a freshman saying "How how." moved "? <br /> <br /> However, I was" moved "by this movie to leave the theater as soon as possible.
