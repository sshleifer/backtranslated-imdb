Spoiler <br /> <br /> Well, the one-line summary says it all. Melville's "Le Samurai" is the original and there are elements of "Leon". And they are better - much better! <br /> <br /> In "Samurai" Alain Delon is a lone warrior / professional killer holding a bird in the cage and stealing cars for his jobs (with so much tension in those scenes!). The end is exactly the same: The samurai seeks death in dignity and is shot with an empty weapon in his hand. The world has changed, he realizes and there is no room for the samurai. Delon does not kill as many people as the Ghost Dog. But I think Jarmusch liked "Leon" very much or even "Desperado" by Rodriguez. So he also added. And let me guess: the girl becomes a pro like Ghost Dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon")? <br /> <br /> So, what did Jarmusch think? Where is the unique, the original thought in this film? <br /> <br /> I can not tell where carbon (celluloid) copies should be made. <br /> <br /> A 4/10 review by Macaulay Connor
