How did Mike Hammer live in a penthouse with a GOLF BAG next to a large CRT TV and a smart fireplace in the corner? No, he'd knocked back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly-sprayed office, or in the stink of a lousy flop house in downtown Los Angeles, wiping the dry red crust and oil-smeared dirt off his face Spillane has certainly written paper cassettes, but how do you make it worse? Give a blank check to a desperate producer for believing that every Noir movie crap is sold at the box office, add some hot tomatoes, and generally offend the story by a retarded, drugged scriptwriter , that's how it goes!
