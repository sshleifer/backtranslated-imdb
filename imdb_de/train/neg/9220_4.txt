When the movie started, the first 4 minutes were like a travelogue from California. I was wondering if I mixed the tapes. Then I let out a sigh of relief when I saw Paul Thomas in a scene with pretty Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is worried about his behavior and hire him a tutor (Kay Parker). I could do without the animal, the robot role play or the incest aspects. There is a good sex scene between Byron and Parker, but it is not enough to save this movie
