A story of amazing disinterest kills "The Psychic" over and over again. The characters and plot are completely uninteresting (like Fulci's crazy camera work, which is usually a redeeming factor in his films), and there is no sense of suspense anywhere. It's filled to an unbearable level - in the end, you will not scream with excitement, but with boredom (and as I may, an uncontrollable fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves to be cast in a better movie. Fulci Gorehounds beware - in "The Psychic" just is not busy. <br /> <br /> 3/10
