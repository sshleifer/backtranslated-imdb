"Welcome to Collinwood" is a kind of disaster. Considering the people involved, it should have been a few times better. <br /> <br /> If you at least believe that things are getting better, you're probably going to cry. It's one of those movies that had potential, but was robbed of this potential thanks to a horrible script and a little bit of bad drama, not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary George Clooney character and the man who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss, but for I do not care so much that I do not even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The only salvation of the movie is the strange con vocabulary it introduces. I kept thinking about it as I saw more and more crimes. This is the only reason why I gave the movie a 3. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, needlessly offensive and highly unlikely. They are in a constant state of tormenting stress and they are all so irritating that I have celebrated their obstacles. They scream and swear. The dialogue is at best bland and insultingly stupid at its low points. <br /> <br /> I think Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are to blame. They should be tried for war crimes if someone really remembers this crap long enough to take care of it.
