The movie "Gung Ho!": The story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders was created in 1943 to improve the morale of the American people during the Second World War. It shows with the better way that the cinema can form propaganda body. The value of this film is just a collection and not an artistic one. In a propaganda film, it makes no sense to judge the direction and the actors. Watch this movie if you want to know how propaganda works in movies, or if you make fun of Robert Mitchum, who plays a minor role in the movie. If you want to see a movie for World War II, they are much better and more objective. I rated it 4/10.
