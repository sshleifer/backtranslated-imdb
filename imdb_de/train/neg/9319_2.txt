I do not know what you're talking about when I saw this movie with two of my friends for the first time, we could not stop crying. This is one of the funniest shit I've ever seen. This comment on the porn is correct, but hahahaha. <br /> <br /> Yes, this film is actually the worst, but it brought tears to my eyes because of the false figures, the bad dialogue and the acting. Not to mention the expensive cameras with which they were filmed?! It looks like one of those movies from my drivers. Class. The props look like they came out of a high school drama show. The music sounds like an original Nintendo system game. The only thing that worried me was that there was a killer clown who did not sneak up on fat, lurking clowns. hahaha, if anyone ever looks at this, he has to look for verbal mistakes by the actors, such as words and facial expressions. hahahaha I died. <br /> <br /> SUSAN
