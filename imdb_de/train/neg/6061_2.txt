This episode of Masters of Horror was terrible. Apparently, Mr. Carpenter has to learn a thing or two about the pace and decent, plausible dialogue. There were times when I literally yelled at the TV that something was going to happen. Maybe he thinks he's building up tension, but Carpenter has to cut back the exaggerated, oversimplified music score of his (or his son's) and push the action a bit. How many times did the girl say, "Oh no, I can not get this baby!" and "Oh, no, here it comes"? Carpenter takes elements from much better movies (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and throws them here as if we were recognizing and honoring his branding style. What is missing here is real tension and energy. It's like slumbering through the process of filming. <br /> <br /> For better Carpenter movies, stick to the time-tested classics - The Thing, Halloween and They Live. To learn better masters of horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer, and Dreams in the Witch House.
