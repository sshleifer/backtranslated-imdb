As far as I can understand, TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. I doubt if this is the work of a normal man who happens to love movies, or if this is the work of a theatrical student, since the credits include a reference to the Oporto School of Arts. <br /> <br /> Director Ricardo Pinho, however, demonstrates with this film the total ignorance of some basic notions of cinema. What is a movie? How do you tell a story? That does not matter to the new director. The first thing you learn at school when you learn cinema is how to tell a story. You learn, as in novels, in movies, you should also build your story in three acts: Introduction, Development and Conclusion. They learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax. You learn, this is true for a 3-hour epic, for the regular movie, for a short film, and even for a 30-second commercial, believe it or not. You also find that your approach to the academic structure can be subtle, and ultimately you can even deconstruct it. <br /> <br /> Broadly, TIM WATCHER shows us his main character and then the movie ends - the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in Jeune's AMÉLIE. There is no second or third act in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an art film, so you can not even try to justify disregard for the academic structure. They expect to be told a story, and it does not happen. Worst of all, TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning. and one without real purpose. It makes no point or at least no valid point. Their meaning is childish and vindictive. The situations presented are absolutely simple and the approach is designed for Manichaea. <br /> <br /> I expected a lot more from this short film. The movie starts with a pretty good-looking credits sequence and you quickly realize that you're seeing something with better production values ​​than the regular Portuguese short film. I do not know the budget for this film, but judging the credits in the credits, earning merit on the production team needs to build such good connections in a country where it's difficult to open doors for young filmmakers. <Br /> <br /> TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style, color and carefully selected plans, combined with a fine score. That's all. There is nothing else. There is no conspiracy. And that's a pity, because it feels like a waste of production values. Hardly any of the many Portuguese short films show such a variety of locations and so many extras available to enrich a story. <br /> <br /> As absurd as the comparison may sound, I must cite the BMW shorts as a good example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film that relies heavily on product placement and superior, stylish cinematography is.
