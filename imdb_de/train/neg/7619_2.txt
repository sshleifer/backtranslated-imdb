As a fan of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can withstand any movie that can be imposed on me, but there is no reason for that. <br /> <br /> Rated "Super Action" in the blockbuster video section the dreaded "Restricted Viewing Sticker" I assume these are the only methods the filmmaker (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4.50 from an unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> Pity about you, Robert Napton! Be ashamed of the exploitation of these poor Mexican actors, who have probably promised you hope to grow up in American cinema. You are a shame! <br /> <br /> There is no moment in this movie that contains the least action. Did you use snot on these people? Oh, look, they have a rave in a field! Like all 6 of them. And is not that an Asian in the background? Why is it always during the day? Why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show anything ... and more importantly, why did we look at the other 1/2? PS: You owe me 4.50.
