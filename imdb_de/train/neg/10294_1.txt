Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Then characters without personality will not develop. <br /> <br /> Then the end never comes, because there is no beginning and no middle. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful shots that are not made nicely because they are not even allowed because this movie is not even there. There is no "is" in this film because there is no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialogue or point. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: It has a good soundtrack. But the sound editing is like that and the movie is so that the reputation is not even worth your time. So if you are really interested I would suggest buying the soundtrack or something. You get everything you can get from this movie without fatigue, headaches and impatience. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
