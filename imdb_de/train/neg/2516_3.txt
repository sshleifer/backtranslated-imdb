Unfortunately, I do not remember the book, but I remember being fascinated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This film represents a typical German production of low quality. This does not catch my attention - though the story itself is good, it is badly attacked. At the heart of misery are the characters who are too simple and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well-known and popular German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Ares can not save this poor spectacle. However, there is hope ... I was told that the following movies are getting better and better. Finally, I have to say that this film does not deserve the big screen, but is enough for a lazy afternoon.
