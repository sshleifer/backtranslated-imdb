I've seen this on cable recently and I kind of liked it. I've read the comments here and it seems everyone likes the second half more than the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (too bad it was not expanded.) The second story, I thought, was a clich√©. And the "California Dreaming" when I hear it again ... Chungking Express is fine, but it's not something that captivates the mainstream crowd, like "Crouching Tiger."
