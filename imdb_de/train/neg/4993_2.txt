I wanted to see this movie and expected an action movie that was still very disappointed. The opening scene promised a little action with a hint of comedy. It keeps you addicted for the first half, until you expect it to be time for the action to begin. Well, nothing like that happens. The movie moves and the end just brings you to a point where you get annoyed. What did the director think? Did not make sense. The film was missing in every way, had no real plot, and seemed very hollow, even if "Rambo" was in it, I do not think it would have helped the rating at all. There is simply no logic for the movie. A perfect way to waste time and money. By far the most irritating movie I've ever seen, and I'm sure there will be others who have the same point of view after they've gone through it. Definitely not for people who still have a little film feeling.
