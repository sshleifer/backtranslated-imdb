I saw this movie at the Rotterdam Festival, probably all the other voters. The director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and was very committed to the project, which in my opinion explains the above-average reception and the result achieved. It's most similar to a feature-length episode of Aussie Kids' favorite "Round the Twist," but it takes itself too seriously to have that redeeming function of its own. The movie itself may be worth watching if you're trying to make a cinematic world tour in all UN member states, as I can not imagine another Fijian movie, but overall it was generic, badly played (albeit by an amateur cast) , and fall victim to the subaltern mentality. The moral of the story seemed to be that domestic islanders will try to shit each other, but as long as a substantially decent white governor steps in, all the problems can be solved (by leaving the island).
