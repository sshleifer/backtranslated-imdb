This was a complete disappointment. Acting is not bad, but the production was just so bad that sometimes I felt like she had to quit, but unfortunately I did it and was able to finish the whole poor movie a bit embarrassingly. It's OK. if you o.k. with kitschy moral acts and it does not matter to watch a movie that has completely misunderstood Whitman. If you want a cheesy fictional story, go for it.
