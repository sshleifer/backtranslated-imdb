Visually clear, plot less, incredibly stunning garbage. Not even near Greenaway's better work. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> The overlapping "split-screen" effects are nothing but confusing, the film is very dark for a long time and the "artistic" composition is extremely demanding. There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film; Even nudity is unbelievably unexceptional, and filling in a lot of the film soon gets boring. <br/> <br /> Also, I can say that the show of Ewen MacGregor is brilliant. He showed more skills in the Star Wars series, and that says something. <br /> <br /> I was not so impressed with a movie since I saw "Darby O'Gill and the Little People"!
