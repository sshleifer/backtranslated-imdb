If he wanted to be specific, he should have picked some Frisco aborigines and not a group of New York actors who do not know about Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I spent all my life in SF, and people here do not talk and act like these actors. Everything was over-dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the bay was JT the Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper. Not a shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats here (ie his Warriors jersey). Not once did I notice anyone wearing Giants or 9's gear; Instead, he fit them into some cheesy SF or Oakland jerseys that are not even sold here. HP has no bowling alleys. Black and Asian gangbangers wear NO head or bracelets with the colors of Africa or China's Olympic team. Also, no Chinese gangster wears a Yao Ming jersey and tries to shoot black tires while shooting. While a significant yuppie community has entered the mission, only one white guy and a self-proclaimed "100% West Coast Boriqua" have been shown. This is NOT New York! The Puerto Ricans here are few and far between, and the Latinos in the mission are very different from the ONE shown here, which was undoubtedly from NY. HP is not the only black neighborhood in town. A close-up would have shown the drama between HP sets in their own hood as well as against Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview and so on. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been much better if Lee had done more homework and had a better plot to work with.
