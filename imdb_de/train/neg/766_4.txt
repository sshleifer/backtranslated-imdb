Whenever a Columbo story deviates from the well-known conspiracy (colorful murderers commit crimes, Columbo smokes murderers, Columbo becomes a pest), the authors can never reach the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This episode deviates in extreme cases and the result is a big flop. <br /> <br /> Would you believe: Columbo never faces the villain to the end? !! Honestly, I was tempted to turn it off two-thirds. Oh, the sacrifices we make self-appointed appraisers are !!!
