My family and I scanned Underdog the night before. And as bad as Underdog is (my four-year-old loved it), Hot Rod makes it look like Oscar-worthy stuff. The only thing that could have saved this film would be if Evel himself had retired to hit Samberg in the face because he made that movie. However, I agree that the soundtrack was good. I was not sure if the movie was shot in the 80s, but most of the music comes from Europe. Who knows. If I were you, I would take a pass. Just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local TV station. Or when you're ready to look at it, people under the influence may enjoy it.
