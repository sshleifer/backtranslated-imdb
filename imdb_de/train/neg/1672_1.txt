This is the only movie I've ever seen that made me write a review on any website, and that's a significant statement from someone who likes The Monster monster attack. This movie is perfect for anyone who wants a harmless movie. For example, it is free of sex and violence. I think this movie is safe for kids of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained, challenged, or stimulated in any way. Adults can easily sleep in front of the TV while the kids watch this movie. Do not be surprised when you wake up and find that the kids turned off the TV and started a board game. As an adult who likes to be entertained, who enjoys everything from the everyday to the fantastic in realism, drama, comedy and action, all the adults who reflect and / or stimulate the real life on Earth, this movie has nothing to offer offer offer.
