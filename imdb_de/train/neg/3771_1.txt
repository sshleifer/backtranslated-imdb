This must be one of the worst films of the nineties. When my friends and I saw this movie (the target group it was aimed at), we just sat and watched the first half hour with our pines touching the ground, how bad it really was. The rest of the time, everyone else in the theater just started talking to each other, or retreating in their popcorn or crying that they were actually paying the money they deserved to see that weak apology for a movie. It must have looked like a great idea on paper, but on film, it looks like nobody in the movie has any idea what's going on. Crap work, dung costumes. I can not understand how embarrassing that is. Save an hour and a little bit of your life .........
