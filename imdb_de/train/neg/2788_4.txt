Much has been written about Purple Rain, the seeming "Quin Essential" musician biofilm. But I want to tell you that the movie does not deserve much praise. <br /> <br /> First of all, Straight Prince is a great musician, and in this area Purple Rain excels in music. Even the score is intriguing, and if this movie was shot only as a concert film, it would be a great experience. Unfortunately, this is not the case and therefore the film has some problems. <br /> <br /> First, the horrible drama / character, Prince's character "The Kid", is supposed to turn out to be a kind of mysterious loner of a few words, which unfortunately just seems stupid and restless. A good loner character should have at least some talkative moments, unfortunately, Prince's character rarely has a few dialogue words in the movie and it's hard to believe he would get the girl that way. Everything seems to be just a little bit here, which is a pity, because it can be said that this is a character who gets into a terrible conflict and lives a very complicated life, but we are never allowed inside. <br /> <br /> A surprising aspect of this movie is how much of it takes place in concert. The lives of Prince and Morris seem to be losing themselves behind the performances, which probably makes sense from a business perspective, but it's exhausting to have a 2-hour movie in which half of them seem to play on stage, especially when the Behind stories of the characters come So, to summarize. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is not a very good movie.
