A remake of the great film of the play from 1972, in which he called Caine as a nemesis of his character from the first film. But nothing more beautiful. <br /> <br /> A sub-parr performance by actors Law and Caine, which is further diluted by a weak, complacent direction. The warmth of The Original setting is abandoned for a super modern home setting. The subtle interplay between Oliver and Caine, which made the first movie so worth seeing, is replaced by a terrible, bold arrogance that instantly causes contempt for the viewer. However, this is not the clever back and forth, if you like the one and the other character of the original so well that this is an obvious OTT character assassination on both characters from the beginning of Sleuth is not really worth seeing, look the original film and let yourself be dazzled by the opening act.
