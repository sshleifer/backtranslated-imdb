Boy, what a shit. But it only takes an hour and I've just paid a price for it, so I live ... unlike the entire cast of this 1933-clunk, which is now all dust. <br /> <br /> So a small village begins to show up bodies that have lost all their blood. The local yokes, of course, talk about vampires and a little louder after each body is found. The city sheriff or the cop or whatever he is, played by the great actor Melvyn Douglas, tries to tell them differently. When he mentions the fact that the dead on each side of his neck have a big hole instead of two holes close to each other, the locals simply say The constable insists there are no vampires, and it must be a human offender who does not Kills. <br /> <br /> But Melvyn does not seem to care in any way. He spends most of his time trying to get into his cute baby's underwear, played by Faye Wray. Also in this mix is ​​the urban simpleton, played by Dwight Frye, who played the same role in every movie to have. He freaks out the townspeople by catching bats and drinking his own blood.Lionel Atwill plays the city doctor, who seems to be trying to help the policeman solve the crime. And the boy does it He always stinks as an actor. Will is as close as possible to Pappe in this role. And Lionel Barrymore is in this as well. Many big names are such a bunch of guano. <br /> <Unlike the terrible title of this movie, the alternative name "The Blood Sucker" is much better, this movie is also boring and flat and just stupid. <br /> <br /> For me the intoxication The point of the film is to look at Frye, he nails the crazy city weirdo, but apart from him, this movie did not offer much. And then, when you find out the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect that all this blood required you I will really be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi made a lot of horrible pictures, but at least he was fun and interesting to see this movie as a really bad Lugosi clunker WITHOUT Lugosi and you get a sense of how miserably bad this one is Was messed up. <br /> <br /> If you can not make a good horror movie of the 1930s, you have to at least lupe it.
