The movie was shit, it was not funny, it was not exciting. They tried to make it so bad that it would be good, but failed. I think it's cool to like this movie in addition to the hype. This is the only reason this film is a success. This film seems to me quite worrying. Either the film goes public or this vote is unrealistic, which can have many causes and should be treated. Anyway, it's a below-average movie that flourished through word of mouth advertising. Their success can only be described as a marketing miracle.
