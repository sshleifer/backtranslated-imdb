What a waste of time and money! My husband and I saw this movie - after seeing the previews and thinking it could be "funny". NOT CORRECT! This movie is about 90 minutes too long. The actors are trapped in a poorly written script and can not come out. The jokes are weak and tired, and if you do not even see Wilson's bare ass, you can redeem any part of this movie. The special effects ... are not. I had half expected the harness and wires to hold Uma in their flying scenes. And when the effects that people did not seem to be able to do faster than the superhero's fastest bullets or battle scenes, they covered everything with a swirling blur of blurry screens - hiding the awful effects pretty well. Wilson's buddy was a lame excuse for a man, and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his colleague in the office. The sex scenes were not sexy and the funny scenes were not funny. I expected too much from these actors. None of the characters was really likable, so I did not care about a flying fig. The only memorable performances were the kids playing Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least they had some chemistry. Overall a great Stinko movie - I would not even recommend it as a pawnshop - it would still be a waste of money!
