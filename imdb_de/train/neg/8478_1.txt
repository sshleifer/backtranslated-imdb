This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life. The drama was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not show any angry feelings. At the beginning of the film, she should be discouraged. Instead, she raised her head, her lower lip outstretched. She sobbed miserably without tears for the crying scene. I was almost angry that they had to pick them from all the girls who became actresses. Everyone else also suffered from excessive action. It was really annoying. It was also an insult to figure skaters. It took Jordan a month to train, and they gave her as a person making up the Olympic team. It is practically the effort that real figure skaters put into their work. A pathetic apology for a movie and a pitiful attempt to combine hockey and skating. Do not waste your life. It does not even deserve a star.
