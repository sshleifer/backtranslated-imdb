That was about 80 minutes half unexpected boredom. At first I wondered how it is possible to produce something like that. When I reached the 70th minute, I convinced myself that there were only a few minutes left, and I took to the end, which I'm somehow proud of when I see the movie as a great test of patience and consider the tolerance of man. Is it worth it to watch? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, give it a try and if you're strong enough, you can even endure to the end ... The film is not consistent and the characters seem to have no common sense all , Anything in the movie you can be sure you've seen somewhere before, and they seem to be in this movie just to fill the movie roll.
