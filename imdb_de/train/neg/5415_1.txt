Dil was a memorable movie that turned a great director like Indra Kumar into a celluloid. The film was followed by Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti, all of whom were outstanding. <br /> <br /> But then every successful director also gives some horrible movies and some hits. Pyare Mohan is one such movie. <br /> <br /> Although the comedies are neatly told, they do not make the viewer laugh. Compared to the kind of comedy films that are made today, this is a stupid one. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, do not look at it. Because the pathetic comedy will only make you cry. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is worth a visit.
