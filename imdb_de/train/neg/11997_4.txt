This movie has many drawbacks and that's all I could see. it is painfully long and terribly strained. I could see that the entire audience was getting impatient and waiting for it to end. Runtime is well over 3 hours, which could be worked in less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Transition between stories is average. Most people admitted to being in the seats and expected something better to come out. <br /> <br /> It's just funny in your pockets. ambitious project and a below average execution. govinda does a fair job, anil kapoor has disappointed me, we rest as expected. If we expect something near Babel or love, it is not close.
