When I saw this last night, I was stunned that Fox spent so much money on it and paid back so little for their investment. It's the kind of disaster one must have seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Raquel Welch was dusted off the shelf the first morning of filming in front of her fireplace to prepare a place for the Academy Award would certainly win for this boldly original movie. Oops. That's not what happened. <br /> <br /> The bouts on set were detailed by Rex Reed in print, and this helped the movie gain a reputation before it was even released. When it was finally released, there was not the usual three-ring circus of advertising. If I remember correctly, it opened in Houston on drive-ins and cinemas in the neighborhood and never played any of the big venues. <br /> <br /> I have the lead manager Michael Sarne, who was hot after directing (that's not so good) JOANNA, a film about young people in Swing Mod London. <br /> <br /> If I recall correctly, Fox fired him and put the film to good effect. That's why scenes do not play in any particular order and characters appear and then disappear. An impressive cast (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) is wasted with nothing to do. <br /> <br /> To extend it to length, there are numerous clips from Fox films starring such as Carmen Miranda (in amazing movies from THE GANG'S ALL HERE) and Laurel and Hardy, who have never dreamed of being in to play a movie rated X. <br /> <br /> The X rating is based on occasional sexual perversions; However, none of the figures seems to have fun. Maybe someone involved with the movie had a puzzled Puritan sensibility and thought that if you could make these things look ugly, it would not be bad to take advantage of them. <br /> <br /> This was one of the "youth pictures" that were almost bankrupt Hollywood in the 70s. One author joked that EASY RIDER (meant to change bags) was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed that tried in the worst possible way to double their success. Sixty-year-old directors, such as Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger, made films like RPM and SKIDOO to attract a young crowd. White directors and writers tried to make films to attract a black audience. These movies are locked up somewhere in a vault, and as far as I know, the two mentioned and many others from this genre have never seen home video or cable. They are the deep, dark secret of the studios. <br /> <br /> The performance of Raquel Welch is very good overall. With the right guidance and script, she could play the kind of sassy, ​​liberated women Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specialized in. She looks great and has fantastic costumes. Mae West is the liveliest actress I have ever met. On the one hand, it's kind of heartbreaking to see her try to capture her glory from before, but I'm sure she needed the money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big budget with X-rating Check out BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE PUPPEN (also from Fox), because he does not take himself seriously. These are crazy kids playing in a big studio with the equipment. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE tries to say something. There was simply nobody who wanted to hear.
