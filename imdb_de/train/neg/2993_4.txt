I thought Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was a pretty good horror movie. When a terrorist's body stolen by a stolen chemical is salvaged by the US military, the body is cremated and the virus is released into the atmosphere over a small island. Soon, the infected locals turn into meat-hungry zombies, and a group of abandoned soldiers have to band together with a group of tourists and board an abandoned hotel to fight the aggressive living dead. I did not find this movie as good as the original Zombie Flesh Eaters movie. But it was still an OK horror movie with good action. I did not think it was one of the best in the series. 4.10
