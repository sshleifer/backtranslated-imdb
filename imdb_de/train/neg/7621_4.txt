As mentioned earlier, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently as "You've Got Mail," with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. Of the different versions, this is my least favorite. The problem I think is that the studio circled on the stars charisma, which is not very noticeable here. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two ladders never stops in this movie. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of one-day donuts, pleasant but bland. And if the leads are boring, the rest of the movie can only follow. Especially Judy is disappointing. She looks like she has no neck! I do not know if she had any pain issues or anything, but she looks like a turtle trying to pull her head into the shell, all pulled together and everything. I could not understand what Van Johnson was talking about. I would have made a bee chain for this cute violin player. And Van was not that great. I've always considered him a rather generic Hollywood man, and he's doing nothing to dispel that image here. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the stars or the early 1900s, then you may like this movie. However, there are many more entertaining romantic comedies, and they offer you much more than just a sip of stale candy.
