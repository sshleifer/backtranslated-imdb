After reading the book, which was very important to me, the film did not give me any of the feeling the book had conveyed. I wonder if Kaufman really liked this book because it made it successful. Either that or he is just bad. Most importantly, where is the ease ?! In the first scene, the music drowns most of the dialogue and emotion, and this continues throughout the movie. I think the creators thought that if the story goes through the film, it will bring a slight boost, but they have failed completely. Instead, the music creates everything that feels like a movie, in a way that dramatizes events so that we get involved with them, so that everything feels really heavy Decorate the plot to make it more dramatic. In the movie we see Franz walking past Tomas, who is on his way to Sabina. The introduction of this random meeting / passing which has not happened in the book gives Tomas' story more meaning than makes it easy. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples where the continuity of The story has been changed, imo for the worst, but this may have been done because the book just is not well converted into a movie like Kunderas does Style is. Therefore, we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site have written with their book AND movie experience, not just writing about the movie. A movie that is as long as it is. For those who have not read the book, I recommend reading it easily. For those who have done this, I have to say that you will only waste your time and will probably end up here to clear similar warnings.
