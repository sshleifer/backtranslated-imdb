As an ordinary movie watcher, I can not say that I enjoyed watching this movie. It is not too emotional for a drama, not too exciting for a thriller, not too fast for an action. In addition, some moments of the film are hardly credible. OK, I understand, soldiers are a bit out of their heads, but it's hard to believe that someone would risk their lives, Carjack in the middle of a hostile city and after a professor's wife yelled at him without asking a question (right ). It would be terribly romantic if it was an animation or something, but it should be a serious movie about war. It takes considerable work. <br /> <br /> It feels as if the filmmakers wanted to create a picture of an emotional, brave soldier, but all these "curves" of his psychology are simply unnatural. > This picture left a question in my mind: WHY? Why did you give him an Oscar? Why six? And in my opinion, it's the most exciting part of the movie :)
