If you go into this movie, you know that this movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible madman. So you immediately suspect who will live and who will die. The survivors are at the end exactly what you expect them to be, so there are no points for plot rotations. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure if this is a B-movie or a movie, that's just it. William Devane plays in a lab with a gripping story and plays a role: immediate Movie status. <br /> <br /> The movie is promising in the beginning. In the lab, we get to know the invisible gorilla, which becomes increasingly violent. Oooh, premonition. The best scene in the entire movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effects. The same is true if they make Bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> There are a few bare breasts, a really lame, dirty joke and enough out of place to give this movie an R rating he really did not need. <br /> <br /> There were no surprises for a thriller, except when Shue makes MacGyver in the freezer, which is more of a "Whaaaa?" OK, there is a surprise. Then Caine (Bacon) comes one last time into the elevator shaft. It was a surprise, but only because you are screaming on TV: "No! You are already dead! Finish the movie! 'Speaking of screaming at the TV, that's all I've done in the last 25 minutes. "Put on your f @ @ ing glasses!" Instead of placing their infrared goggles so that they can see him, they try every other trick in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). <br /> <br /> History has really lost in the end. But the special effects were good; That's the only reason why I give him a 2/10.
