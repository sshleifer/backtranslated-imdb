Life! Yes, but not kicked. <br /> <br /> True story: Some time ago, a Dutch TV station announced the announcement to broadcast a new reality show. A competition rather. The main participant in this show would be a woman who died of something terrible, and she would donate her kidneys to a happy person with progressive kidney failure. For really. <br /> <br /> The country and the international media have been like flying on a dunghill all over this story. They said it was horrible, immoral, what is this world coming and all. In a way, I had to agree. <br /> <br /> As the months passed, the tension became so great that the government was mainly concerned with whether or not they should run this show. Instead of governing the country. <br /> <br /> The show aired and until the last moment when they thrust forward. And until the last moment the country was in arms, the Prime Minister made speeches, every newspaper wrote about it, everyone in the country held their breath. And the network has evolved. On the way to a new frontier on TV. And that is exactly what they have succeeded in any case. They pressed the envelope. <br /> <br /> The show aired and we all watched as a terminally ill woman picked the right candidate for her kidneys so that he or she would live while dying shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> And then, in the last moments of the show, it was shown that it was a partial dizziness. The woman was not ill, but all candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The whole show, which was a public stunt with the advertising and commercials and all the discussions that had been building up to a fantastic climax for months, was a public stunt to raise awareness about the problem of the large shortage of organ donors. The man who founded this network died of kidney disease. Now it's the TV. Astonished, leave everyone far behind. <br /> <br /> Do not give me a badly working, badly directed film about a woman trying to get a Russian roulette show on American television. <br /> <br /> As if. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * As if I would believe they would get it through the FCC. As if I believe that this would be done on the basis of free speech by the US Supreme Court. As if I would believe the ridiculous ending where this woman made it and has conscience problems because a guy turned on air. <br /> <br /> Everything has been done before. See Running Man with Arnold instead. At least it had a reasonably good end. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * This is an incredibly bad movie, along with a ridiculous ending. In the end, she is shot. Should the film feel better in public when we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice? Do not take my word for it, but I would say that: leave this alone and look at a test pattern instead, you will get more quality.
