I have a copy of it on VHS, I think they (the TV stations) should play this every year for the next twenty years. So we do not forget what was and that we remember not to make the same mistakes again. For example, putting some people in the director's chair where they do not belong. This film Rappin 'is like a Vaudevillian musical for those who can not sing or act. This movie is as much fun as trying to teach the blind to drive a city bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood, (Peebles) just got out of jail and returned to the old neighborhood. Of course, in the time of an all-to-nice crime of necessity. John goes back to the old street and is greeted by children's dogs, old ladies and his colleagues as they dance and sing all the way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this if I was sentimental or in truth Someone smoked a medical pot that was prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. Either way, this is a poorly directed, played, acting and even produced satire (ghost life with the 'Hood'). I think the redeeming part of the story, through the would-be gang fight sequences and dance numbers, his friends worry about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from demolition and cleaning. <br /> <br /> Forget about Sonny Spoon, for which Mario could have won an Oscar in comparison to this rap. If you want to imagine stupid and three quarters embarrassed, you should definitely drink first. <br /> <br /> And please take care of it responsibly. (No stars, good luck next time!)
