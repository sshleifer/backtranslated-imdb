*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "goodness" of this movie - the useful play by Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the drama is terrible (this is not supported by the horrible script). The worst culprit is the villain Buntao, the head of an Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I laughed my head as he expressed his "rage" about losing a lot of money; terrible performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and his line "It's a Hostile Takeover" (that's the rest of the title of this movie) has been delivered as badly as it could be. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actress is different in this movie. We come next to the plot. Here's what you need to know: Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a downtown teacher in the original Rage and Honor. Now she is a C.I.A. Agent (or was it another government agency - sorry, but this movie was so bad that I can not remember it). Hmmm ... I can imagine what this C.I.A. Application process was like. Interviewer: What professional experience have you had in the past? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Okay; you are set! I only give it a "2" because in the end a decent spectacle and a nice twist of the plot (though we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the secret villain, gets caught).
