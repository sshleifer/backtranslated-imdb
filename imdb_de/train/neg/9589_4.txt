This movie is terrible if you pay attention. It's a perfect movie when you see only the colorful images dancing on the screen - each with no apparent connection to the next. I rented this movie because I'm a David Bowie fan and love musicals. In the end, Bowie spent a total of ten minutes in the movie and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left much to be desired. The moral of the story was really confusing. I could not tell if there were race problems in London in the fifties or if it was not sold out. In the first half of the movie, I chuckled at how cheesy it was, but I liked the lack of action in the message "No Sale." When black people started being murdered, I thought my band was confused. Maybe I rented half of two different films? No, there was a "Keep Britain White" song and dance sequence. I'm sorry, but you can not write a musical about World War II. At least not a musical that could be described as "Campy", as I have done several times in this review. All in all, I would say that this movie could be a lot better if it decided and would work better actors. (And damn it for a long time, David Bowie!) My grade: C-
