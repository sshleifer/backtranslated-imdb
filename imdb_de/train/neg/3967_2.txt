DARK REMAINS is a low-budget US horror movie that somehow managed to win two awards. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to consist of two different areas. First, a woman commits suicide by cutting her wrists while bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer with a cut throat is found. The mourning couple decides to move into an isolated cabin in the mountains. Later it turns out that the cabin and the surrounding places are being tracked. <br /> <br /> As the movie continues, the two separate strands of the story converge as you might expect. However, the execution is random and causes confusion that could possibly only be resolved by multiple considerations. Unfortunately, the movie is simply not tempting enough to get most viewers to watch it more than once. <br /> <br /> Almost everything that could go wrong with this film goes awry - and fast! And the low budget can not be used to justify all the shortcomings identified here. <br /> <br /> I think it would be wrong to judge the actors involved in this production because the material was simply too poor /> <br /> The characters are of no interest, as stated by other reviewers on this site , The poorly written script introduces too many people without giving them an interesting dialogue, without creating the possibility for character situations and without increasing the depth. <br /> <br /> The direction is uninspired. The inspiration from J horror movies like RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is obvious. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS did not pay close attention to the style of J-Horror. J-horror works so effectively because it plays fear of the unknown. Tension comes from constant shifts between a bizarre situation (eg, a ghost on a CCTV camera approaching it) and the reaction of a central figure confronted with it without warning. In these films, there is no humor and no humoristic element. Everything is played so clearly and without remorse or restrictions that you can not help but be convinced. The predictive atmospheres provide suspense and make the horror psychological, unlike the "jump scares" used in Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The directors of DARK REMAINS have made a bold attempt to avoid Hollywood stereotypes. The use of CGI has also been successfully avoided. The homage to J-horror could have been well meant. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration causes the viewer to laugh at the supposed "fear" on the screen. The make-up effects of the "ghosts" were not so bad given the low budget, but their actions contradicted only the logic. I scratched my head a few times during this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not tell the end, even if I wanted. I just could not understand it. I could only conclude that it was something of an anti-climax. <br /> <br /> What's left? The answer that a reviewer has shown on another website is boredom. The movie is a chore. Fortunately, the pain ends after one and a half hours. However, most would probably switch off long before the end. <br /> <br /> There are only two positive things that I could find in this film - the successful avoidance of scary clich√©s and the lack of the "F-word" in every single sentence like this one would normally expect. This is what the 2 stars are for. <br /> <br /> Those who like supernatural or psychological horror in terms of ghosts and spooks will enjoy watching movies like THE LEGEND OF BRIGHT HOUSE, THE CHANGELING or J Horror Sub-genre. <br /> <br /> If you think you've seen too many established films and want to see an obscure "R-rated" horror movie about extremely low-budget ghosts, then check out DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It's not the best horror movie ever made, but it's certainly much better than DARK REMAINS and has some real surprises in store. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like the plague.
