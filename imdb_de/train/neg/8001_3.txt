MONSTER - He was great. I loved the special effects that created this monster that looked like an updated version of The Black Lagoon Creature. The scenes in which this beast roamed the country and conquered people ranged from good to breathtaking. <br /> <br /> SOCIAL COMMENTARY: Much of history takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors (at the behest of the government). claim that there is a SARS-like disease. In short, we get the familiar government history. You know, I expect that this liberal paranoid attitude with Hollywood movies always calls our government corrupt, but it looks like the Koreans copy the format, and it's very boring. In here it takes away the excitement and tension of this "monster". It just pulls the movie down. The main family seen in the film has to watch from afar, while the young girl in her family, who is believed to be dead, has been dragged away by the creature "message, because this can happen - a terrible one This was the anti-nuclear bomb message from the 1950s, when radiation caused giant ants, spiders, fish, or whatever in those flaky sci-fi movies, and now the focus is on "environmental issues." /> <br /> THE HUMOR This was mostly stupid - I usually laugh about slapstick, but that was not funny - I do not know if the Korean sense of humor is so pathetic or the movie deliberately tries to play with the old "Godzilla" Let's hope it's the latter. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - Video transmission was good, this was a sharp looking picture and the sound was neat with a lot of reverb that on Korean with English subtitles. This could have been a mistake, as the Korean guttural vocals got annoying after half an hour. <br /> <br /> OVERALL - This had a promise that turned out to be too disappointing and even too boring for a modern monster movie inexcusable. Two hours was far too long for this story. I do not know how this film hit record levels in Korea. You may not have a lot of movies that you can enjoy and support.
