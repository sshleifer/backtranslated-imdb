I understand that this movie was made on a very small budget, but that's no excuse for the monstrosity that Grendel is. The Deathstalker, The Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, The Invincible Barbarians were all on low budget and bad special effects, but they still managed to create cult classics by adding a few sparsely dressed warriors and a good sense of humor. The primitive costumes, dark castles, and beautiful Bulgarian countryside gave Grendel the potential to become a very good sword and wizardry movie, but the creators had completely ruined this opportunity with extremely poor CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this movie with Beowulf (1999). It's not Citizen Kane, but it's a great example of how to create an entertaining sci-fi / adventure movie on a low budget using credible special effects and responsive characters.
