So I heard from some people that this movie had brought them to tears in the theater. When I saw it for the first time, I expected another romantic film by Barbra Streisand; Something like the way we were. I was certainly wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, was absent, making it impossible to bond to the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. Streisand's character fell on an alcohol addict who could not sing a single note without pressing the fast-forward button. Once her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. There's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who does not seem to realize it until he actually dies. Parts of the film seemed to stretch out, and I kept wondering when it would end. <br /> <br /> The death of John Howard was absolutely predictable. It was quite obvious that his reckless behavior was hinted at early in the movie, and when he died, I felt no emotion. It was not a tragic accident, he was basically an idiot. Not to mention that throughout the movie I was distracted from his vile beard. <br /> <br /> The only interesting part of this movie is the Streisand songs. The end of the movie, as she sings "With Another Look at You / Now Watching It," was why I gave this movie a stunning 3/10. These 7 minutes were the only part of the movie where I actually felt an emotion other than anger and annoyance.
