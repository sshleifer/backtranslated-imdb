Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self-titled debut, this time around a movie made for laughter. During a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blond beauty on the seabed. Your feet are trapped in cement, as you might expect. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by Bergo Waldo Gronsky. Rome is at risk immediately because he has to investigate some mafia types who turn the tables to him and he himself is the prime suspect. Now he has to flee and hope to solve the case alone. Lanky Sinatra tries to sell us the lame jokes, making us believe he's a good detective, not to mention that he's sexually attractive to the riveting Raquel Welch. The truly ridiculous denouement that surrounds every woman is amazing, every woman in the movie is a wavering head, who likes to bend in front of the camera, director Douglas forces, of course, to enlarge the cracks of the asses each time he steps in on them her back muscles. There is even a ridiculously tough, gay character who rejects the faith. This was a movie made by "real men" for "real men" to affirm their own diminishing sexuality, it's a shameful confusion.
