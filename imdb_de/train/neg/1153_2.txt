Disappointing and irritating. The scriptwriter has no true understanding of human nature but combines clich√©s in an incoherent manner. Character is not explored in detail. These are puppets that have been crushed in an act he admits openly for a dramatic element, the affair of the mother with the lover of her daughter. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid performs excellently, even though she is given certain situations and lines that stand passively so that her angry daughter can hit her in the eye. The screenplay features Darren (Daniel Craig) as Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde with no clues as to why, except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene. <br /> <br /> A mature author could have done much more with this theme.
