This will be short. Let me first say that I am agnostic and not necessarily crazy about Xtians, especially the Xtian fanatics. This documentary, however, had the character of a teenager angry with his mother for not letting him play video games. I just could not take it seriously. Mention how Charles Manson believed he was Christ in order to illustrate the point that Xtianity can produce evil? I do not know that it was just cheap and childish - the opposition became ignorant. In addition, the narrator just seemed snobby and overbearing. The delivery was completely overdone. I can not take this documentation seriously. Perhaps an angry teenager appeals to his xtian mother for not letting him play video games.
