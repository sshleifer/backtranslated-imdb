Some people may consider this film as a work of art - to be able to express your imagination on film, to create a film that is marked by pain and death. This movie is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a complete waste of time, it also makes you ill for days. The dreadful images shown in the movie not only make you gasp, but put you in your head and it takes days to forget them. It is a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "kill bill" has its purpose, its meaning, its peak and its solution.
