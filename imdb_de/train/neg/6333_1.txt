I actually saw this movie in a theater. As soon as I gave my money to the cashier, she said two words I'd never heard before or ever in a theater: "No refund!" As soon as I heard those words, I would have had to say goodbye to my cash and go home. But no, stupid, I went in and watched the movie. This movie has made no one laugh in the theater. Not once. Not even unintentionally! Mostly we sat there in stunned silence. Every ten minutes or so someone shouted, "This movie SUCKS!" The audience applauded enthusiastically and then sat for another ten minutes in a dumb, bored silence.
