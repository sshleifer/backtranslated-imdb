What a horrible, horrible movie. The worst collection of clich√©s I've seen in a long time. Not that I have seen much. I left the theater screaming after about 40 minutes looking for a stiff drink to calm my nerves. Meryl Streep was terrible as usual. How many injured and tortured expressions can a person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as so often - completely wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan that she could act? Trying to be politically correct, this film still enforces racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced, lonely music teacher teaches disadvantaged child violin in the neighborhood school). The kids were not even cute! Just written to fit the frightening script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me falter. real horror this!
