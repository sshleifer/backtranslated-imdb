I saw this movie the other day. I can not even say how much this movie sucked. The writing, the voice, even the clay. Terrible, terrible, terrible. It's like seeing 24 hours C-Span for the comedy. It just does not work. It literally falls flat in almost every possible place. <br /> <br /> Also, the animation of the movie is of very poor quality. I know that this is a movie made by a person, but to think that he could do 97 minutes of crap, he might make fun of at least a second. <br /> <br /> This show may take the cake for the worst movie ever. Yikes It was really that bad. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh, steer that abomination. My advice: Do not even buy it, or look it up. Your brain will be as you.
