This movie is based on the novel by John Fante. Could someone please tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this beautiful book should be adapted in this way. If you want to do a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, how can you possibly connect to Ask The Dust? And if you wanted to turn that story into a movie, why make a romantic, melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek? I do not get it. <br /> <br /> Editing the story is bad, and if you've read the book and liked it, I'm almost certain that you will not like what Towne did with it. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie you might find casting odd, the acting bad and the cinematography a bit over the top. But you hope for the best. I was really hoping for this movie. I actually wanted it to be good. But it only gets worse and it's so easy: whether you read Fante's novel or not, this is not a good movie. Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production combined with bad acting, missing structure and of course many shots of Colin Farell's bare bottom. <br /> <br /> I could complain more about this movie time. I've seen it. Alright. I had to see it because I like the book so much and was curious. And I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is for Colin's sweet little mustache at the end of the movie. So sweet ... Had he worn it all the time, I would have given him 2/10.
