Action, violence, sex and rough language are the things the characters do throughout the movie. And everything they do is done without reason. Mark L. Lester is (un) known for his violent (baseless) films (Commando, The Base). The story is funny, but stupid. The actors play their stupid characters very well ... I'm not saying they're stupid, but I mean they are very bad actors. It's another low-budget action movie from the unknown B series. If you've seen something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, The Patriot, Sanctuary or something like those bad movies of the same kind as Misbegotten ... then do not rent it ... the movies I mentioned ... me give it 1 and a half out of 5.
