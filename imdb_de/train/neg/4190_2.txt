I saw this movie a few months ago in the city, which appeared in the movie as Greendale. That's the only reason why I saw him. Another local who was there sent me an e-mail announcement of a rerun showing that the first one was sold out and the people were turned away. His editorial comment in his presentation is a good summary: <br /> <br /> "Yuk." <br /> <br /> Unless you are a Neil Young fan or live in / near "Greendale" (if the latter know the real name), skip this movie. It's usually an ego tour for the filmmaker. It has no discernible plot, the music is just fine and too many lyrics are incomprehensible, so it's impossible to track what little bits of it are in your hand. <br /> <br /> I do not need to write A spoiler alert, as there are no surprises to give away. <br /> <br /> I would rate this at 1.5 / 10, but that's just fun when you see the locations turned into a movie. The $ 6 was not worth it. I could rent a video camera and drive around in "Greendale" and do a better movie myself. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a * good * environmental news film without action, go to Koyaanisqatsi.
