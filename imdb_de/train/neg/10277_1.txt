I feel totally demolished. Someone has to repay the $ 4.95 I spent at Blockbuster to rent this home made mess. This is NOT a musical, it's a complete waste of time and my evening. What I do not understand is why was that even distributed? ... Someone MUST have taken heavy drugs the night the deal was made. I've seen better movies coming from film schools and I was at a film school, so I can say that as a fact. The quality of this work is simply VERY bad to watch ... on DV turned ??? Nuff said. The songs are not songs, just a joke that sounds the same in each section. Do you want to see a good musical? THEN NOT RENT THIS FILM.
