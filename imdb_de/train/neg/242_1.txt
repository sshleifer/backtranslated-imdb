From a poorly constructed storyline that makes almost no sense, to poor dialogue and incoherent scenes, to the ultimate downer: Bad drama (even Peter Falk can not find his way) "Finding John Christmas" is better lost. Ms. Bertinelli's performance is without depth and emotion, as are her co-stars William Russ as Brother Hank and David Cubitt as Noah's love interest. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of the single father Noah, is almost unbearable to watch, let alone to hear while singing. But who can blame them with such a material? The screenplay by Michael J. Murray is at best teen. <br /> <br /> Every year at this time, I browse through the TV programs and look forward to seeing some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films appear on the small screen. Films like "Miracles on 34th Street", Ernst Lubitsch's delightful "The Shop Around the Corner" and of course the "Scrooge" from 1951. There is Frank Capra's classic "It's a wonderful life" and "Meet John Doe". Hey, forget the classics. What about Home Alone or Home for the Holidays with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My gift to you is an advice. Your time would be better to search for these films than to search for "Finding John Christmas". Merry Christmas!
