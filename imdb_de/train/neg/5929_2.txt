The people who praise this movie are the real disappointments - at least I hope Leonard sees good money as his savings were embezzled by a manager a few years ago and he is now over 70 years old. But this movie is just awful. At the beginning, Leonard himself says that he is not sentimental about his past, and then, for the next hour and a half, the film emphasizes the worst sentimental elements of Leonard's songs. It's so damn PRECIOUS with its endless close-ups of overwhelming singers. Cohen's interview is all in lo-fi video close-ups, and I wanted to see a whole or middle moment of his entire body! I did not care about the comments of the artists, especially the overblown ego-guys Edge and Bono. None of the actors in this film has made even a song as good as Leonard's own music. If you think about it and have any doubts, then pay attention to it. This would be an acceptable PBS special, maybe unique. But I'll even hesitate to get a DVD of it. When the movie finally shows Leonard performing the "Tower of Song," Bono ruins a verse. Even the occasional good performances (Antony, Rufus' first number, Martha's The Traitor) are spoiled by the rest of this Turgid Blabla. Forget about this album and buy Leonard's latest album if you want to pay tribute to him.
