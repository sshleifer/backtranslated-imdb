I've seen this movie numerous times in the late '60s / early' 70s whenever it has raised its head like a reindeer with rabies every November-December as a samin√©e kiddie show. Can I SAY Christmas?), Perhaps the greatest, most iconic Christmas movie of all time. But that's another review. <br /> <br /> At that time, I was surprised that SANTA took the screen color. CLAUS was almost "pink and white", so much had the color of the razor-torn prints changed. <br /> <br /> The movie is kind of scary! That's what I thought then - and I still do. I was very entertaining then, because I still am! It's amusing to a kind of "broken-down elf". By the way, the picture quality on the DVD that I have now looks much better than in the theater, around 1969-74. <br /> <br /> If you expect the lost RANKIN BASS Christmas special - If you want FELLINI DOES Christmas, read on ... <br /> <br /> The synchronization of these foreign films (the original version it's by nature "surreal", which gives the films an inherent strangeness and is also pretty scary, as a "mishevious demon" (as described in the original US trailer) spends the entire movie, to make decent kids "evil." Latch-key "Boy who wishes he had parents for Christmas - suddenly the" Port-a-Family "pops out of the huge" Christmas gifts of the mind "until he realizes he only Has daydreams! If you're a stoner, save your stock - this movie makes you think you hallucinate ... without drugs!
