The idea of ​​seeing this movie so attractive made it hopeful that Charlotte Bronte's brilliance of the classic story of the original would come to fruition. I was deeply disappointed to discover that this film, either written or shot very quickly, did not have the characteristics that made the original novel so powerful. Many of the funny moves between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed either to be missing in the script or lying on the tailor's floor. Also missing was Jane Eyre's charismatic sense of self, which allowed her to endure her turmoil and triumph over everything. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie did not seem to defeat much, including one of the biggest parts of the story, when Jane escapes Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle for food and shelter, her shame to beg for bread, the threat of freezing in the cold, everything to escape a man she loved, were poignant parts of the story in my opinion, they were simple simply were excluded from this movie. The title character seemed dry and unimaginative. The story was unattractive and for those who have not read the book, I can not imagine that story would be the least interesting. The script and the director have little or no confidence in classical history.
