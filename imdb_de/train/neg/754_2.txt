I have to admit that I laughed when I saw a reviewer comparing it to LOTR. Yes, if you exclude the dwarves, the cast of thousands, the great special effects, the big battles, the strong characterization, the decent storyline, the good acting, the stylish alignment and everything else. What lets you go. And, boy, is this movie going? If it were up to Mr. Piano, it would probably take three hours of uninterrupted hardcore wandering through the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so, those annoying Martians will emerge for a few seconds to interrupt him before settling for one further hike is decisive. You have never seen so much in a movie. If this really had a budget of $ 20 million, most of it must have gone on Mr. Piano's shoes because he had to go through many couples with all the walking he does. That explains why there's no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera, or real actors. Honestly, it's like watching a bizarre fetish video for people who know about long walks in period costumes. Even with the fast forward this is a loooongng walk. <br /> <br /> As for the sci-fi stuff, it was a mistake to put the Martians in the film: they only disturb walking, which is clearly more interesting to the director than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much is required of Mr. Piano to walk dogs?
