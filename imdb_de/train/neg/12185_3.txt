What has Martin Scorcese ever owned to make this film new? And he not only made it new, but completely ruined it? The nonsensical decision to make the character Robert DeNiro (in his most exaggerated performance, and that says a lot) a religious fanatic is ridiculous and exemplary of attitudes Hollywood (and especially Mr. Scorcese) heed - attitudes that Writers force to believe that the best way to drive a character crazy is to tattoo a crucifix on his back. In any case, this movie is awful. <br /> <br />
