I may have been wrong, but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman's father. This movie was terrible! This is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie. Bad suspense movie! * shakes sugarcane in the movie * I'll never see it again. And I am also a big fan of life films! You must somehow stop making movies from books. It makes me crazy !!! <br /> <br /> And Whit was ugly and yet she loves him more than Hugh, who looked a wee bit nicer 1/10
