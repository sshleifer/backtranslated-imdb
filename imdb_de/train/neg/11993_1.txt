After watching only half of the film at school in November, I saw today that he was on Flix Channel and decided to look at him to see the rest of the film and write a new review. <br /> <br /> The book the movie is based on, Hatchet, is fine. This, however, is a terrible adaptation of it. Terrible (and I mean terrible) drama, bad dialogue and average cinematography make up this horrible adaptation of Hatchet. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Brian, who is the cliché image of a late 80s teenager (with a mullet and his head against cheap rock music of the 80s) and his mother who drives in a car, so he gets on a plane to see his alienated father (his parents are divorced ... and now the dramatic break.) Now Brian has said goodbye to his mother and dog and flies to his father. The pilot is a fat, ugly, rude man (not so in the book) who has a heart attack in the air after 2 minutes and dies. The book goes into more detail that the pilot has more pain and it seemed they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack. The plane (within two more minutes) has gone empty (the viewer left us to assume that he was up there for hours, even though the sun has not changed and the scenery looks exactly the same). Now he lands crashed , <br /> <br /> This is the point in the film where everything is different than in the book. The book states that his jacket was torn to shreds, but in the movie it is perfectly fine, with no cracks or tears (looks like he just bought it). It never said that he climbed a mountain, saw a wolf, and fell asleep up there. Never said on the mountain that he was attacked by a bear (it's called a moose, but not a bear). He never said that he eats the different beetles he does. He never mentions the second tornado or he has learned to get those sparrows, skins them and eats them or the small fish farm he makes (which is destroyed by one of the tornadoes), and it is not mentioned that he is injured the ribs of one of the tornadoes. <br /> <br /> I don't think that what was portrayed in the movie can be called a tornado. All it was was just a storm that knocked down some of his things. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this camp party was Brian's lame flashbacks (which are never mentioned in the book), especially the cliché scene in which Brian wakes up. He went to the window and saw his father (with all his stuff packed that fit perfectly in the back of his truck). He went and shouted "DAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!" (Of course, his father did not hear him, even though he was just outside) and he hits his fist through the window (wtf?). <br /> <br /> The end is the only thing close to that happened in the book (I said close.) In the book, I think one of the most important things the rescue pilot Brian said when he landed: "You're the kid you were looking for! They stopped months ago." But they skipped that line in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a pathetic epilogue with Brian (somehow without counseling or therapy), who returns to normal with his family. I think we should assume that they met for Thanksgiving (because they had a turkey on the counter). Then it shows his temporary home (for what seemed like three days in the movie, but it was in the book for several months) and his hatchet, still in a tree he put it in (which is not in the book either) has occurred) and shows where he carved a message so perfectly done: "HOME" (where we really should believe he carved that) perfect with just this ax?) <br /> <br /> No Quote can better summarize this film, as Ghost World's Enid said, "It's so bad it's over good and bad." Perfect description of this movie. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to someone (who did not read the book) and just watch a movie, or I would someone who has read the book (because they will be disappointed and bored to death <br /> <br /> For those who have read the book, let your ideas appear as a movie, that's terrible and bring your thoughts into the book. <br /> <br /> 1/10
