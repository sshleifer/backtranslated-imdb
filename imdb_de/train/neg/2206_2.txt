A scientist on an island is deeply concerned about the loss of his son, who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why do not you turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark. Well, who would not do that? It's a bit hard to deal with the fact that the hammerhead shark that kills everyone is constantly called "Paul". William Forsythe's cast as a MacGyver Kick Ass Save-Day childhood hero lacks credibility. On the other hand, there are some hot girls who actually look at the screen while Hai Paul bites another one to death. Actually, I find bad B movies pretty amusing. But for my liking it would have been a much better movie if it had been made for $ 1,000,000 less. Then it could have been fun.
