Well, there is no real plan to talk about, it's just an excuse to show scenes of extreme violence and unfounded sex (which can sometimes be fun, but not in this case). What else can I say ...? The action is imaginative and there is a cool scene where two characters fall from a skyscraper (one must be several miles high), but overall there is not much to recommend "kite". Look at it if you want, but you will not miss much if you skip this ...
