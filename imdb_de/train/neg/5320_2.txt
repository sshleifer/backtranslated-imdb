This is a dry and sterile film that shows one of the most interesting events in World War II and the war history behind the front. A bad drama composition is the worst in this film because the plot about Hitler's death is a pretty dramatic event. There is no character development at all, and the notion that Tom Cruise wants to play a high-ranking commander who questions his deepest inner thoughts about patriotism and betrayal is completely crazy. I believe that Mr. Bin would play it better. In general, the film looks rather like a cheap copy of the good German TV movie "Stauffenberg" from the year 2004, but can come close in terms of no film aspect of this film. However, the film obviously achieves its financial goal with a popcorn crowd appreciating Hollywood's quick mood blood and flat art values.
