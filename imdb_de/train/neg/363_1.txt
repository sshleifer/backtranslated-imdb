What kills this movie is, among other things, its self-confidence. Here is a short list: 1. disrespectful behavior. When the Beatles came over and splashed their kind of "quirky, disrespectful" behavior / humor, it was welcomed as fresh. that was over four decades ago. get over it. <br /> <br /> 2. false sophistication. The spying of the base, quasi-socio-political-isms, is hard to do funny work. ask Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> 3. the postmodern "I'm tough in this fake world and yes, I recognize it in myself" Snake eats himself - serves as an illustration with another animal in the movie itself! - is such a retreading. <br /> <br /> 4. smarmy, complacent trollness. <br /> <br /> 5. amateur writing, acting, directing ... ever seen student films? a victim of yourself, the only thing I can say positively is that it has at least a feeling for itself, and now, I get involved in the self-reflective thing that values ​​it as valuable and valuable. <br /> but towards ... what? ultimately, it sounds as hollow as any other overbearing piece - hey, do you ever see Woody Allen taking Bergman, ie, "Interiors" ??? Well, that just makes it amateurish.
