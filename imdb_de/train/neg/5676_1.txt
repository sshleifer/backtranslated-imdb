This film shows an excerpt from a living animal mutilation of an animal, which is chopped by a machete and whose skin is torn off. I know these terrible things happen in the world, but I watch movies based on the fact that what I'm watching is not really happening on the screen. These live animal clips are not meant to be in movies, they're meant to show people who belong to specific organizations to help the terrible things people do for other species. <br /> <br /> This should be banned and destroyed. I've also contacted Netflix and other resources to work together to get this movie off the market !! <br /> <br /> This film should be taken out of the public eye. The person who made this movie needs psychological help.
