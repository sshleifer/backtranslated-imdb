I saw this movie a few years ago. I could not sleep and there was nothing. So I saw it. What really appeals to me is that it makes no sense and that's why it's disturbing. Richard gets tied up in chicken wire and Jarvis masturbates with Richard's girl while she is unconscious. Then Jarvis' buddy Troubador plays a stupid song on his guitar. The next morning, it shows Richards girl talking to Jarvis and Trouby, and then she goes back to Richard and looks at him while he is still tied up. Then they play happy music and the movie is ready. I mean, what happened? Did you slow down? And what did she say to these two guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? It is too confusing and too poor. I can not stand movies that are disturbing and make no sense. This was the worst movie I have ever seen, since Lord of the Flies in the 90s.
