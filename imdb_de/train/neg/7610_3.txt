In general, I do not like movies shot by Sydney Pollack ("The Firm" is an exception) and I've never been a fan of Robert Redford either. Nevertheless, I thought that "Three Days of the Condor" must be good because of the number of honorable comments. <br /> <br /> Although widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing to the eye and Max von Sydow makes a good impression. As an eerie professional murderer, I found the whole thing enormously disappointing. The film undeniably radiates a paranoid atmosphere, but everything is destroyed by the confused action that seems to make no sense. <br /> <br /> The film also contains one of the most unsatisfactory ends I've ever seen and really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. And what can one say about this absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway? I'd rather watch five films in a row from Hitchcock's movies than get through this trash again.
