The film features SlapChop, Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco - not just names that scream "quality". And with such uplifting skits as "supermodels taking a garbage dump" (it sounds exactly as it sounds), a guy who robs a sperm bank (the "Rhymer"), necrophilia with a rotting corpse, black market fetuses (with a Guy who scoops are supposed to be out of a jar), many, many gay jokes, a sketch about a giant phallus that's a superhero, and forced abortions. The skits are painless (like "Batman and Rhymer"), acting is not good enough to be amateur, and the movie is raw, just to be rude ... and stupid. I strongly believe that a group of 8-year-olds EASILY could make a funny movie with the same budget. <br /> <br /> Apparently this film led to a lawsuit by "Slap Shot" Vince against the Scientologists. Honestly, I would not know who to anchor in this case !!! Apparently he claimed that Scientologists somehow destroyed his reputation and sank that movie. Regardless that the film is dismissive from start to finish and is 99% unstable (by comparison, Ebola is funnier) ... and these are the nicest things I can say about the movie. By the way, IS Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") wears a diaper and participates in the stupid fake porn film. It's amazing that his career has overcome that.
