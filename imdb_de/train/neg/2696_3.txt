I know that John Singleton is a smart guy who made Boyz N The Hood. How did he write and direct this? It's like the pilot of a bad teen who "goes to college for the first time", a parade of boring stereotypes and stereotypes that use some non-violent violence to make a commercial proposal out of it, I think. Who would have thought that the rape victim would throw the seafood sausage? The furious loner would be chased by a group of neo-Nazis (and with a black AND a Jew - just a laugh!) - even Laurence Fishburn's creepy reactionary professor of history just irritated me and I love the man like everyone else with this movie he had lost the plot. Except Busta Rhymes of course. Great ups
