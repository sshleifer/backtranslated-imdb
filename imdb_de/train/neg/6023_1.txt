That reminds me when I was born again and was a minister. I never thought that I would be a minister or even graduate from high school, because I was almost certain that I would have gone to heaven before that ever happened. That was before I discovered that Christianity was a pile of garbage. I am an atheist now, and that only proves that the doctors told by Christians "Once saved, always saved" are no more real than elves. If it was true, why did I go as a pious, reincarnated believer after many years? Yes, I was really saved. I prayed that the stupid sinners pray with all my heart. If Christians read their Bible, they would discover that their gods are rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities. You may be surprised to learn that nowhere is the word "ecstasy" mentioned.
