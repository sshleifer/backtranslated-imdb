Revenge of the Sith begins with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting. Then it gets boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same terrible dialogues and boring machinations that plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the process is the slow - and I mean slow - buildup of Darth Vader's birth. And when that finally comes, it's pretty good. Not good. Not even good. But pretty good. This film is widely praised because it does not shine in the sky as in the previous sequels. Instead, it's just plain, boring and routine. But you have to say, wow, these CGI environments are sometimes really impressive. Bu the lightsaber battles? They are all a blurry mess. I think the dark side seized Lucas when he started these prequels and nobody noticed. This will make a lot of money, but thank God it's over. I saw the show at 12:01 and then I heard a group of very small kids say wow that was great! But everyone older than eight grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was kind of boring. I just thought seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better. So we all said.
