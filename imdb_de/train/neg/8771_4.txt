Okay, I was bored and decided to watch this movie. But I think the most important thing about this movie was that there would be an hour of footage, and that hour was basically repeated four times. It consists of 1. Compiling the troops and discussing the attack plan, 2. Flashbacks to the wives of the men 3. Approaching the troops in a long line 4. Men run up the hill and shoot, mostly the first headshot is hit then 3 other men who save him. 5. Defeat the enemy and call for base to report success. 6. Men who flash back to wives and sing 10-minute songs. That was the basic movie, and the same sequence of events occurred about four or five times. and every time it was a flashback for the women, it showed the man, then his wife and him. There were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback, so it took a lot of time. Besides, the men could only kill their enemy with bayonets or grenades. I liked the music and there was a lot of action, though the action was repetitive. Overall, I probably would not see it again, but it was not that bad.
