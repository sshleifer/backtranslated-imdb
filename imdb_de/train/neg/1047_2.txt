Someone will have to explain to me why any movie that shows poor people and has a pseudo-grained look is considered "realistic" by some people. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything realistic about the characters (though the actors did their best, with really bad games) or the situations. Instead, I saw a forced, self-conscious effort to be "nervous," "pithy," and "dirty and dirty." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it takes much more than just holding the camera with no rhyme or reason and failure to illuminate the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way. <br /> <br /> It's a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution, which are the only films that see the inside of a movie. Nowadays, theaters are all copies, with bad cinematography, non-existent camera work, and a lot of swearing to commit oneself as "art". It is no wonder that movies like "In the Bedroom" or "About Schmidt" get such raves. I found it meandering and very average, but compared to the current independent clones like Raising Victor Vargas, they are downright brilliant and inspired. <br /> <br /> Several years ago we saw an "independent" movie meant that you would probably be dealing with some originality and a lot of energy and care, and maybe a few technical issues caused by the low budgets , Nowadays this means that you probably get another number -shake-the-camera for about two hours trying to satisfy the lack of taste of independent distributors. And of course, all that to serve characters and situations that are totally unreal and invented. <br /> <br /> Is it any surprise that the independent market has fewer and fewer surviving companies? Not at all if you watch movies like Raising Victor Vargas, who do nothing but copy the worst of the previous films.
