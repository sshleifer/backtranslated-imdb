Just because someone under 10 years old does not mean he's stupid. If your child likes this movie, let it test better. I'm always amazed how many people can get involved in something that turns out to be so bad. This "movie" is a showcase for digital magic and nothing else. The writing is terrible. I can not remember when I heard such bad dialogues. The songs are miserable. The acting is below average, but the actors were not given much. Who chose Joey Fatone? He can not sing and is ugly as a sin. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the obviousness of everything. It's as if the authors have done everything to make everything as stupid as possible. Big kids' movies are wicked, smart and witty - movies like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and The Witches, to name two of the past. But with the constant strangulation of American Americans, more and more people are failing, like Finding Nemo (yes, that's right), the recent Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and sensational garbage like Red Riding Hood.
