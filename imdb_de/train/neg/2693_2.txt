Go to a public school and hang out in a schoolroom and cause trouble, but I think that schooling is traditionally a protected environment and parents, caparons and school staff in the Could be near to prevent this. <br /> <br /> One last time, in Hey Babu Riba, the five teenage friends described themselves as foursome. There's probably an explanation why the FIVE were the FOUR, but because it was never detailed, each reference distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> This movie did not sound right for me.
