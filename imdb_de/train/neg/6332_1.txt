I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it came out because I was a big SNL fan. When my friend and I saw him, the people who came from the early show shouted, "Do not waste your money!" Of course we had to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Although there were some fun things (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), most of them felt as though they had made a serious change amusing 1 hour show. It was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When the opera singer came, many people got up and went out. It made me laugh because I realized that O'Donoghue deliberately pushed people's buttons with this movie. Or he was just crazy. Whatever - you do not need to waste your time to see it, it's so bad.
