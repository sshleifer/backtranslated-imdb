I have seen and liked the original movie and expected more from a remake than this one. <br /> <br /> GOOD: effects and make-up are good. No complaints about the score and the visual elements, they are adequate and the performances were fine (Tim Roth was excellent, the other people in charge were fine and a handful of "supporting, supporting actors" worked very well with extremely limited roles ). The action scenes were exciting and funny. <br /> <br /> BATH: The escape from the Monkey Town was terrible. The characters move in circles, then suddenly somewhere in the city there are tunnels to escape. And which escape route leads through each bedroom? <br /> <br /> The story has been reduced to include as much action as possible. I like action scenes, but the original movie had more meat and earned more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the end was completely nonsensical, as pictured. Without seeing the inevitable sequel, there is no justification for it. <br /> <br />
