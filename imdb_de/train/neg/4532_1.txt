My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street DVDs for our daughter, and I have to say, I will not let them watch the new episodes on TV because I annoy ALL characters. Baby bear AND telly OMgosh, how ANNOYING and useless snitch can anyone imagine for his "skits"? Elmo? Rest, not every child likes it again, annoys and brings nothing to my child. Mr. Noodle? what a refusal I think, once I did the "new" show for her, she and I were more stupid than before. The show definitely took a wrong turn. I remember Yip Yips, Kermit's Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford the Mage, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, all the big education sketches of SESAM Street in the Old School (SSD) Always a direct boredom and stupidity Jim Henson's death in 1990. The show no longer has the educational, witty and interactive sketches that it used to have. I find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of useless educational blabber. Continue with the producers / authors of S.S. They have another cartoony show for the parents who sits there in front of non-creative, unexercised children to help them out of their hair. Per Producers / Writers: I suggest that you unpack the old muppets and record content similar to that of the first sesame street. Lord knows, I do not want my kid talking like Baby Bear or Elmo.
