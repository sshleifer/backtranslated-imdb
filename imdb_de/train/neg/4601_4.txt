I do not know anything about the previous work of the author or the director, so I had not prejudiced the film. Because of the brief description of the plot in the TV Guide, I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But the implausibility was jammed on implausibility. Each round of action seemed like an excuse to bring more bloodshed, cruel makeup or special effects. The score was professional and Kari Wuhrer seems to be a decent actress, but the rest was more than disappointing. It was positively repulsive. <br /> <br /> I will not go through the nonsense of the narrative, but I will give an example of what I feel as an excess of explicit blood. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his former victim (Wendt) out of the freezer. McKenna had killed Wendt by biting his neck. Now he feels he has to destroy the evidence of his involvement in Wendt's death. McKenna grabs Wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag he's in, picks up an ax, and starts chopping off Wendt's head. Schlag Schlag Schlag The ax piece chops Wendt's neck again and again. The air is filled with frozen nuggets, one of which falls on McKenna's head. (He wipes it when he's done.) McKenna brings the frozen head to a small fire he's built. He puts his head down on the floor, sits next to him, takes pictures of a woman he just killed, and leads her to Wendt's head. "Do you remember her? We could have done it if it had not been for you," he says. "Duke, you always liked bonfires, right?" he asks. Then he puts his head in the fire. We only get a glimpse of how it burns, but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame. <br /> <br /> I do not want that kind of garbage being censored. I'm just wondering who likes the stuff. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to continue the rest of the movie. Well, I will mention an example of "implausibility" since I approached the idea. McKenna was kidnapped and locked in a dark barracks. He knows he will be half killed in the following days. (He literally invited Heavens to do it.) What would you do in this Poe-like situation? Here's what McKenna does on the last night of his life. He finds a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl and masturbates (successfully). Give this man the Medal of Freedom! <br /> <br /> A monster that looks like Pizza the Hut will be thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks. The camera is often held in the hand and is shaky. The dialogue has lines like "Life is a piece of S ***. Otherwise it's the best of all possible worlds, it depends on your point of view." It uses a wide-angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. A house explodes in an explosive fireball at the end, while the hero McKenna approaches us in the foreground. He is a hero as well. He first kills a man for $ 13,000 by knocking him over the head with a heavy statue several times, then a potted plant, before finally tipping a fridge over his body. (This bothers him a little, but not enough not to persuade him to pay.) Then I hope I have the instruction that he kills Wendt by tearing out part of his neck. Then he accidentally kills the wife of his first victim and blames the serious for it, even though they had nothing to do with almost any moral calculation. Next he burns the head honcho (Baldwin) alive. Then, after disabling the two smaller stools, he purposely blows them apart, though one of them is not completely unmathed. And we're supposed to root for McKenna. <br /> <br /> These are not caricature deaths as in the Dirty Harry movies - Bang Bang and you're dead. These are slow and painful. The first - the murder for $ 13,000 - is made awkward enough to remember what might happen in real life. It's not easy to kill another human, as Hitchcock demonstrated in Torn Curtain. However, this scene does not lead to any important location. <br /> <br /> Some people like that, especially those young enough to believe that pain and death are things that only happen in movies. There is some merchiciouses on the screen here.
