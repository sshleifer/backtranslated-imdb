It has been said several times - not least by me - when you see a movie by Eric Rohmer as if you were seeing dry paint; It seems that Monsieur Rohmer rejects it (he does not deny it, but how could he, he only dislikes it) so much that his new film, which may also be his last, Inch Allah, is so far back in time as if you would see Woad dry. These wonderful people, who gave you the Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema, have already voted this film one of the best films of the year 2007. The reality is not on Rohmer's agenda, so in the 5th century we have an extreme castle in France that would not be inappropriate in the Loire Valley, while we only see a rude wooden hut. The story is about nymphs and shepherds, and as he often does, Rohmer threw it at strangers who happened to pass by, so the annual lesson in a school for special needs students was captured by an accident. You're almost tempted to say "Come back Godard, everything is forgiven," but even this sad production can not make me utter those words.
