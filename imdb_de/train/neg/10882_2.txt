This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. I knew from the first scene that it would be a crash. It starts with a seemingly evil girl who kills a group of nuns in a mission. As it turned out, the people in it were obsessed with random zombies. Well, a few years later, some college kids are kidding. Terrible action ranges from the pledge to the head butt. Things like the jock that pushes him to do something in a very different way than to promise to surpass and exaggerate the whole "zealous role". Absolutely terrible special effects with the cannons. For example, weapons make a sound without muzzle flash and vice versa. This is accompanied by stop-animation zombies (why they're in stop-motion is a mystery), cheesy music and about 40 cannons coming out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is crap. Like so many others, you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest movie rental company.
