... but that does not work and I'm surprised how many people think it's good. For whatever reasons? Here and there are a few loose clues, but the entire material is forgiving and unconvincing. Lynch's films are generally fascinating because they create confusion and yet are very playful. There is some visual feeling, there are some signatures, characters, ideas etc. But that is boring and yes, pointless. For what there is to explore, is either too "small", either too far-fetched or just think ahead. It's just Lynch researching DV, nothing more, so it should be treated that way. 1.10
