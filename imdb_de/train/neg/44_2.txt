I'm not sure if I'm referring to those who labeled this video evil or to the director ... "Devil Hunter" is certainly a bizarre "horror" movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a loose goose bump combo of superior films like Cannibal Ferox and Cut and Run. Chicks are kidnapped in the "jungle" by a "tribe" of "savages". The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies running around in party-city Halloween costumes of tribal robes. And the savages range from white to Asian to black to Hispanic. I suppose Franco has just packed someone who even looked a bit ethnic to this jerk. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this film has an ultra-minimal thrill, no real fear and a lot of unnecessary penis. No fun. I can find something in almost every shabby Italian or Euro-Trash movie; this was just too short. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
