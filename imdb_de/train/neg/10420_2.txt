OK, I know that many people will probably reject this review because Watership Down is a "classic" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but to see this movie for the first time at the tender age of 18, I have to admit: I really hated it. <br /> <br /> We saw this movie because my sister read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people whimpering at the words "Watership Down" - their memories of seeing the movie as children and tearing her emotions at the seams - recommended it. To be honest, I wish I had not cared. I gave him the benefit of the doubt; I do not usually like to stop watching a movie halfway. This was an exception. It was really, really torturous, disgustingly boring. This movie may have been the slowest thing I've ever seen (imagine a covered snail in space) and really did not "make it" for me. The art was fine; The backgrounds were nicely done, if not a bit bland and soft, but the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced. <br /> <br /> I will not go into great detail the plot; Basically, it's the story of a group of rabbits that left their enclosure due to the infiltration of people in the area. In general, it is a moralistic story about the dangers of human interactions with the environment. She uses anthropomorphic rabbits to convey the message. For me, somehow, I wish they were gassed, not because I'm a terrible sadistic person, but because the characters are uninspired, annoying, boring, and generally rather rude (oh, I'm so terribly English). I found myself constantly watching the clock while watching the movie, and it took about 20 minutes for something to happen, and even that was a terrible anticlimax. If I praise I must admit that the concept of showing children how dangerous it is to build in the countryside and hopefully reveal the arrogance of people, etc., means quite well. Perhaps all of this is generally peaceful and preaching, but the message it tries to convey is good by nature. The music score was not bad either. <br /> <br /> So the movie is pretty bad. I could not see it all the way, or I would probably be forced to eat my own legs out of sheer boredom. Granted, it's not "Torque" bad, but in my opinion it's still not rated highly, so I rated it at 2/10. <br /> <br /> I hope that helps.
