Amazes me how this film was made. I saw it while working at home, writing e-mails and answering the phone - I just saw it because I was hoping the "revenge" would be good. Needless to say, the revenge and forced conspiracies of the plans were not worth the e-mails in which they were observed. I'm not even sure what happened in the end. The drama was just as bad as reenactment scenarios in the "FBI Files" show - by far the worst reenactments (really just "arrest and trial" can be so bad at reenactments). I did not know that the lead actor in Third Eye was Blind until I watched the movie here on IMDb, but it's obvious why he has not made any movies since then. I hope he is a good singer.
