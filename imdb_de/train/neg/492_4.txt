If you are looking for the true story of the early baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed. However, if you are looking for a well-designed bodymaker with an art motif, you have found the film. <br /> <br /> This film is such a fundamentally inaccurate portrayal of Artemisia Gentileschi's life that it almost made me cry. (Enter Artemisia inaccuracies in Google and check some fact and fiction articles.) From a purely technical point of view, however, the film was fine: the scenery, costumes and especially the chiaroscuro lighting made sure that the early 17 century experience; although the GLARING FACTUAL INACCURACIES mentioned above are a bit run down. I wonder how the director / co-author Agn√®s Merlet then defended her film? Perhaps she refused to represent Artemisia as a victim, which would have been unfortunate because she had to face it.
