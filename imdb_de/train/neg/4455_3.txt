Where should one start? OK, do not compare this movie to fight the club - ridiculous. If there was even one spot in the fighting club, violence, blood, blood, etc. would be much more obvious and realistic. Secondly, this film is not a football factory - which is much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like an embarrassment). The plot is pretty good and the fight scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending I would like to add. But the film is poor overall, seriously poor. As people have mentioned, the accents should not spoil a movie - I disagree - either a simple casting mistake or lack of effort in voicing the voices made the movie all the way confused / Geordie played the part. Do not get me wrong, good-looking guy who looks good with a skinned head - but no football hooligan. I could go on and on about how ridiculous the football scene was - the situation of the fake steward. If the GSE is going to play United in the north, they're going by train and expect only three of them - that does not make sense - a real organization of mobsters and thugs portrayed in the movie as a mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy - did West Ham and Milwall not play together in the championship in recent years? Hmm, ten years OK. And I am sure that "Bother" will be able to go to a pub in Milwall. Basically a very bad movie that people will like when they know little about real football and hooliganism. If you really love football and are fascinated by the underworld of hooliganism, you'll just feel like this movie has insulted your intelligence. Ross George
