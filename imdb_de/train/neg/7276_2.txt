You can call this a flop, and that's a big one! Quality is not associated with the words National Lampoon, but at least the entries for Vacation and Animal House were fun, but this offer is still the craziest feature I've ever looked at. Pooh! The three-part story tries crazy to parody the clichés and stereotypes that flooded Hollywood genre films, turning out to be utterly listless and boorish slags. <br /> <br /> "Growing Yourself". - Jason, a corporate lawyer, decides to give up his job and leave his wife so they can both grow and do what they always wanted to do. This is the life Jason sees and looks after the children, but his decision to follow that path may not be the right one. <br /> <br /> Talk about lead cabinet, boring and stiff. There is only the small performance of the beautiful Diane Lane of interest. The satirical seems to show something here but to deliver it. The stupid humor is tense, shallow and particularly meaningless. Peter Riegert holds it in the lead role very topp, and Teresa Ganzel bubbles in her role. <br /> <br /> "Success Wanters" - After finishing the collage, Dominique Corsair gets a job as a stripper and rapes with some butter from the Dairy Company presidents. For the amortization she is interested in the margarine industry and works almost on the way to the "very" top. <br /> <br /> Probably the best of the three, but the competition was not great. The gags seem to be a bit more subtle with their sexual and power-oriented tone, but they still feel a little stickier and more forced. The idea had something promising and imaginative on which to build it, but the sluggish pace begins to dissolve in the end, and the catastrophic dialogue does not do it at all. The humor tries it, but does not come often, despite hunger. The seductive Ann Dusenberry is thoroughly cold and manipulative (even after the painful ordeal) and loves to show everything cruelly. Even the tight stripper outfit seems to have a full workout for the first half of the story: in entertaining little cameos Dick Millar, Mary Woronov, Olympia Dukakis, Fred Willard, Robert Culp and a favorite round of Joe Spinell. <br /> <br /> "Municipalians" - a series A murderer who leaves copies of his driver's license after every murder is tracked down by an enthusiastic naive rookie police officer and his old, fossilized partner. However, the young police officer learns that it is difficult to be tough when the couple meets one situation after another. <br /> <br /> Stupid! Oh yeah. Sure, if you want to fake something extremely exaggerated, make sure that laughter flows from it. Obviously they forgot that! Boy does it for 30 minutes! Robby Benson's intrusive counterfeit performance became quite presumptuous with a fatigued Richard Widmark, who did little as his partner. Christopher Lloyd plays the role of the serial killer, but his incredibly funny and likeable performance works well and shows the other tracks. Elisha Cook Jr., Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems appear. When the jokes come, they really feel out of synch and become rather stale, making fun of those cops' clichés. <br /> <br /> All in all, the idiotic material criss-crossed with his skits acts as a disposable item. The unbearable script is fundamentally incompetent and witty. Only a few or two gags go through each segment, but in reality there are too many cheap stinkers or simple misses stuck in your head. This is because it becomes practically what it is trying to be fun, and this is reflected in every story. It loses sight. Performances range from hot to cold, but who can not deny the embarrassment most of their faces feel? The first taste of director Bob Giraldi is a faint taste for "Growing Yourself", but "Success Wanters" showed some weak effects of mild effectiveness. Henry Jaglom does a tired job at "Municipalians". Rick Meyerowitz's vividly sharp drawings that open the film are well thought out and determine the style and mood. <br /> <br /> This low-brave comedy throws it out by dubbing, with the main ones interested in the familiar cameo. But really, it pays to get up through this lazy lame and restless just to discover them. Well, that's up to you.
