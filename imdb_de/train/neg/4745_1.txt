I can not say anymore that this movie was awful. All the Chinese senses are awakened in their being because the ancestors were a hard sell. But to tell the audience that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even laughing at it. It's like saying that every American knows American history without studying, or any Filipino, etc., etc. It just is not believable. It was said that Shin came from a monastery in China - later in Beijing. However, the early sequences of the film show the map that focuses on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas like Mongolia. But it is a separate nation and even designates "Mongolia" on the map. Did the Disney Studios fail the 5th grade geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is at best superficial and yet she somehow feels connected to him. Your training is just cheesy. To put it in a nutshell: Everything about this film is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry over it. The Taekwondo campaign was in many cases exaggerated and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The evil eye thing was cheesy. The end to the left, however, would have been the only descent. They should have left the evil eyes. Instead, the evil is somehow defeated. Yes! <br /> <br /> Overall, the dog's time in the movie is not worth it. Brenda Song should get along with another studio.
