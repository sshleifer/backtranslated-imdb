This short film by Hal Roach, A Tough Winter, is the ninety-ninth in the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and the eleventh talkie. Basically a showcase for the black comic Stepin Fetchit, which receives special bills here. We see him going to his hut, where the gang is hanging around. Farina gets a letter of love from the post office for him and is asked by Stepin to read it because he can not read it during the day while he goes to the NIGHT school. It's by chance from his favorite in Tennessee, so Farina has to stuff her ears with cotton now, because it's too hot for him! In another room, Weezer hands Mary Ann instructions to turn Radio Taffy off. However, as he repeatedly runs into the kitchen, he misses the announcement of the lady to confuse milk pudding and Spanish tamale, Mary Ann confused with additions of Tabasco and Lux. After the preparation is complete, Jackie and the rest of the gang help themselves with the awful-tasting, but very sticky substance, as it all gets stuck on the walls. While everyone is trying to clean up the mess, Stepin works in the basement on various pipes and sockets, where the functions of different devices are mixed, for. A phone with a vacuum cleaner, a vacuum that rings, and a fridge that plays music! The end. What I have just described points to the twisty nature of this "Our Gang" shorts, which served as a pilot for a possible Stepin Fetchit series of films. It's also good that it never happened, as Fetchit's characterization of the lazy negro was amusing in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today. Many of the scenes I've just described are good for some laughs, though the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah to me. In summary, A Tough Winter is worth seeing at least once. Incidentally, the real name of Stepin was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
