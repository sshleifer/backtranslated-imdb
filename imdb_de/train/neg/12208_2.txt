As a veteran of the army, I was deeply offended by this movie. In my opinion, it is a shame for those who fought in the Vietnam War. To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this crap are an understatement. If the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon, it would have been better received. But my many people, especially overseas, have been taken seriously. As stupid as it sounds, when I was in Europe in the late '80s, people like me and the Americans generally seemed to be watching this movie. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A monosyllabic, muscular cretin is being withdrawn from a prison task force to conduct a secret mission in Southeast Asia to rescue some American prisoners of war. In an ongoing battle, he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never has ammunition and never overheats. And he never misses running with a 32-pound rifle held with one arm. I could go on, but I get a headache. I only rated this as 2/10 because it's a bit better than Rambo III.
