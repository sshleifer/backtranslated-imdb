"The Crush" is a very pleasant, romantic chick movie for the first two-thirds with about 40 friends, as he tries to be a British "Sex and the City". <br /> <br /> I especially liked the turn of the young Trophy Cup, whose character is not very pronounced (considering we did not see too much physical meat from him and Kenny Doughty is well worth seeing) ). <br /> <br /> You probably do a lot more with the young man / woman than in both versions of "Sabrina" (neither of which I like) or with the Douglas / Zeta Jones or Dion / Svengali -Wedding. <br /> <br /> To host Andie MacDowell as an ex-godmother are welcome confidants from British dramas and comedies, such as: B. Anna Chancellor with sharp tongue. <br /> <br /> The plot twists to the end very deus ex machina. But it was not until the end of the credits that I realized what could really be wrong. Just like "Sex and the City," the writer / director is male, here's the first Scot, John McKay, and I think he really wanted to write a screenplay about three gay men, probably about their relationship with their loved ones and at work (the characters are a headmaster, a police officer and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting film. The working title for the film was "The Sad Fcker's Club", which would have made his parallels to the gay "Broken Hearts Club" even more obvious. <br /> <br /> (originally written on April 6, 2002)
