Words fail me. <br /> <br /> And that's not common. <br /> <br /> Well done, that could have been great. Rarely have in the field of drama so many competent actors fought so futile with such a dog breakfast of a script. I can only follow the comments of the previous reviewer. In fact, DO ANYTHING except watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Positive: Lucy Beemans nose. Negatives: Everything else. <br /> <br /> Fitting line: "This is not going anywhere". <br /> <br /> If only every plastic surgeon could have met such a fate.
