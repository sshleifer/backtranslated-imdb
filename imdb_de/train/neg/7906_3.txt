No hit on Korman since he was very funny on the Carol Burnett show. He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brook's films ("High Anxiety"). He is not, however, a person who can wear a movie in dueling roles. This is basically a Gremlins effect following a tradition of films like Critters and Ghoulies. It's also not a very good tee, comparable to "ghoulies", but with a much brighter tone as it's not as dark as the movie. In fact, this is too light and frothy and unfortunately many jokes fall flat. Although I've awarded a 3 for a score, it's just because there's a movie worse than "Gremlin." If you've seen Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know the one I'm talking about ... the infamous "hobgoblins". This one has a guy who finds a little creature in an underground place (I saw this movie a long time ago, so I can not remember everything exactly), and it starts off well. However, this creature quickly becomes rude and of course more is produced and that is the movie. More failures than hits in the joke section, and it's also very lame to see Korman playing the role of the bad brother. It's best to skip this, but then you might just want to look for kicks.
