I do not know where to start. The cast is full of people who have never done anything before or since. Debralee Scott is on the covers, but does not appear in the movie at all. The writing is pretty bad, even for college movies. It's obviously a very small budget, with a scene at Sorority House that has an extremely choppy cut. <br /> <br /> The characters are typical for college movies - shy guy, nerd, confident black guy, tough guy, guy with mustache, attractive girl, little girl from town, etc. The featured teacher is about the what you would expect ... medieval, heavy set type that is easily distracted. <br /> <br /> If you want to attend a college flick, stay clear of this. It's so bad, it's not even funny.
