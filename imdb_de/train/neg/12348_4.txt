This movie is very similar to "Flashdance", you know that is the dance strip with Jennifer Beals. This movie is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen since it's not even bad enough to be funny. "G.I. Jane" is much better than the movie, but that does not say much. Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there is high music, and we see how she is fought and everything, but it certainly is not very appealing. I really think the idea behind the movie is kind of interesting, but the script is too clich√©d and Ridley Scott can not help it. Well, as I said ... it's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
