Visually stunning? Certainly. I've seen some movies look so good for some time. Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow use eye-catching cinematography, computer graphics, and creative futuristic designs to create a world that's historically familiar and something new. The period seems to be in the 1930s or early 40s. The film tells of recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason. Even the mysterious disappearance of relevant scientific heads coincides. Who can stop them and save the world? Okay, it's not a leap of faith to know that it's the Sky Captain himself, with his wisecracking reporter friend who's always hot on leadership, and in the wings his faithful, thoroughly competent buddy. What Sky Captain has in terms of atmosphere and graphics, he lacks in storytelling and characterization. The plot for this movie is ridiculous. Apart from that, the film strives for a serial feeling of film series from yesterday. They had pretty long stories and bad acting - but none of them, and I mean, none of them had the budget and the big names this movie had. Two Academy Award winners and Jude Law could hold a movie afloat, one would think, but Sky Captain sinks unhappily. Despite its fantastic dark appearance, I wish I wished the movie would just end and I could go on with my life. I had little interest in a story that aroused little interest. I was not interested in the smooth portrayals at all. Paltrow was just awful. Jolie was a joke with a role that had virtually no substance. Law can not carry the One Liner tradition too well on its limited shoulders. I mean, let's face it, he's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson or Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least to me, was that it was so promising and yet delivered so little. I got bored after ten minutes - waiting for something that caught my interest - and it never came.
