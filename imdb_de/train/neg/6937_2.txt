The subject that this youngest Adman-turned filmmaker is attempting to tackle in his debut (ad) project is an ancient discussion topic for almost every cultural standard - timeless romance (intended). <br /> <br /> The exploration (and exploitation for Desi auds), however, falls regretfully, as the usual inclinations to maintain the usual masala mix of b / g score, dialogue, dance, drama, etc. too Season and spice up a pretty-looking package with not much inside. <br /> <br /> For the first 40 minutes of the movie, the kitchen scene was repeated at least 8-9 times. Further repetitions follow through the film (after all, the main character is a cook). Therein lies the problem - no story! Hah, no wonder. Someone forgot to write a script. <br /> <br /> Amitabh brings Cheeni Jyada (more) too much. Really, when will this guy ever stop? How many 60-year-olds prance like this, even when they are teased by a nice 30-something ??? Timeless mind, yes, but what about the not so ageless body? And the sole? Excuse me, soul ?! Reasonably good drama by Paresh Rawal, who plays the only sensible role in the film. The director lacks realism when caught up in his new discovery of a hot new idea. Nowhere are we confronted with problems or problems faced by such a couple unless you actually marry, which is just the initial obstacle. The signing of a little child with cancer (the first love of the bachelor boy) goes nowhere, and whatever a little palatability that might otherwise have caused this otherwise bland presentation is quickly broken off along with the character of the girl. Anyway, nice try, but not so far.
