Without doubt one of the worst movies I have seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women driven to rob banks that we should somehow sympathize with. It's hard to sympathize with characters making such stupid decisions. Oh no, the cops are coming up to us, they know who we are, what are we doing? What!?! Every character is a clich√© and it's easy to say who will end up dead.
