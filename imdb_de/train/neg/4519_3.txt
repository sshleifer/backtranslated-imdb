Three Henchmen - Have Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature film to feature the Stooges, and it's pretty bad. The THREE STOOGES make the world look like a masterpiece in a daze (from 1963). <br /> <br /> The Stooges are janitors at a rocket place. They get into a rocket and they go to Venus. They meet a couple of things, including a talking unicorn they call "Uni" and bring it to Earth. "Uni" speaks like an average, pleasant person - "Oh, hello, how are you, beautiful planet here, hope you like it." Very funny. <br /> <br /> Very few gags and so many scenes just go on and on and on. <br /> <br /> The Stooges come back from outer space and the movie is over, history goes, but No one said that the filmmakers continue to shoot for about 10 minutes at a party that does not happen much, the Stooges leave the party and then the movie is almost over. <br /> <br /> High point of the movie - the end of which the Stooges sing a neat little song about their journey.The Larry and Curly Joe slapped Moe in the face with two pies. Brutal. <br /> <br /> Another writer mentioned the fine score The music I've ever noticed was two classic tunes - ILL TAKE ROMANCE and DA RETURNING THIS SONG, both of which are played at the party - and * that * really is the highlight of the picture - music from old Columbia films br /> <br /> The tall, sexy blonde was nice. <br /> <br /> Awful - save a brand new VHS video from the 99 Cents Only.
