I unconsciously had this movie on my shelf for a while in a Mill Creek Collection, and one night I just decided to look at it; although not much expected. At the beginning of the credits, I was amazed when I found out that this movie was filmed under Filmirage. Filmirage brought such amazing stinkers to the world as "Troll 2", "Ator the Invincible" and "Quest for the Mighty Sword", so I had to watch. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, he had started to show some decent potential, even though it was unoriginal. The Gore scenes could have been improved if they were expanded and more frequent. But after a while in the movie, the tempo began to tug and I thought, "Okay, somebody should be killed soon" or "Someone better mutated". At the beginning of this resistance, when I had these thoughts, even though someone might have been killed or mutated, however, as already mentioned, the blood and the effects were not very good. What made matters even worse was that the scene transitions were confusing; Example: First Dr. Houseman at the zoo, then he had a look back, possibly killing someone, and finally he woke up in a cold sweat - the audience asked, "Was he dreaming that he was in? The zoo?". Like the tempo of the movie, these transitions became progressively worse. <br /> <br /> I could try to say that the character development of Dr. Ing. Houseman was pretty good, but towards the end of the movie, that is, if you 'I've seen what the doctor has turned into, hopefully you'll laugh - which is really the only reason to watch this movie at least once; This movie is unintentionally like a lengthy joke. <br /> <br /> The Hummel costume that Doctor Houseman becomes is also featured in Joe D 'Amato's "Quest for the Mighty Sword" in the same year. You have to love filmirage movies, they always use the same stuff!
