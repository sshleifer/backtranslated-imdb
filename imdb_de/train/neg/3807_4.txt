Do not get me wrong, I'm a big fan of many of Woody's films, obviously his late-70s masterpieces (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his late-'80s / early-90s dramas (Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeaners, Husbands) and Wives) I even liked some of his recent efforts (Melinda, Anything Else, Small Time Crooks), but that was miserable, I thought it could not possibly be worse than Match Point from last year, but how wrong was I. <br /> <br /> It was lazily plotted - basically a cross between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks, with all the jokes - Woody seems to be on his way and most of him lines up and disguise the provision of "witty" slogans "I respectfully say that ..." over and over again until the fineness of the whole thing becomes too much. <br /> <br /> I know most actors line up to work with him, but at least they should read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are so much better than this - and Woody should really be in Future behind the camera role when he has about 20 miles behind him. <br /> <br /> It would not be so tragic if we did not have so many great Woody movies compared to that - but it's clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort, Woody should call a day before he becomes an industry joke. <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad
