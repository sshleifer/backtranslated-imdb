I can not think of any truly redeeming features of this extremely poor rendering on Asimov as the artistic director. Forget the product placement disaster, the unconvincing performance of Will Smith, and the giant plotting holes. That was not just ridiculous and painful to look at. Even the action was boring. A mix of MTV-inspired output and extremely poor dialogue was probably aimed at very young children. <br /> <br /> What a pity that sci-fi is so bad, you can still do it after we Bladerunner, Minority Report or, to a lesser extent, Dark City (by the same director). This really belongs in the 100s list. Really terrible.
