This movie has several vulnerabilities. The first and most important of these is the clear lack of a good plot! Unfortunately, this not only makes the film difficult to see, but also gives the viewer certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she is wasting valuable time in their short lives. This means that the film can not captivate the audience, but encourages viewers to despise the movie and everything related to it! In short, it is really, very, very, very, very bad! Do yourself a favor and chew on a large rubber boot. You will find it much more interesting and enjoyable to watch than Terminator Woman.
