... but this must be the worst A Christmas Carol adaptation of all time. And that needs something that's associated with different types of lifetime efforts. Do not get me wrong - I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I enjoyed them tremendously in other roles (see eg Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes). But the script gives her no choice but to chew the scenery. And chew it, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim, who fits into a Christmas goose. <br /> <br /> Just give me the classics: Alastair Sim, 1951. With the exception of Scrooged, everyone else is just an exaggerated effort to capture the past, present or future spirit of Christmas.
