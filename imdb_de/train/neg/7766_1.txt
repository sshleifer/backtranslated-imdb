<br /> <br /> As with the other episodes of this TV series, which builds on the many adventures of the legend around the sea, Horatio Hornblower's extremely human infallibility ruins every chance for excitement. As the little Wesley Crusher, many seasons of THE NEXT GENERATION ruined, Horatio Hornblower irrevocably saves any situation. Every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lips of Horatio Hornblower. Considerably immeasurable, Hornblower's main problem in this film series seems to be tolerating the many flawed characters in and below him in the chain of command. A perfect being makes for boring storytelling. Our hero is so superior that even those who try to help him are unable to do anything right, unless Hornblower is there to control and control his every move can do and win repeatedly in everything? What is the meaning of such a story?
