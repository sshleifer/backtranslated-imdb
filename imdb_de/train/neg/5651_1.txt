In my life I have seen many great and horrible films. I'm not an expert on professional reviews, but I definitely have something to say. First, these actors are the worst I have ever seen ... Their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think that these actors were not interested in the quality. <br /> <br /> Another horrible thing concerns these dialogues - they are so lame. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear them. It seems your 14-year-old son could behave better. I feel that this movie had a budget that is similar to the cost of my 14-year-old European car ... Please, when my message reaches you - save time and money.
