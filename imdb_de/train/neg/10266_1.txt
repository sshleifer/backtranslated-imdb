1. watched 11.07.2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): Exaggerated 1970s prelude to the supposed horror movies like Friday the 13th (versions 1 to 16). I can not spend much here, except (or think something?)? The story revolves around some stupid people listening to the radio for a year after a couple of kids were killed in the woods as a "tribute". allegedly. But lo and behold, one of the stupid people has connections to the actual event because their sister was one of those murdered (again, how stupid is that she would even be involved). Guess what? The killer is back and we are made aware right from the start who he is (so there is no secret). And besides, where are the "cops" and why does not anyone call them? I can not believe that this film was financed and made by someone. One might think that the American people are now valued at least a bit higher, at least in his cinematic experience, but not by this filmmaker.
