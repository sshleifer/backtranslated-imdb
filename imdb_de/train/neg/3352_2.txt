I do not even know where to start. "It's about the family." This must be the worst dialogue line ever to be heard in a "horror movie," though this might not be a horror movie, even if it had tried !!! Pooh!!! And I know that Owen Wilson is a better actor. He has to stop playing the characters who die in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). Finally, the man "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore" co-written. He has a talent. Lily Taylor should also stay with indie films. She has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should be porn star. There is no place in legitimate action for them. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I have ever seen.
