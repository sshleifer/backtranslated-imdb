The hysterical thing about this film is that the director finds it difficult to find a distributor in the US, as most of them who watched the film could not reconcile the seemingly contradictory messages of Christianity and American fear. The idea that anyone sees this as a religious movie is ridiculous anyway. <br /> <br /> Because a missionary prays to a homeless mission or wishes someone Godspeed, does that make a "Christian" movie? One could interpret that this is actually ridiculing religion in the "Land of Plenty" with all its material excess. The best thing an organized mission can do is spend a bowl of soup and a Bible verse. Many unhappy or run-down maybe? Countless homeless missions? How about many psycho-vietnamese veterinarians? As an insane survivor of the agent "pink", we think that America is a "Land of Plenty" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have many psychiatric patients? Surely we do not have many people worried about Palestinian politics, based on the main cast of the phone call in the film. Of course, if you worked in a German homeless shelter, the unfortunate thing for peace in a distant land would be much more than personal survival, because the world knows that Europe is the "continent of abundance" when it comes to sophistication In fact, I ended up agreeing with the title as the United States is the "Land of Plenty," referring in this particular case to the abundance of bad scripts, amateur actors, and films that are not passionately directed. Life is too short and you, even an American, do not have much time to look at this piece.
