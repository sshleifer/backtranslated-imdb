I am a great sign of Neil Young's music, and with that and with the glowing praise that the film received in many ancient Indian press circles, I met the first Greendale show I could find. My excitement was short-lived as this turbulent action and faint lyrical verve left most visitors either asleep or disappointed. Neil says the movie started as a soundtrack and the characters came to life so much that they were alive. I've just filmed the soundtrack. Not the best way to make a story. No character really has a bow, and when "significant" events occur, it does not bother the viewer, because the annoyance of the film technique is so high up to that point. The movie consists only of songs, and for this purpose, the characters end up at the end of the lyrics as they are sung. The technique works for the first stanza in which it is completed, and then rubs on the nerves. It does not feel real or fake, it just feels unwelcome. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, with characters who find a mood and play everything. Sometimes bad light. The only kudos I can give to the film refer to several scenes that were shot as a news show, but the technique is used today in the cinema so that this film has contributed little. A good soundtrack, but nothing that I can buy quickly. A bad movie.
