I'm so confused. I've been a big Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all of his films and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this movie as "bizarre". Steven Seagal shares script writing and producing credits for the film, but I find it hard to believe he would prefer to speak for so many of his lines over his own voice, in a thin, whiny voice. What I also do not get is if they had to sing some of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the other? I expect Seagal to age like all the rest of us. But the Seagal in this film barely exudes a fraction of the same boasting, confidence, bravery, charm, and sexiness that he has so easily shown in ALL the previous films. What I missed most of all was his cocky, self-confident attitude and his infernal mockery that easily turns into that delightful grin. Where is this in-your-face attitude and the charm that has made him such a big star ??? I hope this movie is not an indication of what Seagal has to offer. If so, his lifelong fans will have to admit that the Seagal we all know and love has disappeared.
