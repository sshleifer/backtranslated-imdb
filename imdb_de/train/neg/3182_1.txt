In Final Justice, the great Joe Don Baker walks around in Texas and shoots people shooting people. Then it goes to Malta, where he shoots more people. He is often jailed for shooting people. Then he gets into a shootout with the evil, who is dressed like a monk. There is a chase and Joe Don is back in jail. Finally, Joe Don, with the help of Elaine of "Seinfeld," kills the evil, blows up one or two boats, and someone is shot with a torch. All this and a catchy title song, just like Mitchell!
