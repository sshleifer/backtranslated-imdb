A family moves into an old house in Japan. But there is a catch that it pursues (BOO !!!). Aw, I did not want to make you jump. It's just a review. Calm down again. Um, now it's being tracked down by an old samurai who killed his wife and lover in slow motion anyway. Of course, this results in a 3-minute scene extending to about 7 or 8. Horrid acting. Terrible story. But how bad can it be that you ask? Well, it was so bad that my brain began to melt and run through my nose in meditative drops. It was so bad when Doug McClure came on the screen. I prayed that I had flashbacks from Small Wonder (yes, I know Doug was in "Out of this World" and not in "Small Wonder"), but it's pretty much the same damn show I can do better with the "little miracle" theme to hum. There are films that are so bad that they are good. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My rating: F- <br /> Eye Candy: Mako Hattori is topless, Susan George gets 2 love scenes (one naked, one just topless) <br /> <br />
