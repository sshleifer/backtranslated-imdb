Sometimes I take a break and think about the reasons why films about killer sharks and / or crocodiles are still being made today. They've been making these lame "jaws" copies since the '70s, it's not like they're getting more and more popular. The idea is still the same. So we have an animal that starts killing people. First, some secondary characters are torn down, then the main characters are attacked. Usually they are played by some noblemen, except for someone who used to be a bit more famous and usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the others somehow kill the animal, usually with an explosion. Then we usually get one last shot, where we see the animal still alive or laying eggs, etc. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same overused ideas and does absolutely nothing to produce even a little variation. If you do not count the fact that the "specialist" in this one variant is a captain, your claims in this case are pretty low. It's weird that he was played by Duncan Regehr, he was like Zorro. Did I give him a bonus point?
