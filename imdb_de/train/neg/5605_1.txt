I was very disappointed in this movie. I expected more from a Thelma and Louise Krimi. Instead, the women's prison flees in this strip, had no sense of loyalty to each other. They were an extremely vulgar pack of hyenas beating each other, crucifixing each other, and even making lesbian rape against other women in the film. To plan their escape and raise the hidden money, the women were too selfish and vicious to trust for long , These women were not released in a positive sense. They were just a bunch of loose cannons, unable to respect themselves or themselves. If you like 1970s female thriller capillaries, skip this bomb and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase with Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
