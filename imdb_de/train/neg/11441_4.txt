After a promising first 25 minutes of making you feel warm, you are pretty sure that this will be a great romantic comedy. Then the film turns to bad. <br /> <br /> The warm feeling may still be there, but as others have said, the plot becomes so incredible and artificial that it's almost unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> The movie gets faster and you get the impression that you are either fast or that the producers decided to put the movie in less than an hour and 40 minutes and cut out many scenes. <br /> <br /> Realism is not an end in itself, but as a spectator, I'm pretty much convinced that this comedy is not deliberately unrealistic, but random. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, this movie has some nice interiors, and despite the bad script, I think the performers perform well above all else. If I could only rate the first 25 minutes, I'd probably mind an eight. As it is now, it gets four. ... and that is nice! <br /> <br /> If you like romantic comedy, you probably have a great time anyway. If not, I would recommend that you look at something different.
