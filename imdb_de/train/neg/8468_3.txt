"They are among us" is at best a bad science fiction. This film looks mediocre. The action holes are numerous. Extraterrestrials, who somehow came to earth on a meteorite and have been hiding among us for over 100 years, need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human. In their alien form they supposedly have exoskeletons (which is why they need the plastic surgery), but when you see them, they have teeth and fingernails. The hero's father "disappeared" after Project Blue Book was closed, but was allegedly an F-16 pilot. And on and on. If you want to see an alien invasion movie, select Invasion of the Body Snatchers and see how it is done properly.
