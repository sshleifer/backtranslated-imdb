I like Billy Crystal and I thought it would be fun to watch this movie because I know that he admired Alan King and they would be funny together. I thought I saw all of Billy's films but could not remember, and now I know why. It is so full of clich√©s and false emotions. You can smell every upcoming scene (and go!). Billy does not get funny often. He's too busy crying tears or showing his fear of his father's abandonment. Alan King himself is quite likeable, as is the subplot, which is about being special in the movies. But what a coincidence that Billy is visiting his dad right now as a major health crisis, etc., etc. Or that two busy doctors have to close their practices to drive around LA. And when the end comes, boy, it's fast! Almost as if the authors had realized that they had painted themselves in a corner and the only way out was to make a death scene. Most disappointing with a few good shimmer.
