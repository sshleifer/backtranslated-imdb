Ulises is a literature teacher and comes to a coastal town. There he falls in love with Martina, the most beautiful girl in the city. They will begin a fierce romance ending with the tragic death of Ulises at the Sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in town, and lives a quiet, happy life, surrounded by money. One day, the apparition of Ulises will be her passion to get up and act without thinking about the consequences. The plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent role. In addition, three-quarters of the film is sexual, which, while still well-filmed, is quite exhausting, as we want to see more story development. It's just a bad movie by Bigas Luna, with lots of sex, no arguing and stupid characters.
