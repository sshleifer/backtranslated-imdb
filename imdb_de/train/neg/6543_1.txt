The 1990s began sprouting tag talk shows left and right. Every network had one and there was no originality about it. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the overweight caravan mom with a Marlboro cigarette while she nursed one of her dozens of toothless illiterates. The English language and other cornerstones of humanity, where this was ruined, show the existence. Titles range from Girl you a Pigeon Head and so on. How could anyone want to see this pure and pure garbage? Is our society really just a bunch of Hill Billys and dead fathers beating? The people who appear on this show were rubbish. The people who saw this show were trash. Who wants this show to be aired again or put on DVD is TRASH. People wonder why Americans turn into huge piles of lard and fat to even get a job. Since they have shows like these, tell them. Having such a trash on TV has destroyed morale.
