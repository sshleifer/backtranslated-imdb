This is the second British Rank movie that adapts the stories of Sommerset Maugham to the movie. With the exception of a quartet story, time is not traveling well. and the actor's speech is decidedly "cut off," as only British actors from before the 1950s are heard. In any case, 'trio' seems to be tighter and more cinematic than the first film adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the problems these two films can not overcome is that their source material was written 25 to 30 years before the movies. In the 1950s, Maughm's (before the war) popular "little moral" storytelling seemed strange, if not downright insidious.
