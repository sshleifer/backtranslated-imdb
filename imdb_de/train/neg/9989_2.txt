I had the misfortune to see this garbage on Sky Cinema Max on a cold winter night. I'm not a big fan of horror movies because most are just garbage. This is even worse: It's one of the stupidest bitches I've ever seen in my entire life. Horror movie? Yes, there are terrible things here: the acting, the script and the special effects. I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to make a movie for 90 minutes. If it had been a comic movie, I would have given him a 5. Do not even think about renting it unless you want to mock the producers. did not vote because I laughed all the time ;-)
