Universal Soldier: The Return is not the worst movie ever made. No, this honor would have to go to a movie that tried to make some sort of statement or accomplish an artistic achievement that failed in a pathetic or insulting way. But maybe no movie I've ever seen has done so little and made it as complete as Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This movie is a sci-fi / action-travesty that's practically nothing to recommend. Acting is as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The plot is terrible and predictable. The special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone who is even remotely connected to this movie should be ashamed. USA: The return makes Van Damme's earlier fare look like groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces. Some movies are so bad, they are good. Believe me, when I tell you that this is not one of them. I'm really not sure what else to say. I doubt many people have considered watching this movie if they have not already, but just in case: not.
