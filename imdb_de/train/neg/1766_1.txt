Baldwin really longed for such films. The script, the music and just about everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The sound effects do not sound real, they stand out too much (technical devices, etc.) when they try to make a movie about such things, at least try to get real, and let them They drop the extra beeps and beeps as these devices do not really make loud noises. Natural sounds like footsteps and such do not exist, resulting in a void-like atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Director seems to be fine for a movie on such a low budget (I hope it was a low budget production), even though it sometimes looks pretty amateurish. <br /> <br /> Most characters look empty and wrong, they just did not occupy this movie well. I would imagine that speaking Baldwin Spanish would be a better idea than having Spanish actors speak English. If we all know that their language is livelier and more vivid, the performance of the actors can suffer greatly when an odd language is used. I mean, could somebody finally realize how stupid it sounds when international actors speak English with a bad accent? It should have buried a corpse in movie production a long time ago. Has the production team ever heard of subtitles? This film once again manages to portray European police as lazy and corrupt, societies vulnerable and helpless. I mean, if the plot again looks like, "Interpol can not do a book, so we call an American to defeat this international consortium" or whatever. Sony Pictures is following the same path as Columbia previously, only producing films for hell. I would imagine that they also have some self-esteem. Shoppers want to buy every dirty title just because Sony publishes something good several times a year ?! Maybe they should have used the same team that made Di Que Si - Say I Do. It's spoken in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job of keeping the movie afloat. Looks and sounds much better! Come on, Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
