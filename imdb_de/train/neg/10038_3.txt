The film lacks style, I mean, original style. everything looks copied, including action, first appearances in the movie, songs, dialogue delivery, etc., etc. Yes, there were the fools original, as at the beginning a car with the number UP **** number and a few seconds later it starts to appear to fall down a hill with the number MH ****. That was one of many dummies of the film :) Something good in the movie? Yes, for Kareena fans, if there are any, Kareena in a bikini. For Akshay fans, his dialogues and action stunts. That's it. nothing else. So look at your own risk and do not blame the director or the actors. Director is crazy and actor, I feel sorry for them.
