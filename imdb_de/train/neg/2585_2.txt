This was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only is it almost nothing to do with the other American Pie films, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not funny. <br /> <br /> The girls are nice, but spending time watching cheap, soft porn might be bigger than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a very bad sex commercial for an audience no older than 12 years old. <br /> <br /> I have never attended an American college but I would seriously doubt that anyone who did this could really laugh at each of the scenes. <br /> Save time and do something different.
