I could not believe that some of the terrible dialogues came from the mouths of the people, and the final role of the Bloopers, who were attached to the body of the film, was a real shout. There are also a few shots of Angelique Pettyjohn (Art) and Loren Crabtree. <br /> <br /> A teleportation device activated by psychic Angelique Pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground laboratory in the desert. According to director Fred Olen Ray, these were remnants from the film by Klaus Kinski, ANDROID, which give the film a higher value than it looks cheap. <br /> <br /> Inside the container is a small alien (played by Ray) son) who starts scratching people to death. It was pretty funny to watch this little "creature" in a black reptile suit, with big beetle cases running around in the dark. We can even see the little bitch on a poster by ET, which I thought was funny. <br /> <br /> And then there's something that looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that gets hammered death by William Fair, after the mini-creature has chewed Frank McDonald's neck in the kitchen. I suppose to have aliens on a low budget. <br /> <br /> The whole thing ends abruptly and looks like the movie ends in the end, before the blooper roll enters the credits. Talk about missing funds ... <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray also mentions in the director's commentary that they were not sure if Aldo Ray would go through the filming and remember his lines. He hardly did it. <br /> <br /> Low budget cheese giant. It's fun to watch, I'll give it to you. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
