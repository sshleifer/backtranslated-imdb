A star. That's all this documentary deserves. I did not feel disappointed when I saw a movie, let alone a documentary. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the "Walking With ..." series, including Nigel Marvin spin-offs, for all their fun yet informative information. And although the topic of prehistoric man has never been as interesting to me as other prehistoric beings, the subject is still interesting and unique to explore. After seeing all the other documents from the series, I thought I must see this too, especially after seeing relatively good reviews elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Well, for those of you who have given a good review of this document ... what did you think ?! lol. <br /> <br /> Although the information they could go through was interesting, the presentation did not fail in any other way. It had a terrible flow, was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say (with jumbled information and sometimes out of place), terrible effects (including the few moments of CGI and especially the makeup effects) and the overused MTV style camera effects. <br /> <br /> Speaking of makeup effects: A reviewer mentioned how ridiculous the scene was when the cavemen came across this huge monkey and what it looks like a 70s horror movie. Well, there are many moments when the people who represent the apes are ridiculous and ridiculous. None of this is helped by terrible camera positions and compositions. <br /> <br /> The worst of all is that none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way, or looks as if it were real from a distance. It does not even look like it was taken seriously. It also lacked any emotional impact that the predecessors of the series had. Remember the episode in "Walking With Dinosaurs" about the fate of Ornithochirus (sp?)? This episode still brings tears to my eyes when I see them. This way of dealing with the topic is missing here most of all. If you are more concerned with the subject and your own personal story, even if it is just speculation, you are more interested in the facts that surround it. <br /> <br /> The only salvation from this production is the pretty good narrative (at least in the BBC version I've seen) and the music. Otherwise you should NOT rent this rental property unless you want to have a good laugh (which I often did, but usually with rolling eyes). This is not one of the other "Walking With ..." documents. <br /> <br /> And it makes sense to learn that this document was NOT produced with the same people who did it in the series? Hmmm...
