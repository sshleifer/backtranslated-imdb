I'll keep that fast and sweet. Five girls on their way home from a football game opt for a shortcut that leads them onto a deserted, wooded road. Of course, only good things happen to them, and they arrive safely at their destination. <br /> <br /> Okay, they do not do it. Soon they are chased by a confused chick who has some serious mental problems, and a 90-minute boredom follows. I hope I will never again see one of these actors in a movie. Their screeching, screeching voices gave me a headache and the script was so poorly written that it contained many repetitive sentences and nonsensical hysterical screaming. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror movies I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
