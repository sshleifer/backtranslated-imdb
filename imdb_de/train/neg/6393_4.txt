I admit that I did not give this film a chance. I decided quite early that this is not my kind of movie. <br /> <br /> In most cases, he has a great look at cinematography. The scenes of Manhattan in the early 70s look very good, as does the lead actress. It's a very crisp black and white, which makes the movie almost undated and fresh. However, some of the other techniques the filmmakers use make these prospects hell. The disjointed editing is VERY late 60s, somewhere between Surrealism and New Wave. The story also feels like it came from a very specific time, between free love idealism and artistic experimentation. The film follows a young girl in town while she is looking for a man who had an anonymous phone having sex with. When she meets other odd characters, she reveals her quirks and they reveal her. The film seems to be an unconventional comedy, but fits together avant-garde. I would expect that if you like Andy Warhol movies you would love to discover the phone book. <br /> <br /> Some problems I had: At the end of the movie, a character says a desperate anecdote that lasts about twelve minutes ?? - durchzusitzen brutally. There's also a very explicit animation sequence that I found coarse and youthful, which serves as a highlight of the movie. I laughed out loud four or five times and liked the end (apart from the disgusting animation). And when the movie for the last phone booth was switched to color at night, I liked the way it looked even better. It was one of those experiences that made me feel like I could really have liked it if it was a little different. But the filmmakers gave us that. It is dark, artistic and left over from the left edge of the dial, but none of these reasons argue for recommending it alone. I did not find it unique or creative, but forced and overbearing.
