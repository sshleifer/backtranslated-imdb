This is the kind of movie that my enemies keep seeing, but that's not really true. I just watch it from time to time to make sure it's as bad as I first thought. <br /> <br /> Some kind of gangster hijacks a Boeing 747. (That's at least an improvement over what you've got. Boeing hijacks a good part of the Pentagon.) The plane descends in the Bermuda Triangle and sinks under pressure, sort of post facto submarine. <br /> <br /> It has one of those all-star casts, either falling the stars or barely above the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We're on our own!" says Pilot Jack Lemon. He is so right. Except George Kennedy. He is in all these disaster movies. <br /> <br /> See another movie instead. Oh, not "Airport" the original. That's not good either. Instead, watch a decent movie about stuck aircraft like "Flight of the Phoenix."
