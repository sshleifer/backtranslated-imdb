I would like to say that, in contrast to many people who disliked and could not understand this film, I fully understood what it is. A very incoherent attempt at an action. <br /> <br /> I do not like to throw that word around, but in that case it fits in very well. The director initially presents the material extremely "arrogant" and worse, extremely incoherent. It is incoherent that the material is presented in a messy, unclear sequence, giving us the impression that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first, and arrogant as they expect us after 2 hours , the viewer in the end with CARE of it. <br /> <br /> I respect the surrealist cinema for what it is. (Creating a story about a more than real world that is not tied to real life) But there is nothing unreal when a story is placed in ordinary modern times and a modern world that the public, above all, does not claim But it can also just be a series of events that are barely connected. The most accurate way to describe the experience of this film is to look at a story. Maybe even a very good story as it is based on a book but frustrated that the camera does not capture the necessary moments and does not combine coherence. <br /> <br /> Let's compare stylistic cinema. Compare Gaspar Noe's "Seul contre tous" with it. He gave us a coherent, extremely responsive and intellectually deep story. This film does not offer intellectual study, and although it is very stylistic in its fragmented presentation, the director has ultimately given up the essential art of good storytelling and all that remains for us is a jumble of events that are barely linked. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is indeed possible to understand things ... to a POINT. But as I said, the viewer will reach a level where he simply says, "Who cares?" It turns out to be a dreary, banal story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in unconventional order. Even in murders it is completely uninteresting and disconnected. Nowadays, too many people will label something they can not understand or understand just because they're afraid to look stupid, and this movie tries in every way to make the viewer look stupid. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time, then watch this movie and consider what I said about it. It's a story based on a book that could have been presented in a much more effective way, and that's my conclusion.
