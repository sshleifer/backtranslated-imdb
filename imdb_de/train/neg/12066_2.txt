OK, how is that for the original? This fat old geezer is leaving his belongings to his adult children, all ungrateful losers, and two spooky servants, as long as they spend the week in his creepy old house. What happens this night will only surprise those who have not watched a movie or television program yet. After a series of murders that make the victims look as if they bleed in the ketchup restaurant, we have a painfully obvious ending. The cast is led by some formerly respected actors who have desperately needed to pay their payrolls. There are also some second-tier actors who got up at this time but have long forgotten. As a result, the film creates all the drama and mystery of an episode of Matlock. I give credit where it matters. The final scene is smart and amusing when you're still awake.
