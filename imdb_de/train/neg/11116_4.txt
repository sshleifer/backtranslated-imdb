This woman, who works as an intern for a photographer, goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. So she goes to the realization that her neighbor is a photographer. This movie could have been a great plot, but the action leaves no hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone snorts heroin. If they took out the scenes in which someone snorted heroin, this would be a pretty good movie. Every time I thought there was a scene going on somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. It was really lame to have so much drug use in a movie. It caught the attention of the main story and a great story about a photographer. The lesbian stuff did not bother me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.
