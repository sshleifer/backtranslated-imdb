I have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'Goodnight Mister Tom' for ages, and only recently did I have the opportunity to watch this adaptation. I've heard a lot of positive comments, so I had high hopes. After this movie was finished, I was horrified. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good movie at all. "Goodnight Mister Tom" was an extremely poor adaptation and practically 4.5 / 10 of the book were missed. I found out that many of the characters and some great scenes in the book were missing. There was not much dialogue, it was rushed and way too fast, but most of all I was angry that in this movie you never saw the bond and love between William Beech and Tom, which was really disappointing. The casting was not so good either. I thought that could have been really good, but it was so different from the book! Extremely bad adaptation, one of the worst I've ever seen. This deserves a decent remake, which is better than 1000 times better than this garbage heap.
