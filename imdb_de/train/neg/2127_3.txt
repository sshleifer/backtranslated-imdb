Why? For one reason, there was no more charming scene in any movie than Ann Margret, who sang "Bye Bye Birdie" at the opening. She also repeats it in the end (in a different mood!). Both wonderful. Rent it and see. Even if you see it all. They will agree, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Everything about the original was so great that it did not need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa made notable appearances as well as Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers in this new version have given it all, but it's like trying to improve on "Casablanca" - it just will not work! It's even annoying to compare them spiritually as you try to honor the remake.
