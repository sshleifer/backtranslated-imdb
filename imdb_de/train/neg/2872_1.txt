This is by far the worst horror / thriller I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers this for free, say NO. This movie makes you a stupid person because you know you've looked at him. The plot is not the worst part of this movie ... it's acting, camera work, lighting and sound. There is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. Who has paid for it, is now broke. I hope the director never gets the green light for another movie. In his defense, this movie was filmed quickly to try to capitalize on the BTK killer's actual finding, but I've seen a movie of weeks that looked compared to the Oscar winners.
