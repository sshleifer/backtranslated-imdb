The producers made a big mistake by putting Mark Lester, who could neither act nor sing, into the title role. Apart from his very bad "acting", Lester's vocals had to be dubbed by a girl. I do not know why they cast him, because there were so many guys who could have played the role infinitely better and also sang themselves. Shani Wallis was far too old to play Nancy, who was only 16 years old. The current version of the West End is in every way much better than the movie. Ross McCormack is the best artful Dodger of all time and he certainly looks much better than Jack Wild ever was. It was clearly political to give so many Oscars to this old-fashioned musical after the turbulent events of 1968.
