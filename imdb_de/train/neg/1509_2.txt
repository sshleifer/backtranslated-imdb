I really have trouble rating this movie. It's brilliant, it's obviously a lot of money in it. Gere and Danes are intense (though their on-screen personality could use a little more defining and spicing up), cut and camera are superb. On the other hand, it's one of those really really sick movies, in which you do not have to wonder if the director likes to stage certain scenes, and you can not wonder how many imitators will thrill such a movie /> <br /> From a purely artistic point of view, it's a 9, but I really have to wonder who these people give their money to produce such a movie.
