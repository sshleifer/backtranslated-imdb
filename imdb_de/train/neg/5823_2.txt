"Drawing Restraint 9" is a kind of movie you either love or hate; Fortunately or not, I have left it with a strong sense of wasting time and the thorough filling "Whale propaganda propaganda is bad". Aesthetically, the film could have fallen especially in the first half, until it is not clear that each action depicted serves as an allegory of various aspects of whale hunting. Until then, it may be a bit amusing to look at the daily tasks of Japanese workers, but later it becomes obvious that everything that appears on the screen is a propaganda and no single frame is an exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the movie essentially uses the old moral game machine, where "good" and "bad" are not derived in the course of the plot, but are carved in stone. Probably it is only me, but I find such art forms shallow and preconceived, even if it is only about the noble (here no sarcasm) search for the protection of the environment. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is a major sin when a footage is stretched without justification, just to stretch it. In my opinion, "Drawing Restraint 9" could have easily fit in 75 minutes, but has a torturous duration of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but there was not enough to not notice for 15 minutes. The film has no standard scenario and there is no evolution of the characters, but no documentation, but rather a kind of conceptual installation. This is an unusual form for a movie, but it can also be considered as an art if the concept is as simple and naive as here. OTOH I also believe that the director should have had some honesty and not pretended that he could only be delivered in 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> And yes, the music score was mostly whale song. How surprising. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
