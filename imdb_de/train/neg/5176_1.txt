If a film is independent and unrated, such as the Hamilton, I expect from the norm that you should cut out your heart's power. I know that good movies do not always contain blood and violence, but I read the reviews, visited the site, and even convinced some of my friends to pay me $ 9.50 for this horrible movie. If there's a festival called Horror Festival, I expect horror, not Dawson's Creek, with incestuous undertones. My expectations for this film were extremely low, but the small expectations of the film were turned to hell when I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood from the fingers of a participant. There were too many action holes left to the imagination. I do not regret having seen Happy Feet. I think there could have been more violence and blood in this movie than in the Hamiltons!
