The premise of this film was decent enough, but with a comparable acting it was just boring. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of the death It was a murder, it was not like the guy was doing it. Also through some flashbacks there is a mystery that makes events like justice to a certain extent. There are no emotions in this movie. For the first 20 minutes, this woman calls her sister and hears her message. It was boring and boring. <br /> <br /> With a little polishing and better acting, it could have been pretty good.
