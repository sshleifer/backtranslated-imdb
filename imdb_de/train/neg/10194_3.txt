This 30-minute documentary shot by Bu単uel in the early thirties about one of the poorest regions in Spain is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. Let us first admit that, 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and, if I say so, I fully acknowledge that wealth brings with it its own problems, such as excessive individualism and consumerism) better state than the extreme poverty depicted here ). And when poverty fell in Spain, it was not exactly the kind of socialism Bu単uel favored, but Western European capitalism. However, one of the most shocking things about this film is this: In one scene, the narrator states that children at school have learned the value of Pi. Mathematics lessons for poor people, the horror! The shortsightedness of Bu単uel is most blatant here, without realizing that access to the latest knowledge and technologies helps the poor overcome their situation. What does he suggest? That children are taught something exactly at school? Does not Bu単uel understand that the lack of modern technology has made her poor compared to other people?
