Funny how many of the people who say that this is far superior to the version of Romero tend to be very young (judging by their other posts). What we have here is a chic, action-packed, bloody and "Whoopee" filled 2-hour MTV video. Fast editing, pop video camera work, "cool" music, blah blah blah, <br /> <br /> Actually it's not bad compared to other remakes (Chainsaw Massacre was a total catastrophe) ... all pretty good Round, absolutely predictable in the stakes "Who will die next" and a sum of the name "Dawn Of The Dead", which will generate a lot of revenue just by fans of the original, who will come out of curiosity br /> <br / > Are not remakes of classics getting on their nerves? Can not you really come up with something original? Why remake of Dawn Of The Dead? The things that made the original something special (the middle segment that kids think is so boring, should be slow to show that if you get everything you ever wanted, you're not happy are missing), they are completely missing. This is an action movie, plain and simple. The faster the better. If you like action movies (and the 2004 version is good too), you're fair enough, but for those who like a little substance in their films ... get ready to sigh (again) ... <br /> <br /> Take a look at the movie theaters in the next few years, while we're the most pop-director of The Godfather series, and make Star Wars new. All the kids say that the new version is a lot better than the old version is slow and boring and keeps a camera turned for more than 5 seconds ... <br /> <br /> Not bad, but in 10 years will still debated about the Romero version, not about this daddy
