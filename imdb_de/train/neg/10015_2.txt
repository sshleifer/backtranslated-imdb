Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical 1950s teenager who is in turmoil. It's not a horror movie or sci-fi movie. Plot concerns a group of teenagers who are about to be kicked out of their "hot rod" club because they can not reach retirement. Once kicked out, they decide to try an old haunted house. The only salvation for the film is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the suit She Creature) is a movie monster played by Blaisdell.
