Greg Davis and Bryan Daly take some crazy comments from a terrorist, add some comments from a number of right-wing reactionaries, attribute the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist Muslims on the planet to anyone who calls themselves Muslims, and present this as the theology of Islam. Perhaps in their next film, they will conduct an interview with Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church Congregation, add comments from militant atheist "scholars" and call their film "What the World Needs to Know About Christianity." Ultimately, the film suffers on both arms production values ​​and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism: do not waste your time and money, just turn on your AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a few days at the same level of free intellectual analysis.
