If you find this turkey in your TV program guide, AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> start to describe how bad this movie is! There is only one funny scene (the memory eraser scene), but only 0.00 on the Lachometer (out of 1000). Whoever wrote this turkey should not be allowed to write another movie for his entire life.
