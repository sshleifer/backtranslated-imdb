For Angel Town, times are tough, gangs rule with an iron fist and for mostly unknown reasons (mainly for embarrassing writing) the gangs want a street kid, Martine joins the gangs, so they beat him up every day. However, thanks to the presence of an Olympic kickboxer (Olivier "The Most Terrifying Actor in the World") named Jacques, hope is on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most incapable news movies ever made (and I've seen my share). It seems to insist on the idea that all gang-infested neighborhoods need French kickboxers who can not act. Worst of all, there are so many unpleasant moments that it's just so funny. The best part is the exchange between Gruner and Aragon, which summarizes how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit: "You like fighting?" (Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock) I could kill him right? If I want him dead, he dies! The reason I do not want to see him dead is because I'm scared of him, and I know that if I kill him, his son and his wife will kill me, that's why he does not die! "<br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that it is wrong is to kill someone, not to mention your best friend, of course not. Strange. <br /> <br /> But do not let me make that sound that I hated this movie, far from it, it's so horrible that it's priceless. The biggest laugh comes at the end of the catastrophic finale, in which Grunner one with the gang members who (the biggest logical gap of the film) refuse the use of pistols. A Vietnamese vet with disabilities also helps by shooting at the gangs with his machine gun while Gruner hits the rest with the boxes. All of this relies on frightening "Mexican" accents and surreal energy that make it memorable for fans of movie waste like this one. <br /> <br /> The other treat about this movie is for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college, even though he's the reason he's here in the States and not in France when he's with his Girlfriend (in a graveyard at the awkward beginning of the movie) is going through. Angel Town is undoubtedly a failure on all imaginable levels, you laugh about feeble-minded martial arts films with insane action levels that make sense on any level. This is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand, be sure to drop tequila, such as the ridiculous opening song "Is not no mercy in Angel Town". <br /> <br /> * of 4 (bad)
