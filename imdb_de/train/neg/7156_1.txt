Dooohhh! My bwainn hurrrts! Well it makes after this endurance test of a movie certainly. How on earth did I manage to keep going without hitting the fast-forward button Lord only knows. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's me! Maybe I do not understand the premise of the movie ... or I do not appreciate the supposed mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, the movie has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds. <br /> <br /> Also, the characters were all terrible and there is more character development in a Tom & Jerry cartoon. Yaarrrghhh! Why do I do this? Why am I looking at such tripe? It is enough to run away and join a monastery or the Foreign Legion !! YAARGH !! An absolutely horrible movie in almost every way. Otherwise it is not so bad.
