The book is so good that at least the opening of this TV movie will move you, but it is increasingly deviating from the book, eliminating all religions, love, and math, and putting cotton candy clich√©s into boredom. Still, from comments I've heard, people who have not read the book tend to like it, and if it even causes a child to read A Wrinkle in Time, it has served its purpose. The most embarrassing change is making the Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppin's uncle Albert (I love to laugh). Nothing is as shaky as characters on the screen laughing funny at things that are completely unsteady.
