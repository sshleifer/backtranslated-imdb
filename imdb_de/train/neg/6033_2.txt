People who even remember that they saw this movie already have some perturbations in their minds. This movie has NOTHING to do with Jack the Ripper (in case you thought so), it's another B, I mean E-grade movie that consists of a bunch of horny teens in certain sex scenes that are being watched before they get their Splash spleen onto a nearby tree. It is not scary, funny or amusing. If you really feel like bloody stuff without a plot, then look at Cabin Fever, at least the director did not fall asleep in the middle of directing this filth. See this only if you have absolutely nothing to do in life and only Oprah on TV Winfrey was crying on the TV.
