What's up with Robert "Pretentious" Altman? Did he save on the lighting? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was ridiculous. I mean, have you ever seen a law office where everyone works by candlelight? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. Do not waste your time with all that Altman does: it's all a presumptuous waste of film.
