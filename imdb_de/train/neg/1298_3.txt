Sogo Ishii may be an experienced filmmaker under the right conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a scion of the Genji clan. Film production has the key features of low-budget production, including fuzzy battle scenes and awkward montages (as you might find in an underproduced dorama). Monk Benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his fate is to overcome the mysterious spirit guarding Gojoe Bridge during the night, but he does not realize that this decision will bring him into conflict with almost every element of society at that time - but which one could earn him enlightenment. <br /> <br /> However, there is no lack of ambition in portraying the conflict between the sacred and the secular. Artful flourishes in some areas of photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film style. <br /> <br /> A disappointment.
