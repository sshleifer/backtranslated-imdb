I'm soooo happy that I did not spend any money on going to the cinema :-). It is nothing more than a compilation of elements of some other classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss, etc., which are framed in a rather boring and pointless scenario. I really can not figure out what the purpose of the movie was - he has absolutely nothing new to offer in his plot, which is also pointless. Besides, there's nothing to see - the FX'es look like they've been taken out of a second hand store, they've all been seen in other movies. But it's definitely a good lullaby.
