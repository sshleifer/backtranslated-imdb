I do not agree with everything written and said about this alleged "masterpiece" of the German New Wave: <br /> <br /> 1) There are big mistakes in simple presentation, in the basic communication of critical plot points as well as over Maria's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the husband, for a substantial financial compensation, agreed not to return his wife until Oswald was dead? <br /> <br /> 2) The end is extremely unsatisfactory because of arbitrariness and coincidence. The original script demanded that Mary commit suicide after reading Oswald's will when she found out that her husband had actually sold her marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs out of suicide water from a faucet over her wrist. Maria was blown up for a short time instead of having to deal with the consequences of her self-deception and her moral compromise. 3) Fassbinder tries to superimpose the public on the private and the political on the personal. Contrary to what the critics and "experts" claim, I do not think it works. Only the penetration of historic radio news or the sound of jackhammers of the German reconstruction in the soundtrack to the dramatic events of the film does not make these historical events an essential part of the drama. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambition of Mary's rise from poverty to prosperity should correspond to the so-called economic miracle of post-war Germany. Mary should therefore be a woman who is specific to and reflects her time and place, but in reality she is not original and not specific. Women claim to have their independence by using sex for themselves to improve themselves. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are several examples of inexcusable sloppiness and capriciousness - Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have been effective. Unknown people talk outside the screen without ever being seen. Music is awkwardly intrusive in places; and melodramatic posturing sporadically replaces acting. Oddly enough, a film that condemns a country for arbitrary collective amnesia of the Holocaust never mentions it.
