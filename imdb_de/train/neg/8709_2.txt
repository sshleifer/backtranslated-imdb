Arg. The shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our brains in this terrible third movie. This time European terrorists (Irish, I would say) have a convoy of the army to transport uranium. They move into a shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends, the carnosaurs. Pandemonium comes to visit as the rubber dinosaurs plague terrorists, police and some marines. The whole movie seems (again) largely inspired by aliens (like Carnosaur 2), with the miserable marines going through the "claustrophobic" shipyard. Weapons ready. This third work is probably the driest and most impenetrable film in the pack, with only one burst of blood when a rubber dino tears the head off a Marine head. The dinosaurs are as usual stiff, shuffling creatures and the T-Rex sounds like an angry elephant when it roars (it does not seem to have eyes). One of the film's most ridiculous scenes is when the copper donors arrive at the scene: they enter the building where the abducted truck is housed and hear strange noises from another truck. When opening surprise! The Rubber Reptile Gang set out and devoured it. Why were the Dinos imprisoned after escaping from the first in the second truck? How were they locked up because the truck door could only be locked from the outside? What was the point of turning this scene ???? Oh trouble, who cares? Both thumbs down for the oversized rubber iguanas.
