The only thing The First Power really has to offer is that it gives Jeff Kober the opportunity to play one of his sexy variations of psychotic villains that he has done so well over the past 25 years. Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger, who specialized in these parts in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> But it's not enough, The First Power is an excited slasher strip who has wasted Lou Diamond Phillips as a LAPD detective. Who has a specialty in catching serial killers. Kober is his newest catch, but Kober is in the league with a lower performance and they will team up and make Lou's life unhappy for him. Even after Kober has received the gas chamber, his mind returns in all possible forms. Mykelti Williamson is present as a lous partner experiencing a nasty end to a demon-possessed horse and Tracy Griffith as a mate to help psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with insights Lou. Will he succeed in fighting forces from beyond the grave? <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you do not care. Lou was really trapped in a turkey. Maybe the devil let him do this movie.
