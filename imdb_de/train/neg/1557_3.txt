The movie is basically a boring series of terrible stereotypes that do not provide real intercultural insight. The eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way: there are obviously mudbrick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women in black robes and belly dancers. I wonder how the whole picture lacked camels and date palms. The personality of the two main characters is sketched very awkwardly and many situations are hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day you should skip this movie if you are looking for cultural insights.
