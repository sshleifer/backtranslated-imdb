It's been around 14 years since Sharon Stone gave the viewers a crossover that twisted many people's minds. And now, God knows why, she's back in the game. "Basic Instinct 2" is the sequel to the erotic "Basic Instinct" with a sexy Stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas. Fans of the original may not even come close to it, as "Instinct 2" is a painful filmmaking, as mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones murders the legacy of the first film. <br /> <br /> The storyline of the movie begins when a car explodes right at the beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, trying to be sexy) is a suspect and seems involved in the murder. A psychiatrist (a dreadful David Morrisey) is appointed to investigate her, but eventually he falls in love with an intimate seduction game. <br /> <br /> And without further explanation it is the basic force that moves this "instinct." There is not much explanation and we have to move through a dark C-class erotic movie her first role in which she is mostly a departure, part of it because of the amateurish writing, the careless direction, and the frighteningly low chemistry.The film is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (a three-movement scene was cut off) she was not classified as NC-17) as the first show in the series. "Instinct" is a compelling torture. <br /> <br /> To top it off, all that made the original movie a guilty pleasure Acting here is really bad, Sharon Stone has some highlights, but here she gets extremely uncomfortable, David Morrisey plays the worst role of his life and never seems to me in the movie to give hr as two forms of expression - confused and excited. "Instinct 2" is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series that introduced thrillers to eroticism extremely well. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you ... <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" never sounded like a good movie, and it is not. Some movies should never come out of paper, and that's the feeling you get after watching. Now it is much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg are leaving the company and why Sharon Stone was expecting a big paycheck for this .......... 3/10
