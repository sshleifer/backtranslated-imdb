I saw the Canadian videotape of this movie as "The Witching", which somehow got into the state of New York. The audio was pretty bad, I had to raise it to 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often overwhelmed the dialogue. Orson Welles was a groundhog, worse than usual, and some of his dialogues and others were led through an echo chamber. A ghostly figure who keeps coming back had a distorted voice. Some subtitles really helped! <br /> <br /> A group of witches or satanists (in the credits, the group should not represent a real group!) Have a ritual where they strip naked and have a cause miscarriage by stinging a doll. The woman who had the miscarriage and her husband move to a town called "Lilith", where he is offered a job in a toy factory. Although one of the AKAs of this film seems to be "The Toy Factory," we never see it, and it's only occasionally mentioned. On the way to Lilith, her husband will ask with some impatient questions about what his new boss, Mr. Cato, wanted to know about their religious beliefs. He drives aggressively and lets another car drive off the road and blow up. After the police arrive, she takes a doll that has fallen out of the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the movie. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mr. Cato and all the inhabitants are witches and that they are the ones who caused her miscarriage, even though she did not notice. They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy she did not really know. <br /> <br /> Some pictures in the movie have some influence, but overall, the movie is not very involved. The film looks a bit chaotic, and that is undoubtedly because it has been reworked and new material added. The original version was called the end credits Nekromanie - A life for a living. The magic of the DVD could show us both versions on a single disc, but reissuing this movie is probably not a priority.
