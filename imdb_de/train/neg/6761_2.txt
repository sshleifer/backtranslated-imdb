Let's face it. As a film school project without budget and "real" actors, this is a very interesting film. As something to be released on DVD for an innocent bystander, it is a very poorly produced product. If I were to change channels involuntarily and catch the movie by accident, it would probably stop my eye and attention for a while. As a person who bought this DVD with the impression that I would be a real movie product, d. H. I am deeply disappointed in receiving a film. It's a video-based television game, something along the line of old sixties series, but without that kind of charm. Apart from the leading man, Mr. Redfield (who is also the director), the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus (for that actually a bit too old) or members of the director's household who appear to be on camera without anything not only by the current sofas, but also by the make-up artist or hairdresser (a hood over over-grown pony or a cylinder over mullet is a very long way from the 1840s). It's all taken with a motionless mounted camera in a small, nude studio, sometimes with blue screen for outdoor use. The synthesizer produced a non-inspired score from a lame "period," which on more than one occasion resulted in romantic karaoke attacks on the audience's ears. The movie is trying to be "gorgeous," while in fact it's just a conceptless collage of those recordings that made it to cut (and believe me, the standards were not too high to start with). There are sometimes interesting dialogues, but on the whole it is quite lame and two-dimensional, in more ways than one, with no ingenious moments of the director or any other crewmember. Thus, "artistic" films in the 80s tried to look. Mr. Redfield is much better as an actor than the director.
