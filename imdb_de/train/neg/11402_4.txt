Exactly what you would expect from a B-movie. Positive, unpaid nudity, sometimes boring, ridiculous blood and kitschy special effects. Of course it could have been better, better (better) played, better written, directing etc. But then I think it would not have been a B-movie. The actors were pretty shitty, in fact, it was a bit like an episode of Buffy, the vampire hunter, or something except a lot of blood, madness and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis needs to be highlighted. She is absolutely the cry queen of the new millennium. Not that acting is really important in these films, but she was better than any other actor. She also smokes hot in that plastic suit she wore the whole movie - wow! Her rump is absolutely stunning in this outfit. I mean, every time she turns around, you can help, but find out. And at the end of the movie, the viewer is rewarded when he sees them completely nekked. <br /> <br /> So if you have a looser B-movie horror buff (like me), then look at that. If not, you should avoid it at all costs.
