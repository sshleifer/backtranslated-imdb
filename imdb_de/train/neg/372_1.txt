I've seen this movie a long time ago and I do not feel like ever seeing it again. <br /> <br /> This film is about Preston Waters, an unlucky Preteen who is always overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short of money. All this changes when a bank robber drives over Preston's bike and hands him a blank check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). Preston then buys a mansion and says he works as an assistant to a mysterious and affluent lender called Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). After that, he only makes money with the money. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a great idea on paper. On the screen, however, it is one of the most emptier films I have ever seen. For one thing, it's too incredible. I know that some parts of the film should be incredible, but I draw the line to a twelve-year-old boy who goes out with a thirty-year-old woman and is held responsible for the small fortune of an imaginary person. This was also a flat film with weak acting, a predictable plotline and characters that are less than memorable. The characters were either cheesy, over the top, annoying or underdeveloped. But "Juice" was a funny character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie with your family, skip it.
