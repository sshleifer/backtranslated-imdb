The first cube movie was an art film. It has created a world in which all the important archetypes of humanity are represented, and it showed how they endeavored to understand a hostile world that they could not understand. On a non-literal level, it was an act "man against cruel nature," in which the individual, representing innocence and kindness, came to the end and encountered a new, indefinable world beyond man's petty quarrels. a world in which there was no fight, but peace. I rated Cube 10 out of 10, and it was a movie never intended for sequels. <br /> <br /> The second movie, Hypercube, was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the environment made no sense and had no meaning. To be quite entertaining, I still rated it 5 out of 10. The third movie, Cube Zero, plays the second and ignores the second movie. He plays like a very low-quality commercial B-movie rehash of the first movie. without the symbolism. There is no "homage" or "tribute" here; it is only torn off. The same kind of plot in which some elements have been idiotically altered (like letters instead of primes between the cubes - an idea that shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off without any originality and nothing to say). <br /> <br /> Seeing something "behind the scenes" does not mean anything, because the observers are just part of the Big Bad experiment, whose architects we hear nothing about. And in this movie, those who get to the exit (like Kazan at the end of the first movie) are simply killed - where is the * bleep * the point ?! That's just stupid. I'm glad I did not pay for it. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​and action in Cube Zero are not so bad, but the story and ideas are so completely devoid of any inspiration that this movie offers can only get a rating of 3 out of 10 from me ,
