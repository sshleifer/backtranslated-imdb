As a player, I can not say that I like this movie. The fact is, I hate it. I tried to make it as open as possible, but when it comes down to it, it feels pretty offensive to my social group. <br /> <br /> For me, there are several reasons why. <br /> <br /> 1. The characters seem unnatural. I have met many players from all walks of life. I do not know anyone who behaves like one of the characters in the movie. It's as if the film's producers picked up the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and set them all at 5 people. Most players are more social people, some with a more active life. <br /> <br /> 2. The style does not work. The memento style does not fit the theme of the film. A recent documentary about gamers would actually work better. Although it looks good (ie neatly put together), it is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural. There also seems to be no real context. Players swear I admit that, but we do not have Tourette Syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. The humor is missing. Self-deprecating humor is indeed a major component of my group and several other groups I've encountered. However, this is less self-irony and more like toilet humor. Likewise, a lot of the gamer humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most players would refuse and avoid anyone who made such jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically this: accuracy. I do not mean rules, but dynamics. This film is invariably compared to the even cheaper The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both of which present the players as actual players playing a real game. The difference is, gamer: The film is a situation in which you want to defeat the players against the gamers against the gamers, in which you can say, "Huh, I know a guy like that ... Yeah, that's definite like Gary. "
