Just the good old fool. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, not the good fools like Killer Tomatoes or Ed Wood movies. This is probably the stupidest movie I have ever seen. Giving this movie a golden turkey is an insult to turkeys. To call this film dumb is offensive even to dumb people. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American cinema and American art, we are better off to start World War 3 and 4 at the same time and let cockroaches run the show afterwards. <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult on my only braincell .... <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie if you are suicidal.
