Tourists travel to Ireland for a school trip to learn about druids. What they encounter is a terrible story of cannibalists. <br /> <br /> If I had to sum up Evil Breed, that would be a bad gore feast. The film mixes Dead Alive, Evil Dead and Wrong Turn in one. It's just too bad that the movie has so many inconsistencies that it loses the "fun" when you see it. The film has many random "horror" nudity ... although the movie also has four porn stars and four to four stars, there could have been much more. Breed also shows a good amount of blood. <br /> <br /> Evil Breed has a terrible start with ridiculous dialogue and terrible acting. This is given in a horror movie directly to the video, but that costs the cake. I can not really figure out who the main character is because the one woman who "lives" at the end is not really much in the movie. Speaking of the end, this must be one of the most random and fake end results in the history of the movie. With the rest of the film, it makes no sense and completely changes his view of the film. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie to believe it, as there are some pretty great death scenes. There are two death scenes that come to my mind, one in which the inbreed killer of a naked woman tears the bowel from her breast ... yes, her breast, do not ask me. The other id, when the guy gets his guts, torn out through his asshole again. Does that kill the guy? No, the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own gut. These scenes remind me so much of Dead Alive, with the right amount of humor. I also got the feeling of Evil Dead with the senseless mentions of horror movies and Sam Raimi. Along with Halloween, when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life, the killer desperately tries to get involved. <br /> <br /> Although the thrill and nudity are not enough, this is the quality of the film's poor sound and picture quality. When the teacher wakes up from her bed and goes downstairs, her steps are so loud and hard that it looks like she was wearing boots. In fact distract. As well as the continuity in the movie with only one inbred killer? And which character dies at what time. I could not say if the breast implant chick was Jenny or Gary's sister / cousin ... I can not remember. Just like the accidentally naked chick with a dead baby still attached to the umbilical cord. <br /> <br /> The terrible editing also distracts, the opening speeches are too fast and confusing. It got off to a bad start and got better, but the end just brings the movie back to a terrible level. If there were perhaps better production values ​​and more confidence in this film, then he would not have been cruelly slaughtered. Stay away from this movie unless you are satisfied with proper blood with the frighteningly bad movie, which is below budget.
