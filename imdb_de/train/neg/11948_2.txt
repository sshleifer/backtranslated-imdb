Terrible looting of a classic. <br /> <br /> It was not convincingly written why Mary should develop such compassion for Bates. He may be more stable until he starts playing pranks with him, but he still does not help himself with his actions. (He asked a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his recently vacated motel, tell the attractive young girl his past mental problems, lie about the knifes, etc.). This should keep Mary extremely suspicious, in addition to her previous knowledge, but that does not happen, just so they can later play the False Identity Murder game. Which in itself is ridiculous: "So and so is the true murderer - and she too - he too! There were too many twists and turns to put a story on the screen if the narrative did not need to be expanded. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Perkins playing his famous role again, but that's the only little treat to be ripped off. It's definitely not a hit on Hitchcock, and if you do not even try to be closer, you should not bother about it at all.
