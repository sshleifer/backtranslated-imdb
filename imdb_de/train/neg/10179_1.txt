This movie is a shame for the Major League franchise. I live in Minnesota and even I can not believe they dumped Cleveland. (Yes, I know, at the time the real Indians were pretty good, and the Twins had taken their place at the end of the American League, but are still consistent.) Anyway, I loved the first Major League, the second and always I was pleased me on the third, as the Indians would finally go all the way to the series. You can not tell me that this was not the plan after the second movie was finished. What happened? If you're a true fan of the original Major League, do yourself a favor and do not look at this trash.
