STUDIO 666 (also known as THE POSTESSED in the UK) is another subordinate Slasher who has the appearance of a direct DVD movie. <br /> <br /> While many of the direct DVD movies are fast. STUDIO 666 is a terrible or unintentionally funny in the so-bad-sense-sense sense. A terrible failure. At the time of writing, each comment on the first page contains a negative rating and a negative rating. Each of these people hit the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> The two people (who wrote at the time of writing) who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously. Obviously, they have seen few Slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror. <br /> <br /> The only really positive thing I can say about this film is that it is better than THE CHOKE and ONE OF THEM, two very mediocre slasher films that I do not want my worst enemy would! <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie must have been made hundreds if not thousands of times. The film has only a slight twist (and one that is treated poorly) that meets the usual expectations. A depressed singer commits suicide. Soon after, her mind returns to possess one of her surviving friends. The obsessive obsessed friend makes a murder rush. The rest of the plot is really too bizarre to sum up. You just have to see it for yourself, assuming your interest is not quite extinct, of course. <br /> <br /> The acting in the movie is for the most part very bad. The actress who played Dora was an exception. Her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen. It helps to raise the movie about similar contemporary endeavors. Unfortunately, some of the lines she was told were badly written, to say the least, and prevent her from saving the film. <br /> <br /> The direction was just as bad. The villains did not seem threatening, every murder was completely stress-free, the atmosphere was not there and the camera work was incredibly easy. Some of the special effects (if you can call them that) reminded me of the television series GHOST STORIES. Unfortunately, for the producers of this film, GHOST STORIES has intelligently written screenplays, shown credible performance, and made excellent use of the camera angles. If the producers had looked closely at the television series, they might have found a few other techniques that could have saved that excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> The music is totally unsuitable for the sound of the movie. It's just rock music and not the best examples of this kind. Do not get me in the horrible song that was played at the beginning! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film, especially the dialogue, are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, they are not funny enough to bring the movie up (or it should be down) to the bad level. <br /> <br /> All in all, STUDIO 666 is a profane, mediocre slasher with very few noteworthy aspects. I recommend this only for those who are fans of DVD movies and have the desire to see every single Slasher ever made.
