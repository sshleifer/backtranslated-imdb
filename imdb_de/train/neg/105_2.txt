There are tons of good-looking women in this movie. But this film is unfortunately naked. Grrrrrrrrrrrr Hit one. <br /> <br /> Um. A story in this movie takes place in 1971. Why the hell are the lead actors doing a Kia Sportage? Hello? Continuity, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you may know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And it's the most terrifying effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure if someone messed up the job, but there was no 3D image, just double blurring. I did not have the same problem with the other 3D movies of this company, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Sure, the 3D in those things sucked too, but with them I could see a semblance of 3D effect. <br /> <br /> This thing is a big ball of nothing Women was the daughter of the ear-eating lady, yummy! I would like to see more of her. Also in movies. Looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
