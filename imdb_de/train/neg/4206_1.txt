I was at the film's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the show, when the writer / director and some performers answered the question, nobody could bother asking any. Rarely was a film so poorly staged (why were random frames cut out of some scenes?) Misbehaved (David Arquette to describe Dorothy Parker) does not execute the emotional scale from A to B. He parks at A and brings a lunch) and completely pointless. Characters behave without reason for no reason, unless the plot is forced to move in certain directions. Finally, the film comes to a completely random and meaningless end that "really makes you think". Unfortunately, what makes you think, "Well, there are 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back."
