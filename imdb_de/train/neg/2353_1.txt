Madhur has given us a powerful movie Chandni Bar in the past. His next movie was one of the worst movies ever. It apparently tells the story of some high-class people in India. After seeing a scene in which the man forces another man to star in a movie for sexual reasons. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. By chance, I have done. The reason was that the film contains scenes of child pornography and harassment. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked kids. Very disturbing stuff, it was not necessary to show the children completely naked. One of the rich men loves to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreigners, British men in this movie. I am shocked to know that this film was a hit in parts of India, otherwise super flop in the UK, US and Australia. I am from UK, and this type of stuff makes me sick, should not be published in the UK.
