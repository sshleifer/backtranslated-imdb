I've seen this movie on TCM in the last few hours. From what I saw, there were some problems with the movie. First, the adults did not age when the children were 10 years old. Some parts of the film had problems with continuity. For some reason, the actor who played the youngest son looked like the eldest when the 10 years had passed. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was missing for about 20 minutes or so, at least a big black screen gap appeared. It's too bad, because although the script left something to be desired, Bergman & Russell have both done a good job in their roles. It is a shame that the big piece is missing, but what is here can be viewed. <br /> <br /> I just wish it was all intact. The script makes little sense as Bergman's character is sent away when the kids are small, but then brought back to take care of them when they grow up. Some timelines are not useful. There is a stock market crash reminiscent of 1929, but the children grow up in World War I to fight. The spectacles of the supporters in this movie are fine. I'm just wondering what was in the movie gap that I could not see because it was missing.
