Usually I love lesbian movies, even if they are not very good. I'm biased, I guess! <br /> <br /> But this is just the pit. Yes, the scenery and buildings are beautiful and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this movie is just a waste of time. Annamarie alternates between pouting and sitting up / stoned / giving out drugs or alcohol, and Ella inexplicably admits to this heinous behavior throughout the movie. At no point do we get an insight into why this is so, or even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If there had been at least some kind of closure in the (possibly romantic) cause, not even know it!) Relationship between the two, there could have been some kind of satisfaction. But even though Annamarie Ella asks at some point, "Why do you love me?" Ella does not even acknowledge that. It's never really clear if this is more than a (badly educated) lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight woman. <br /> <br /> Even the interactions between the two women and the locals they encounter on the island The journey, which could have been lively and informative, is rather flat, boring and mostly incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There's a good joke in the movie, though I'm sure it was not intended. The women travel in a two-seat Ford coupe with a medium-sized trunk. But when they set up camp, they have a huge tent, cots, sleeping gear and even a table, chair and typewriter! If you board a ferry, we also see luggage stacks, presumably their, probably in the trunk of the small Ford! <br /> <br /> And throughout the movie, we never see a gas station or anywhere it looks like it actually has a place to buy gas. Most of the time they travel through endless miles of lonely desert. So, where did you get fuel? <br /> <br /> There may not be too many lesbian movies, good or bad, but there are many that are better than these, and very few are worse. Leave this in the rack.
