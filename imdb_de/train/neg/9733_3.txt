A pretty bad Firestarter clone that looks more like a bad TV movie than a bad movie. How disappointing that this comes from Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> Government officials are conducting a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb. The boy from the experiment constantly has a fever of 100 degrees. When he grows up, people spontaneously start burning in his life. He tries to find out why. <br /> <br /> The people who are completely on fire are well done, but when they get to the point that they are well-made in another sense, they obviously become dummies. When fire-blasting shoots out of the characters' arms, it looks silly instead of alerting the way it should. Also ridiculous is the fire, which apparently flows through the telephone lines and exits in huge nozzles from the receiver's receiver. How should that happen exactly? <br /> <br /> Another thing I find stupid in the movie is when a character has visions of his deceased parents. In home videos we see later exactly the same footage from these visions.
