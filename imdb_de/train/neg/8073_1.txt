If the author / director reads this (and I imagine you're unemployed now), then I have to tell you - I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this one gets the distinction that I have the worst premise ever heard. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. I laughed out loud at the end. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE - (If the whole movie of her was in a coma, does the scene of her sleeping with this guy mean someone who raped her when she was knocked out?) <br /> <br /> Absolute nonsense.
