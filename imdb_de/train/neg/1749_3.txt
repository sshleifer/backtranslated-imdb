I have to say that this was the worst movie of Priyadarshan (besides the much better Kyonki, which was also his directing project). It does not contain a specific plot and focuses only on the body presentation, debuting actresses and some stupid comedy sequences. I think that Priyadarshan gets too repetitive in his comedy films, just as Govinda and David Dhavan did in the past after giving some good entertainers who also lost their audience. Try some variations in his direction , Give us more of Herapheri's and Malamal Weeklys than Duds like Garam Masala!
