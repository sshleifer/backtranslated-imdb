"Soul Survivors" is the latest entry in the category "Who Is Dead and Who Alive" of horror movies. Two teenage couples, Sean and Cassie, Matt and Annabel, are getting ready for different colleges. But before they break up until Thanksgiving Break, they visit one last time a rave party in a parched church, at the suggestion of luscious slutty Annabel (Eliza Dushku, aka Faith, the other vampire hunter). Uncanny, creepy boys start paying too much attention to Cassie (the generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons never to be explained, and soon the quartet leaves the party. They drive off in their SUV and are chased by the devoid-minded scary boys who promptly and inexplicably make a 180-degree weapon in the middle of the freeway and cause a nasty and fatal accident. Sean is killed (or is he?) And Cassie spends the rest of the movie dealing with loneliness and guilt (she drove) if she's not followed by Sean's mind or persecuted by these devoid-minded, scary fellows. Many inexplicable incoherence ensues as Cassie's mental state continues to degenerate until we reach a predictable conclusion. So who is dead and who lives? Who cares after ninety minutes of this purgatory?
