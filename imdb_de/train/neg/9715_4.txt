This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino's sharp-witted character would have been transferred to the "rubber cannon troupe" years ago. The entire team consists of unscrupulous egomaniacs measuring people whose actions go back decades by the 2007 standards. Every Vietnam Veteran character they've ever had turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There was only one black killer asked by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a "racial traitor" who killed another Hispanic to commit a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (of course) two rich white children committed. What a lot of propaganda. Hey, screenwriters: Minorities and poor people commit murder too. Only in this show are there most of the upper class killers. In addition, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s and 90s are a joke for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago. No real prosecutor will demand a murder because it means the state gets stuck in its huge medical bills until they finally kick. The state would do a favor to their families and insurance companies. The prosecutor will only ask them for involuntary manslaughter, and they will not stay in office for one day. The only really old criminals going to jail are either organized criminals or former Nazis whose high-profile beliefs promote DA's career.
