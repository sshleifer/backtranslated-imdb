After seeing the trailer for this movie and finding out that Spike Lee was directing, I was excited to hear about this event. I did not live at that time, I did not live in New York, so I expected more history lessons than anything else. What I got was an interesting drama, a lot of sex and about 30 minutes of film that actually had something to do with Sam's son. I think the movie was not about Sam's son, but it was a look into the summer of '77. Despise me disappointed. <br /> <br />
