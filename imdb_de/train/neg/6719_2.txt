This is a great idea for a movie, but unfortunately it turns out that this is not a great movie. What starts off as a sweet and almost silly romantic comedy about a fluffer falling in love with his Fluffee is out of control, a bizarre combination of genres and a true stew of action, with generous bows from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK and even a strange "blow" of 400 hits thrown in towards the end. (At least the director has done his research!) The result is not necessarily boring, but in the end makes this smooth, well-produced film nothing. However, the actors all do a game job with the material and there are some good laughs about the gay behind-the-scenes porn scene. <br /> <br />
