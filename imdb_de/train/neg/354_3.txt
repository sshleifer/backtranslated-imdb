Take a look at the wonderful selection of talents compiled for this film: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen and even Cameos by Slezak, Lange and Plimpton. They piquantly prove the saying that a good cast can not save a bad script. The storyline requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its implausibility would have even surpassed the Hollywood standards. It is not very original and the "turns" are downright cruel.
