How many times do we have to see evil horror movies with a killer in a screaming rip-off mask? The plot of Bleed is somehow original, but the movie itself is a complete failure. For one, the dialogue is poorly developed, boring and wasting too much time on insignificant details, acting bad and so on. I want my money back, this rent stinks worse than a skunk.
