Dear Richard, I know that we all loved you at Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, apart from lame sequels to Air Bud, you have nothing else to do? I thought Tim would have given you a role now, or even his personal assistant. I know that sounds ironic, but the wage advantages are far more rewarding. <br /> <br /> Everyone would see you near Tim and immediately think of "Tool Time". They would even get more roles with Bob Vila. Instead, appear with a Golden Retriever for 10 minutes and smile. I know that there was not a big script, but you could have added it. I mean, come on. Tim owes you something. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this movie does not do anything for the Air Bud line. On the contrary, the fake talking puppies are crazier than actually when the dogs play sports. The original was better. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, know that more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> This is an "F" movie.
