R Balki tries to tell you a story that Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd had told in a sensual way. This time it is mixed with ripe humor. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and owns Indian cuisine in London. He is very dominant and arrogant and respects his job like any other job. Cooking is an art for him. Hyderabadi Biryani still can not get it right. <br /> <br /> Enter Taboo, who sends her the right Hyderabadi Biryani, who was made by her, and they soon meet and fall in love. Amitabh is 65 and Taboo is 35 ?? No problem! But a hitch! Taboo Father Paresh Rawal !! The couple decide to meet the father for approval of their marriage. But Amitabh realizes that Taboo's dad is much younger. And the complications begin? In terms of performance, all three actors are brilliant. The script of the film is very close and interesting. The dialogues of the film are catchy. But somewhere you can feel that the stomach is not filled properly. The comedy is sometimes misunderstood. The film also tries to go a little longer in some places. <br /> <br /> Not much to sing musically except the title track. The camera work is good. Director R. Balki could have said much better with this script. In the second half he himself looks confused. The "Satyagrah" scene of the father looked irritating. But the lines that Amitabh Bachchan spoke during this scene are gossipy. <br /> <br /> Overall, Cheeni Kum had to have more sugar!
