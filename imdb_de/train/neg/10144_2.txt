As Steven Segal films go, this is the bottom of the barrel. His best was food for bored teens. This tilts the scales and then drops off. The characters are all cardboard. The story is twice as lame. I can not ruin it by telling you the end. You already know how all Steven Segal movies end up when you see one. Here goes. He's a super agent who knows too much to pull off, so they decide to kill him instead of killing him until he can not squat down. He escapes naturally, gets arrested and is tracked down by his old general, who needs his one million-year-old man to get back a stealth plane that was surprised by a winged air force pilot who has handed over a terrorist group in Afghanistan. Segal trains. All heroes, except for Segal's character and his gloomy girlfriend, die heroically, and Steve Baby saves the whole world in one fell swoop or collapses. What ever. Made with a little more Air Force and naval aviation film. And many boom-boom. Get some Popeye cartoons instead.
