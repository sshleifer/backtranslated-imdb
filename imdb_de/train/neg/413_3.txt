This is the kind of movie that makes an impression. Story Writing IS what filmmaking is about. <br /> <br /> Incredible visual effects. Very good acting, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect .. Except .. The story is just poor and so everything fails. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you have the power to be invisible. What would you do? Well, our crazy scientist (played by Kevin Bacon) could not come up with anything other than caressing and raping women. This is all that his supposedly "genius" mind could think. Is he trying to gain extra power? No, he does not even bother to become visible again. The guy is basically a crazy sex madman. <br /> <br /> Added to this is the laboratory atmosphere. They have all these young men. They throw jokes like in a bar. If it were not for all those white coats and gear you would think this would be a bad imitation of "Cheers". Very flat and poor personalities, and very little care is taken to make you think that these guys are anything but lambs for the Wolf of the Hollow Man. <br /> <br /> Even as a thriller, the movie is way too short, since most of the "exciting" scenes are so poorly advertised and filled with illogical behaviors of screaming actors "this is just a stupid thing I need to do so that the Hollow man can find me alone and kill me. "<br /> <br /> If you read the actual book while the scientist (Cane) pursues the women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and worrying thoughts that In the movie, Cane is only the sick person who goes to a crowded market to rub his body with women and step on it.
