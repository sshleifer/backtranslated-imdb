"Tapeheads," a heinous, at times funny parody of the music video business, could have been the perfect comedy, and the stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly in the swing of nonsense chaos. They play two half-savvy Los Angeles security men who set up their own company, Video Aces, to make funny videos for groups, parties and a deathbed star. It 's too bad that the filmmakers had to invent a muted subplot to refresh the runtime (phenomena that involved a crooked politician and his henchmen who do little else but counteract the film' s main strength and spread the US music culture at the end of the film) 80s). Still, Cusack and Robbins are creating some originals here: nerdy but laid back, street-smart, hipster-free or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength and never bump into each other. They are the right thing in buddy comedies. * 1/2 of ****
