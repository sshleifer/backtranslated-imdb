Oh god, what a horrible, horrible movie. This is a commentary on the state of society and reflects only the worst of the worst in reality TV. Interstitials hosted by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most disgusting part, written in a tone that may be reflective and enlightening. Rather, these moments are mind-boggling when they talk to the camera in a dialogue written by someone who has the love of insulting, condescending speech that pushes the movie's "meaning" into the viewer's throat. a point for budding filmmakers: Long scenes and quiet scenes are not all art. Extreme angles or logic are not enough for absurdity. <br /> <br /> If anyone out there is interested in watching this movie, please do not. Serious. You're welcome. They have better things to do.
