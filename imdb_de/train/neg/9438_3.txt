Have you ever seen a movie that has lost the storyline? Well, it did not even have one to start with. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? The painfully boring scenes of our heroine, who sat around the house and actually even during the seemingly constant thunderstorms (which, oddly enough, never really heard in the house-sized double glazing) have emerged. However, the house, which seems to be only a few miles from a city, is several hours away (?) Or the third girl who makes no sense of the conspiracy except to deliver a surprisingly quick murder while boredom becomes unbearable. Or even the beginning, which suggests a series of more than 20 murders across the region, although it is obvious that the killer never dares to venture far from the house? Or the bizarre salt and pepper ritual that governs most movies in-house. <br /> <br /> Add a lead actress who can not act but is totally irrelevant to Naked Showering and this video is really uncomfortable, but not in the way you hope. <br /> <br /> Given a following that was banned in Britain in the 80s (mostly because of a final surprise murder) It offers nothing but curiosity and a classic "stupid" murder (do not worry - it will be telegraphed at least ten minutes before). <br /> <br /> After a walk in the woods, our victim gets a rather steep climb, which they obviously have to fight. Halfway up, they see a black-clad figure swinging a big scythe. What do you do? Slides and how the rest of us run? No, of course not - they fight hard up and stand comfortably and upright in front of the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> It's really just a movie, as they say.
