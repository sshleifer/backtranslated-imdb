Salvage: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets a horror movie by the Christian Coalition. Okay, maybe it's not that bad. But it is close. <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Lauren Currie Lewis, Alicia Silverstonesque) is being followed and possibly killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, who is rather threatening and brutal). I may say, because she wakes up and it was all a dream? .. or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The film's basic problem is that this fifteen-minute plot (well done the first time) is repeated over and over again. And since Claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or an alternate reality, I just stopped worrying about what happened to Claire and wondered what lame phrases would pull it all down in the end. <br /> <br /> I wanted a s√©ance (which honestly would have made more sense), got instead one of the too obvious half-surprise (Think the Village or Below). Yup breaks the movie faster than the directors of Donnie Darko have cut. All the great spins in the horror movies The Sixth Sense, the original Body Snatchers invasion and Happy Birthday to Me worked because the audience did not expect an explanation for the left field. (Even the canoe, which ended on Friday, the 13th, was worth a jolt.) Salvage, on the other hand, screamed with each scene change. Other nagging mistakes are the monotonous piano soundtrack (although the featured songs were decent), the obvious time (Claire's washing up, Claire's subplots), the way Claire says "Hello everyone's there" if she thinks it's a show gives killer around. <br /> <br /> Also, some of the secondary roles (notably Claire's mother, played by Maureen Olander, who resembles a Mary Kay zombie) show for the first time that actors have low budgets. <br /> <br / Both are too half-witted and not nearly smart enough that salvage arouses your interest just to see how they fix this mess. The problem is that they really do not do it.
