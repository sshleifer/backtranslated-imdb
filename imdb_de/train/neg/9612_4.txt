Until the end, the bad guys always have the upper hand, which challenges the competence of the good guys. A few innocent people who have been charged with a crime are irritating. Some unnecessary dialogues in which various boring legal issues are debated. This is just a mediocre, mute Western, so what nonsense is it to try to keep things "realistic"? Cagney's atypical presence in a Western is one of the few - if not the only - entertainment in the film. Somewhere in the middle there is a ridiculously timely marriage proposal; Somehow like "Where is the kid hiding? !! Where is he ?! ... Oh, and by the way, do you want to marry me?"
