Serum is about a crazy doctor who finds a serum that uses the power of the mind to cure all diseases. Instead, it creates a kind of monster that has to eat human flesh and brain. Crazy Doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems. The action is very long, many scenes familiarize you with the characters. The crazy doctor's nephew gets into a car accident and Crazy Doc tries to apply his new serum to the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C movie with OK, but it does cause some straightening and some continuity errors. There is not much zombie action in this and the effects are sufficient, but nothing special. You can quickly move through the slow parts and enjoy the action scenes. Pay attention to nudity and bad language.
