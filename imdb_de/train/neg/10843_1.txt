This may have been made to hell, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen in years. The best of the entire DVD would be the case! I am surprised that people took the time to do some garbage and still spend money on it. I am glad that I only rented. I think the real fans of this movie probably need to be sadistic and gothic to take care of it without considering CGI or other effects. I hope Alex Chandon has learned a lesson on lighting and SFX to make a better movie the future, that is, when he is still working. <br /> <br /> Advice to buyers, this is extremely disappointing, DO NOT BUY IT !!!!!
