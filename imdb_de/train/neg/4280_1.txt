This must be accompanied by a special rating and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NORMAL PEOPLE. <br /> <br /> The obsession of Daneliuc with the dirtiest bodily functions turns into a nightmare. It is also obvious that the man is a misanthrope, he hates everyone - his country, his people, his actors, his work. And this hatred blinds him and he forgets the profession he knew a long time ago more. <br /> <br /> This so-called "movie" is just a hideous series of disgusting images of no artistic value and no professional knowledge. It is an insult to good taste and good sense. Pity, shame, shame!
