Honestly, it also seemed like seven hours of boredom. What is it? What about Will Smith that I just can not stand anymore? I think he just seems too hellish if you take him seriously and get an Oscar. I understand how biased that is, but if he does not go through new acting lessons, I can never win him. He is a big name and is therefore generally confused with a talented and versatile actor. He just is not. I give credit to him for making so much effort and being able to cry. That's it. <br /> <br /> Seven pounds were for me from the beginning a kind of Eyeroller. The suicide call of 911 did not fascinate me in any way. I was not curious to know why he asked for his suicide. There were absolutely no surprises. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had some of the screen chemistry. I do not know her name either, but the Hispanic woman has done a great job with her role as a timid and beaten woman. Woody Harrelson had very little time on screen, but I would say that he stole the show whenever he was here. <br /> <br /> All in all, just an extreme run of the mill. I could not help wondering why I was interested in any of these people. I never felt sorry for "Tim / Ben". He killed himself with a jellyfish? Was the only survivor in an 8-person accident? Geewiz..have not seen anything like this ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 is pretty generous.
