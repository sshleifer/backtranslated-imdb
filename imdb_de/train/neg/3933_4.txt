A huge hit when released to the Australian public, it can still be fun today, but its exaggerated political impropriety and dull, unobtrusive humor make it a kind of ring. It goes on for far too long; Part of the content may have been saved for the sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, which urgently needed something new anyway. Granted, his ocher-like Aussie stance is funny, but it gets annoying as the movie moves on. Some say Crocker's songs are the best pieces, and they are certainly original, but "weird"? The adventures of Barry McKenzie will be considered a milestone in Australian cinema, but we should do everything in our power to ensure that the foreign audience does not see the majority of Australians as Barry McKenzies (or even Mick Dundees!). , Rating: 5/10
