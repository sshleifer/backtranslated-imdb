I can not believe anyone liked this movie. I've seen a lot of low-budget indie movies, but this one is absolutely crappy. Low budget does not mean that the movie has to be demented. Horror does not mean that the movie has to be demented. There was nothing scary about this movie. It was just a gore party and a particularly disturbing one. The spectacle was average, considering that all the actors were unknown, but the story was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The film tries to be "artistic" or something. This is not one of those really great indie films that only cost thousands of dollars but are incredibly well done. This was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to film their perverted obsessions. Other reviews here also said the soundtrack was shitty. There were no redeeming qualities for this film. A complete waste of my time and money.
