Wimpy Stuffed Shirt Armand Louque (bored by Dean Jagger, the veteran actor in a rare lead role) joins a group of researchers seeking to discover and destroy the secret technique of zombie creation. Armand falls in love with pretty Claire Duval (who gets blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses the gentle sap to marry Armand's colleague Clifford Grayson (the hopelessly wooden Robert Noland). Armand is angry because he is being used and spurned by Claire. He uses his voodoo knowledge to avenge himself. Sounds exciting? Well, it certainly is not. For starters, Victor Halperin's static (non-directional) direction makes the meandering and uneventful, talkative story go on at a painfully slow pace. Even worse, Halperin does not bring the dreadfully boring process with tension, atmosphere and momentum. The mostly stupid spectacle from a largely bland litter helps nothing; Only George Cleveland as the hearty General Duval and E. Alyn Warren as the stunned Dr. Trevissant manage to liven things up a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics. The film music of the Drogy Stock movie library, the painfully obvious scenery and the rough cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive. In fact, this feeble pardon for a frightening apparition is so shitty that not even the unattended, staring eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can ease the boring boredom. A gloomy fool.
