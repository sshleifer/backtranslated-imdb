Major Payne really was not very good. Although it is funny here and there, the story was ridiculous and the acting was bad. Especially annoying were the voice and temperament of Major Payne. The idea was ridiculous and the things the guys in this movie had to do were even more ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
