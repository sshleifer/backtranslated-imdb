I probably could not find the DVD menu selection for PLOT: ON OFF. The default value is clearly OFF. When the credits started rolling, I could not believe it was. Like our poor but beautiful protagonist, I felt dirty and cheap. The characters were very broad and the author's contempt for wealthy Thatcherites was obvious. I consider myself "Roosevelt Democrat" but would appreciate a little more subtlety. <br /> <br /> Of course the problem could be mine. I see that many others in this picture seem to find meaning or message. Unfortunately not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me from giving a "1" was the beautiful landscape, man and plant.
