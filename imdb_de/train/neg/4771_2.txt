Do not waste time with this movie. It might have been good, but the end was one of the lameest I've ever seen. I have to seriously wonder how the people involved in making this film looked at the last scene and thought, "Yes, there is an end!" and patted over it on the back. It seemed to me more like they ran out of ideas! They built up the final scenes to have a cool twist, instead letting the whole structure fall flat on his face. When the last shot went black and I heard the credit music begin, I was shocked - I could not believe what I saw and that someone could even call it an end. The best thing anyone could do with this film is to rewrite the ending and give it some substance. Seriously, I would really love to find those in a room I imagined, looking them in the face and saying - WTF ?? !!!!
