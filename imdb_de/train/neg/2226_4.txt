DD movies were damn stupid, damned stupid, and had a plot that seemed gossamer, but these days they were at least a plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a comedy, but a mix of melodrama, romance and all <br /> Every drama scene is blown out of proportion <br /> <br /> The comedy is funny but also crazy. But the movie entertains you entertainingly. These Govinda movies were loud, blatant, but funny moments that people enjoyed <br /> <br /> David Dhawan does a good job. Music is okay. <br /> <br /> Govinda works well in comedies and dramas. Karisma is decent in parts and annoying in parts. Squad is Gulshan as usual. Prem Chopra are typography Shakti is weird
