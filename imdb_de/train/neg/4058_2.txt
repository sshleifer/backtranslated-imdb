You know from the beginning how this movie will end. It's so clich√©d that your typical NRA member will not even like this movie. I give him 2 out of 10 just for the acting of William Benton. I can not believe that people have chosen 6+ for this movie. It is so prejudiced to a "particular point of view" (once a thief ...). People are not born bad. They were not born too well. You are born with a clean slate. Society, parents and education make them who they are. And if they go in the wrong direction, it certainly will not be the American penal system that will get them back on track! Anyway, avoid this movie like the plague. I bet you've got something better to do with your time than wasting that crap. <br /> <br />
