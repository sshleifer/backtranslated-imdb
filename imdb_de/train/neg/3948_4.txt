This is not the video nastie, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were probably sick of the whole thing in the UK. It's 75% a replenishment of The Boogeyman and would have been banned for the same reason - whatever that was. <br /> <br /> At first I was confused when I thought Annie (Kelly Galindo) might be different from Lacey, but she had problems with psychic visions of boogeyman, similar to the first movie. Fans will immediately realize that they are not the same person. After seeing a murder in a bathroom and also the address, Annie, her psychiatrist and a para-psychology student, who looks very much like the guy. The cheap romance and butter-admittance you go into the house, and of course it's the same bathroom. 24 hours later there is a murder, as she has described. Of course, we have no idea who this Boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered. Then the movie shifts to a replay of the Boogeyman story with additional footage that we did not see in the original. The Boogeyman can be seen in contrast to the original. Unfortunately, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90% of them are there. Why repeat this movie? Did you find the material in the garbage? What was the purpose? <br /> <br /> We will never know, and although the psychologist tells Annie that she is healed, we all know that the villain will never die.
