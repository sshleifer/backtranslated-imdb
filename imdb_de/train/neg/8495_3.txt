I'm the guy who went to the local library and read books about Babbage's difference engine while my schoolmates were playing football and so on. So if there's a target audience for this movie, I think I'd probably be there. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just have to look at it again. A previous reviewer mentioned that he should not see this movie when he is tired. Maybe that was my mistake. <br /> <br /> I did my best to enjoy this movie and there are some aspects that I like, but on the whole I found it amateurish and rather babbling. <br /> <br Being a self-professed computer nerd, I can not help but determine the exact time frame when the movie was actually made and how the graphics used reflect that time (ie 1997). Games of the era have played. "Mind Grind", to name but one example, this movie can not resist this 16-bit low-resolution multimedia explosion of the time. Luckily, in recent years, at least in the gaming world, this has diminished somewhat in favor of the actual game. <br /> <br /> Must watch this movie on a German FTA satellite channel (like I do not think it was ever aired on UK FTA TV (well, lately not)). I was amused that the credits could be seen. Maybe it's mean of me to enjoy it, since it's been ten years since the movie was filmed, and yet movie graphics from the 1980s look good in comparison. <br /> <br /> But as for the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like others, I agree that Ada earned a film without the science fiction angle, and a simpler biographical approach might be better suited to tell the story of this remarkable woman's life. <br /> <br /> There are fundamental mistakes that involve undermining my enjoyment of this movie. At first, the underlying idea that the real information from the past has somehow been lost, to be reconstructed through a kind of extrapolation via software-based, intelligent agents, seems somehow ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Also, the topic that runs through the computer movie that a computing device can actually predict the mechanics of all things over time (such as the winch) is no longer the case. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the Victorians could argue this point But the work of Godel from the twentieth century, proving that no mathematical system can be complete, has Turing's work on the limits of predictability, all too silent about the chaos theory and the quantum mechanics, completely undermining all those ideas that are central to today's researchers Software should work. <br /> <br /> Finally, clicking with the mouse in the air for "programming" is simply wrong, as mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> This film might have been OK, but at least some technical a A scientific consultation would have given the film some much needed recognition in the credibility missions. <br /> <br /> I will not forget the movie, although like "Pi" it is clearly a unique work, but also with many fatal mistakes for me to really enjoy it, 3/10 of me.
