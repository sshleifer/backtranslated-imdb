The Angry Red Planet <br /> <br /> Like "The Man From Planet X," this is a bizarre science fiction story from a time when fantasy and science fiction were still the same. That is, we have some highly ridiculous special effects and rampant pseudosciences that disguise themselves as science fiction. And yes, it's another "classic" that has been released in a high-quality broadcast with a pin-sharp picture and sharp sound - from Midnite Movies. <br /> <br /> So, the main reason to watch this movie? Oh, it's definitely the whole time our space crew is on Mars. (What, you thought, "Angry Red Planet" referred to Neptune?) Before that, there was a rather inferior crew on board a spaceship smoking and chasing sexist chauvinist jokes directed at the "murderous female" person Crew. By today's standards, it would be a bit offensive if it were not so funny. But Mars is the real reason why we are watching this thing. The film is usually black and white, but Mars, well, Mars is screaming blood red. It's filmed in that bizarre red plastic sheen, giving the angry red planet an interesting look of overexposed redness. It is quite a sight, as the (ha ha) aliens, the spectators are seen. The best is the "Ratbatspidercrab". Do you think that's a joke? That's what they call it in the movie! It is a gigantic chimera (little doll) that combines the characteristics of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. It borders on all puppies and scares our "heroic crew". There are other weird and ill-conceived aliens you can see, but this one takes the cake. Finally, after her shattering experience on Mars, the sexist crew board aboard their "ship" and return to the planet from which they came. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone. Science fiction movie fans and curious people and some general movie fans. Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans will spend one field day with them (if they never got around to it on the show). <br /> <br /> 2/10 Modern score, 6/10 nostalgia score, 4/10 in total. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
