Just to avoid this kind of movie being made in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment, but does not tell a bold story. <br /> <br /> You could feel virtuous because it touches so many IMPORTANT topics, but with no apparent motives. The viewer does not get new perspectives (unless you have a tree growing while your head wanders, as is inevitably the case with this pointless movie). <br /> <br />
