This is the version that even the author hated because she is so schmoozy. They gave him a "happy ending" and changed many dialogues, and it was just a big pile of saccharine. The stage manager is pretty good, I think he created the role, but everyone else falls into the acting style of the '40s, who really just poses. The one great feature - the music. This has one of the best scores ever recorded, and it's worth visiting in a record store. Overall, I find the 1989 version of Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller far superior.
