When I write a review about a movie, it may stay with me ... but in general, I guess I forgot that I saw this movie in just two weeks. Why bother? Because again I see myself in a poorly rated movie that was fun. I did not expect to stay in the room while it was on. <br /> <br /> It was not that great, but at least it was not unbearable ... no comedy of fallacies that always makes me flinch. It was just sweet fluff ... and if you can not stand it, stay in the locker room, guys. I agree with those who defend this film because it will surely please the target audience and for an adult no boredom is a page divider. Sure, it's stupid and mildly entertaining, but at least it does not suck (as so many have said). Maybe these people are afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /> <br /> I tend to write down on the bell curve, so a 4.5 or 6 in my book is actually a decent all-round rating. If you give him a 4, it makes sense and will improve his rating at the time of writing. If you award a 1 or a 10, as is the case with most, the scores are meaningless. I can not believe how much people feel about this forgetful fluff in one way or another (or that I even bother to write about it). Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it should be noted that Emma Roberts plays quite convincingly her role as Clairedycat. Ariell Kebbel, often written in b * ch roles, does not disappoint when due to her character. You may also recognize Bruce Spence, who plays Leonard, although he plays a minor role. <br /> <br /> You can certainly miss this role when you grow up. But if there's a teenage girl in your life, lend it to you ... and be prepared to NOT hate it (you can even enjoy it).
