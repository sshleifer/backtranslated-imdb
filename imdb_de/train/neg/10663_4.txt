The movie was not a waste except a few boring scenes in between. But the occupied women did a pretty good show than the male men, who were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen has really rocked in the movie. Her voice was so seductive and sexy. The scenes in bed where Krista was involved would have had to be shorter, but she made it so handsome and sexier than anyone could do is really one of the best roles in such roles. She played the role of the evil in the last 5 minutes, which is the interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not so good and that was not his best as an action star. He could have chosen a better script than this. I really believe that he did it for money.
