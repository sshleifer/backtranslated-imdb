After seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago, I was curious about the unedited version. I was surprised that it was more believable and played well than I remembered, but one thing really stands out. I think other reviewers have mentioned this as well, what exactly is the nature and motivation of the character of Chris Sarandon? Has he already raped other victims? Is he completely psychotic or an "average" sociopath? How had he expected him to attack his younger sister? Is this character believable at all, or is it just more background knowledge? He almost seems to be an uncomfortably believable character at the same time and too crazy to actually be able to undertake a teaching assignment that brings him into contact with young, vulnerable girls. This generally seems to be the biggest complaint from viewers. It has nothing to do with its performance, which is terribly convincing. The film plays an uncomfortable position between pure exploitation and a reasonably serious treatment of the subject, without settling in either mode. Not the worst movie ever made, but not so good either.
