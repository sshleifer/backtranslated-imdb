The book series "Wrinkle in Time" is my favorite series from childhood. I've read and read it more often than I can count for the past 35 years. The characters with all their virtues and mistakes are dear to me and love. This adaptation contained little of the wonderful, magical, spiritual history that I love so much. To say I was disappointed with this movie would be a great understatement. <br /> <br /> If you have never read the books, I can imagine you will enjoy the movie. The acting is passable, the special effects are good for a TV movie and the story is interesting. However, if you love the books, avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the Wikipedia page of the novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said about the film:" I expected it to be bad, and that's it . "" <br /> <br /> Like another reviewer, I feel the need to reread the book to drive this movie out of my mind.
