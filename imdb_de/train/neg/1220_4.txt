She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this film shows why she is also a multi-year Razzie nominee. To make a movie that is so bad must be an indication that it needs money. It could advertise why you should not talk on a mobile phone while driving, especially at night on the way to a crowded shopping mall. Susan Montford should continue to keep up the production (shoot 'em up). She is not very good as a writer / director. <br /> <br /> She is approached by four thugs in the parking lot of the mall, and the first thing they say is that they have a gun. What is she doing? She begins to shove and insult her, as if she knows martial arts or something. She manages to escape, but gets lost in the woods. Why did not she run to someone? We get four thugs with weapons tracking a woman with a toolbox. Of course, their rifles are no match for their keys. Ha! Of course she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver. These poor thugs. <br /> <br /> Now she's home for Christmas - and she has a gun with her!
