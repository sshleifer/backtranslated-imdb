I actually saw this movie in a theater, but what a waste of time and money! I am sorry to say that bad acting did not help to enjoy this rather sticky script. Some friends told me to watch this movie because James Redfield, the author of the book, was very involved in the script. They had really enjoyed the book, so the movie just had to be perfect. Maybe my hopes were a bit too high, but I hated that movie! It was predictable, too sweet to a point where I actually went, I had to throw up and worst of all, there would be a sequel! Do the world a favor and stop this vile crusade.
