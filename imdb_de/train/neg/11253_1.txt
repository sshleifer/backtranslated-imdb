Visually interesting, but falls flat in the originality department. This boring exercise in engineering becomes thin after the opening fight. Jude Law has the charisma of burnt toast, but in his defense, this film contains some of the worst dialogues I've ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is so bad that it constantly takes you out of the movie and causes me to think about work, bills, my dogs, and so on. Paltrow is as wooden as it gets. This could be saved by snappy film noir dialogues or the top camp. My only complaint about the technique is that black-white-film (sorry, computer) helped, because it looks like Turner is colored black and white. Just a boring clich√© mess. I'd rather break my femur than pass this endurance test again.
