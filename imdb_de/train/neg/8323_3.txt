From the beginning, this film had some shortcomings. The main character playing Hayden Christensen is the rich young mogul who has inherited his father's considerable wealth and power, and he has trouble filling both his father's shoes and cutting the apron strings that mother (and co-manager ) keeps too tight. He also has the problem of having heart disease and waiting in limbo, which is the organ donor registry. There are also smaller back stories that you should first ignore, which later became important, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle-class girl (Jessica Alba). Uncreative storylines, but not bad enough to ruin the movie. The only true "oy vey!" Moment was the name of Lena Olin's character. An arrogant woman named Lilith ... subtle! <br /> <br /> The operation scenes are not censored at all. I appreciated that, people who find surgery scenes scary could not do so. The horror of being awake during anesthesia was good at first. You see in emotional pain as Christensen screams in through the chest cut and the rib spreader. The moment of irony comes from the supporters, while he is one of the few unlucky ones who are awake during anesthesia, and he is also happy because he helps him to learn that his surgical team wants to kill him. The big twist is however, very predictable, letting the film plunge into the conspiracy and its memories of the little characters that were there, but like us we first miss it. <br /> <br /> In the end, there are two other phrases that relate to his relationship with his mother. One of them is an impressive gesture by Olin, which is not very impressive due to bad writing. The other is a mystery about the family's past, which seemed very seemingly futile. <br /> <br /> The initially well-made anesthetic awareness drama is lost through the poorly written conspiracy drama. There is one last attempt to bring back the movie, which is flat and takes the entire movie with it.
