Please do not hate me, but I have to be honest, when I watch this movie, I had a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> It's a movie with a stupid cast and stupid songs !!! <br /> <br /> Unnecessary songs !!! Mehbooba ... A total insult to the original Holi .... well ... it was OK! Traditionally, every film has one !! Chad Raha hai Nasha Whatever ... VERY UNNECESSARY dumb song jee Le ... sounded like a Playboy song Dumb song ... <br /> <br /> Except for songs. The movie was alright This was Ram Gopal Vera's own adaptation ... If you think you will like this movie <br /> <br /> Well, this movie depends only on the viewer and his judgment on whether he / she this thinks movie is totally copy he / she wants to put her head on the cinema seat or if he / she thinks the director has his / her own view he / she would be relaxed and take a look at this movie <br /> <br / > Anyway, I looked in both directions, congratulating and abusing Ram Gopal for the catastrophe he's made. <br /> <br /> Well, some other things that have disturbed the CAST as terribly bad <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan As Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his own movie remake Funny what the director thought) Ajay Devgan As Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol could have been better) Performance in Mehbooba's song) Sushmita Sen As Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan was right, Taboo was right for this role) Nisha Kothari As Ghungroo / Basanti (I think, Es Ha Deol would have been great) Mohanlal As Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so cute ... Oops sorry hehehehe, he was OK, I could not think of anyone) <br /> <br /> The film would even have FAIRED a little if that Casting OK was <br /> <br /> I was not even exciting, the movie was just OK, just to watch <br /> <br /> The overall rating <br /> <br /> directed ... 8 / 10 I deserve credit Cinematography ... 9/10 Script ... 3/10 BAD to write songs ... 5/10 Needless in the movie, could have been better Just play to the ears in PC's and IPod's and Stuff Cast ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi Out Pakistan
