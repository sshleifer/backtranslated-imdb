Why did I waste my time on this movie? There was not a single funny joke or stroke. The slapstick was not even a little funny. I really mean a runaway suction tube? Why was the name of the National Lampoon attached to this movie? Even Christmas holidays were better than that (I thought the movie was really funny).
