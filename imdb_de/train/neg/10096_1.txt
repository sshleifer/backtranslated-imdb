This movie must be the worst I have ever seen. The title of the film deceives the audience, perhaps hoping. The plot of the film is at best ridiculous, with acting so poor that you just have to paw. The title "Zombie Nation" implies a bunch of zombies, even though there are six in all. This can not be classified as a horror movie, as cheesy music of the 80s was introduced when the zombies "attacked". The zombies actually talk and act like people in the movie, the only difference being that the make-up is something from a La Roux video. If you ever have the opportunity to buy this movie, then burn the copy.
