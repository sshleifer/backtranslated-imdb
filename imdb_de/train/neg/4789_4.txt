"Phantasm" from 1979 was a very atmospheric, scary, scary and very original horror strip and in one word cult. The first sequel to 1988 was bloody, funny, action packed and extremely entertaining. After the first sequel, the "phantasm" producer Don Coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas. "Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead" from 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it's even quite entertaining, but there is no longer any originality, and the desperate attempts to bring in something new are sometimes tiresome, which makes it pretty good compared to his predecessors disappointing. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> At the very beginning, we reveal the secret behind the mysterious Sentinel Spheres (the brain-sucking flying silver bullets). Then a series of unnecessary and annoying new characters (like Tim, a small kid in the "home alone" style that's great at shooting, a rocky, a tough and super cool, nunchaku-wielding black chick with a crew cut.)) Are introduced , The film also has its qualities - Reggie Bannister is again very cool, like the ponytail that Reggie plays the guitar. Angus Scrimm is still pretty scary as the Long Man, but the fact that the Long Man in this movie talks a lot more leaves him a bit unsaunted. The character of Mike is again played by A. Michael Baldwin (he was replaced in part 2 by James LeGros), which in my opinion makes no big difference. The film also holds the movie interesting enough to look at, but it's still a disappointment, especially as attempts to make up for the lack of ideas get pretty annoying pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Phantasm III" is an acceptable waste of time, but compared to its predecessors, it is definitely disappointing. Fans of the first two "Phantasm" films can give it a try, but I recommend that you do not set your expectations too high.
