I was surprised when I saw this movie. I had heard that it is the best movie the novel has ever done. How disappointed I was. <br /> <br /> How any real Jane Austen fan can rate this adjustment is a mystery to me. The scriptwriters have decided to teach some ridiculous humor that is embarrassing at the best of times, but also ruins the sense of time. As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a rather flat heroine (but then any "hot" American star in the role would be questionable), Toni Collette is miscast and poor Ewan McGregor gets ridiculed! I really could not say anything good about this movie. I seem to be among the very few who do not judge that, but if you want my advice, watch TV production with Kate Beckinsale instead - believe me, that's far superior to this superficial garbage.
