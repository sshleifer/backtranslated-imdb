Like some other people who reviewed this movie, I also became nostalgic ... before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this film have been completely unreliable, and The Perils of Pauline is now an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and simply boring filmmaking. Even the presence of the old professionals Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can not overcome a rancid script, a terrible title song, and some miserable "special effects." In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for a painful viewing, especially since this occurred immediately after the civil rights movement. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably received a theatrical release. Judging by the results, this is an absolutely credible (and confusing) scenario.
