Let me be clear. I have been using IMDb for years. But only today I have laboriously registered on the website just to give this film the lowest rating. I've seen hundreds of films, some bad, some horrible. However, I have never seen such an opposition between presumption and incompetence, high intentions and failure. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is terribly busy as a princess, but as Phocion, a little boy, absolutely incredible. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is even worse than in the bland French piece that is the source (Marivaux has not yet reached Hollywood, and we should keep it that way). For example, to show that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she shows how she pours chemistry from cup to cup, invoking the names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is played even darker. To this end, the couple should receive a joint "Clair Danes" award, awarded in a fair world for an anachronistic and uninspired reinterpretation of interesting teenage literature authors as 1990s brats (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> Apart from the cruel conspiracy and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming. For example, there are moments when a handful of onlookers are shown up in the action, sitting on chairs and watching the main characters. The director wants us to know that she has adapted a piece. I get it. But it only happens far into the movie. At this time, it is scary and distracting to see a crowd sitting on chairs for a moment and then disappearing. They are like some kind of weird zombie crowd that pops through the fog and scares us. If you see the terrible joke and the song ending this movie, you want to awaken your own lot of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustice that is poisoning your mind for 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> -Matthew McGuire
