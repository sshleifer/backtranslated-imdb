Yes, there are great achievements here. Unfortunately, they happen in the context of a movie that seems to have no idea what it is doing. During the first 45-60 minutes of it all the music takes place as a realistic performance. Suddenly, about an hour later, the characters, who had always talked to each other, suddenly began to sing together. To further confuse things, they lead a little further, out of nowhere, about 15 minutes of dialogue, seemingly rejecting this idea and moving on to other things, such as a number starting with a jazz club. A drummer and two e Guitars suddenly turned into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive, invisible string section. Adding to all these contradictions in the use of music is that the composers are clearly unable to actually write music in the style that is allegedly portrayed. While the first two pieces mimic the Motown sound of the fifties, the rest of the movie is just (bad) Broadway show music. Then there's the sheer stupidity of snippets of a group doing a bad imitation of the Jackson family, and Eddie Murphy turning from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When he started channeling Stevie Wonder, I could not help laughing aloud. This was clearly one of those movies that made me appreciate how little time I have on Earth, and it annoyed me that I spent two hours watching this movie.
