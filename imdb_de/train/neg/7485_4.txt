Granted, that seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. Where can you be wrong? Watch the movie and you will find out. <br /> <br /> In fact, Martin, the lead role, is mismatched. He does not make the great slapstick for which he is known from films like "The Jerk", but plays a kind of intermediate figure that does not work. Hawn, without playing someone, is terrible. Cleese is the only, even partly funny member. <br /> <br /> To top it off, the plot is pretty stupid. I can not say how much of it has changed, but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense. They are walking through New York without doing anything right and unfortunately nothing funny. Not only is the whole premise unbelievable, there also seems to be the message that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, a theme that is repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> If you see this, rent the original "Odd Couple" again.
