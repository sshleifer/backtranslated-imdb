Short summary: This film humiliates everyone he touches. That means, you. <br /> <br /> Let me first say that I'm not a purist, and that could have been funny for a few minutes. The imitations are not bad. But overall, it's just boring and agonizing not funny. A few simple jokes are repeated over and over again. <br /> <br /> It's clear that this movie is just to get the last dollar out of now protected Laurel and Hardy. Producers can not really appreciate their place in film history or their talents. That insulted me the most. <br /> <br /> Of course my daughter liked it, so I failed as a parent;)
