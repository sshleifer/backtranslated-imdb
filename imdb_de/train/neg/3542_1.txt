After reading the comments on the website, I feel compelled to write for the first time. It seems that this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that movies do not have to make sense to have fun (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), but they still have to keep you busy with the characters. Well, while I was completely involved in the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's Opus, I have to say that I could not tell about Mr. Green and the other cardboard gangsters who lived in this Tagglo world. <br /> <br /> Even if so many people seem to be trying and saying that they did not have fun because they did not understand it, I would not have to agree - I was not kidding because I was bored. I wanted the movie to end, and it did not always take those quotes over and over again. Call it wise, if you want - I think it repeats itself. <br /> <br /> My main reason for writing, however, is to ask all the other reviewers a question - the footage of the movie I saw did not contain a credo. Only music about black. Have I seen a dude print or is that proof of the presumption of GR? Or did all those involved in the film have seen the rough cut and removed their name ???
