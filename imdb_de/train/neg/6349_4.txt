Woody Allen has done some of the greatest comedies of all time, and I would seriously consider that Annie Hall is the greatest movie, but if I really think about it, I'll probably think of one or two better ones. Of course he had some movies that are not as good, but not as bad as Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but he has never before had such a bad movie as Melinda and Melinda. Not so tired and listless, his films are usually funny and funny, but how did that happen, is it still our good old Woody? The story is about four friends having dinner together. Two are game writers, and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to one of their friends. It's about a young woman who burst unexpectedly at a dinner party. We never hear the rest, because the two drama writings start debating whether it would be a better comedy or tragedy. Then we start to see the two aspects. Both focus on this woman named Melinda, who has problems with both drugs and her ex-husband. In the tragedy, she is an old family friend who, after her suicide attempt, decided to appear at her front door for no apparent reason. The comedy is about Melida, who stumbles after 28 sleeping pills on the dinner party. Both lead to a wild whirlwind of events that never really make sense or match, or you laugh more than once or twice. There are some nice performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they do not match. They could not stop them from falling further than most other films this year.
