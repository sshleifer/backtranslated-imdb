Slow and beautiful pictures changed, sometimes with annoying music (you know Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the movie. If you have not slept enough, this is a good time. <br /> <br /> But in the last 20% of the film director, he decides to bring the idea of ​​reincarnation, reincarnation or else through the S & M images: "Spiritual Lover" cut each other's bodies with knives. For me, that was very disturbing and actually changed the overall impression of a blend of abstract art and images of the modern Japanese mystery. <br /> <br /> Operator and director are great, but weird. <br /> <br /> Did not like it at all.
