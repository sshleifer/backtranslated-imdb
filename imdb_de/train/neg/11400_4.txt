The Hazing is a confused hocus-pocus that wants The Evil Dead so much that it even refers to Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is, it just is not in the same league as this great movie. This movie is not nearly as original. The plot was previously used by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons, and that was much more fun. This movie is too complicated before he takes the kids to the sinister villa and begins the demonic event. As usual, Brad Dourif is not very busy here, but when he's up. On the screen, he performs yet another towering achievement that would make Christopher Walken jealous. The acting of the children is passable, but not good. The shaky camera work is more annoying than smart or atmospheric. There are a few good moments when the first man gets possessed and throws some deadly liners while sending off his victims, but it has never been scary for a second. The gore level is in the middle to low range, but the director tries to show the actresses up a few times. All in all, okay, if you have 87 minutes to lose.
