I only gave this ridiculously named comedy horror movie a 2, because several famous pornstars of the past appear in it. A group of tourists allegedly on holiday in Ireland, but actually in Canada, have suffered from cannibalism inbred mutants. The problem is only if I did not count wrong, there is only one mutant, and he is not very impressive. Like the pot-bellied mummy in this homemade movie from about five years ago. Some bloody but stupid deaths help, but the movie is a pure amateur night and boring and unbelievable. The end is predictable and has been done to death. No pun intended.
