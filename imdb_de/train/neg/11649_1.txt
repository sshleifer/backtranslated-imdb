Okay, if you want to see this movie, give me our money. I'll let you step if it counts and you'll have just as much fun. I guarantee even more fun. This movie shows once again what happens if you can not get another person to hire your family and you are forced to make your own movies. The same, I go through puberty humor jokes, just stupid and rude. This movie is really a shame for moviegoers. They try to shock you with laughter because you can not believe what levels they need to bend over to make you laugh. So my offer is up there
