I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It is so incredible. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage and has a breakdown in front of a real estate agency. What happens? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job !!! Hilarious! Next, you know the two women are doing it. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing in this movie sounds like "Lifetime for Women with Nothing Better" than true. Chunky dialogues like "I do not want to feel the rest of my life as if I have the chance to be happy and not to take it" does not help. There is a rich, distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A naughty black maid - unbelievable, that in 2003 a film will be shot in which there is a naughty black maid. Hattie McDaniel has to turn in the grave. The wife has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. Sheesh! No clich√© stops.
