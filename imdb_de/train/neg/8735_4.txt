This movie somehow failed me. It seemed to be very similar to the movie Jaws when the hopper told the mayor to close the parks as if Roy Shider told the mayor to close the beaches. Both did not say it was summer! But in the box it is said that Hopper gets into the head of a murderer and must think like one. But he really does not do anything interesting or exciting. I am not even a little convinced that he and his partner have any experience of policing when they ask in the office how they will solve this case. They just say, let the police work and we'll solve it. And what about all the old men with pool cues? I did not even begin to believe that they were Mobbosses. And then the guy who doubted the guy whom the mob did found the killer. With his $ 100 haircut and the fact that he thinks his Di @ k is the size of a school bus. Come on what rough lines. I thought he would hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies. I used this movie and would not buy it again. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh, and it was funny to see the microphone above the scene where the hopper is getting coffee.
