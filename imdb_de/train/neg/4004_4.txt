As a big fan of the cracker series, I've been waiting 7 years for the next expansion. This episode, I'm afraid, just does not dread the legend. <br /> <br /> Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for the wedding of his daughters and gets involved in a murder case. His mission in Northern Ireland is a deadly spree. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this episode is the extremely comfortable way in which everything is set up and how Fitz is led to the killer. It's all fat to farfetched. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good scenes in Flashbacks from Northern Ireland that are filmed great.
