"Revolt of the Zombies" proves that the same director redesigns and recycles an idea, not necessarily causing a lightning strike twice. <br /> <br /> The Halperin brothers responsible for the horror classic "White Zombie" did so. A few years later, it was a three-piece piece of garbage to get rid of its popularity, and even the close-ups the eyes of Lugosi from the previous film. There was a dispute with the rights holders of the "White Zombie" film, who did not want the Halperins to use the word "zombie" in this title. That word was the only thing that could help this movie, because bad movies, as everyone knows, can make a lot more money by just letting the word "zombie" appear in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin did a few years ago just makes this uninteresting movie more insulting. It seems like he never made another horror movie after this debacle. The zombies here do not really seem to be dead, but are simply hypnotism victims. <br /> <br /> Do you want to create a mind-controlled army of zombies? Be prepared to crack a few eggs, including your own. <br /> <br /> THE LAME PLOT: The man falls in love with a woman who plays with his heart and gets engaged to him just to win his friend, whom she loves, jealous. This puts the man in a spiral of madness, in which he tries to use the mind control zombie techniques to change things to his advantage, to win a woman who is not worth spitting. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most obvious plot developments I've ever seen. They would have to be blind or stupid not to see the end. The spectacle is not even good. This movie makes the racially insensitive "King of the Zombies" (which appeared on the same DVD I bought) appear like an atmospheric horror masterpiece and reminds us that not every black and white movie is a classic. It makes the atomic zombie cheese festival "Invisible Invaders" from the nuclear age look like a serious drama. This is a big cheese ball that is so ridiculously melodramatic that it probably causes many Korean film fans to flinch (South Korean films are often known for their use of melodrama). The credits contain the ironically named company Favorite Films. I'm not sure whose favorite movie that might be, but they're obviously an idiot. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for fans of: zombies, romance or classic movies.
