This movie was awful. I had a very difficult time reviewing all this. I did not understand the point of the movie. What was the purpose of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, the acting was bad and the story was not inspiring. The two main characters of the film were very boring and their dialogue was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among the performers. I do not know, but I suspect that most of the actors were first-time visitors. The film could easily have been reduced to about one and a half hours without losing the plot. This indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie. I'd rather have a root canal in the two hours of the movie. I want those two hours back! If you want to watch a good, funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of Mormons, you should see Napoleon Dynamite instead.
