While watching this movie, I tried to figure out why they bothered. Although the main presentation of the movie is potentially good, there are all sorts of unrelated / unnecessary side sketches. The marketing people in Hollywood must have dictated the bad guys, the eternal double crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex. It's weird that we see more of them having sex than the president and his lover. The many acts and subplots make the movie too broad and none of the characters is well developed - I really did not feel like I knew a character except that they are all corrupt and evil. The end is completely incomplete - it left me wanting more than just what could have been, but what should be. In the end, there's really no explanation for why someone does what they do except as extra corrupt characters who make a double cross. I'm surprised that so many established (and good) actors have agreed to shoot such a hollow film. This seemed to be a film made by college students working on their second or third project. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time, unless you're in a film class and want to make an example of what you should not do when you're filming.
