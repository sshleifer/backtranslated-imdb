Basically, "Caprica" ​​is the story of Cylon origin. The premise of the show is interesting. However, the authors follow so many storylines and block them with too many POV characters that they hinder storytelling. The action creeps in with the speed of the glacier and releases the tension that it possibly had. Little or nothing happens in each episode. <br /> <br /> Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robot soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only working prototype is powered by the AI ​​version of his dead daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide attack caused by Soldiers of the One (STO), a subterranean monotheist extremist group. <br /> <br /> Joseph Adama (father of "Battlestar Galactica" commander Adama) struggles to keep his family together while searching for an AI version of his daughter (who also died in a bombing) in a Machiavellian virtual version by Caprica (which strongly reminds of the 1930s Chicago). <br /> <br /> Apart from the vapid font, Caprica suffers from a similar problem to many source histories. We already know how it ends (ie The Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
