* WARNING * Possible spoilers down <br /> <br /> The movie is more boring than anything else. There seems to be an attempt to build tension through poorly lit shots of empty spaces and empty lawns, but none of this works. <br /> <br /> MST3K has done a pretty good job, but the film is usually boring on its own. <br /> <br /> Funny Moments: <br /> <br /> When the fake skull rolls out of an ash pile, the wife becomes hysterical and crazy, while the husband (trying to drive the car) wraps wife crazy) says in a dead voice: "There is no skull there, no skull." <br /> <br /> If the real Ghost Skulls caught the husband in a cucumber as if they were trapped between first and second base.
