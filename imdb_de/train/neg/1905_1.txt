I'm one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and I've probably reviewed more Buster Keaton films for IMDb than any other person. Every film he shot from the beginning of his career to the early '30s has been reviewed with only two exceptions. So I can tell you that I'm a big fan. That's why I found this episode so painful and hard to see. I loved the movies of this man and always thought "Buster, how can you do that ?!". Now that I think about it, I can see why Buster played Keaton in this terrible episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. After a messy divorce in the early '30s, he had lost much of his fortune, and his movie career as a leading man was long gone. Well, in the 1960s, Keaton needed the money and loved his popularity regaining popularity, and he scraped anyone willing to pay in beach movies and in this mess of an episode of a big series. <br />> The biggest problem with the episode is that it was just terribly written and Buster deserved much better. The show is supposed to be funny, but it's not and instead of paying homage to silent movies, it's just painful to watch - especially when Keaton wields the stupid time travel helmet and poorly executed slapstick. Do yourself a favor, SKIP THIS ONE - it's a pale imitation of the size that once was Keaton's career !!!
