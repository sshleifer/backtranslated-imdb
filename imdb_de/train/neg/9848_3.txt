This film has some great noiric / neo-realistic visualizations and tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood frosting, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. However, some scenes are far too long (especially the wedding), and I found the exaggerated theatrical and unrealistic conversation more appropriate for the stage than for the screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was particularly distracting and it always seemed to get worse as the movie progressed. Most of the characters were either Italians from Italy or immigrants from Italy who lived in New York in the 1920s and 1930s, but their dialogues sounded like they were practicing lines for a Shakespearean play while mixing cement and bricks. I laughed towards the end and not because the filmmakers wanted me. I suspect the stubborn poems could be defended by saying that the characters spoke Italian, and the dialogue is a literal translation of how they would really speak. But it absolutely did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Another line of the conversation made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character, who was born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly takes a pretty British-accented tilt. My guess is that this had something to do with the fact that the film was filmed in England. <br /> <br /> I give this movie an "A" for effort and purpose, but a significantly lower grade for the performance.
