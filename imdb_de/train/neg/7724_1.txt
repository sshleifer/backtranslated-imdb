When I saw all the negative reviews for this movie, I thought it might be another comic masterpiece that was not supposed to be that way. I saw the first two combat scenes, heard the generic dialogue that Lungren was terribly running, and all the other oriental actors thrown in, and I found the movie so horrible that it was funny. Then Brandon Lee goes down in history and the one-liners start to fly, the plot falls apart, the scriptwriters start to drink and the movie is in a bad mood, it's welcome as it turns into the worst action movie ever. <br /> <br /> Lungren highlights his earlier efforts in "The Punisher" and others, as well as all the films of Van Damme, Seagals and Stallone's non-Rocky films for this special honor. This movie has the absolute worst acting (look at Tia Carrere's face when she's in a scene with Dolph, that's laughable), with the worst dialogue ever (Brandon Lee's commentary on Little Dolph is the worst line ever played in a movie). and the worst outfit in a movie (Dolph in full Japanese clothes). Picture "Tango and Cash" with worse spectacle, meets "Commando", meets "Friday the 13th" (because of the senseless nudity and Lungren's performance is very Jason Voorhees-like), in an hour and fifteen minutes of a film joke. <br /> <br /> The good (not horrible) performances go to the bad guy (who still looks clogged by his overall performance) and Carrere (who somehow says her 5 lines without laughing). Brandon Lee is just here to play Lungren's buddy, doing a really awful job. <br /> <br /> A horrible, horrible movie. Fear and avoid it. However, if you see it, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots. When you talk about the underwater shots, take a look at the lame water battle scene with the worst end of the fight scene. In this movie, there is every version of a bad fight scene for people with short attention spans and to fill in between nudity. <br /> <br /> A BAD FILM !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
