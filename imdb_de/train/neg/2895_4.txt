The premise of this film can be found on the DVD box. A textile worker develops a miracle material that does not degrade. But the movie does not move on. Instead, he rumbles for 45 minutes and makes a noodle around a preamble before making the big discovery. Since the audience does not benefit much from having a Whiz kid find out, it's a curious choice: The movie was successfully prevented from engaging in a topic. Once the material is discovered, the film realizes too soon that both industry connoisseurs and work colleagues want to suppress the invention, so that the film leaves only two faint movements; Invent the chemical and run in front of oppressors. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why anyone would call this a comedy. The sound is not funny or funny. It is rather a serious social critique of the day: capitalism distorts both supply chains and production. This in turn prevents innovations from reaching and improving the world. Yes, that's probably true, but without playing with this attitude, the movie is just a serious argument. You need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find here. <br /> <br /> This is more of a British Meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
