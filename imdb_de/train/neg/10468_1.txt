I did not know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know it. This was a really horrible movie. The script, direction and acting were just as bad. The story was stupid and stupid. The director could have made a clever and thought-provoking film, but did not. I wound myself in my seat in the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the focus on the film? Where was something in this movie? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. It was shabby and a waste of my money. Do not see this movie
