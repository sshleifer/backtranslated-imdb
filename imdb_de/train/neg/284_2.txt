I only picked it up today in the 99 cent store today and still think that I was deducted from it. "Dream to Believe" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama, and $ 1 is just too damn expensive. This movie is probably remarkable for only two things: 1. He has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It's headed by Paul Lynch, the man who also did Promo Night. Now for the movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo) who was seriously injured in a car accident that also cost her father's life. The accident prevents them from attending gymnastics tournaments. She is often attacked during class and meets a ferocious child named Tommy (played by Keanu.). Robin works when not in training, alongside her mother as a sideline and stepsister in a laundrette of her abusive stepfather. Finally, she is selected for the competition. <br /> <br /> Overall, Keanu and some catchy 80s are preventing me from awarding this 1 star, and it's not one of the worst movies ever, but it's still far from good. The DVD itself also receives no medals, as it seems to come from an old VHS. Towards the end, the tone goes out of tune and when the credits are almost over, it becomes black even though the sound is still present. So this can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork also makes no sense, since it seems to consist of recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the film, since it is not in the film itself, so the cover is obviously provided with Photoshops , Avoid in any case at any cost, unless you are a Keanu fanatic. I probably will not stick to it anymore. I'll probably give it to The Cinema Snob, who by the way is a great YT critic. Hey, if any of you have any crappy movies he does not want to see anymore, he can donate to keep his show going.
