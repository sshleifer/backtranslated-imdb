I found the movie for Americans who lost someone in the towers, for Americans in general. Any director who claims to be a tribute to the dreadful facts of recent years takes the opportunity to polemicize with old facts (unrelated to a terrorist attack), to criticize American political behavior, or to criticize the other political Situation as they themselves compare land that has nothing to do or share with the 9/11 atrocity. Shame on you.
