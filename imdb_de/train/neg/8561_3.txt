The cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle. Certainly not one of John's best films. Do not get me wrong, there are always some good spots on every move of John Wayne. And he has his fair share. But overall, the picture is slow and does not meet the expectations that it could have. Bruce Dern does a great job as a villain again. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie. The children in the film were average, but could have worked better. This would be a good movie for eight to fifteen-year-old moviegoers. <br /> <br /> This would be a good family train that you can look at with your children. Be aware, there are a few scenes you should look at before you let the little ones see you. But most of the kids I know liked the movie. Maybe it's because kids of their age do the adult work.
