For some strange reason, the movie world is dominated by fashion. Someone is shooting a movie about a killer shark, and suddenly the oceans of the movie world are flooded with giant squids, killer octopuses, and sea monsters. A man is persecuted by a former lover from hell, then every movie character is persecuted by a cops from hell or a roommate from hell or a babysitter from hell. Then, when a big Hollywood company produces a big, high-budget FX blockbuster about tornadoes, other film producers jump on the bandwagon and the fact that they do not have the budget to go through does not stop them. NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a typical example. What struck me about this television movie impression is the fact that it's trying to hide its lack of budget by cutting advertising breaks. Each time a tornado appears, the Camara attacks the horrified expression on the actors as they yell things like "oh my god, this is how it works" and "run for your life". Then the screen turns black and the producers are no longer up to date with the budget for special effects. Unfortunately, the budget of NIGHT OF THE TWISTER should have been increased to include better actors. The cast is not bad at all, but they are not impressive and they lack the ability to transport a movie that is controlled by characters. Where are Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? <br /> <br /> And the last word on this is a TWISTER clone ..... Yes, NOTT was released a few months before TWISTER, but TWISTER had been hyped for several months as a 1996 summer blockbuster and NOTT has a quick feeling, which makes me believe it was made and published to join the hype surrounding TWISTER
