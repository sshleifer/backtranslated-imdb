As you can guess from my review and my title of this review, I do not like Johnny Test. Now I think I know what people are going to say, "How do you know how bad it is? Have you ever looked at it?", I've watched this show a few times because I study film and animation and this simply not. I hold a candle by my standards. <br /> <br /> I'd like to talk about the animation first, because it's one of the most confusing things I've ever seen. As in the first two seasons or just in the first season, there was a hand-drawn animation. I thought it would be a nice show if it was drawn by hand, but then switched to flash animation and the quality dropped a lot. <br /> <br /> So that's a shock in my eyes, but let's see the story of the show. It's way too hard to be like Dexter's lab, but there are differences, because instead of a red-headed scientist, there are two and both are female. There is a talking dog (why?) And the parents' settings are changed a bit. I have others, but I do not think I can write them here (I do not mean cursing, but I do not know if there is a limit to words.) Everything else is just right, even Johnny, a DeeDee character , It's just so hard to be Dexter, but it just seems like a heartless punch. <br /> <br /> Finally I want to talk about the jokes. Remember in Dexter's lab some jokes related to screaming? Yeah, screaming can be good for a joke or two, but Dexter's lab also had smart comments that forced me to go back and look around to get the joke. Johnny Test just forgets it all and screams only 50% of the time and stops the music when a stupid joke or a liner appears. This is not a comedy, it's stupid comedy (I know what some people think, is not that a stupid comedy? Look at that and Johnny Test back to back and you laugh at the first option). Sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations that drive me crazy like chowder. I have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together: Too much bizarre is not just comedy, it just makes you think, "What am I looking at?". <br /> <br /> It's definitely the right thing. Do not look at this show if you respect comedies in any form, shape or form.
