DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM WHEN YOU LOVE CLASSICS LIKE TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER and BEN JONES! THIS FILM WILL BE ABLE TO! First, this movie starts with Bo and Luke running for Jesse Moonlight. Bo and Luke would never do that on the real show! In this film, unimaginable characters are portrayed doing things that would never have happened in this series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest and law-abiding. In this movie, he's a criminal doing moonshine with the governor of Georgia and smoking weeds. Plus, if this was an extension of the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have a question: HOW CAN JESSE MAKE MOONSHINE WHEN HE DID BEFORE THE HEARTS OF HAZZARD IN Hollywood MOVIE? AND HOW BOSS HOGG IS LIVING WHEN HE WAS DEADIES BEFORE THE REPLY FILM 1997! FILM AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? IT IS MAGIC THAT THESE CHARACTERS WERE RECOVERED TO LIFE IF THEY WERE TODAY 11 AND 8 YEARS OLD? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought along James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach as 1997 and 2000 and turned a family-friendly movie with the living original characters The Show, what it was and is compared to this disgusting, shameful movie! If you want to watch good Dukes movies, either buy the original series or go to walmart.com and buy the DVD set of 2 DVDs that includes Reunion and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood. They are both in the original cast and are family friendly! Do not waste your time on a movie that is not worth the CD it was written on!
