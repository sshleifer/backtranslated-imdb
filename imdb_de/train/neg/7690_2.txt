Anyone who rates this film well must obviously have something to do with its creation. This movie is a painful sucker. The acting is stiff, the generic soundtrack in stock is ridiculous, the direction is bland and strange, the teacher is really not very attractive (the student's blatant progress is all the more awkward). The creative minds behind this garbage should dissolve and spread out to prevent further evidence of such concentrated craptitude. I am sure that some starving children in Africa could have used the money wasted on this project. Hell, the funds also saw a clearer purpose that fueled a crack addict. At least someone would get some entertainment from it. For the sole reason that it did not become incurable, I give this movie two.
