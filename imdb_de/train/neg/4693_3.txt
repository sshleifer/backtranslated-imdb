This is exactly the kind of movie that frustrates me the most. Great cast, great director, great storytelling potential, then they ruin everything with a script that goes nowhere ... and says nothing if you go there! There is no depth here. No depth of character, no depth of action, no depth of surprise, tension or common sense. We know what happens, we are told how they want to fix the problem, they solve the problem, throw a surprise towards the end that does not create tension, then they stop the movie abruptly. Wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Glenn Ford is staging a cast of UK (and French) actors who are all fantastic and do amazingly impressive work with the one-dimensional writing they've been given. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie", who gives a dark and serious film wonderful jokes and warmth. I also thought that the movie had a great view of him ... all the shadows and fog ... very film noir feeling. <br /> <br /> Although the actors do the best they can and the direction is fun, it's still not enough for me to recommend taking the time to watch the movie. There are far better Glenn Ford movies: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, etc.
