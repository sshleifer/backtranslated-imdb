I have to admit that I did not finish this movie because he was so incredibly stupid and not worth watching. I watched it with a room full of kids who did not laugh at the stupid and gross humor. The director, Bob Dolman, seems so obsessed with sphincters and genitals that he overwrites the true story I grew up with. This is not a good movie for kids! Apart from the fact that the content is so rough, the movie is just stupid, has a bad flow and no intelligence behind it. What a waste of an absolutely good story. If you've read the book when you were younger and loved it, do not waste your time watching a movie that bothers you so much that you get angry. Instead, buy the book for your children.
