I watch (or at least try to be) a lot of scary movies, and this must be the worst, if not the second worst, movie I've ever had to go through. I never knew the depths of Masacism until I had rented that piece of blue cheese covered with a used latex contraceptive. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but that's worse than I would hope for him. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising and I was intrigued ... for the first minute and a half minute The credits rolled and I still had to see the pain at first hand. Maybe there are some spectators who have enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction, but on the other hand I know from the spectators who understand whether to commemorate, especially if we had to turn off the video and just DO NOT do that comes with our observation (we obviously had to make an exception). <br /> <br /> If it were for a remake, I would give it a try, as long as it does not contain more than 1% of the original. That's all.
