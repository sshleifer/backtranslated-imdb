Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in Space Girl Costumes. <br /> <br /> I love 50 sci-fi, I even love cheesy 50's sci-fi, but this movie is really, very bad. And not in a kind of MST3K style. <br /> <br /> Virtually unsurpassable as some Bozos make their best "hip-cat" impression of Abott & Costello For example, in "Cat Women On The Moon", but in this case it can not. This movie requires a mute button and a fast-forward. <br /> <br /> That means I could watch Gloria and Dolores walk around the spaceship for about an hour.
