In an interview, David Duchovny said he had not even able to see the first hour of this film - and you should not. The scene in which he asks the owner of a house where a murder was committed, if he can look around - you change the name, which he indicates, and he could lift his performance of each episode of the X-Files. He is the whole movie on autopilot. Brad Pitt looks terrible.
