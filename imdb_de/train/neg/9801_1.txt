I remember this show when I was a kid in the early 1990s, and there was a rage about kids with silly jerseys that drove Kung-Fu on each other and romped around in plastic dinosaurs. It was called Power Ranger. I remember that little kids beat each other and then the shirts and show stuff were banned in many school districts across the country, because this show taught the kids how to fight each other to solve their differences /> I've never really seen it as a show, especially when better shows like The Tick were played on Fox Kids. Most older teens have always considered Power Rangers to be ridiculous and contemptuous, and it's not hard to ask why. The footage is ridiculous at best. The colored Ranger costumes look like things you would train in, and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you come into acting and of course these really ridiculous haircuts. Half of them are wearing earrings, half of them are 90's mullet, and they wear the same clothes every day, then change into a leotard that wears Power Ranger and was the joke of many late-night talk show presenters. And of course, these are two of the worst movies ever made, and I mean, two of the worst movies ever made were based on that show, with almost every critic rejecting both movies and the shows based on them. <br /> <br Power Rangers is nothing more than a bad TV commercial location for particularly bad toy merchandising. As an adult, I do not consider it affectionate, but rather as another embarrassment for 1990s children's shows, fashion and stud earrings.
