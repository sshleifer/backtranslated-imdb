Richard Dix is ​​a big, not very nice industrialist who worked almost to death. When he takes a vacation that his doctors suggest to him, can he find happiness in the last months of his life? Well, he'll probably feel better if he ignores the VOICE of the whistle. <br /> <br /> This William Castle introduction offers some great moments (the introduction and presentation of Richard Dix's life through the Citizen Kane newsreel) and a fascinating plot in the final roles. The performance of Dix is ​​generally pretty good. Unfortunately, that does not quite work, because you do not have to buy the characters behave the way they do. In addition, the film changes from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost happy 30's movie, like a middle part (full of nice urban ethnists who do not mind being not rich) and back to a complex noir conspiracy last 15 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> This is a decent movie - worth seeing - but it took a little more running time to find a few characters and a female lead that can fulfill their role
