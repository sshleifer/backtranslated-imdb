This movie is S-L-O-W. He spent most of the movie waiting for the beginning. <br /> <br /> The setting was bleak, the script was bleak, the cinematography was bleak, the plot was bleak, the budget was low (not all low-budget movies are bad, but this did not have any redeeming features. ) The action was taken more by a vengeful, slightly disturbed hunter than the actual Wendigo who had a very brief appearance towards the end of the year. This in itself was disappointing as this wendigo was just a bizarre mix of a tree and a deer. Everything about the movie was boring. <br /> <br /> The boy's parents seemed quite distant and sometimes seemed to be completely disconnected from their son. I'm not sure if it was bad acting or a bad script, but it only increased my disappointment and boredom. <br /> <br /> There was no reason to think and nothing that aroused interest. With no real intrigues or chill factors, this movie creaked so painfully that you just did not care what happened in the end. Wendigo's ambience reminds me of the boring film that was shown at the awards ceremony The end of "Mr. Bean's Holiday": a movie that is artistic and nonsensical and tries too hard to be deep and meaningful, but pretentious and boring acts. <br /> <br /> I would never want to watch this again. I only saw it to the end, in the futile hope that something interesting could happen ... but it did not matter.
