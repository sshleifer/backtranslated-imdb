I've seen it. It is not "good" but subtly interesting. The guys are pretty naturalistic, but ................ the graphics / unsubstantiated rape scene is disgusting and - oh yes - the arbitrary insertion of World War II recordings is offensive and kind Way, as it tries to compare real horror with this misogynist institution. Real cruelty is real - this movie is just cruel. However, the film has a look that can attract you. But it seems to me that these are "Imperial New Clothes", but on the contrary. The movie looks good, but the direction, the story, the content, and the last feeling you take from this movie is empty. When a feeling can be empty - that's it.
