I am afraid that I do not have to agree with the majority. I found Spike Lee's newest bit boring! Although he tried something different, ie not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I do not think it worked too well. <br /> <br /> It's really a little too much going on - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's (Mira Sorvino) relationship, Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia types. The story is good, but in the end you have everything - two or three stories. Could Mr. Lee not deal with this provocative murderer on this side of the movie anymore? > <br /> <br /> But there are some good points. All scenes with the "Son of Sam" killer David Berkowitz look very good (color saturation, etc.) and the drama is pretty good throughout. Overall, I felt that the different stories would work well alone or otherwise without the murders. In the end, it just was not strong enough. <br /> <br />
