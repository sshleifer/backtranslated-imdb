This is probably the worst Christmas movie of all time. The plot is practically non-existent, the acting (especially Affleck) is bad at best. Ben Affleck fans are likely to defend this film, but deep inside they must agree. As far as I could tell, the conspiracy was Ben Affleck, a millionaire salesman who is being asked to shrink to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burns a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. With that, he pays the family who currently lives in the house to his family for Christmas ... and that's it. The film goes on and finally he meets with the daughter of the family ... bla bla bla bla.
