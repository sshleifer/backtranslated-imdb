In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as President of the United States. North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II. Died after a long illness; and a movie titled "Into the Blue" was released. The existence of this film is not as bad as the other things that happened this year, but the movie itself was pathetic and perhaps the worst of the year. Now in 2009 The United States has another president, there is another pope, new Korean nuclear weapons ... and the movie Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original one ... but that's the same thing though you say, "Getting a finger cut is better than having your head cut." This sequel is a really bad movie that kept me extremely bored and uninterested. The cast of Into the Blue 2: The Reef is composed by actors of the TV series, who lack any credibility and drama weight, but who are perfect to show their bodies. Chris Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring out hollow and boring performances. I have some films by director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bil and Ted's Excellent Adventure), but in this movie he can not even create the least amount of excitement, emotion, or entertainment, and the characters in this movie are not only badly performed, The cinematography from this film is also lame and seems to have been made by a technical team that makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels Into the Blue 2: The Reef is a horrible movie thats better This is the same as nothing, as I said before, avoid this crappy movie at all costs.
