I am generous and give this movie 2 stars. The line "Have you seen the Wizard of Oz?" was the best for me! With horrible writing and action as shown in this film, it's no wonder that many of worthless reality shows are taken on television. Do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royal baseball game, you're glad you did!
