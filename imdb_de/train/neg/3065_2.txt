This movie shows the times it was made, as well as the original, I suppose. What is really sad, because on a deeper level, the title "Vanishing Point" is the original so ironic. I am sure that was not the case, but the original was filmed in 1970 and published in 1971. The REAL "VANISHING POINT" was the end of an era that pretty much ended in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this remake, all countercultural elements have been removed and more pc advised to reach a wider audience. "Sanitized for your Protection" <br /> <br /> The insertion of the Indian scenes was unfounded, and the idea of ​​a "noble purpose" for the journey was subtraction by addition. I am glad I saw it, but I appreciated the original much more. The original is a cult classic and golden. This remake is terrible.
