Maaan, where do I start with this horrible movie? Bad bad narrative. I do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie. To be honest, Namaste London was a pretty entertaining movie ... though the soundtrack was good. But in this ... oh my good ... for a movie that is supposed to be a musical ... the songs are soooo bad. AR Rahman should have been the music director. <br /> <br /> In the face of two great actors, the director would have had to do much better work. Although the first half is shit, the last 30 minutes of the movie are fine. Ideas of Salman and Ajay save the film from total catastrophe. <br /> <br /> See it when you have nothing better to do. The last good Bollywood movie I've seen (and I'm looking at a lot of them) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
