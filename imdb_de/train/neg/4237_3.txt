JUDAAI was a courageous film by Raj Kanwar in 1997, when such a topic was damned out of the box. <br /> <br /> To honor him, he manages to show how greed changes a person and to what extent The person can go to get what they want. <br /> <br /> The film is damn melodramatic, ridiculous in many places. <br /> <br /> One wonders why Anil does not buy a TV for his wife? When he earns so much Just to show how poor he is. <br /> <br /> The twist is well made but the handling is straight from the 80's. The Johny Paresh comedy that entertains here and there stands out as a painful thumb as it does not fit into the story. <br /> <br /> Even there are several croaking scenes. <br /> <br /> The direction of Raj Kanwar is sufficient, even if sometimes melodramatic music is fine, but most of the songs are compelling <br /> <br /> Anil does his part well Sridevi is excellent in her part Urmila is decent Under rest, Kader Khan is as usual Johny Lever is funny, Paresh irritated Farida is decent
