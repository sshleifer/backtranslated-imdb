Loved the original story, had very high expectations of the movie (especially since Barker raved about it in interviews), and finally what can I say? It was a total MESS! The direction is everywhere, the acting was cruel, the eye catching visuals and choreographies were simply flat, empty and completely unnecessary (what about the generic music video techniques like the slow, forward, slow nonsense?) Not needed in this movie and cheapened the mood in one While some of the killings are pretty cool and brutal, some are just ridiculously ridiculous (the first Japanese murder was hilarious and Ted Raimi's death was just stupidly funny) simply racing without tension and tension all over the place, moving completely from the original story and then going back to the finale, which at this point feels simply pinned to mess it up even more. I mean, I knew what happened just when I read the story, but for people who did not, it's even more confusing, because sometimes I did not even know where it was going and what it was trying to do - it was crazy going on all the time. <br /> <br /> God, I really wanted to have this movie because I'm a big fan of Barker's work and loved the story because of its immense potential. I even enjoyed some of Kitamura's movies as funny trumpets, but this movie stank from beginning to end of amateurism and stupidity. I was not interested in anyone or anything. The whole thing was quickly inhibiting the very source that transformed it into something else. Granted, it was bloody and Vinnie Jones was playing a great badass, but everything else was more than disappointing. Except
