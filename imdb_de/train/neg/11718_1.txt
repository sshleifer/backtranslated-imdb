It's incredible!! ..yes, someone in front of me wrote that it was a waste of time to sit and watch this movie .. it is! Do not do it! I am totally tormented! I liked Wesley Snipes and found out he was playing the meaning of his name in a movie. Anyway, I wanted to watch this movie (of course, only at home), but now (shortly afterwards) I'm absolutely disappointed! It was his worst movie ever. Inwatchable !! Bad acting game! Bad cameraman! Bad scenario Just a good thought: the wonderful girl! Must be a male! Eeeeh !! MB .. 10 lines minimum?! I do not want to waste time reading my opinion! I hope I was clear and supportive because English is not my native language. So thanks for your time and see good movies, as I try too. Peace!
