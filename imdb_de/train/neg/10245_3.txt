I expected a lot from this movie. A bit like Lee as Naughradame like the character, but all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can not even explain this movie. It had wooden spectacles, terrible scripts made of Bible pieces like hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But that was the end! The rest I had to wait and hope that something useful would happen, but it did not happen. This film is about a couple trying to find out about the changes in the world, for example, in places where an earthquake has occurred in China, ending up in a monastery with eight nuns and a priest. The monastery is ultimately the key to the aberrations. The whole movie is misleading and boring. One of Lee's worst.
