Every now and then a film like Sholay comes along in Indian cinema, changing the way the audience perceives a good movie. And from time to time (hopefully) we have a RGV-Ki-Aag, which surpasses all standards and creates its own. A standard that is so low that it can never be broken. Ram Gopal Varma manages to melt talent and create a dish so you can smell it from afar. To take and kill a classic like Sholay is absolutely unforgivable and I can not believe he almost called the movie RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay contained many folkloric elements, the film managed to develop its plot by defining the characters so clearly that they lived on forever. Aag takes these characters and messes them up so much that they need a contest to find out the worst. The element of realism is completely lacking and what the film delivers is a bunch of "actors" acting in a plot of less and seemingly unrelated events. A star for this film is a ridiculous election waste. It is time for RGV to deal with the reality of its failure and conjure up another "other" action that can be categorized under cinema.
