I admit - Emma is, in my opinion, the greatest novel ever written. It's as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a palimpsest at best. <br /> <br /> A comparison with the Gwyneth Paltrow version is unavoidable - this version is far more faithful to the spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> There are some good elements here - Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste at Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin). is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes a suitably decorative Frank Churchill. The production is good-looking, but the interior is far too dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are some big problems. The first one is Mark Strong - at first he does not look right for Mr. Knightley. Maybe it's because he plays the role of a censored Victorian pastor. It is bad mood. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one of length. In short, the movie is far too short - to get the right feel, it should be twice as long. <br /> <br /> Finally and above all the quality of the adjustment. Austen is the dream of an adapter - all dialogues are already there. It just needs to be cut off and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems different. This is a pretty bleak movie at first, and the last thing Emma should be is bleak. More importantly, Davies was able to rewrite the end as a kind of bucolic feast. Which planet or what is a small work by Thomas Hardy? It is completely out of the style and spirit of the novel. And I think it's enormously presumptuous to make improvements to perfection. <br /> <br /> Check out the Paltrow version or check out Kate at Cold Comfort Farm.
