I can always tell when something is going to be a hit. I see or hear it and get a good feeling. I did not feel good when I saw the preview. I was not at all excited about this movie, and I'm not at all surprised that he is rated here as one of the worst 100 films. I was actually right. <br /> <br /> The first thing that knocked me off was the title. Not that I have a problem with Ebonics (I'm black, by the way), but for a movie they could have used a better title and for that time use a title that does not have a bad grammar. I heard the dialogue, saw the acting and all I could do was make faces. <br /> <br /> I also think that the subject of dance film is exaggerated. At least "You Got Served" was better in my opinion. Even the soundtrack did not impress me.
