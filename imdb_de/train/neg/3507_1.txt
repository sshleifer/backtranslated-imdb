With this film, the Maysles Brothers reached a low point in human interaction. Remember, you who used words like "masterpiece" when discussing this movie, that those Maysles goose bumps did not accidentally go to the Hamptons and happen to film some eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor, pathetic people, they had to finance their project (and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project). Then they became friends with the two extremely vulnerable women. No reflection here or genuine consensual participation. These wretched Maysles smiled, kissed their butts, did everything they could to bring the Beales to work, then exploited them as brutally as ever. One would think that these robbers occasionally had thoughts of remorse and guilt. The filming, however, was time-consuming due to the preliminary planning, the actual filming, and the subsequent editing, and their goal was not to actually relate the Beales as humans. An exploitation film perpetrated by the nastiest people. Over time, their reputation was seriously tarnished by what they did here. Her reputation as a human is abominable. That's what people will remember. Grotesque Hustler.
