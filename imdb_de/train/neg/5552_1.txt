This show offers interesting places as fast as the travel channel. It is charged as a reality, but in reality it is a pure primetime soap opera. It tries to use exotic locales as a fa√ßade to lure people into fake competition, and then starts hooking viewers on the soap opera style of competitors. Experience situations in which participants can try and overcome them. Then the winner money will be rewarded. If you can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters, it's even better. While the game format runs in slow motion against Beat The Clock, the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality. <br /> <br /> This show contains elements of several successful past programs. Reality television, hardly, but if you're craving for the contestants, the venue, or the contest, this is your cup of tea. If not, this whole series is, as I say, dripping wet with gravy. It's another show that hides behind the reality label. This is the trend that began in 2000. <br /> <br /> It's smooth and well produced, so it might take a while. After all, Gilligan's Iceland, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Brady Bunch also runs. No professional actors are employed here. The intelligence level is about the same.
