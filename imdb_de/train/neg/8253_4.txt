The movie had a nice opening, I really believed in one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. There was something out of the ordinary about how the film was constructed, realistic and yet somewhat abstract and mystical. Then the action became more and more unrealistic. To say that the end was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would be almost an understatement. The most typical romantic ending, where everything goes well for every "sympathetic" character. A scene where the main character realizes that he has made a mistake and chases the "woman of his dreams" just to confess his love to a sympathetic crowd of spectators. Come on. In the end, the "good guys", "bad guys" win loose ... They get a picture. A WASTE of a potentially interesting movie.
