I love B movies ... but come on ... that was not even worth a note ... The end was stupid ... b / c IT WAS NOT A REAL ENDING !!! .. not to mention that it comes to life on its own ... I mean no light storm or crazy demonic forces? Slow as hell, they'll just start killing the characters one at a time in 15 minutes ... and I will not even start from the side of the thing that kills the one without a head ... and then you can Do not even see what Jigsaw even does with its so-called "new puzzle" ... If you have nothing better to do ... I need to dry dry before I can recommend this godforsaken movie to anyone else ... oh and around it To make even better, the other totem of the movie, you can see the guy throwing the one creature out of the window in the basement scene
