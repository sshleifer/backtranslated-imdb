Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and another bad sequel. I think that's related to the last sequel to the Dream Child. I was fortunate to have the DVD box Nightmare on the Elm Street series for my birthday, so I saw all the sequels. May I say that I am increasingly disappointed, though with these sequels, at least the last two, Freddy has seemingly lost his edge. It's almost as if the writers tried to give Freddy a soul, and they only destroy it instead of reinventing history. This was a sequel that was not needed, apologize to Robert Englund, but this was a lot less than what Freddy Krueger's daughter represents. Maggie, she does not know that he is her father, but she soon learns what his dark secrets are, and he wants her help. She must do her best to resist his powers, but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father. Ironically, right? But Freddy does not give up without manipulating her in his own way. <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: The last nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical, huh? Notice the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels. She is bound to the fifth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series. I'd rather see the second nightmare on Elm Street, to be honest. It just had bad acting, stupid editing and, above all, a bad idea for a story. I did not like the concept, and it just ruined the whole idea of ​​who Freddy Krueger really is, the Death Master of Nightmares, not Father Knows Best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
