Lurked for a few years or so. I've never been moved to post here, so maybe this movie is worth a star, but I doubt it. I just watched it on DVD because I missed it due to illness in the cinema and have not made it yet. I had not read extensively, not even thinking of the movie in a few months. It was exactly what the buddy picked up at the store, and so it was watched. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. <br /> <br /> The setting I talked about in the summary above is in the trailer and on the poster. Jason Statham has hair from the start. Like no other GR movie. Or a JS movie that I saw. At least not in the quantities shown here. And Ray Liotta in underpants SHOULD be warned beforehand. It's scary and funny, but not in a ha-ha-humorous way. It's more like an almost-the -office-but-slightly-mutated-and-failing kind of humor. They all say the same thing: "This movie is not like anything you expect from this movie." Now, based on the previous, extensive film experience, I expected that this movie would be a movie few things. Like: <br /> <br /> () Coherent, <br /> <br /> () Interesting or engaging, <br /> <br /> () Not a complete Farrago of navel-looking, <br /> <br /> () Something more substantial than a colorful collection of ill-fated fables from an Eastern mystical ideology disguised as a "cool, modern, self-assured art form." <br /> <br /> () Hopefully better than "The Idiots". <br /> <br /> As you may have already guessed by my tone, it has completely failed to tick one box above. Instead, it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Badly edited {tempo throughout the shop, 70's amateur high-8 style cuts, incomprehensible "plot" "spins !!!" I could go on with hacked flashback montages ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) Shot like of a depressed 14-year-old Goth who had just spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard the curtains drawn <br /> <br /> (x) So behind the whole "I'm really smart, I" motive / the message behind that it feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so Make sure that the stupid people (ie, those who do not like it) make sure in the audience that they understand the point. <br /> <br /> (x) A real waste of my time. <br /> <br /> As for the undoubted ability of some people to get something out of it, it's good. I am glad that you liked it. A poster said something that grabbed my attention: Under 25-year-olds, it was probably better understood through editing. Maybe, but editing should make your work more accessible, not less. As for the brigade "The genius is only known by the enlightened ones", an onion suckles and grows up. There is nothing more presumptuous and self-serving than people who say that the reason why another person does not know great art is that he does not understand the 'craft / material / lunar cycle / threads of supreme rational thinking' that the author / poet / artist / palm reader / idiot savant 'used to explain his' Vision / Great Unity / Unity with Gaea / Big Bucket of Dog Disease'. <br /> <br /> For me and many, many more people, its garbage. <br /> <br /> Movies, art, stories, poetry, everything to be seen by another person should be captivating and moving. In any direction, be it metaphorically, spiritually, emotionally or whatever you have yourself. <br /> <br /> The only way that brought me to it was on time, two hours closer to my own inevitable demise. "The biggest trick he ever did was make you believe that part of this movie meant 'Anything at All'. <br/> <br /> And now, by all means, toast my rolls for me ,
