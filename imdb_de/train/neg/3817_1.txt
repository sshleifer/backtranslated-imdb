Serious. This is one of the dumbest family shows of all time. <br /> <br /> Plot-A family without a mother and 3 "fathers" raises 3 little girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters: A cute freak Danny, the cartoon loving Joey, the hair obsessed by Jesse, the spoiled brat Michelle, the stupid DJ and the almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to hate the characters, right? <br /> <br /> So I do not think anyone should watch this show. I just chuckled for a few moments during the entire race of the show, and I think that instead of the lethal injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this show, a far worse torture. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
