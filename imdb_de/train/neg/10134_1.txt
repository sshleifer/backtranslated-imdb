Steven Seagal movies have never been Oscar material, but with every release they are getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> This begins with Seagal being picked up by the FBI for killing a few people "in self-defense". An active military is therefore rescued from prison to rescue a stolen stolen craft stolen by used the clich√© "evil English villain", with which Hollywood is so obsessed, including the present day. <br/> <br/> Suffice to say that the film is awful dialogue, which is almost always delivered with a strong cheese coating and lack of acting talent. The story is not interesting and there are segments that make absolutely no sense and add nothing to the story, characters of the film as a whole, like the "lesbian" interaction between the two main women in the cast who is there purely for titling But not even worrying is confusing, as it makes no sense why it happened when it was not needed. <br /> <br /> In short, a horrible script with poor dialogue, delivered by under-a-part actors, boring and sometimes poorly choreographed action scenes and non-relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near-impossible and make the movie even worse close. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of life and make that mistake, even if you are the most passionate fan of Seagal.
