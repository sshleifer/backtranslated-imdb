This inferior sequel, based on the characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also a producer), concerns a marriage called Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They adopt a little girl named Delia from a monastery. Gene York on the re-election of the Congressman and the chairmanship of the Finance Committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be when unexplained deaths occur. It leads to devastation when a metaphysical Mass takes place as supplies of numerology, therapy, healing counseling, yoga, tarot and others are destroyed. Karen York hires an Eye-Private (Michael Lerner) to investigate the strange and bizarre events. <br /> <br /> This TV sequel shows thrills, chills, scary events and bloody killing. Delia like Damien seems to send out a new, sinister murder every few minutes that goes through terrible murders. The main thrill is to observe what new and innocent victims can be made by the mediocre special effects. In addition, mediocre protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, but nice bystanders, such as Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and the recently deceased Don S. Davis, he was a captain of the army, who became an actor. As always excellent music from Omen I and III of the great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is exclusively for hardcore followers of the Omen saga. The film is badly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. Earlier and much better versions are the following: The immensely superior original 'Omen' (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) by Richard Donner; "Damien" (William Holden, Lee Grant) by Don Taylor; Final Conflict (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Grahame Baker. Rating: Below average.
