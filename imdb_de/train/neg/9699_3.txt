Despite what many people thought about the first movie, I really liked it. This, however. How to put it in a nutshell: This movie is (and here comes the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let us look at it bit by bit: Here is the plot: Finally the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow White has other problems: The jester, the father of her Son, has gone astray when the super, split ends, goes to extremes to combat his gray hair and sell the royal offspring for some blonde and full hair. In desperation, Snow White seeks the help of Bubi (Otto Walkees), who must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least find the name Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend when the authors were very drunk, but the studio was under pressure to write the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part or for fans of other actors, it is not worth buying the DVD. You can believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves the movie from forgetting, at least, are the performances of some actors. That's why I gave the train 3/10. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them can make up for the bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, sometimes they even intersect in our reality and sadly .. they do not do anything funny while they are here. <br /> <br /> Many great actors in this film: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as a mirror, Helge Schneider and many more, but unfortunately Not all of these comedians can bring this really bad script to life. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a treat for some hardcore fans, but for ordinary moviegoers or meanwhile DVD renter or buyer, it's not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I even regret having rented the movie.
