An Aventgarde nightmare, a "low-budget movie" that has megalomania. Hard to sit. I get the message that child abuse is wrong. Wow, great revelation. I had no idea it was wrong before I saw that. Yes, that's sarcasm. DO NOT watch this "movie" if you are offended by male or female nudity. DO NOT look at it if you are the least squeamish. DO NOT look at it if you are interested in acting. For the second thought, do NOT look at me. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Make Movie, Premiere, Interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes, movie stills, director commentary, 2 versions of the teaser trailer, music video by The Azoic and a video experiment in the classroom
