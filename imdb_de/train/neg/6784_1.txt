I tried to watch this movie twice and then fast forward the irritating parts, but still could not make it to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this movie * really * got good reviews. I think those people who give such good reviews just try to hype the movie for marketing purposes. Her reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like an insider job that makes things miserable. Movies should receive really positive comments on their own steam and not invented !! <br /> <br /> The acting was reminiscent of a kitschy porno movie and not in a funny way. I do not care about low-budget movies that do bad things when they know how to handle them. <br /> <br /> I found the main character irritating. His expression and humor were unbearably childish. I thought this was intended to make the conspiracy of women more pleasant and sound, but they were even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also awkward (his bosses outdid the business speech) and the unpleasant sarcastic remarks. <br /> <br /> I found nothing redeeming in this movie except for some of the attractive women. <br /> <br /> I have never felt that a review is so misleading. I was interested in his premise, but was scared of everything. Of course you can see it if you want, but I just did not want anyone else to raise their hopes / waste their time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
