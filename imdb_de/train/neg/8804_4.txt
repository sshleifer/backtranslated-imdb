Great CGI effects and a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is a one-trick pony in this movie. How he got the Oscar for Best Actor this year because of Morgan Freeman was a crime. <br /> <br /> This film is a dizzying love letter to the baby boom generation with a very covert right-wing bias, ranging from Forrest's service in Vietnam to the "resolution" with Jenny at the end. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is hugely entertaining and an American movie through and through. I found certain parts of this movie extremely offensive. Zemeckis dumbles this movie almost to the level of Gump. , Maybe that was the point he wanted to try. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and ask yourself, "What does Robert Zemeckis say about what makes a good American?" <br /> <br /> Forrest seems to have made the "right" decisions and has been in the "right place at the right time" for the past 45 years. Those who, according to the director, are wrong, seem to pay a high price. So Zemeckis says that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even American quality?
