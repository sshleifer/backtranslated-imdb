Oh god, where should I start ... bad acting ... characters you just do not care ... are they american or english ... they seem to think they are in america because where else is this here enormous forest in the midland ... <br /> <br /> a big mistake ... they drive through these forests all night ... if they did not walk around, they would have been in Scotland in the morning .. if the whiny the poor wandering woman overturns ... <br /> <br /> and her cell phones are not working .. so, what are they doing ... splitting, of course, making it easier to be ticked off ... so go find three looking for a house that could be in the middle of nowhere, and two staying behind to care for the unconscious woman ... so, what do they do, instead of feeling well, padding their heads, covering them up or even taking them off? take the blooming street away. They just let them lie on the hard road while they make a fire 100 meters away ... and all the time they have a camper they could put them in ... <br /> <br /> and on the horny angels who have wanted humanity so much that they were expelled from the sky to live among us ... what do they do then? enter into sexual relations with men who meet them? ......... no, they bite out huge chunks and tear their heads off ... i think they miss the point ... these are not beautiful sexually robbed former ones angels, they are cannabalistic vampires ... and what tom savini says, how stunning they are .... well, these gals have good bodies, but nothing special in the face. The main character was far prettier than these so-called irresistible sirens ... <br /> <br /> waste of Â£ 2.30 from my local library ...
