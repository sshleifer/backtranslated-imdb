This is not a good movie. Partly to preach and the plot was below average. The 3D was okay, but not great. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about 3 young flies who want to have adventures and want to follow them. The characters are missing, I really do not care about these characters and I feel that there is no reason to interest an adult. Pixar is not. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more special 3D effects. I would also like to see more fly jokes than the mother who constantly says "The Lord of the Flies".
