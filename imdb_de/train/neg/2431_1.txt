As a Turkish man who now lives in Sweden, I must confess that I often see Scandinavian films. Mostly when I never understand them. I think actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood. Last week, together with a Polish friend, I saw a movie called "The Polish Wedding". Unfortunately I was wrong, this movie "House of Angels" is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely not the female star Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so stupid that no one can believe it. I think the whole thing is a mess right from the start. a lot of bad acting, except for Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
