*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a British "thriller" released by First National in the US. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius, who has to leave his research because his money has dried up. Karloff has to retire to France and open a doctor's office. He is proposed by an engaging woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. She knows that Karloff needs the money. <br /> <br /> Karloff agrees with the proposal and soon becomes the husband's personal doctor. Meanwhile, the woman with the native, not so good playboy dances through the city. Karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison and he starts. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the murder and finds that the will has been changed. When he spills the beans on the woman, she goes insane and even bites into the hand of the son. In the meantime, Karloff's nurse has relocated the hypo with which Karloff killed the old man. When Karloff learns that he does not get any money, he asks the woman to poison the son. The sister suspects Karloff and finds the missing Hypo. The analysis shows poison, but not on time when Karloff kidnaps the nurse. <br /> <br /> To make matters short, the nurse flees, fetching the police and manages to rescue the son who is about to be injected by Karloff. Karloff injects himself instead and dies. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good points. Karloff is obsessed and plays the kind of crazy doctor he made in The Devil Commands and the man who lived again. However, it is strange to see him walking stiff and slightly stooped. We never know why he goes this way. I suppose the director thought it would make him more sinister. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the 2-stroke wife exaggerates something terrible. She has a French accent. Although she does not exaggerate badly, you still manage to hate her (or maybe you hate her for acting ...). <br /> <br /> Slightly below average for a Karloff vehicle. If you buy the Sinister Cinema VHS copy, the sound is a bit choppy.
