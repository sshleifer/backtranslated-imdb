My wife and I watch a movie every night without distractions and mostly artistic films that are thoughtful. I have a lot of patience for slow-moving movies. My wife has twice as much attention as me. All this is said - this movie is just empty and boring! There was nowhere. It never started to flourish It started pretty strong with a promising conspiracy ... then it bakes cookies ... goes to Spain ... she pouts, she stares .... the credits roll. Uneven, full of holes, false starts and dead ends. We filmed ourselves through several extended sequences that simply stared into space. Artificial depth was implied as she played with the mud and cried. Zzzz ...... It's like a beautifully shot chick movie pretending to be deep or artistic. You can never get to know or understand Morvern. About half you do not care. We only wanted to develop one of the plotting lines. Do not waste your time with it. I am shocked that it is so high.
