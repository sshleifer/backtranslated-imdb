I love a good war movie and I fall into the category "been done with it". So I would like to believe that my rating is accurate (IMHO). After watching this movie on DVD, I can say for sure that it was a garbage heap. I can not recommend this movie in any case. <br /> <br /> It started when I called the TV and said, "You would not do that", etc ... but I quickly realized that I had a bit of work experience would be an obstacle, well I calmed down a bit. But in the opening scene, as the trailer wheel fell off, I had the uncomfortable feeling that this movie would be a predictable guy ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There was simply no logic for the EOD scenes. All I know is that the army team at the other end of the command cable or remote trigger had some of the most patient insurgents. So much that I scratched my head all the time. Then, if you think you know where the story is going, the boys in the Humvee will be traveling the desert on their own. One of the most valuable assets in the theater when a funny idea with some SAS would-be contractors took place. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was just ridiculous. It just did not make sense and I wanted to switch off there and there. Then they put my patience to the test. It started with the "Contact Right" and went downhill quickly. If you had a British accent, you were shot, but if you were part of the EOD team, suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day. Then, when you thought it was over, it took an inexplicably long time without even adding anything to the story. You just have to watch and ask why it's not over. <br /> <br /> Then we had the alcohol scene where they met each other to laugh. Another scene in which you just wanted it to end. It did not add anything to the movie. <br /> <br /> When my life was very boring, the main star went out of the wire to hunt someone. This is the most ridiculous scene I have ever seen. It defied all logic and ability to write a good story ... it was pointless and terrible. I still do not understand why they wereted time with it. To watch him jogging through the busy streets that returned to the camp I let myself roll on the floor with laughter. Pure Comedy :) <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this story can be seen throughout the show without really deciding what it wants to be. I thought it would be stupid illogical EOD scenes, but then the tangents went on and tried to be something else. But as hard as it tried, it just bored me to death. I just wanted it to end. It was a messy assortment of stupid scenes mixed into a collection of stupid, pointless action (ish) scenes. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this. Perhaps my work experience has a negative impact on enjoyment, but even the na√Øve must realize that this simply does not make sense. The only dimmer thing than this movie is the artificially high IMDb rating ... which must be the 24/7 work of the box office PR team, who seems to use this site to make everyone that everyone thinks they are good. Sorry people ... it just is not! <br /> <br /> Not recommended ... it will bore you.
