Eddie Murphy as Best Supporting Actor What an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can act) goes through this movie like a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? That was acting ??? <br /> <br /> This film fades in comparison to CHICAGO or almost any other recent musical. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the great singing and performance of Jennifer Hudson, I would have given this a ZERO. <br /> <br /> And no, I've never seen the play, so I do not do it the typical Broadway Vs. Hollywood rap.
