Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films in which humor is based more on the weirdness of everything than on actual punchlines. <br /> <br /> At first it was very strange and pretty funny, but as the movie progressed, I did not find it the jokes or the strange more funny. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget movie (that's never a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but eventually I lost interest. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that this film would appeal to a stoner who is at it. <br /> <br /> For something similar, but better, try "brother from another planet".
