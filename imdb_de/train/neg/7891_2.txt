The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film. It should have read: "Be ready to be thrown back into the prison of the 3rd Pew from the back of your family's church at the age of 8, to listen to the preacher drone about God's will while you think of coming home your Lego '. <br /> <br /> It starts with good intentions, building some real and surreal clues, like Rennys' How did the cut on my thumb heal so quickly? 'Moment. Then it slowly turns into a Christian Jamboree and sacrifices its action completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced chatter. I think I counted the use of the word "pray" about 53 times in five minutes at the end. After the 31st I tried to turn the context of the word to its synonym "loot". Unfortunately, this little puzzle game has made the movie at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. Also, it always made me laugh when a figure said "Prayer" ("Preyer" to me) because it was totally crazy. Even my catholic wife sank into boredom in her chair and was almost so far that she landed on the floor. <br /> <br /> For all of the displaced Christians who rated this movie from 8 to 10 stars, I recommend sticking to their theology-enhancing security standards like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, Everything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar, and the like , Stay away from cerebrally challenging issues in films like Jesus Camp, The God Who Was Not There, What Would Jesus Buy Buy Or The Soon To Be Religulous. <br /> <br /> Maybe Robert Whitlow's book is better.
