Judy Holliday struck gold in 1950 with George Cukor's film version of "Born Yesterday," and from then on, her career was finding material that was good enough to beat gold again. <br /> <br /> never happened. In "It Should Happen to You" (I can not imagine a modest title, by the way), Holliday performs another variation on the stupid blonde, who may not be so stupid, but everything about this movie feels and half-hearted. Even Jack Lemmon, in whom I believe he was his first movie role, can not muster enough energy to liven up this recycled comedy. The audience knows how the film will virtually end right from the start, so it usually just sits around waiting for the movie to catch up. <br /> <br /> If you love Holliday, you will enjoy it. Otherwise I would not care. <br /> <br /> Note: C
