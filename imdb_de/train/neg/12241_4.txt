This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an undeniable mistake in her narrative. While dealing with the ralphic situation, Christopher claims to have heard of Pie-O-My Death in a fire accident. This is an important detail, because it is obvious in this context that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who killed Ralphie. However, there is no way that Chris would have heard about the accident. Who should have told him and when? When Tony was torn out of his delirium by Tony's call, nobody else was informed. Tony knows that - which makes it worse! When he heard Christopher talk about the death of Pie-O-My, Tony could only come to the conclusion that Chris himself had set the fire. Given the impressive writing process that the authors themselves said on the DVD, I'm really surprised that none of them recognized the problem there. The story just does not work that way. Needless to add that I'm a big fan of sopranos. Otherwise I would not care.
