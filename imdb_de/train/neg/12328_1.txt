It's obviously illegal. Pedophiles are praying for something like that. How did you come to make such a movie? This movie is all in one word, SICK. Where do people come from and do such films? Actually, when I saw the movie, I did not think they would allow that kid to say maybe 12 if that actually sleeps with that woman. Sorry, if this is a spoiler for you, I would not have seen that. Where did the reason of these people go? Maybe the creators of this film are pedophiles? Our society today is filled with all kinds of sexual predators who pray for children. However, filmmakers make these kinds of films that do nothing but provoke this behavior. I noticed that in a previous comment someone was asked if there is a version showing them naked. This is a kid here and someone asks something like that? What's wrong with this picture?
