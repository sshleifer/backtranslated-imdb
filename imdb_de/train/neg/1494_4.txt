Yes, definitely better than my view of the Death Tunnel. In fact, some of the deaths were quite original and the gore was decent. It was as if Wrong Turn met the hills with his eyes. <br /> <br /> BUT: 1.) When the "kids" (high school or college?) discuss horror movies in the kitchen, all Shae says is almost an exact quote from Scream (1996). The thing about the busty girls, etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Was Steve NO Bootleg Randy from Scream? 3.) What else did the film have to do with Samhain besides the fact that it took place in October? Pretty unnecessary if you ask me. I think it's funny when I see those horror movies from the 80s that explain loose ends by pointing the fingers at the druids or a pentagram. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow, they made a Sam Raimi reference !!! 5.) Why were Gary and his sister in the movie? The characters had nothing to do with it. And he is so spiritual that he could not even see his own death? 6.) When Gary was killed in the bathroom (by which time death became simply troma-licious), how could she hear the screams when she was down, but she did not hear her when she was at the door? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggis, which is primarily a Scottish dish, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) The lesson is, if you are like shae and have no fun or run a smile through the whole movie, will you be the one who lives? 9.) The mutants were pretty cool, but they looked like a bowl of chili con carne. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought in Gary's sister, they forgot that Steve was tied up there wondering where he was going? 11.) Was not there more than one murderer? Shae hit one, but never met again. <br /> <br /> 12.) What about the flashbacks to these other people? Half of them knew that Shae did not know if they were dead or alive. 13.) Why did not you kill Gary and his sister first? 14.) Why did not anyone call the police? And apparently everyone knew that these people lived in the woods. Why did they never organize a sort of raid? 15.) As far as I know, they were not zombies or vampires - how could they eventually become one? I'm with everyone else on the giants "huh?" at the end. <br /> <br /> Much better than the Death Tunnel, but still pretty sloppy. I still do not understand why they made it in Ireland at all, considering that Samhain had almost nothing to do with the plot.
