This is really the worst movie I have ever seen. Ever. Period. I actually paid Â£ 3.50 to see that steamy stink of a movie. Incredibly boring, badly played, dark screenplay, often incoherent and too many scenes that seem to be of no importance to the overall film (for example, when Heath Ledger's priestly partner is nailed to a wall by a ghost ... what was the point? In this scene - please answer on a postcard ...) <br /> <br /> I should have gotten a medal for keeping the whole running time for this movie. I would rather make a strong kick in the groin, than to go through this movie again. <br /> <br /> This should be fed into the bottom 100 of IMDb. Hopefully my vote of 1/10 will help to make it on the way.
