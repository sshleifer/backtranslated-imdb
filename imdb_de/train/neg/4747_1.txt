I found this movie awful. I'm Chinese, so I thought everything was totally wrong. Many facts were wrong. The only thing that was right in the Chinese story in the movie was when Wendy's mother told her husband the statues guarding ShiHuangDi. I also found the fight scenes very cheesy and spurious. Many of the actors and actresses were not very good. Some of the jokes that were supposedly "funny" were really stupid. I think this movie should get the worst rating he could get. Disney really needs to get more information about Chinese history if they want to make an extravagant movie. Mulan was pretty accurate. Watch this movie if you want to lose some time.
