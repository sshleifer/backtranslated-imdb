At least the under ten years old set remains interested. Eleanor (Geena Davis) and Fred (Hugh Laurie) Little, a nice, affluent couple, set out to bring a new little brother home for their son George (Johnathan Lipnicki). They come home with rather strange new siblings ... a neatly dressed little mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox). Yes, Mouse Stuart is happy to have found the feeling of belonging, even if it is in an oversized world that contains the pet cat Snowbell of his new family (voiced by Nathan Lane). Stuart relies on the experience of family loyalty and general friendship. George will finally accept his tiny new brother when skilfully dressed Stuart saves embarrassment at a model boat race. Also in the cast: Julia Sweeney, Harold Gould, Estelle Getty and Jeffery Jones. And the voices of: Chaz Palminteri, Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.
