One would (like me) think that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese a movie should at least be decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest comedy works of all time. Well, apparently I was very wrong - this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It baffles me how one joke after the other can be so profoundly out of line. It hurt me to watch these talented actors do one of the most lascivious script I've ever had. Focusing solely on the big names, I stayed hopeful for a long time throughout the movie, but there was always a lack of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Usually, both in movies and in life, I try to keep it from biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this movie, it's hard not to let go. I can count on one hand, maybe even two or three fingers, big Hollywood productions that made me more bitter. This is without doubt one of the worst comedies I have ever done. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy it - I really did. But the out-of-towners ultimately fail miserably. If you really want time-efficient entertainment, just take your money and watch it whirl around the toilet while you rinse. Please do not look at this movie.
