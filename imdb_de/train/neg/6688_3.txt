This movie is pretty awful, but I have some interesting information about it: <br /> <br /> It was shot in 1976 at Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, and Oak Creek Canyon, near Sedona, AZ. A large part of the extras in the film are acting students of the NAU. I was a freshman that year and had a bit of a theatrical experience, but for some reason I did not engage in production. However, I knew several people who could provide this rather strange fact and can: <br /> <br /> There's a scene in this film, in which two of the principals have to run as part of their ritual dim naked in the movie Forest. They are seen from behind in the movie and do just that. The thing is, these are not the actors, but two people I knew from the theater department. The identity of these "stunt posters" remains anonymous, at least for this website, unless they decide to "reveal" themselves!
