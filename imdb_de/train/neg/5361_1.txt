Watched this movie when he first came out in the 70s and hated him, hated, hated him! Easily the most down-to-earth movie I've ever seen in my life. I do not know where Leigh got his inspiration from, but this is one of those movies in which you want to shake the characters so they can open their mouths and communicate with each other. The title says it all because there are no saving moments in this film, only long, long silence where people can not articulate what they (presumably) feel. If you want to see something that drives you to drink, then this is the thing for you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours, put a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more enjoyable than anything you get from it! Yes, Leigh had a lot of really rewarding stuff in his career much later, but do not miss it.
