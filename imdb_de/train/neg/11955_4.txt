"Visitor Q" is a failed attempt at a black comedy focused on the potentially dysfunctional family of the world, including physical abuse from beatings to murder, inbred to sodomy to necrophilia for a nursing mother nursing her husband and adult daughter The film is so abominable that it received critical praise and established a small cult following. With home video quality and slapdash production, however, "Visitor Q" does not even hold a curiosity. The genitals are blurry and the sanitary facilities clearly visible, the make-up is terrible and everything else is amateurish at best. Waste of time. (C-)
