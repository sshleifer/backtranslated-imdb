As the mother of two young children who grew up with Scooby's many reincarnations, I feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> Whether as a family We had not seen any episodes of Shaggy and Scooby who had a clue that we might have enjoyed it as a light weight, nothing special on the Saturday morning cartoon. But that is essentially the problem that it is in its current format, so light that it does not have the longevity of the "old" Scooby and the gang. I'm sure that this can lead to a quick cash return, but I'm sure the long-term buying of old and young is in real danger of getting lost. When my 6 year old son saw the new version, he was really dissatisfied and said without prompting that he really looked very animated and why it did not look like the one in the last series (Where are you). Scrappy Doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better. Let's hope that there is a hint that refers to the producers.
