I was very excited to see this movie and to expect a visual digression on the relationship between artistic beauty and nature, which contained the kind of wisdom like "Rivers and Tides". I did not receive that. Instead, I get a rather uninspired film about how human industry harms nature. This is clearly a very unorthodox claim. <br /> <br /> The photographer seems to argue about the aesthetic qualities of his paintings and the alleged "ethical" duty he has over the workers, who occasionally populate the paintings along the periphery. And frankly, the pictures were generally not that impressive. And after this "artist" the scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> A stupid movie in every way. For people who want to feel better with their environmental awareness, but not for someone who wants to think about the complexity of the problems involved.
