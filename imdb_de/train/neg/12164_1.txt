This movie is not good. The first movie was almost crappy, but had this unreal ending to be worth seeing. He has nothing. There is no fear, no tension or tension here. This is not really a horror movie Show Nothing. There is no horror to talk about. This could almost be a TV, except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence. Acting is also not very good. I think it could have been worse, though I do not see how. But on the other hand, it's less than 80 minutes long, so I think it's good, but it felt a lot longer. I've found it for a very reasonable price, but it's still not worth it. If you want the more uncut, more graphical version, read the Anchor Bay Edition.anyway, this version of Sleepaway Camp II : Unfortunate campers get a fat, fat 1/10 from me. If you are watching this movie you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper. If you're a real fan, you might want to purchase Anchor Bay Sleepaway Camp (with survival kit) with three disc collections that include the first three uncut and with uncommitted movies, acquire special features
