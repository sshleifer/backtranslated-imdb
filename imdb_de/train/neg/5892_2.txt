Hideo Nakata's Ringu (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002) are clearly demolished with references to Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but abominable bleeding (green corpse with red eyes!). ) weak story and a weak topic (I find it very difficult to find a picture message scary). There were two moments in this movie that made me shudder, both with an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi movie, this one in 1999) made me tingle for hours after seeing it, and all the movies This stealing was actually scary, I can only see this movie as a sell off of the Western popularity of the great Japanese horror movies. Two out of ten.
