There is a good reason why Edison went straight to the video: He would have come to the theaters with a crumbling blow. The movie took too long and was dangerously boring. Just a notch on Lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who apparently had a spare two weeks before the next movies), the bad guys are as laughable and as close to action as Justin Timberlake is. I hate beating the guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his strength, the better. <br /> <br /> The movie is not all bad, mostly only. I like the fact that LL Cool J looked like he was the leading man. He deserves it. And unlike his co-musician and co-star he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always having fun (you can see him swallowing several times when chewing the scenery) and Freeman has the opportunity to lift that streak to three stars (out of ten ... he's not that good). All in all, the ultimate flaw in this movie is that it's a banal and annoying piece of pseudo-action poppycock that keeps nobody awake. It also brings no one to give a good crap about each character. All in all, it's just boring. That is, hire this if you suffer from insomnia.
