good gentleman! (and that comes from an atheist), this "movie" is bad! <br /> <br /> A lot has already been said by the reviewers (those who rated this piece 3 and below), to which I totally agree, I just want to add a few things: <br /> <br /> Among the three boys who had to consume their own digestive products, they were hacked by an ax that was raped by a broomstick. Ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture while listening to the girl's endless and pointless babbling at the kitchen table (like we, but at least we have the grace of mute button) The director cut out the endless and endless cemetery and inverted scenes, our suffering would be over after 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only things that made this movie at least bearable are Emily Haack's tits (one point). <br /> <br /> forget it. Do not buy it Do not waste your time. and your reason My brain is so fried after seeing this. I have an urgent need to see (and suffer) "Scrapbook".
