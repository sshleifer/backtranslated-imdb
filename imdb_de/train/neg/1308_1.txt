The thing that really interests me about this movie (ie the thing about this movie that makes me physically sick) is that somebody actually paid for it. There is absolutely no reason for the existence of this film. It's not scary, it's not thought-provoking, it's not entertaining, it's not good. It's a cyanide sleeping pill. The DVD case compares them to Blair Witch, Evil Dead, and a few other decent movies that clearly show the desperation of the filmmaker. It's nothing like any other movie ever made. it is much worse. The claim of an "extremely shocking ending that you will never forget" is equivalent to a ton of stinking horse droppings. Never waste your time looking at this garbage because you might become sterile. The man who wrote this movie should be deleted from the Writer's Guild member list and never film again. Because if he thinks this is a movie that's worth shooting, he probably will not have much to offer in the future. Zero Stars May Grod mercy on the soul of everyone unhappy enough to see this. I will vomit now.
