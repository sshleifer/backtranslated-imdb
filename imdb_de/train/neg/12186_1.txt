This 1962 remake of the original 1962 book has some very good parts to recommend and some good portrayals of some good actors - but towards the end Scorsese opts for the most formulaic plot changes and an embarrassingly overreacted Shakespearean death that had me looking at my watch. <br /> <br /> DeNiro is an outstanding actor who does everything to do everything he does, but he needs a direction to focus on his talent, and this is painfully missing in the last five minutes of The Movie , <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck's cameo is useful, but not anymore, while Robert Michum is always fun, even with as few lines as this one. Nick Nolte does a better job than Lorenzo's Oil, but not in the same shape as "Weeds". Joe Don Baker has some great lines, while Juliette Lewis proves once again that talents sometimes skip a generation. <br /> <br /> Some good points? The starting points (!), The first glimpse of Cody's back in prison, the scene in which Cody is attacked with baseball bats, Sam Bowden's decorum in full panic, Cody is calm, but nervous <br /> The worst? The "cleaning lady - BUT NOT REALLY !!!" Part. One hundred miles bare-handed at the bottom of a car clinging at high speed. (Are there no speed thresholds in the US?) The "He is dead - BUT NOT REAL !!!" partS and the mentioned long-range end. <br /> <br /> I can look at the original again, but I have not tried to see the remake in four years since I saw it.
