First of all, I want to point out that although I'm not an expert, the way the process was conducted will offend your intelligence. First, the prosecution has never proven that "facilitated learning" actually works. Irresponsible both for the prosecution (because they can appeal) and for the defense because it has not responded. As another commentator said, facilitated learning proved untrue. Secondly, they used Terry as the translator, who has personal interest and will even testify in the process, which is just stupid. If the court had allowed him to testify in this way, they would have used a neutral person, otherwise they would only appeal. Third, the child was never asked by the prosecution any specific questions about the defendant (moles, details of the event, etc.), and even if specific questions were asked by the defense authority, as at the beginning, he could not answer. If that is not a reasonable doubt, I do not know what is and a competent lawyer would have an acquittal. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It starts off well with the pressure to be the parent of a child's autism, but the process makes this movie totally unbelievable.
