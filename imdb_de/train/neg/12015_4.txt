Alfred Hitchcok is by no means my favorite director, but imagine what he could have done with it! The plot has a lot of potential for excitement. John Garfield is almost always excellent and Raymond Massey is skeptically cast against Typus. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive lead actress, but the minor cast is big and very capable. Yes, it sinks early. There are too many coincidences. An important topic is banalized by the fact that in the end it is made into something more than a love story. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch out for Garfield, Massey and the actors. But it is not very good.
