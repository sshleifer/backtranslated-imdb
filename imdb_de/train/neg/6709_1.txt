I'm easy to talk to. I enjoyed "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and their many sequels, even though most people found them unbearable. I even managed to enjoy most of the Pauly Shore movies. I just saw a movie that I can honestly say is bad ... and that was it. I have not seen it for a while, but I remember sitting in the theater and thinking, "This is a stupid movie, why did I see that?" It's really the only movie I can not recommend.
