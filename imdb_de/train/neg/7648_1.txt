It is considered a fashion to emphasize every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance, however silly this illogical "logic" may be. However, within the history and theme of the film, there is no gray area, and the woman who should be called the antagonist of the film is the "villain of history." Under no circumstances can what she has done be justified. Sexuality of women in this case is just a hype and has nothing to do with reality. It's betrayal of the ultimate strain. The man spent his resources and time lavishly raising the offspring of another man. To crown it all, the weakest arguments that lead the three "liberated" female characters to climax are pitiful. The sexual needs of a woman are no excuse for committing adultery and constantly betraying her husband. Worse, there are no other children. His life has been essentially wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations lead to the execution of the unjust.
