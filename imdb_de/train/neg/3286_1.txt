I do not understand why remakes have become a trend. Every remake I've ever seen is awful, and this is no exception. If any of you have seen Ben Jones's quote that it's a "dirty" trash, then he's right. Why they would take a wonderful television program I loved, never missed an episode and put their own seasons 1-4 on DVD, and I'll never tell them. The TV show was a family show, and although Daisy has the body, she was really flaunted or even featured on the show, except for the outfits. A family show was taken to a dirty piece of garbage and I would not recommend anyone to look at it. What I did not like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are great actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they're also extremely cute. The new Bo and Luke are not even a little bit sweet. That was one of the drawers for the show. The casting is awful. At least you could have gotten a brunette for Daisy. I also do not think Burt Reynolds is a qualified boss hogg. Every other role he has ever played is completely opposite to this role. The only role they play reasonably decent is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but still it's not a comparison. Denver Pyle is a very special actor, and that made him perfect for the role. I think the casting is awful, the story is terrible, and ruined a wonderful show altogether and turned it into a filthy, horrible movie. I would not recommend anyone to see it. I just saw it out of curiosity. There was a free entry ticket in the 4th season. I never paid for this movie, but it was free. DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS FILM.
