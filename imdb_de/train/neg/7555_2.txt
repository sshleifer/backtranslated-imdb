Do not be fooled by the premise - this was a funny movie. The problem - it should not be a comedy. History prepares you for an end that never comes. Worse, the setup will NEVER be explained. They will leave the theater and ask, "Is that it?" I simply rate it at 2 because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage has done as good a job in this role as he expected, but he had very little work to do. There are weird quirks and interesting twists that have absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Have this video here before you waste your money.
