The Invisible Man is a fantastic movie from 1933, an innovative film for the time when objects rest on a truly invisible man. Look at the movie, you'll be shocked that it was made in 1933. It was the first real special effect film. Coming in 2000, computer-aided special effects seem like a breeze. The audience is not overwhelmed by special effects, but disappointed if it is not done right. The special effects in Hollow Man, the update to the HG Wells story, are fine, but not the biggest problem with this Paul Verhoeven film, which you may remember from Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist who has fought in the world of bio-invisibility (yes, I know that's not a word), but of course he fights against higher Americans who threaten to fund the team take away. Since film characters, who are about to cut their funding, tend to do so, he brings the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibility process (yes, I know, I used that non-word again). The process has dire consequences, no Caine does not die, but becomes a horny, violent creature aka a man. Now that he's invisible, Caine is following a sexy neighbor, a co-worker, former girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue), and the man who took him out of finance. Then a funny thing happens, Caine becomes a new supernatural being: "That which will not die." Caine laughs in the face of all things natural and looks at death and spits in his face, because it takes hours for this creature to die and pull out the end of the movie. The film is stupid, stupid and ultimately ridiculous with the way realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. In Hollow Man there are plenty of opportunities, but of course none of them are investigated. To get a more interesting look at an invisible creature, prepare for an old-fashioned black and white movie theater and visit the 1933 Invisible Man. Kevin Bacon is still invisible when you come back, probably at the bottom of a volcano.
