This was a popular movie, probably because of the humor, the fast-moving story, a submissive character that silences all loud mouths, etc. Funny is that you probably could not make a movie with this title if you replaced someone However, "white" as something else would be considered racist by the police. Nonetheless, Woody Harrleson, as the white guy who turns out to be as good, if not better, than any black basketball player, is just as interesting as his main partner, Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> Snipes had many funny lines that made for a lot of humor. The bad part of the movie - which does not bother many people - is the extreme profanity here and the sloppiness of all the characters. This includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean, nice people in this movie. For this reason, I can not honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lot of obscenities
