and forget that. Completely. If you really have to see how Madonna acts, you can rent "Body of Evidence", at least Willem Defoe is one of them. <br /> <br /> If the sets are beautiful, you should mute the dialog. You will miss nothing. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a prop and Madonna is so awful that it gets amusing. I will never know why they had to slaughter the original film into this mess; Presumably, they thought it was "bankable". Madonna, as an actress, is certainly NOT. <br /> <br /> If you borrow the original movie from 1979, you'll enjoy it, and the actors in it can actually act. 1.10
