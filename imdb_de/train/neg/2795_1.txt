Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a gun in her mouth and blows her friend Neal (Jason Dibler) off the back of her head. Cassidy was the singer of a "Demons and Death" rock band that could not shake off the sad feelings of her friend's neglect (you know, I can find other sensible ways to solve this problem rather than hit a bullet through your head ). , However, she returns and has the soul of Dora (Jill Small), her friend, who is to replace her with vocals for the group to end the album, which was stopped by Cassidy's premature death. But, Cassidy has made a deal with the Dark One and souls are to be gathered. She is consumed by this rage on mostly Neal, but all the band members or anyone in the music studio are killed if they fall prey to the desperate Dora..not Cassidy returns for the payback. <br /> <br /> Lousy's micro-budget horror movie looks cheap, has a cheap cast that should make plans in another division, and offers cheap kill scenes that are not that bit of effective.
