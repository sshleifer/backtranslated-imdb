You can often find that a film has not become as it should through the intensive use of a narrator. This movie is consistently equipped with this device. Richard Jobson is not completely satisfied with writing directly and even funding some of these films. He helps to read excerpts from his own semi-autobiographical typeface, which, in conjunction with some pretty edits, misses a boring, depressing story that he must confuse for a true art house. Kevin McKidd shows a good performance. Everyone else is fine. <br /> <br /> Budget constraints meant that all scenes were filmed in daylight, though most are obviously intended for the night. However, if you know serious alcoholics, they work mostly on the day, so it adds a touch of realism. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie is a waitress who does not even age a single day in the twenty years that pass between her performances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has goes from 18 to 30 without more than to change his clothes. Bless.
