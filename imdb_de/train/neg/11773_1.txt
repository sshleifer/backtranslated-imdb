I have landed on these boards for several years because of the lack of sheer intelligence that is communicated through the reviews that regularly appear in the IMDb section of this film. I have seen this film courtesy of the New York New York Film Festival (which this year had a superb selection of films, see June's Essential Snake, CHA NO AJI, Survive Style) and have every day regretted having a scene Arisen from this film dissolves from the back of my mind and becomes a living memory. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you can read a laudatory summary of the movie from Subway Cinema, so I probably made the mistake of pulling my friend to the movie. The description built up the horror film that I had longed for for a time based on terrible terror rather than cheap fear. P was really different. It relied on cheap laughs. <br /> <br /> The incredibly annoying announcer described this movie as a "lesbian team to fight monsters." Not at all. There's a subplot in this movie that looks like the relationship between the girl and Pookie is actually going somewhere. More lies. This movie seems like a short film for "Are you afraid of the dark?" The story is ridiculous and they only succeeded in eliciting laughter and confusion from the audience after they had finally revoked their attempt to look at the film with a sense of seriousness and forgotten the $ 9 they were wasting at the door. I almost wish Paul Spurrier was in the audience so that I could laugh at him and ask him why he wasted 5 years in Thailand to make a bad softcore horror cum porn owned by The Spice Channel and the The actress only managed to excommunicate from her family and caused quite a stir at the Belgian Film Festival. The only excitement that produced this was a gut gut, as he could not extract himself from the skin he is. In any case, I hope that I can not stop anyone from making the grave mistake of watching this movie. It really was one of my three worst movie experiences that excluded Soulplane for # 2.
