Okay, like most Steven Seagal fans, I know I will not expect a masterpiece every time he makes a movie, but I expect the movie to have at least some sorting budget. The main problem with the copy I looked at was the terrible dubbing. I know this has to be done in some movies, and I accept that, but if they overwrite with a completely different actor voice and do this through the movie, this is the magic of overdubbing. The sets seem to be built without care, because in a scene, the glass sunroof in a top-secret laboratory has a huge crack. I was really disappointed with this movie and just hope the next Stevens project is more finished before the movie is sent out for sale / rental. The story of this movie made me wonder if I saw a sci-fi movie or not, as if some parts seemed alien, but they never fully explained what's going on. I found that very confusing.
