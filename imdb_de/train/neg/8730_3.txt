What I (unfortunately) comes to mind in this film is the introduction, in which John Berlin (Andy Garcia) drives into the city. You see his Mercedes driving on a winding road through a forest that looks like it's full of redwood trees. It's pretty nice. <br /> <br /> To Andy Garcia, who plays a character with the surname Berlin, well ... Andy is just too Latin American to be passable. Maybe a Caucasian father married his Spanish mother for this story? Who knows. But I can tell you that when you take him to a town full of farm-dwellers and hicks, he's like a sore thumb, especially with his accent flaring up when he gets angry. Yes, I know, big deal, right? He is still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a serial killer calling his victim Jennifer. All victims are blind and he breaks them down. The killer has taken a break, but suddenly reappears when a blind witness (not asking) appears, Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman). Thurman does a good job as a blind person, to my surprise. When I saw Lance Henriksen playing Sgt. Freddy Ross I was worried. Henriksen has been playing in some pretty strange movies, especially lately. I still can not forget him in the bloodbath movie Pumpkinhead. <br /> <br /> Berlin is filming as a detective in a small town by L.A. He begins to investigate the Jennifer murders after finding body parts at the local landfill. His brilliance in finding a victim was blind, seemed far-fetched. Also the irony of * SPOILER * Freddy's assassination, with the recording and the name similarities. I was very confused about the logic of how eight "Jennifer's" came. And the murderer's motive as simply confused was not particularly bad. In hindsight, this movie is more likely to be vital if it shows an unsuspecting person to be fit for murder, just because he eventually became insane or was born as a Loney Toons in his interrogation of Garcia! However, a bull would not be allowed to squeeze and hog someone without being properly banged. As for the end, it's a small surprise, but it's very controversial, much like Sgt. Ross' murder The murderer decides to run after his running victim and instead chooses to joke. <br /> <br /> And there are so many ways to kill her that it's ridiculous. I will not ruin the end, because despite the shakiness it is a good surprise. Afterwards you will probably say: "Boy, she was lucky!" 4.10
