Okay, let me pull it down for you ... It's awful! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble did such a great job at the first Cruel Intentions, why did he do such a bad job? I'm sorry, but this movie is stupid. He could have improved if his series was ever aired but can be realistic. A lot of bad acting * NOTE The Shower Scene * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What is that line? "Slipery in wet condition" ?????????? Can we say DUH-M! This movie had a hard time, I'll give that to you, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make fun of it by giving the house servants dumb accents that are actually ... WHAT LUST! It was pathetic. Not to mention that in this case they make everyone look absolutely like the original. It's like they're deliberately letting them look different or something! I like to look at it when I'm really really board, which does not happen occasionally. For those of you who like it ... Okay, what did you think? Could you possibly choose this movie over the other, who had great acting and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar? A movie is gold when Sarah Michelle Gellar is in it, DUH! But this movie is not insulting, Amy Adams. Oh yes, since when does Sebastain have a heart ????? POOH!
