This is the biggest flop of 2008. I do not know what the director has to cause such a big disaster. The songs were added without any situation, the story was stretched to fill the 3 hour gap, and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors. It's as if everyone has superpowers that can run between the balls, and nothing happens and one person fights with 100 people. Only the best performance was achieved by Anil Kapoor. He's always at his best and plays the role of the villain with a comic act that speaks Hinglisch ... Akki has done a good job as well ... But the filmmaker just forgets it.
