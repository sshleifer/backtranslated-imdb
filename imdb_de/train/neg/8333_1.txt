This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Acting is bad and the plot is almost incomprehensible. Whether you like fire ships or other ships is irrelevant. For special effects, the film has no. The entire film crew was probably in rough seas on the boat and not in a studio, and when some of the men are "stabbed" (if you can even call it that) their reactions are totally unreal. The guns are quieter than a mute button. How this film can be awarded two prizes poses serious questions to the state of the human mind. Well, that's it. This review is probably more fun than the movie. If someone is considering looking at or buying it, I would seriously discourage you for obvious reasons. I said that it contains a spoiler. If the fact that some people are stabbed and a gun is fired is a conspiracy. I suspect it's because they're the only good parts of the movie.
