Probably the worst film in New Zealand ever made <br /> <br /> The jokes you are not funny. Used from other movies & just stupid Acting is bad though there is a great cast <br /> <br /> The story is uninteresting & boring Has more cheese then pizza huts Cheese lover Pizza Art like acting 1,000 times before I saw that when it came on TV, but it was so boring that I could only stand for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie is shit. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, <br /> <br /> Look dry instead
