The only reason I rented it was because of the article in Fangoria Magazine. The article made this movie interesting. Well it is not. This was a very boring, amateurishly written and staged movie. All the actors in this movie are terrible, except Faye Dunaway, who is always a pleasure. But too much time focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with Ravens and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a strong Argentine accent, you can only understand every word he says. Also present is Nicholas Pauls, who plays the ultimate love for Gina Phillips. Conclusion: This movie is not scary. There is only one good scene and these are the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I would have given this one star, but I gave it three just because I like Faye Dunaway so much. But even she was not so great.
