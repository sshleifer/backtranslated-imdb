Dieter Bohlen, the notorious German composer and producer of some wasted pop hits like "You're my heart, you're my soul," felt the urge to tell his story - and gracefully decided to hire a ghostwriter. The result was a funny book about his life. Well, more or less a blurry picture of it. He did not deny that he was a selfish asshole, but the whole story was shot to fit his image of himself. No word that he probably beat his former wife and she ended up in the hospital. However, it was written in a funny style and after his appearance as a jury member of the German version of "American Idol" a huge success - especially his unforgettable comments. <br /> <br /> This should be the end of the story - yes, really. In the hype of the mentioned "Idol" show entitled "Deutschland sucht den Superstar" (DSDS), someone has come up with the terrible idea of ​​making a movie out of the book. The result is "Dieter - the movie". <br /> <br /> I've rarely seen a movie that desperately tries to be funny and so totally failed. None of the gags really hits the mark. Naddle's voice and speech got on my nerves, though Verona's voice should have done more. Obvious, childlike, predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie within minutes to the end. The content of the film is a sloppy movie adaptation written down sloppily by a ghostwriter based on Bohlen's sloppy idealized memory. They could have used that freedom to do almost anything. It was supposed to be a satire, but they failed. The story is completely uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the entire film has nothing satirical at all. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder it was considered bad for a movie release. The likelihood that this thing would rot in any archive was quite high until the DSDS season turned out to be a mediocre success. With the "friendly" help of Germany's largest yellow press newspaper "BILD" and the desperate situation for the television station RTL, during the still unbeatable show "Wetten dass ...?" On Channel 2 the movie finally starts on TV - unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, it's a waste of time - there are certainly better cartoons with a lot more fun and a really worthwhile story. <br /> <br /> Therefore: 2/10
