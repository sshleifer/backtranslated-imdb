Another film about a tortured, arrogant, arrogant, callous, hateful, self-destructive main character we should take care of. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong I'm very open to all kinds of people The wall movies, which have a very self-destructive character as their main character. What I throw against it is that this guy has so little background. Why did this guy hate himself and the world? If the script had been more concerned with that, they might have been able to sympathize with it. Just as he is, he just comes across as an unpleasant hateful character, not tragic, just hateful. <br /> <br /> After he went to great lengths to make this guy as crazy and antisocial as possible, and his fate as dark as that, the author may have the nerve to make a happy ending ... . <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it's a good fight! Man! Do not waste your time.
