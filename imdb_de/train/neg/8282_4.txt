By now, you should already know about this movie, the Jessica Simpson "bomb," which ran pretty much directly on video (limited, anemic theatrical release). Basically, Ms. Simpson Katie has traveled from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend to surprise him, to find him in bed with another woman. She's stranded, but she has a friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I would have loved to see more often in the movie), who lets her stay. In the end, Katie gets a job through two lamentable colleagues (Penelope Ann Miller and the always amusing Andy Dick) who are using Katie to oust the company's president (Larry Miller). This is strictly speaking a b-movie that should not be profound. Jessica Simpson is by no means a great actress, but she is pretty and never really annoying. The film is to be seen in the sense that it is not an abomination, but a throwaway fluff. Penny Marshall is funny in a cameo (a subtle joke about Milwaukee made me giggle), and there's a funny scene with Norwegian priests (do not read too much about it). Not terrible, but easy to skip. Your bet is to watch it on TV, if it ever happens. Not good again, but no deep catastrophe.
