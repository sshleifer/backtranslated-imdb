First of all, I'm sorry that you gave this movie even a rating of 1 (not less than this available). The film fails in every department, be it scripting, directing, characterizing or acting. <br /> <br /> 1) At the beginning, the name of the movie is really C-Class (although the movie itself is named). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to do justice to the character, but the weak writing, coupled with a pathetic direction, makes him a humorous figure. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has a reward of 50,000 on him (which was convincing). Here in Aag, there were 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by our so-called heroes and had few men to drive with all automatic rifles) Does not look convincing. 4) As for Nisha Kothari, someone has to tell her that she does not know acting. Why does Ram Gopal Verma repeatedly throw her away? 5) Mohanlal was good, but there is not much to do for him. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav, who are great actors, are wasted in the movie. 7) Legendry's role, played by Lilac Misra (Mausi von Basanti) in Sholay, will be replaced in this film by some Gangu mummy cheap. Ramu, please wake up and understand that there must be an intellect in your movie. Enough stupid characters like Shiva and Aag in your movie. 8) I should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru ... for the most part complacent. <br /> <br /> In summary, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and funny translation of the original classic. Please do not waste money or time on this movie. I think it would be a better idea to see Aap Ka Surror (who in my opinion was the worst possible movie) than to see this terrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and a miserable direction. Thanks, Saurabh
