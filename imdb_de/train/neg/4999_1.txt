I ask ... What a shit are the Real TV? Never I see something B ****** in my life: A ******, dirty, f ***** bad and other a ****** things, but everything else is just a piece of American shit. Britney always says, 'oh my ***, I want to see his cock, I want to f ** and put his D ***' 'and he thought' 'Oh, as if I had not made her money yet' ' "It's just another show of s *** somebody that's the only good thing that Britney sells in interior clothing, but nonetheless to notice something special, it's just like saying another show on this show, but the money to digest pure sex all the time. I only see that I sleep in the previous show, for this I want my damn money
