This was a painful example of a cheap, boring and unoriginal show produced by Australian TV stations to meet local content quotas. The writing was really horrible and I'm not surprised that the writers are responsible for the worst Australian movie of late, the honest Wally Norman. Nothing about this TV series was funny - never mildly amusing. It was just tired and bad, and worst of all, it was really funny. It was just embarrassing to see. <br /> <br /> This show has 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to get a (real) review of a (real) Australian viewer of the show (there were not many) and it's impossible. Or crazy. There are loaves of bread that are funnier than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at all costs and when it appears on DVD, remember that the laughter that deserved was unwanted.
