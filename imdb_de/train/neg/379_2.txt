The TV Guide calls this movie a mystery. What's a mystery to me is how it's possible that a culture that can produce such complicated and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians can not produce a single film that goes beyond the contemptible trash can that this film so perfectly represents , This is Bollywood in its best / worst form, I really can not tell the difference. Disgustingly sweet, cheesy clich√©s on every level, action, situations, dialogue, music and choreography. To put it simply, you have to delay to enjoy it. I saw it to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to leave because I could not bear it anymore. The only redeeming quality of the film is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
