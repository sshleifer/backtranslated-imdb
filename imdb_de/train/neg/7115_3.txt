Okay, so the introduction with the hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone dying of fright during the movie is so lame it's funny. And so the first "skull scene" is so boring and unobtrusive that it is funny. The actual plot of the movie is a decent one, there is at least some thought-provoking input into the characters' behavior, and the plot change is decent when horror movies go off. The spectacle is average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is not quite as a 1/10 movie. It's not terrible enough to get the lowest or even the second lowest rating. If I just read the script, I would say that this could be a decent movie. It's just that the terrible direction and production are ruining the movie. So it's a bad movie, but there are many worse ones.
