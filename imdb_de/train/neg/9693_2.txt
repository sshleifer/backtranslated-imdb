The overheated plot of "Bonjour tristesse" comes from a youthful first novel by Francoise Sagan, who became a bestseller, though God knows why. For teens who want to get rid of a potential stepping up, this can have a certain appeal. Do not be impressed by the fact that David Niven plays the Playboy father and Deborah Kerr plays the stepmother prospect. Unfortunately, too much rest on the weak shoulders of Jean Seberg. She is beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can beat poses, but she can not act. Anyone who saw her as Jeanne d'Arc in Otto Preminger's St. Joan - Seberg's first film - knows she was unable to make a movie at the age of 19. This film, also by Preminger, fulfills the "promise" of the first. It was her second movie. She was 20. What did Preminger think? That Niven and Kerr could compensate Seberg's lack of acting power? No chance? Seberg's character is at the heart of the story, and although she is 17, she can not fulfill the emotional demands of the role. I do not know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she had no influence on my consciousness in her later pictures. If you think that this film is better than mediocre, it needs a taste test. Despite Niven and Kerr, this remains a youthful story that is juvenilely executed by a pretty young girl in desperate need of acting lessons.
