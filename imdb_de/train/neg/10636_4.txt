I was really looking forward to the show, given the quality of the actors and the fact that the brothers The Scott were there. Unfortunately my hopes were dashed! Once again we believe that the KGB are a group of incompetent idiots who have no idea what they are doing. At one point there is a ridiculous scene in which 4 KGB agents could not serve a CIA agent. I get tired of these one-sided and totally inaccurate depictions of the spy game that took place during the Cold War. I find it ridiculous that the US is unable to make objective films about its involvement in World War II and beyond. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we believe the US got the Enigma machine completely wrong again. <br/> <br /> In his honor, "The Company" is filmed and acted very well. The venues are also exceptionally well realized. Alfred Molina, like Keaton, does a great job (The conflict between them has been very successful). I really wanted to enjoy this show and no doubt I will end up watching the other 2 episodes, but I really wish the US productions would stop presenting their spies, soldiers, etc. as supermen who are mentally and physically superior to Planet. It is getting old quickly and seriously compromises the plausibility of what a 10/10 could have been. <br /> <br /> S
