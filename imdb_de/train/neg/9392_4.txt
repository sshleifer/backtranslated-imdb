... and also Ethel Merman fans will love their loud, imperious vocals as the evil witch Mombi, but this animated cartoon on "The Wizard Of Oz" is deprived of real fantasy, replacing fantasy and excitement with loud action (and cheap) repeats his material like a bad music video). Little Dorothy is taken back to Oz where she is ruined and meets old and new friends. The inelegant animation is somewhere between the weakest Walt Disney and the less-inspired shows of Hanna-Barbera, though many of the songs are good, especially Dorothy's sweet "It's a Far Away Land" suit, which is excellently played by Liza Minnelli. You can rely on Minnelli for energy, so the movie always gets better when Dorothy is around. Much is unbelievable, and I'm not even sure if Baby Boomers will get a fee for it, since it has not been around for so long. As a curiosity just fair. ** from ****
