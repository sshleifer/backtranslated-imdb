My dad is a fan of Columbo and I always liked the show. I always explain my contempt for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he still looks at it. That's his right as an American, I think. But my senses were aligned with the show when I found out that Spielberg had staged the first episode. At that time I was grateful that my father had bought this show, that I really can not stand it. I went through his DVD collection and came up with this thing when I came home for a college visit. My opinion of the series as a whole was not affected, but I got respect for Spielberg, knowing that he started like most low-level directors. And that makes a little dribbling, until the big fish comes (get the pun, HA, HA) Like Spielberg, it's like Jesus, before he became a man, or at least I think that would feel like English: www.goethe.com .de / ges / mol / thm / tde / en2690299.htm As a fan of Columbo, you would most likely like this, even if it contains little of Peter Falk, because this is the beginning of the series and no one knew where he should go was the crime's culprit instead of Columbo's investigations, as many later episodes would do.
