Everyone in this film tells Raffy Carruthers how talented she is, what a great director she'll become someday, etc. I think they're just nice. Even Kimble Rendall, the director of this film, shows more talent than she. Call them "The next Jane Campion"; and even if both are overrated, they both have a lot in common. They both film directly. They are both women. They are both Australian. (Well, give or take.) <br /> <br /> Yes, it's one of those movies where a character is considered brilliant, and we just have to swallow hard and accept it. But I say that for Carruthers: she's cute. -And fascinating. Not really. Here are some thoughts on their lack of talent: <br /> <br /> (1) Part of the talent of a director is in dealing with people. Why is Carruthers so phenomenally bad at getting her crew to even notice her? To make it easier for anyone to deviate from the set and get killed, I assume. <br /> <br /> (2) Why is this one of the most convincing depictions of a movie set I've ever seen? It must have been filmed on a REAL film set. How could you do it wrong? If Rendall's set was half-understaffed, it's a wonder he's finished his film. <br /> <br /> (3) Carruthers - the fictional director - has set himself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror movie. Fat chance. I doubt it's possible these days. I suspect that Rendall - the real and talented director - has taken on the same task, realized that this is not possible, and instead opted for a (sighing) parody. Of course it is not enough of a parody to work as a parody. Once the cast and crew enter the isolated mansion, the movie spends most of its time doing what the horror movies of the 1980s did ... well, not so badly. <br /> <br /> (4) and yet ... the movie does not start with a parody, but with an honest honesty of the 80s horror, with Molly Ringwald (that's too good to be true). This pastiche is much better than anything that follows. (This is a bad sign if you wish you to watch the movie in the movie and not the movie.) But it too was shot in the late 1990s. Maybe it's still possible to make the horror of the 1980s. You just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and make it MOST. <br /> <br /> (5) I never wondered what the horror of the 1980s would look like if all the characters had Australian accents, but now I know it. And strangely, I'm glad I know. A need that I never knew I had was fulfilled.
