Although I am generally a proponent of the well-made film, I do not limit myself to films that elude these limits, and most of the time I enjoy and admire films that "break the rules" successfully. And it's true that director Pasolini violated the rules of established cinema. But I also think that he does not break it successfully or to a certain point. <br /> <br /> Pasolini's work is visually shattering, but this is less a question of actually being on-screen than how she's filmed, and the bounce of his films seems less to be a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. This applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors, and while many directors have done so with remarkable results, his non-actors under the direction of Pasolini tend to remain non-actors. This also applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often includes images that are intended to shock, insult, or otherwise confuse the audience. Such elements can often be used with startling effects, but in Pasolini's hands such elements rarely contribute to the film. This also applies to DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I was told that there are many people who like Pasolini's movies, even admire them. Still, I've never met one of them, and I've never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that made me understand the reason for such sympathy or admiration. I appreciate him from his works, and I think he was essentially an amateur director who "did not break the election" so much by choice as by lack of skill and who was originally acclaimed by the intelligence of his time "existential audacity ", he simply confirms him in bad habits as a filmmaker. I find his work boring, unimpressive and overbearing. And that goes for DECAMERON too. Sadly, this also applies to virtually every Pasolini movie that I suffered for my misfortune.
