Many people see this as a classic, but I obviously have overlooked something. Life in Anarene, Texas in the early '50s is pretty boring - which means a movie about life in Anarene, Texas in the early' 50s will be pretty boring! What do so many people see in it? As soon as the last picture exhibition in Anarene is closed, there is really nothing to do in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes this clear at the end of the film. But even before it closes there is not much to do, so basically it's all about sex. Students make plans about how to lose their virginity - sometimes together and sometimes with some bored adults in the city. You see, there is not much to do for them except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers) or whine about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought would give the movie a spark of drama. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing really happens, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) flee, but nothing really happens. Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens. The only thing that added something of dramatic value to the film was the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms), which really underscores the emptiness of life in this miserable little town while the men stand around looking at the body that is debating about it go to breakfast. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, indicating how gray this city is, but the only thing that I found interesting was the early view of actor Bottom, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (Incidentally, it was frightening to see how Quaid - 1971 - actually looks like his character, cousin Eddie, in the National Lampoon Vacation films Classical I do not believe 3/10
