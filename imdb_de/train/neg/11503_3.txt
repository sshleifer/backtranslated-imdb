Quentin Crisp once said that when things are shown too well, you're romantic. When things are unbearably bleak, they are realistic. And if something gets the ironic treatment, they are just right. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa he falls into the second category. This director has obviously been trying too hard to make a Spanish "Ken Loach" movie without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters that make Loach movies not "depressing". Los Lunes al Sol is just that, just depressing. Things are unrealistically bleak. The ultimate moments of the character's characters all reach a peak at the same point. If the depressing story is not enough, Aranoa washes the story with a visually gray and dirty color palette. The films were ridiculously overrated on the Goya. A film that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society, in this case unemployed dockers, is not automatically a good movie, even though I would be the first to sympathize with the fate of these people. This movie only manages to make me disinterested in her fate. In Spain, the unemployed in the 21st century do not live like beggars, and public transport ferries have adequate toilets, and it's hard to find a bar with so few visitors and so little luck. Leon de Aranoa seems to have no idea of ​​the working class Spain, and does not like it. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene, in which the men watch a football game for free, has been copied directly from a film that deals with the topic of "poverty" much more realistically, namely, "Purely Belter", which is far more captivating, humorous. and yet sad.
