You have to wonder how some flics are ever made ... this one decided to jump over with the why of many other things, and just wanders over the jerk. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, there are a number of decent actors who do their best to give life to the story. The blue tint in the entire movie flooded "again", which alone would be depressing, but here it is exaggerated. The idea that this is not a disease, not a house or a gypsy or jewelry curse, but simply something that happens for no apparent reason to our protagonist and everyone else around her, is just as if you were take a long drink of an empty cup. Some doppelgangers have superpowers, but others do not know or do not know they do. It seems they are as ignorant as we are. <br /> <br /> It's a poor man who has dismissed "Body Snatchers Invasion" with Keifer Sutherland's "Mirror" and "The Sixth Sense" together seriously messing up these three.
