Yes, that sums it up. This movie was awful. After two minutes I wanted to stretch my eyes out. This was praised as an "innovative LDS comedy," but it's not even good for members of this church! I do not think that a person should be so tormented that he sees a movie of this low quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, it can be said that absolutely no effort has gone into this film. It seems that the terribly drab, smooth, three-part conspiracy was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow filled with the gift of coherent (at least half-coherent) thought. Then there is the acting, which is dismal by all concerned. Even the cameos liven nothing up. <br /> <br /> And let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a superficial idiot whom we would like to believe change, but this path is filled with embarrassingly bad dialogue, vile gags, and many Mormon "jokes" that anyone who is rational, LDS or not, should consider as purely stupid! This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen!
