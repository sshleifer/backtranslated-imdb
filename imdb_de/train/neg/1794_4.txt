not your typical vamp story, no bram stoker or anne rice here. a really original vampire story. These vampyren are genetic mutants that do not disturb sunlight. They are just evil. <br /> <br /> the movie is not perfect. Many of the actors are clearly amateurs. However, the two leads who play van Helsing and collect the vampire chick are pretty good. The movie is very violent, which can disturb some people. It is also equipped with scientific details that are difficult to understand and boring for many. I was sold because of the skilful action and the good performances of the couple. It is not clear how successful this movie could be if it had a bigger budget and mass distribution
