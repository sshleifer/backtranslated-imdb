This movie was terrible, from conception to execution. The US needs to set up a "Star Wars" site in this remote country? That's her premise? The US decides to gain access is to win an obstacle course like a cross country race where the winner can claim anything from the leader. And who could win this race, known as a "game", better than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission. And do not forget that his father operated. Luckily for our hero there are gymnastics devices in happy places, like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a place (without reason) in the middle of the crazy city. Perfect. <br /> <br /> But beyond the dreadful HORIBBLE premise, is the clumsy fiddling of the romantic scenes, the obviously highly depressed Ninjas, whose only job seems to be to show the racetrack and the worst climax of all time , After our hero has won the race, he addresses the wishes of the US government. And lo and behold, all the effort was worth it, because the US gets their "Star Wars" page! Huzzah! WHAT DOES YOUR TRIUMPHANT? Wow. <br /> <br /> But being such a bad movie can be a lot of fun. The cover, on which ninja's were shown with machine guns, was enough to rent this film. <br /> <br /> But if I met Kurt Thomas (the Turner star) in real life, I'd probably do that for him after a double somersault with 2 1/2 turns in the layout position.
