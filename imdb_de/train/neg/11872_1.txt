This is only a family drama if the parents misclassify everything with their message. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They feed a deer for a year and kill it because it consumes its food after killing its mother and first taking responsibility for taking responsibility for its actions. They accuse bears and deer of "misconduct" by eating while not assuming responsibility for using suitable locks and fences, or even learning to shoot, rather than maiming animals twice and letting them stay longer.
