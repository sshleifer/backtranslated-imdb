One of the worst romantic comedies (no, worst movies) I've ever seen. The boy (who works as a telephone operator!) Must pretend to be gay to move into a flat with his dream wife. Joy does not follow. Boredom, easy gays and terrible dialogues do it. If you read Brad Meltzer and like his fucking dialogue, you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid that. If you see it, destroy the copy.
