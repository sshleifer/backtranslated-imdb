In today's Eastern Europe, life is hard and for young women, prostitution is one of the few career opportunities that Melania reluctantly perceives. It attracts the attention of an American, Seymour, who becomes obsessed with her and pays more and more time for her to finally buy her. She has two pimps with different emotional attachments and she is generally passed around like a piece of baggage without her own feelings. However, we are in the field of "modern art house cinema". Conventions such as narrative structure, lighting the subject so you can see it, camera techniques that distract rather than distract the action, and a vague consistent presentation can all be abandoned. Most of the time, I had no idea what was going to happen, and very rarely did I care. People started almost before the arrival of the last stragglers, and I do not think I've ever seen so many people. <br /> <br /> Images are important to the director - Characters slowly appear or disappear In a dark screen we get long shots of nothing special and a sex scene takes place in the infrared. In fact, the sex scenes for such an unconventional movie were remarkably ordinary; There were too many missionary positions between naked people in bed and there were no drugs or related crazes. But maybe it's unconventional to be ordinary these days. <br /> <br /> On the whole, almost completely unfounded. <br /> <br />
