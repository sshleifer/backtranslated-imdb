Basically, we do not have much more than a remake of the hilarious kitsch horror 'Death Line' from the 70s, which ironically looked like that cobbler and was shot in part in the disused subway station Aldwych. <br /> <br /> Good Use This movie contains basically the same conspiracy - the now disused platforms of the Jubilee Line in Charing Cross and the already mentioned Aldwych. The dodgy murder of crazy zombies in the tunnels that triggers the lost passengers who missed the last train - the originality is not strong point. <br /> <br /> In fact, strong points are missing. The Gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily overcrowded smells, while the Sub Gollum Nutter is never fully explained, as it appears little more than an underdeveloped plotter. Franke Polente has little to do with a thin script as many tunnels run down and scream now and then, in fact she was like any other in this movie played by a small dog and a pack of tame rats. <br /> <br /> If scary films that were filmed in the London Underground are your bag, or you just want to find the location of the subway they pick up on DVD when they're on a bargain basket meets. If you're looking for classic horror, pick out a copy of Death Line (also known as Raw Meat). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a well-written and well-performed movie, you'll need to change trains ....
