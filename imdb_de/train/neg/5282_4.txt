I must confess that I am deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version can not compete with the 1995 version. The reason I saw them was that I was not entirely satisfied with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth, and I thought that Rupert Penry-Jones was similar to the captain I had imagined reading the book. And he was too. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only redeeming quality of the movie. The rest is as unaustenartig as possible. Miss Elliot would NEVER have walked this way through the streets of Bath. It was not in her character and it just was not done by a lady at the time. The Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms, but this was the worst. <br /> <br /> Although there are three important quotes from the book, they are in completely inappropriate moments and warn those who know the book as another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed. <br /> <br /> And although this version is not much shorter than the other, it feels like everything is rushed. Very little attention was paid to introducing the characters, showing their dispositions and motives. Important scenes have been omitted. How could they have slaughtered the last scenes in this way? A disaster! And it was not nearly as well photographed as the other one. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, do not waste time on it.
