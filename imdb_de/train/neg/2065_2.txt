Rented it last night. The opening (2001) was too long for WAAAAAAAAY. The hitchhiker scene had no purpose. Some skits were left behind. I knew before that Chevy Chase was switched on for less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BAB'S COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good material from a 75-minute movie Everything else was either unsteady or stupid as hell. <br /> <br /> Let me give some advice: If you want a rough movie that spoofs TV and movies, rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want a less crude movie spoofing TV and movies, rent "AMAZON WOMEN ON MOON" or "UHF". <br /> <br /> Otherwise you should not borrow this movie. You save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's Best Film Is Still "Modern Problems"
