I saw this movie years ago, and I was impressed ... but on the other hand, I was only 12 years old. I have reviewed it recently and would like to have this time back. This movie is pretty bad. While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (eg My Bodyguard (1980), if you want to see a good movie where he was in Meatballs (also with Bill Murray)), and Burgess Meredith does that role / has not done anything for her career. Anyway, Lee Major's character is Franklyn Hart, a former racing driver who plans to drive his racing car (which he had in stock) across the country California. One problem: The government has banned all private transport. I thought the concept was okay (not the worse I've heard of), but the execution failed terribly.
