Without a doubt, Gymkata is one of the worst movies ever made. But not the bad movies. This is so awful that it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas obviously has no lucrative career as an actor. He should go to gym again. But who can forget such memorable scenes as the high beam with chalk, the stone pommel horse or the five-minute chase scene through the Madman's Village in slow motion. I do not think it should be that bad, but who can say that. It's not art, but if you want something light and fluffy that allows for a good conversation, hire Gymakta. Makes for a fun evening.
