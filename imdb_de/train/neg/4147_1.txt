I'm an avid fan of horror movies, anything cheesy and ridiculous is my game. Imagine my mind, I went to the local Rent Shop and found Vampires Vs. Zombies. The name is just too entertaining, you know that no one in the world can do this, it just has to be bad. After seeing this horror movie, I was literally speechless. Me and my buddy sat outside for several minutes without saying a word, and we both thought about the future of our life after this movie. I suppressed the depressing silence with the words "... age ... what?" Yes, I am a captivating person. <br /> <br /> Here's a short 'Street Review' The Plot; In "WTF" mode there is never ever. The characters; No development, forget. The music; Worse than porn. The vampires; Your vampires? The zombies; Your zombies? <br /> <br /> In the end; Everyone should see this movie, frankly, it's so bad, I long to see him again. So do yourself a favor, look at it and get depressed.
