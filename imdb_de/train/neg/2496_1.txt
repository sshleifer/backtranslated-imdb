I would list this movie under the horror movie genre. I did this because I do not know a genre that is considered horrible. Since the genre horror comes closest to the terrible, I have decided to bring it into this category. The acting was amateurish. They know who the villains would be on the first scene. The heroine is as ugly as the movie. Students of filmmaking should take this film as an example of the lesson, which is not to do in a movie. It is so bad. Man the word bad is an understatement. The villains kidnap an ocean liner and want $ 10 million. They want the money to be delivered to an inhabited rose island in the middle of the Pacific. They would sit ducks after they got the money. Is there no escape plan? How stupid The female cruise director is a former police officer, marine seal, Kung Fu. I'm afraid. The funny part is the way the time bomb is defused. He says he knows what he's doing and is constantly pulling all the wires one at a time. He then puts it in his pocket and according to the movie with all connections. Is he crazy? As crazy we were, who saw this RIDICULOUS. If you have an M-i-L that you do not like. To annoy her, lend this movie and act as if you were enjoying it. I assure you that you will definitely tell your spouse that you have such a bad taste and that your son / daughter has married a person who is below their family standard.
