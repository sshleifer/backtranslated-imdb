There simply is no point in glorifying any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> It was down to trash. At the very beginning, you might think that you expect a visually stunning piece of cinematography ... and shortly afterwards you will be hit with a big sack (burlap) by FAIL! The fighting is hardly martial, the acting fluctuates on the edge of the par and the music is not worth describing. There is only enough history to make an excuse for this movie. The choices the characters make and how they handle the situations are weak and just frustrating. I think the only reason for this movie was to act as a fan service with Yumiko Shaku.
