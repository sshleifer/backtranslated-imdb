THE CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most directed, exaggerated, over everything I've ever seen in France. There is nothing worse than a French production trying to outperform Hollywood films. CR is a perfect example of such a wannabe horror / action / buddy movie. I almost stopped it halfway because I knew it would be nothing but French guys trying to show themselves. The movie starts promisingly like a kind of sprawling horror movie, but it's fast moving the genres from horror to action on X-Files-type to Buddy-Flick, that in the end CR is all and none of it. It's so full of stereotypes that at some point I thought the whole thing was a comedy. The painful dialogue and these quiet pauses, with fades and fades at just the right exposure moments, made me moan. I thought only films made in Hollywood used this choppy technique. <br /> <br /> The scene of Vincent Cassel chasing after the killer is so exaggerated and exaggerated that it's almost a beauty job. The climax on the mountain, with the stupid revelation about the killers, in which Cassel and Reno played "Buddies" like Nolte and Murphy for 48 hours, completely derailed the credibility that the film had until then. <br /> <It's hard to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS also directed GOTHIKA, which had some problems but did not come close to the fearlessness of this baked, confused film.
