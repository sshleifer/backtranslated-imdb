This show was ridiculously bad. The writing was bad, the dialogue was bad. The guy who played Craig could not work his way out of a paper bag. Since it was Thursday night, it was definitely great to see some beers. Cool music, bad acting, bad writing, everything came together for my entertainment. <br /> <br /> It was a drama / unwanted comedy. I do not care what happened to the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, as they could not see who the victim was, they had to write the dialogue about what was terrible. I mean, the laudation at the funeral was ridiculous. In fact, all the scenes that happened in the present were extremely terrible. <br /> <br /> Let's take a look. Everything that happens in this day and age is shitty. The flashback scenes, only writing, dialogue and Craig acting, were shit. The music ruled, however.
