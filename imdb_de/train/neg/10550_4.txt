After being a big fan of the ten-minute TV episodes of 'Stella Street', I waited with excitement and anticipation for this movie. Unfortunately, I felt very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was dismayed that almost all the gags and a liner were directly removed from the TV episodes and were delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing if the actors had said it once, and they themselves would not bother to say it again. I bought my copy on DVD and felt betrayed that I had parted from my hard earned money to see the same jokes again. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The plot of the film begins with Stella Street (a normal English street) in Surrey, which has been gradually populated by "some of the most famous figures of the last forty years", including Michael Caine , Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All celebrities on the street are eventually driven out of their entire fortune by a local cheater and forced to live like trampoline and ordinary workers. There are some nice moments, but by and large, the authors make an interesting idea and make them pretty boring. * END OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In the TV episodes, all the characters of John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women) are listed, but in the movie Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think this was a mistake. Her imitations were not funny and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do. <br /> <br /> If you were not a fan of the episodes of Stella Street, you might find this movie entertaining. But if you were a fan, I think you might feel cheated. 4.10
