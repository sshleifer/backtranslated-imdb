This movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie. The main character was decently done and I felt sorry for him and there was a decent backstory. BUT everything else is shit. Director Emmanuel is quite incompetent in filmmaking. He uses some of the most idiotic recordings ever. <br /> <br /> - a few random sequences of random images scattered throughout the movie. I do not know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic, but he was not. It was stupid. Random shots of the caravan the main character used to live in, random buildings, accidental panning of buildings, random cats walking away. WTF? And clouds. Many dark dark clouds. <br /> <br /> - He liked this technique of cutting a scene into different shots instead of just taking a continuous shot. EX: Guy tries to light his weeds and the camera circles around him. Instead of editing just one shot, it can be put into 10 different settings, so it's really EDGY! and HIP! and smart! stupid. <br /> <br /> The acting is awful, but that makes the movie so funny. And the scarecrow is a gymnast, because he turns and turns and turns constantly. And some of the deaths could have been better. They expect the main bully to have a long, well-built death, but no. A simple corncob in the ear. The love interest was hot. Lush That's why this movie gets a 2.
