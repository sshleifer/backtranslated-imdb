First of all, to get rid of my own personal feelings, I would like to say that I hate so-called comedies in which every single character is so stupid that he is so stupid that he gets hurt when they all get the result I'm going to say that I've seen the first three American pie films, and although they were not the most amazing movies I've ever seen, they were all right (and absolute masterpieces in the Comparing to the three "Americans"), I still feel compelled to ask what the hell they were thinking when they made this movie. <br /> <br /> I also have a few other questions. <br /> <br /> Who thought this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources? <br /> <br /> Who approved the final screenplay (and what did that person smoke when she approved it)? <br /> <br /> And finally, why did anyone think it was worth bringing to cinemas, where the average cost of recording is between $ 10 and $ 15, depending on where you live, when it's right in the rebate box should have gone Blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes in this movie that I can not write a full report on it, as it would exceed the maximum allowed words in this forum. The biggest things are wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is generously uninspired and stupid and the characters are all as interesting as the drying of paint for eighty minutes, but the biggest thing I can not see with this movie is The Acting. <br /> <br /> While most performers are talentless, there are no names that are likely to be forgotten in a few years. <br /> <br /> The only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy Who almost always watches the screen with this knowing grin and says to the viewer: "I know, that's not it. It's not funny and I'm wasting my talents, but I'm getting paid for it, so who cares "he does not even try to make one of his jokes funny (he really deserves more than that garbage). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, most of the other performers are awful, even though some of them were in some really great TV shows. Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays a character so unbearable, unlikely and irritating (there are things he could teach against tropical skin diseases) that you almost want him to be slow and painful Death on the screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just hangs around screen and wastes the talent he has in this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe the next movie in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story to help them get through and get one in the MPAA R-Rating This film deals with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointless offensive sexual content assumed that he should have received the X rating (the rating agency must have been drunk or drugged when watching this movie for his rating). <br /> <br /> It's interesting that Wes Craven submitted A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA 25 years ago for a rating review, forcing him to cut material for twenty-five seconds (I think it was part of one) Death scene with a silicon casting of a breast in it) to avoid an X-rating, and he had no choice but to do it, otherwise the film would not have been released, <br /> <br /> but this kind of unnecessary offensive trash today can get the rating R because everything is done in the name of the comedy. If this movie was a drama or horror movie with such content, it would have stunned the content, and the dreaded would have ended. X rating. <br /> <br /> The last thing that really annoys me is writing. This movie was written to be like the wet dream of a twelve-year-old with extremely overactive sexual fantasy. It's pretty youthful and extraordinarily blatant, just about every exhibition situation the corpse is supposed to move. This movie is a conspiracy that is kept away by an intelligent viewer so that he can only be seen a mile away from him and the like These characters are only stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes, not to mention the often repugnant sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior. It feels like this film was written by an incompetent first year in a scriptwriting class for film schools. <br /> <br /> The length and brevity of this is his time to kill this series, before it gets any stupid, crass and offensive, this cake is filled with street apples.
