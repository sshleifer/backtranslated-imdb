My 7-year-old daughter loved it because the people in charge of Disney had convulsively calculated that she would do it. That's the problem with "Air Buddies". It's a strictly childishly numerous children's movie filled with carefully calculated cuteness, politically correct morality and enough potty humor to avoid the dreaded G rating. As a parent or even as a ten-year-old, you've seen it all before and done better. Think of "101 Dalmatian Meets Home Alone" and get a general idea. I think a good kids story is a good story, period. Air Buddies, which are as original as recycled paper, do not meet this standard. It's not the worst video your kid could see, but there are mega tons of better ones.
