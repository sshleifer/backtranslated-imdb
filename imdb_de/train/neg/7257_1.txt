I was expecting a French B-movie musical. After all, Dhéry, Blanche and DeFunès were superstars of French low-budget films of the time. And it is in color! But I have hallucination in this incredible hour 30 of pure mediocrity. Musical numbers are horrible and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And the songs? Which songs? This is just a series of bad numbers, one after the other. The only very rare thing is the nudity of women. It was not known at the time. In fact, some numbers are only there to show us up without women. It contributes to mediocrity! And try, in a sense, to find the young Michel Serrault, the future great actor of French cinema, as a musician in his very first film. Good luck!
