Here is one of these educational short films made to inform unknown people about the facts of life. This time the target group is preteen girls, the fact of life is menstruation. This animated film was created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with sponsorship from Kotex. <br /> <br /> It starts by explaining how hormones grow and develop. With the help of an animation and a female narrator, it shows how the body, in particular the ovaries, the uterus and the vagina, works and why this leads to menstruation. It's almost amazing to become a comic about how to avoid sex. Even the word is never mentioned, though "Furtilized" will pass once. I'm not sure why I saw that, but since it's one of those rare short films that might give you an idea of ​​an innocent time, maybe you should try it.
