No, I'm just kidding. It was awful god. <br /> <br /> Last night I watched my local sci-fi station, which plays movies every night on a monthly theme. This month's title is "Space Turkeys" or "How I Learned To Love The Bombs." Films so bad that they should never be made. This was a good selection. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is terrible through and through, with two exceptions, the make-up make-up (which showed potential) and the cut (which left the rest of the movie to be in terrible) , Acting is terrible everywhere, the dialogue is terrible, the script, the direction. It is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It consists of two forms of special effects: Gore and Stock footage of space. I will focus on the Gore. When I saw this movie, I thought, "What was the motivation behind this movie?" People like to do things, sure, but I was reluctant to believe that something good would have turned out for everyone involved. I came to the conclusion that this movie was made to enhance the demo reel of the make-up effects series. He (Rick Baker) has a pretty good career behind him, working on STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), MEN IN BLACK (1996), and even THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN (1981) with other notable flicks. Besides, I can not say that I've ever SEEN a real, living-melting man - unbelievable or otherwise - but I have to say that this was an adequate representation of a man. <br /> <br Well, when I think of bad editing, I usually think of a scene where someone is talking on the phone and then in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps to the shoulder or something in that direction. This movie serves to highlight the fact that bad editing can take many forms. In particular, overlong and completely useless scenes. Almost every scene dragged on longer than it should, from some dead air to this crazy scene with Cleaver Girl. And this severed head in the river, the head is thrown into a river (in slow motion), the movie continues for a few minutes, and then we cut back to the floating head and watch him fall down a waterfall. I'm sure they were all very proud of their severed head. Finally, I would like to mention the running fat lady / slow motion scene right at the beginning. The jerky slow motion tells me that they did not shoot the scene in slow motion, but later decided that it "does not work that way" and then slows it down. Oy vey. If you ever saw another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hallway and then directly through a closed glass door - all in slow motion - remember - remember THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, because * that * is Where everything began. <br /> <br /> Films like these are best viewed at home with a number of friends. This is a bit slow most of the time, but there's just more time left to find your own one-liners. It's not the worst of the worst, but it's pretty damn bad.
