I have to admit that director Eduardo Sanchez, who was the director of the popular and successful Blair Witch Project, is the draw for this film. Besides, this is a kind of alien movie, and it sounded like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of the films the critics hated, but I enjoyed it. Changing is a waste of time, so I keep this review short. The conditions are always promising and Altered is no different. It tells the story of a group of men who have had strange encounters in recent years, and as usual, others will take you for a sober idea. Stories about alien abductions always have to deal with probes in the openings, so I will not go into detail, but you get the drift, it's damn uncomfortable, and something you'd like to forget. <br /> <br /> What if you have a chance for revenge? That means you can hunt successfully and capture one alive. What will you do? It's a fun payback period for this group, they thought. And here the film develops into a snoozefest with bad, uninspirational dialogues and even worse actors. Even if the budget is low, there are not many redeeming factors, be it the strength of the plot or any help from the cast, just to make their characters a little interesting. It's the standard cardboard box from a simple vanilla font, paired with a few cheap scare tactics. <br /> <br /> What's good is the make-up. Great efforts have been made to create some things that I will not mention because it only destroys the few elements that make this movie bearable. Apart from that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and blood stains you've never seen before. <br /> <br /> See this only as a last resort. Compared to the city's other monster movie - Feast, this one is less fun and takes itself too seriously. They were depressed by an uninspired direction and you were warned.
