A typical Lanza strip with a limited audience experience with a weak story that was simply put together at this time to justify the MGM contract of Lanza. <br /> <br /> As reported by member Lastliberal (above), Grayson Lanza could not stand off from his obscene rapprochement with her (and sometimes in front of the camera). In addition, his gutter mannerisms and the constant smell of alcohol in her face were unbearable during the scenes that made them together. After making their second (and final) movie "Toast of New Orleans" together, the normally quiet Grayson stormed into Louie B. Mayer's office and told him in indefinite terms that she would never work with Lanza again. Period. Mayer thought Grayson was much more valuable to MGM than Lanza, so Grayson's statement stuck. Grayson starred in a series of much-acclaimed (and far more profitable) musicals with Howard Keel and others. Later, when she was asked to compare Lanza and Keel, she replied that there was no comparison between them and that Keel was great at working with them and the "real people" in the audience were much more appealing.
