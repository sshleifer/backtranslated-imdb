I've never commented IMDb before, but I feel I have to after watching the Batman animation. His absolute garbage! Warner Brothers had the perfect animated series in Batman in the early '90s, so what the hell are they trying to do with the formula for success? I would like to write a letter of complaint to WB. The original animation was dark and somber, just as Batman intended. WB had to screw up with the Batman Trip of the Future. Now they produce this jerk. The Joker does not remotely resemble the joker of DC Comics. DC should complain. I urge anyone who agrees with me to write an e-mail or letter to WB and use the power of the people to get the original formula back
