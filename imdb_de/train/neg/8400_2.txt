Not even the most passionate fan of the henchmen might like the movie (I'm one of them), the Stooges just have no material to work with. It's really a shame, too, because this is the only movie the Stooges have done with Curly, and that effort is painfully unrecoverable if it could have great potential. Terrible music numbers do not help anyone. The short film with the same title has more laughs.
