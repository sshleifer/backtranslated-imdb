Not only is Brad Sykes having fun, he's responsible for at least two of the most boring and cliched movies I've ever seen - this one is one of them, and Camp Blood is different. <br /> <br /> The acting is awful, the imprint is modest and everything about this movie screams "seriously, you could do it better yourself". Maybe this is a challenge for everyone to saturate Youtube with our own zombie sack? <br /> <br /> I bought it for Â£ 1, but remember that you can not have 71 minutes of your life for a price. They would do well to avoid this turkey, even at a reasonable price.
