I was excited to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to make a movie in Cebuano language. (Not "dialect" as most Filipinos will falsely refer to it, since Cebuano and Tagalog are as incomprehensible as French and Spanish are each other.) But I was very disappointed to see this movie. As a Canadian from Cebuano parents, I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film. I kept being excited to hear it was not another stupid action movie or melodrama, as Filipinos love this kind of movie. But unfortunately I had little money. <br /> <br /> Panaghoy serves as an ego trip for Cesar Montano. Of course Montano plays the hero of the movie. And when I say "hero," I mean in the most stereotypical way; His job is to win the heart of a girl and lead the Bolans to victory against the Japanese. His character has neither depth nor complexity. He just fits in the hero form. The rest of the characters is one-dimensional; They all fit in their cookie cutter roles. <br /> <br /> I'm all for slow / meditative films, but this movie was slow. It did not really think about something. Just because a movie is a historical topic, a drama and a slow movie does not make a well-made movie. <br /> <br /> Particularly annoying is the American actor Philip Anthony. His performance was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry, he should have thought it through. He said he wanted to make Visayan films that could compete in Cannes and Toronto etc., but in fact this film would have been booed and hissed on such festivals. In order to bring Visayan films into mainstream consciousness, he would at least have had to make a film that would attract the audience, even if it meant sacrificing quality. Obviously, he has not thought about it or received any information about what kind of films were awarded in Cannes, so that a viewer-friendly movie would have been at least a foot in the door. <br /> <br /> I'm worried about this now Visayan movies are not being shot for much longer due to this movie. If I had ever said to a Filipino that I would of course like to see more Visayan movies, I would get an answer like, "Visayans do not make good movies, have not you seen Panaghoy Sa Suba?" Of course, this is ridiculous, since it is an example of a visual film and probably the only example that would probably be seen by anyone today. <br /> <br /> An example of films that are meditative and not just slow running the Tagalog movie Blackout or David Lynch's The Straight Story. I hate promoting the Tagalog language as it is endlessly and unjustly promoted and depressed by non-Tagalog Filipinos, but to call a spade spade, I say blackout is a very good movie. These films are heavily dependent on what Hitchcock called "pure cinema". Images without words are used to convey the story. But I think the definition for these two films is a bit in the sense that these films use images without words to convey the mood of the film. and they are doing very well. Panaghoy believes that if they just record the landscape with their landscape images, they have set the mood. <br /> <br /> And what about so many Filipino films showing a dying mother or grandmother?
