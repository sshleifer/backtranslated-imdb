This movie is ridiculous. Anyone who calls acting great and the casting is superb has never seen even mediocre cinema. Acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you meet. Lame. I think that all other "rising" comments have to be made by people who are related to the filmmakers. I was not very impressed with the plot, but just wanted to see the beautiful Oregon countryside, and there were some decent cinematographs - but the casting was anything but an inspiration. I think this movie also mocks the generally noble suggestion that something deep in America's culture has been ignored and perhaps lost, and that a revival is worthwhile and possible. It puts jokes in the wrong and all too obvious places and makes me think that it was written by the State Department or something. Back to the drawing board. To even claim that this film deserves a place close to classics like Harold and Maude, he is left behind, as well as begging and presumption and "joking" as in this movie.
