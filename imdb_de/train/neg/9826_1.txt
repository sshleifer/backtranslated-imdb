I think this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized Christian dogma, but for anyone who believes in free will, rational thinking, the separation of Church & State and GOOD science fiction, that's a terrible joke! br /> <br /> There are some well-known actors who either urgently need work or have to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us pagans. <br /> <br /> I was entertained by film the same way I was entertained by "Reefer Madness". In this film, attempts have been made to teach drug lessons through horror tactics, as this film tries to teach "Christian" principles with the threat of hell and misery to the otherwise good people who do not share their interpretations of our world /> I had to Laughing and at the same time scared to realize how many people really believe that our society should return to the good old times of the 19th century!
