I only rented it because I loved the first movie. It's called John Carpenter's Vampires: Los Muertos is just a trick to get you to rent it. He is indeed executive producer and obviously had nothing to do with the making of this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?). A tragic plot, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing vampire Hunter all the time It's not even weirdly bad. <br /> <br /> What ends up being a boring, unpretentious movie with a terrible script and incorruptible bad and clich√©d drama. It only smells like a low budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague of the plague.
