This story had a different perspective that fascinated me, enough to buy a previously seen, invisible VHS. That was a mistake. <br /> <br /> In a potentially very beautiful story - of seriously ill people in a hospital and their various personalities - she quickly became a very profane soap opera with unusual characters /> <br /> We have "Bloss" ( William Forsythe), the stereotypical racist whites who say the F-word every other sentence and are so disgusting that he did not give him a first name in the film. It's a lot of fun to be around. Then there is "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a fast talking womanizer. Snipes must have liked these fast-talking "hip" arrogant roles because he played in a number of them, as in "White Men Can not Jump." Then there's the cute Helen Hunt, who plays "Anna", this wonderful, loving person who has an affair with the main character of the movie, "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). Yup, this is heartwarming and feels good. It melts my heart when I watch these nice people. But if you are one of those who love sleazy characters portrayed by sleazy people in this sleazy movie, then you might really like that! Add a dose of political correctness to Hollywood and off you go! What more do you want?
