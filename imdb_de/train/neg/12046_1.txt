I had high hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed. The film was so badly directed that he had a stomach ache. The pace was so slow, the dialogue ridiculous and the film - apart from a nice fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was flat. <br /> <br /> And why, oh why Hollywood always insists on rewriting the stories so that they are accepted by consumers. Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted ten years, and Achilles was killed with an arrow to his ankle from Paris outside the walls of Troy! It annoys me that such a classic story like this is turned into a soap. <br /> <br /> And do not even begin to think that there is a lack of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman the war was waged against, and it did not even look like they cared much for the others. No sparks, no emotions, no hope. <br /> <br /> I have to say that in film defense, Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole have done a terrific job on this awful film with a bad script. <br /> <br /> Can someone tell me where the budget of 200 million pounds was? Maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral - where did they get all those trees from? <br /> <br /> I am so disappointed that it hurts.
