This movie is LAME, LAME, LAME !!!!! It takes a lot of exaggeration to overdo a movie, but this movie stunk my house !! I did not even finish the movie and had to stop commenting on how bad this movie is. I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT!! As a consumer, do not spend money on this film. Wait until it comes out of a cable duct or something. It is hardly worth the TV. I really hate to disassemble a movie, but this movie is garbage! Hardly over the porn. Should and have X rating! Good action, some frontal nudity (if that floats your boat), but HORRIBLE drama at high school level. I do not know how this movie was distributed. (It must have been a contractual matter.) If you really want to watch good movies, you should not waste time with this movie. From one movie lover to another. You will turn to yourself! Let me also say that once you have gone through something like that, you may be able to tell something and it will be of value to you. In this case, I say, look at it, you may take away some of it, if you not only see something that has happened to you when played by someone else (has therapeutic value).
