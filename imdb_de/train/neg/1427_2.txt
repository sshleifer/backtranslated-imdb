The British Claymation series, in which "funny" conversations were recorded by "average" people in the mouth of "cute" imaginative creatures, had the advantage, at least for non-British viewers, that they were seemingly droll and kind of cultivated humor, you could not understand US TV. Someone had made the mistake of introducing him to US television. <br /> <br /> Something like the sad American version of the great Brit-com COUPLING that died on NBC in a month when the same basic scripts did not. "Translate" from English into American English, which seemed droll and cultured in England (and just a boring BIT), occurs in CREATURE COMFORTS, the American version, as boredom with puppets. There is no continuous line, no characters and after one and a half episodes (out of the last three broadcast), there was no reason to suffer. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is the new The summer series and the compassionate short walkthrough was that the Claymation was performed at least professionally and as a setup for the worst show of the CBS program The New Adventures of Old Christine (or How to Become a HORRIBLE Mother) - or person - in an endless, fun lesson "), children who wanted to stay happy after sleeping happily went to bed instead of watching this show, and the adults were able to Wait until 9:00 pm as "Two and A Half Men" (guilty pleasure) and "How I Met Your Mother" (actual quality letter) come up.
