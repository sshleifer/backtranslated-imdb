This thrown-together piece of fecal substance combines so many ridiculous scenarios that it ends up as a laugh of total joy. Too bad, since the premise is promising (as so often in Duhllywood), but in the hands of this scriptwriter is in la la country. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in prison serving a DUI who killed his mistress. We see him having nightmares just so we know he feels really bad. Then his neighbor hangs out of the cell. Or does he? Lowe has some suspicions, but drops them quickly. His suspicions are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to fear. Why then use it to get killed? Ah, this story could be interesting. There it falls off the tracks, and once it's out of the tracks, it decides that it can hurt the audience's attention for the next deafening hour. <br /> <br /> ************ ******* *********************************** * <br /> <br /> I will not be bored with an endless recount of the irrationality of what follows, but consider this end. Lowe was imprisoned by the bad guys in one go. They want a band he has because this band will crush their boss and them. Then 3 policemen with drawn weapons come on the train, ready to rescue Lowe. The bad guys kill the cops, in front of half of the passengers and then .... Lowe continues to hunt for the band. HELLO!!!! Killing 3 police officers in public brings you into a deep Doodo, to hell with the band. Nevertheless, they go through a mall and shoot up the square as if the audience were not witnesses, and in the end Lowe is packed and the villain still wants the tape !!!
