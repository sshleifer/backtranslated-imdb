Lipstick is another shiny movie loser. I'm trying to think of a good thing I could say about the movie, and I'm having trouble finding something. I think the red dress that Margaux Hemingway wore at the end of the movie was the best part. The writing and the script were not the worst I've ever seen, but it could have been a lot better. The lipstick was very appealing to the eye. The sets were very shiny and nice to look at. The cast was fine. I had the feeling that Anne Bancroft's character was the only feasible character in the entire film. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon wasting his time with this film.
