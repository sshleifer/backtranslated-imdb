I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is there) and I have to say that I was not satisfied. <br /> <br /> Of course, the computer graphics were amazing, but the story needed a little refresher. I also think that this movie with more curses and blood would have been much better, even if it had been rated PG-13. <br /> <br /> That would definitely attract more people to see it -> teens. What would attract even more teenagers (especially teenage girls) would be a close-up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Even though the film had its drawbacks, I still saw it and thought it was okay!
