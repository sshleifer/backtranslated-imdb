My, how the powerful fell. Kim Basinger is a great actress, but when she took that role, she was definitely in the slums. This film is bad for one reason above all: gaps in logic. It looks like one of those films that would have been accessible with all its action holes if it had come out in the '80s and' 90s, but in 2008 it just looks really stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen, and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> The details that Della (Kim Basinger) is getting from shopping for gifts at a mall are being harassed by a band of thugs who ended up killing a police officer who came to her aid. From then on, these idiotic idiots chase her through a deserted street and start her off with a toolbox full of tools. <br /> <br /> With this movie, many things are wrong. As I said, this movie jumps on logic every turn and with the exception of Kim Basinger, acting is bad for television. This pseudo-thriller is bad for television. The way she kills each of these politically correct thugs (1 Caucasian, 1 Spanish, 1 Asian and 1 African-American), who all come together to persecute a Caucasian woman. Do not you just love America? The way she killed the Spaniard made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main drink was so far out in the left field that you have to shake your head. I only recommend this to lovers of bad movies and nobody else. Everyone else, especially Kim Basinger fans, would do well not to own this movie. You do not want to see an actress who respects you in such a bad movie, right? Of course not. You were warned.
