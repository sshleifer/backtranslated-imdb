We are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor. We can confess the truth of what we see, without being stupid, confessing that in many aspects this show is simply incomprehensible and that it is clear that much of it was created out of pure intuition without any real concept Of course, many people like things like that. Not me. I prefer well thought out and planned shows. And I also admit that the show is way too serious and boring for my liking ... those love and drug stories ... There are so many exciting soapy souls (eg Dallas), but Twin Peaks can not catch my attention. I'm not interested in these people, except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
