My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention a shared office. When it became known that he was BTK, she was shocked. All day she told how she had never seen him as a Wichita killer. I heard that she told her several times. I asked her about many things and went to all the interviews she was asked to do. I read the entire book about Raider, Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that something like this could happen in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Not too long ago, there was another BTK movie on TV, and I thought this would have been better to portray Dennis's murders, maybe even some smart motives. <br /> <br /> I'll be very dull with the flaws in this movie. This is based on my mother's account of him, all my readings about him and the videotapes I've seen of him. <br /> <br /> At first, the camera angles were awful. It looked as if it had been taken with a home video camera. The acting was terrible and I could not bear to see it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a "very anal man" and was a guy like "follow the rules". He was not as nice as the movie made him look, he was very polite and abrupt, on business. The same goes for his murders, as far as we all know. If you have seen his confession in court, you can already guess. <br /> <br /> And as for the obsession with the slaughterhouse? No, I have never read or confessed that Dennis Raider had a problem with animal cruelty or humans exterminating insects. In fact, he practiced cats and dogs for gagging methods. Throughout the film, however, he has placed animals on the victims' faces and pretended to care for their well-being. Dennis Raider never killed the people he knew, he confessed. But in the movie he tells the woman he knows. <br /> <br /> I do not want to get into this movie, and I'm scolding. This is NOT what you want to see if you are interested in the actual events of BTK. This is NOT what you want to see if you want a good horror movie. If you want a poorly shot half porn with some battle scenes on the side, then this is your kind of movie.
