Okay, Chuck Norris has somehow found a way to produce this sequel. I have a question - why? Who read this script and said, "Sound is great! Original!" This movie is scrawny crap that would not cloud my toilet gut. Of course, it's another story that follows the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force, and so forth, where Chuck Norris, of course, is the one man who can distinguish America from some bad guys. He usually does not even need a weapon. It's stupid, patriotic jargon that baffles the mind. Big surprise that the only one who will direct these Norris films is Chuck's son Eric. Eric Norris has worked mainly on all his father's movies and television programs. Is not that a sign that he has no directing talent? After all, in the same stories as before, he leads the same people as before ... the only difference is the names of the characters. If that makes me patriotic and cheering for the US, then our country is in much worse shape than I ever imagined. Hopefully this is the nail in Chuck Norris' theatrical coffin.
