or: It is a bird? It is an airplane? No, look ... It's a disaster! or: No need to look at the sky. <br /> <br /> or: (... OK, that's enough.) If the singer tried to make a romantic titanic movie that crashes the box office, he failed. The SR structure can not do that, the dark and limited color scheme (I would call it "wishi-washi"), the boring usual dialogues, the clown with advanced alien technology, the lack of fun and magic, etc. make the movie complete disappointing. <br /> <br /> It just does not work. <br /> <br /> The main thing about a character like Superman is that he is a superhero. That's the core, the most important thing. <br /> <br /> Love problems and a sadly lost depressive supersoftie can only be one facet in a 2:40 long Superman movie, not all the time. <br /> <br /> Because then it is no longer a superhero or superhero movie. It's like a (and in this case a very bad and boring) social study where a person flies around every 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> That's a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Holy Skywalker, this is Superman, so give us Supervillains, Superaction and most important, Superfun. <br /> <br /> We want ENTERTAINMENT! Singer, if you want to make a 2:40 long love drama about lost and sad people? Then take normal human characters and make a yentl remake. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman returns. And then Supersadlysoftie is in the door. Maybe singer has tried to kill the legend without kryptonite, but a bad movie can not do that. Do not give up, they're planning a sequel ... <br /> <br /> Next time Singer (and Warner Brothers), make a superhero movie, not a depressive superlame soap, or let it be. A superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with lots of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a great cover. Yes, technically there are all sorts of ways, yes, there are a lot of little conversations, there are a few jokes, action scenes etc., but the only thing that all these worse pieces have in common is their poor quality. <It's nothing more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The ridiculous cast strategy (cast her as young as possible, so we can do sequels over the next 25 years) will do the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old star reporter. She looks 19 years old. Superman was full five years ago, and he slept with her 6 years ago, so she was 16 years old (looks like 13) and a daily planetary reporter wrote, "I'll spend a night with Superman." Warner Brothers, that's too much. <br /> <br /> Routh is not so bad, he plays a bit of wood, but the whole movie is made of wood, so ...?! Temporary estate was marshes and sometimes posed. The rest forgets it. Also spacey, that's not his terrain. Reeve / Hackman / Kidder were so easy and fun. What a difference. <br /> <br /> The Jesus poses in the end are also ridiculous. What the hell is that supposed to be? The problem here is that you are serious, not as a joke. Next time Spiderman or Batman or Ironman fall and rise like Jesus or angels? Or they speak directly with God. Why not ? They are superheroes who save lives every day. So at least once a week a conversation with God should be possible ... Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Maybe this was not the movie that was really announced, but it came from a bizarre, boring parallel universe. <br /> <br /> For the Warner brothers, this overlong depressive stripe may be the biggest disaster in history. Not only because of the money. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult it was (maybe) to create and transport messages or feelings, but showing lonely, lost and sad people is not new and thousands of movies or TV shows are better off made in very old or new like magnolias. And the flying frogs were more impressive than this flying superwoman, sorry, of course the superman. <br /> <br /> Singer and WB, that's just nothing. In fact, it's more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for (comic / superhero) movies and steals us three hours of our lives. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Smilla's little brother (Very angry and green like the trunk.)
