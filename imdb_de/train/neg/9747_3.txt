Ok first, this movie is shit. But let's examine why. The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, then transporting and reassembling it, is at least fascinating. But that's what they assume. Instead of investigating what could happen when someone makes that kind of machine, they break that damned thing. That could have been a good condition. Living with the responsibility of this power and dealing with the constant temptation, ie the invisible man. But no .. they break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. Then the doctor brings the thing together and tries to transport itself. Just to mess it up with his beautiful but dumb secretary (duh). What would not have happened if Lembach had not decided to leave. Now he roams the land and kills people because his little experiment failed and they would not give him any money. Wah To make the movie even worse, you should have a dry British relationship between the two semi-competent professors who hire him. Between their loving sessions, they make some half-hearted attempts to find him while killing half of London. All this could have been prevented by not damaging the damn machine. This would never have happened if Lembach had not left. This movie tried, so I give honest 2 stars for trouble, but it would have been better if they had not broken the damn machine, Lembach would have to let go and have to try him again. Damn you Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
