I love zombie movies and I love amateur productions. And Meat Market 2 really starts promising with a nice tribute to Fulci's classic "Zombi". <br /> <br /> So I sat back and waited to be impressed. Okay, some make-ups are great for such a budget-less movie and some actors (the vampire lady and the cook) are really eye-catching, but otherwise there's nothing. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a new Romero movie here, but throughout the movie there is no sequence that even has a bit of tension or shock. The director knows exactly how to stage rippings and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it's time to learn a little more, not enough - excuse me. <br /> <br /> ** from *****
