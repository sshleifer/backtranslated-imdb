Style but no substance. Not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as it wants to be. <br /> <br /> This is another film that deals with the difficulties of filmmaking. A young filmmaker is hired to complete a '60s science fiction movie called Codename: Dragonfly. Think of Barbarella or Danger Diabolique. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davies is a scared filmmaker. He is not a hack, he is an artist. The movie he wants to do is a diary of his life. Hardly original. <br /> <br /> All characters outside of Jeremy Davies filmmaker are as thin as rice paper. Characters who might be interesting, like his father, his doppelganger, or Jason Schwarzmann as a director, are introduced and then shown the door without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of eye candy, but when compared to other films about filmmakers like Stardust Memories or 8 1/2 it fades in comparison. These films are funny and provoke with well-developed characters. These films have lessons that apply outside. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be comic and campy, but it's just a derivative and there is no funny scene. The filmmakers describe it as a send-up, but what is the satirical goal? The actors say it's a tribute, but I think I'd rather get a full version of the code name: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is clearly amused by the setting, as the visual humor of science-fiction film shows within a movie. But he does not tell us why we should have fun. Outside the science fiction movie, it's just a mess. There is continuity error, the filmmaker chooses a sci-fi weapon after it has already been selected. What? <br /> <br /> Just because he has a scene where the filmmaker is confronted by the critics who complain about the lack of story, the lack of a point, a scene in which he admits empty wisdom not that he has addressed this criticism. <br /> <br /> I think if you can make a movie with your novel Coppola about a fearful, idealistic filmmaker who does not know what he wants to say and therefore does not say anything. In that sense, it can be considered autobiogical. <br /> <br /> I would see it in Circuit City on a wall of TV if I had the choice. Take a look at the 15-minute codename: Dragonfly Movies on the DVD as extras and send it back.
