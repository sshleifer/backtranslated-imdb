There is not much good to say about Underneath, Soderbergh's untrustworthy pursuit in Neo-Noir. Soderbergh remembers Robert Siodmak's decent Noir Criss-Cross, though he did not change the plot too much, but the adaptation pulls him out of every ounce of his state-of-the-art film noir atmosphere and gives him the same History unappealing places, lifestyles and anachronisms. Soderbergh, who would later turn wonderful thrillers like Out of Sight and the Ocean Series into a great style and atmosphere, takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story in the ugliest, dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s. In nightclubs, there are horrible, disgustingly dressed garage bands. Peter Gallagher's uninteresting version of Burt Lancaster's anti-hero is left behind by his girlfriend, "Femme Fatale," who has forcibly bought lifeless modern, state-of-the-art equipment such as stereos, televisions, and other modern gadgets that are detrimental to the film's response. <br /> <br /> It could have been more entertaining and less boring if it had some saving graces like a good score, more flesh for the characters, more than just William Fichtner, who offered performances that are not. t wood, a crisper pace. Unfortunately, Underneath has none of this. Soderbergh, a good director, does not use his dry department this time for his film. This disposition works wonderfully when he shoots a thriller with more tongue in cheek like the aforementioned George Clooney pictures or a social or character drama like traffic or sex, lies and videotape. With a movie like Underneath the boredom of the viewer is intensified.
