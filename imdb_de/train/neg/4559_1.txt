I am surprised that everyone involved in the production of this series actually takes responsibility. The script is so obscure that it was written by someone who did not pass the Canadian Comedy Writers' Union entrance exam (and that says something!). Bring your binoculars out if you want, but there's nothing like a joke. Ronnie Corbett must have been broke to humble himself with this garbage. The rest of the cast is lacking in drama or comedy skills. I am amazed that the first episode went beyond the first episode - the correction, the auditions. I can only say to those who enjoy it that they need to be entertained very easily. It is obvious that the production costs had to be all 100 per episode. And in the event that someone thinks I'm commenting as a foreigner unfamiliar with English humor, I have to add that I'm actually English.
