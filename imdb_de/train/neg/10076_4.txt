The weak link between this film and the first grease is made right at the beginning of the film, when Didi Conn, one of four actors who repeat their roles, approaches the young Maxwell Caulfield, a British exchange student. Although in the previous film Olivia Newton does not explain St John's foreign speech patterns, it states that Caulfield is her cousin. What Conn still does at school, I think she just likes hanging out in Rydell High, even though she's a beautician now is a nerd. And that's especially bad when Zmed's girlfriend decides she likes Caulfield. But being a nerd will simply not cut it off. <br /> <br /> Then Caulfield decides to launch a modern Zorro act. He picks up a junk bike, puts it back together and teaches himself how to drive. He gets a leather biker outfit with glasses to hide his face. If it's not about winning Michelle Pheiffer, Caulfield will have no trouble partnering with a gay male leather bar the successful career paths have both enjoyed. If you've seen the first Grease movie, a much better movie, you definitely have an idea of ​​how this film will evolve. In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman faculty members from the original fat come back in their roles. The music is not as good as the songs that come from the original. <br /> <br /> It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's just not great.
