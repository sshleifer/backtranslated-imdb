Horror fools (I'm talking to over-12s, but if you're under 12, I apologize for what you think might be an insult): In short, if you've disturbed your imagination with well-written, original storytelling, that interrupted by the unpredictable is well planted fear and delivered by convincing performances, then I can highly recommend - AVOID THAT DAMPER - made by directors who apparently have long since stopped selling. It's no coincidence that almost every episode feels like it originated in the 1980s. So as not to blame the shoulders of some of those old guys (or even the eighties), because where would we be without certain movies from Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (actually Clive, WTF) I'm glad to see that Romero had the good sense to miss it because I'm sure he was asked ...). Maybe we should point the finger at the creator Mick Garris, whose credentials include logic, the braving and depressingly poor TV remake of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece The Shining. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's an indication of the state of television today. Are we so starved of good TV horror that we applaud some old sloppy blow that the networks are dropping out on our devices? Unfortunately, maybe so. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would not be able to add a comment that would not question the bugs and merits of a production, I would only rate it accordingly. However, since this series is in no way valuable (with the sole exception of the topic), I write this as a warning rather than a review: do not waste your time and money. If you disagree with me, it is very likely that you have not seen enough decent horror. Perhaps some of these directors' earlier films would have been a much better starter, but if these "masters" of Horror were judged solely on the basis of these works, they would never have been able to get their bachelor's degrees. Unless, of course, they were studying at the University Of S ** t.
