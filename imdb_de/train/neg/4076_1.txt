This theme deserves a much better screenplay and final score than this movie. The script is full of holes because it was never designed as a story, but as a series of nightmare scenarios loosely connected. The gaps and loose ends in the plot are numerous. The scene in which the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead and have been looking for her since taking her is just bizarre. It is a cathartic therapeutic moment when the head of the shelter gives her a "missing poster" from the age of eight. If it turned out in the real world that the head of an emergency shelter for outliers found out he had a kidnapped abduction under his roof, this would have been an immediate call to the police. It's a prosecution that is not a 12-minute section for Oprah. Everything that follows from there to the end is so short that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were exploited purely without exception. Funny, that's what this film is supposed to do. In the end, it seems to have gone along.
