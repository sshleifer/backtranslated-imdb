The best thing about Camp movies in general is that you know what to expect. It's like a professional wrestling match, a soap opera a day, or a Jerry Springer show: you can immediately follow the tight plot, identify the cardboard figures, and be satisfied while all the clich√©s are fulfilled. Sometimes the director does something unexpected. It can be something extraordinarily stupid or something unusual or something insightful. Director Makinen is up there with the best camp directors, and this is his best movie. In Yon saalistajat everything seems to come together. There is nothing good about it, but it still manages to be a coherent whole. The movie does not even slow down - the action continues and shots continue. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that there is no sense of time: some characters seem to need months while other characters just have to do something spent in an hour's bar. This is partly due to the Finnish summer Where the sun never sets, so you do not experience the day turning into a night. <br /> <br /> Finally: There is a plot somewhere. However, you may need to watch the movie three times before you notice it.
