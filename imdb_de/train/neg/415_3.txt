Leave it to Paul "Sex on the Brain" Verhoeven to develop a meaningless and youthful version of the INVISIBLE MAN story. If he were to stage a Pokemon movie, I'm sure he would make it a sort of orgy. I do not mind having sex or filming myself (even in my other reviews), but frankly, the director has a one-way mind and could not see any interesting aspects of an invisible man's story as the confused implications that come with it , It's a shame, because it could have been good if the movie had not spent so much time with an invisible wife of Kevin Bacon. <br /> <br /> The Cast of Actors does what it can with the monotonous script, but for some of them I felt bad, including William Devane, who is totally wasted here. <br /> <br /> But what could I have expected from the director of SHOWGIRLS, who is way more entertaining than this stilted and bad movie?
