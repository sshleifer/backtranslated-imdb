<br /> <br /> I saw this on the sci-fi channel. It came right after the first. For some reason, this movie has interested me. I do not know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Okay ... It was cheesy, as this guy had to do with the making of the movie. In the first film, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in this Sequal, half of the killings / attempted killings were basically baseless. Stanley killed the director because of creative differences, he conquered the co-writer due to creative differences. No cast, no movie. He wanted it to look "real when they died"? If this is a movie with such a high budget, use the special effects of MAN. Of course, the trapped girl comes off like the first, and Stanley gets confused and disappears. Woooooow (sarcasm). This movie had potential. And the saddest of all ... the really sad part ... I would see a "Cabin by the Lake 3". Just because I like Judd Nelson and he is the only good thing about this Sequal.
