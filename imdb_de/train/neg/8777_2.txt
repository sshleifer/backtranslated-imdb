Okay, I had trouble ignoring the fact that the movie basically lied from the beginning when I sold EVP as real. I thought of this hell, I do not believe in vampires, but I still liked Dracula for me to live with. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie is just not good. It has been made and acted competently, but does not really catch you. There are several "leap" moments, and I just looked at them and thought, "Yeah, I did not expect that", without even jumping in the least. If the power behind it is able to do the things it seems to be, why must there be a substitute? Besides, the final signature was absurd. It's obviously as part of the "Give credibility to the movie by saying it's all real," but for this to work, it really needs to be in the beginning. But they can not put it to the front, because then they give the action away ... If you put them in the end, it will stick out like a thumb.
