I can not believe that Steven Segal's career is so low that he can only make fourth place movies with 5th grade actors. I watched as the move anticipated that he would fill the crap of some people as usual. If he confines himself to using a single judo stroke between the shoulder blades to knock out an opponent, and the guy falls like a ton of bricks, something is wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is unbelievable as a movie, and even if you excuse the visuals and read this story as a novel, you'll wonder why you've ever taken the book in hand. Steven Segal goes through the moves and seems as if he is only doing so because he is committed. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he does not show up at all. <br /> <br /> I hate to repeat other people's comments, but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals the planes in flight are pathetic. The condition of these scenes is shaky and the scenes themselves seem to have worsened over time. The Zappruder movie showing how President John F. Kennedy is murdered is calmer and cleaner. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion is to tell you that you should not waste your time watching this movie the shimmering man or the exit wounds. I read in a report that said the film had a budget of $ 12 million (Segal received 5 of them) and that the film was still below budget. I have to agree. <br /> <br /> It's no wonder this is a direct DVD movie as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie.
