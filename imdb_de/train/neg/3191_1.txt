There are films that are awful, and there are films that are so awful that they are long forgotten and unsurpassed. Also a lot of violence and bad stuff (not just kitsch stuff, you know what I mean) contribute to the mix. What is the result of bad movies with such heavy content? "Endjustiz" of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of the movie, and that was flipped by Joel and the bots on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". This time, when Mike took Joel's place on the Satellite of Love (but with the same bots), this trio made fun of MST3K's second Joe Don Baker movie Final Justice. Of course, much of the naughty material I mentioned was removed for TV release, but still I want to see this episode (and also "Mitchell"), because what does Joe Don hate most? Why nothing else than "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have big lots around, check this memory for the uncut tape! LOL This happened to another user!
