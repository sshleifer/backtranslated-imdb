In reviewing this film, I can only focus on my experience as a weekend warrior who completes my basic training in July, August, and September 1971 at this Earth Gardening site, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground was nothing to remember the basic training. <br /> <br /> But you have to remember the time when this was in Korea and ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew it. It was not Vietnam, a jungle guerilla war, in which we were constantly pouring draft horses into an endless pit. The draft at that time was not welcome, but was still considered necessary for the defense of the country. Richard Widmark is a veteran of Korea, now hired by the state side to train troops for overseas deployment. The film is about one of his training cycles and the men of the train he has to train. It's the usual kind you would find in pretty much every war movie of the past decade. <br /> <br /> One thing I want to praise Take The High Ground for is that MGM realized that our army was now an integrated army with William Hazard on the train as a black recruit. It corresponded to the zeitgeist, which changed. <br /> <br /> But I want to say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn was healed of his clever mouth from day one. Richard Widmark would not have risked death or a eunuch to trust Jerome Courtland with a weapon. And by no means would he have worried so much about leaving Robert Arthur in the lurch. He just allowed the deputy to deal with him. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was bombarded in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso that Texas Take the High Ground gave a good authenticity. However, consider it as a recruiting film for the army, and you can certainly understand why the government was so eager to cooperate that day. <br /> <br /> I remember the drill sergeants who had their little conflicts that you could pick up. They did not worry about 95% of their cases being dealt with. In no case would Karl Malden Widmark have set open during the training in front of several witnesses among the recruits openly. Both would have recognized that authority had been undermined, something that the military simply does not allow. I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground, because I certainly like the talented cast. The talented director Richard Brooks, even the dumb theme of Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, was awarded an Oscar for High Noon the year before Service. The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and the History of Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufman's lively imagination.
