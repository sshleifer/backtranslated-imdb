Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are in great shape here. They earn Oscar nominations for their performances. I'm also a big fan of the TV show. Their music rocks and they are all so talented! I am also a great exponent of SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> <br /> IF YOU ARE A S CLUB FAN, DO NOT READ THIS !!!!! <br /> <br /> The performances are terribly weak, the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not even performed properly (I'm sorry for the director). The jokes are so incredibly bad that 8 small, passionate S Club fans did not laugh. They thought they could do better. And they did. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "the fat, ugly one who founded a mosh band," has to thank his lucky stars he has left. One of the worst movies ever made. ATTENTION THIS FILM! DO NOT GO AND SEE IT! You will not laugh! YOU WILL WEIN! 0/10 RJT
