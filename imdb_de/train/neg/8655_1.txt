What a horrible movie. It sucked. It was terrible. I do not know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole some critics with a nail in the ass. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sigh ... I do not hate Roger Corman, it's this awful movie. Well, really? But what can you expect from a movie with homoeric computer graphics? What's another matter, the CGI sucked out loud; I hate this movie terribly. This is undoubtedly the worst Roger Corman B-movie and probably the gayest B-movie. It's-it's --- DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, I must have offended some nerds in those moments. It's just a horrible movie ... 0 / 1,000
