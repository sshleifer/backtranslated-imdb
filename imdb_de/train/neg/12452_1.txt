This movie is so bad that I can not describe it. What's wrong with the authors, producers and directors in the blazing pit? How on earth did you get money for this abomination? The plot is ridiculous, acting at best is bad, the story ... What story? The first fight in this movie is fine, but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> I think I'm the biggest loser if he did not turn off this stupid movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie because Scott Adkins was there ... and he's in there ... for 30 seconds. .. <br /> <br /> I give 1 out of 10 because it is the lowest IMDb class. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: watch a Uwe Boll movie instead ... twice ... it's more valuable to your time.
