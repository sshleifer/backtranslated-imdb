American Pie: Beta House is the sixth American pie film in the series. Though it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie films, except that some characters should be associated with the characters of the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (can not that guy get better gigs?). <br /> <br /> There is little that can compliment this movie. There are no funny jokes. Acting is painful to watch, especially the girl with the "southern" accent, who portrays herself more like a Canadian than a Briton pretending to be a hillbilly using the word "ya'll". In this movie, I feel like an idiot. Why did not I apply for a college where no one goes to class (but everyone gets good grades), girls are constantly undressing in public, everyone has unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs, and you can ejaculate family photos everywhere a girl without you mind? Actually, this series has dropped to the standards of softcore porn. Maybe they'll break up for the next one and hire Ron Jeremy as their leader. I'm sure you can just put it on the show by having the character's third uncle Stifler do it sometime or something like that.
