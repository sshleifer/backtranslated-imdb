The only connection this film associates with horror is that it is terribly indefinite. I'd rather stick a rusty nail in my finger than go through it again. Even for a TV movie, it's flat. The cast is boring. The script is as exciting as a bowl of sand. How two directors have teamed up to create such a film will remain one of the great secrets of the 20th century. There is only one scene that can be vaguely recorded in the Omen franchise, and it is shot in Slo-Mo and shortened on the expected payout. If you are tempted to watch it, insert it, set the alarm to 90 minutes and make yourself comfortable. With a bit of luck, you will quickly nod and the alarm will wake you when the worst is over. Namely this movie.
