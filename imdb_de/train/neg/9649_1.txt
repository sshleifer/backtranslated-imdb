Who did you kid off? It was just too much in this movie that was hard to digest. When Arjun (Ajay Devgan) unknowingly wishes his father's death when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Om Puri), only to leave him a few minutes later. The only problem with this theory is that anyone who has ever gone through London Heathrow knows that it is impossible to hold such a feast, especially not from an Indian. But the film problems do not end there, there is the problem that the two main actors (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) pass by as rock stars, who are about to realize their dreams. I mean, yes, we've seen that Susan Boyle (a woman in the UK who realized her dreams after 50 years) was successful, but that was a rare case. It was really hard for me to stop my unbelief because I thought the casting of Salman and Ajay was bad. They would never occupy Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles. Why should we watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men who are just over 40 years old) desperately trying to hold on to their 20s? Let's not even talk about the most confident actress Asin on the screen. This is her second movie (which I've seen) and she's just hopeless as an actress, so she's aware of her looks, that she's only concerned with looking good for the camera and looking fashionable, rather than a good acting performance to provide. It's hard to believe that she refused all the other film roles to play in that fuzz and then being so fluffy as an actress that she has nothing to write on. And to make matters worse, the film just bored. It's nothing special, believe me, you'll predict any clich√© that will happen in it.
