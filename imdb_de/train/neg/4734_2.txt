You like beautiful girls? Yes me too. What's bad about saying beautiful girls / women? No imo, so why should I give this movie only 2 out of 5 stars, even though he received the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I wanted to see really nice people, I would watch MTV or something. This is a movie, still a so-called action movie. So by definition, it does not even need an action, right? I do not agree 100%, but let's say yes. So what does it need? 20 minutes of footage from Part 1 (I may exaggerate a bit, but it felt like it was more than 20 minutes ...)?! That would be "no". But on the other hand, you never know, the people watching Part 1 may not know what they ate for breakfast this morning, so let's remember ... maybe you even remember them twice? Just to be sure they will not forget ... at least until the end of the credits of course !! <br /> <br /> So forget the story, the character development, the real feelings, the "acting" (and no, I do not think women run and / or fight in skirts that are responsible for the acting!) ... what is left? Yes, the action scenes. The action scenes are not bad and that's why I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! I gave this film a chance, but it was a waste of time ... you have better things to do / look, believe me ...
