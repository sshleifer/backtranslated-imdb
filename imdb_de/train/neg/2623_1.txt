Sly Stallone is hardly the best actor in the world, but compared to his brother Frank ... well, roll those prizes out now! Muppet Frank seems to believe that every role he plays makes him play the part of an American / Italian Wise-Guy refugee from the godfather. Please, somebody makes him an acting offer, "he can refuse!" This film simply stinks the place out, even with the terrible overreaction in this movie, Frank still steals the nefarious actors. All people compensate for their lack of talent by yelling their lines and throwing their arms and gesticulating wildly, in a style that has gone out of fashion with silent films. <br /> <br /> The plot that is there is no use when a meteor land lands and makes all women sex horny nymphs. However, since this is a film with 15 certificates, that just means that they take off to their underwear and moaning sounds like dogs in the heat. What happens in the end, I'm not sure, because I lost the will to live before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague and watch 'Deep Impact' for a decent movie on a meteor hit Earth. <br /> <br /> NB Point of order: When one of the women laces down to her underwear, she has her underpants / panties under the suspenders / garter belts that knit over the suspenders, so that women go to the bathroom with less effort can go. A trivial point maybe, but it shows how stupid this movie is if it does not even get it right!
