This must be the cheapest movie of the 21st century. It's all of poor quality, but in the end everything falls under ... everything. All the cheap tricks like lightning and dark are used to hide those crappy computer effects. All actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene in which Anne is asked, "Why are you acting so carelessly?" The correct answer is because she can not act. No matter what happens (the world is close to destruction, her girlfriend dies, she gets fired), she has the same stupid grin on her face. <br /> <br /> It's not just the B-quality movie. It is also the back page description (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray-Schiff, capital ship and main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description sounds like another movie, both with character called Fletcher and Sea Monsters
