I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of the Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories coming together in the end, but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was lost. I would have turned it off almost immediately, but I felt I should endure to the end. Thank God I rented instead of seeing it in the theater. After two hours, I almost screamed in frustration. The biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene. My DVD player still has not forgiven me, and I do not blame it. It was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie.
