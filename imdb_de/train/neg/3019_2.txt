How can you take their hard-living, glamorous violent bounty hunter story with this accent seriously? It is absurd. Besides, the director's visual style is nauseating and tricky, the storyline is a shallow, boring, confused gangster movie, and acting is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters throughout the movie and is told in fragmentary flashbacks - mostly out of sequence - just to keep you nice and confused. The film always shows THINGS THAT DO NOT REALLY HAPPEN, and then later says, "That did not really happen, that happened" - see the (apparent) killing of (fake) "first ladies". What did we see for the first wrong sequence of events? <br /> <br /> A horrible casting choice, an intricate, messy conspiracy and a headache-causing directing style. 1.5.
