I might give this propaganda film maybe 6 or 7 because it shows when and how a propaganda film will succeed. If there are people who look at this play and think, "Well, Jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated in World War II," then the film is very clever to "Why and Why "to hide, and how to mix it and false observations about how a people lives. What can a propaganda film aim for more? The part that contains an American film about the Rothschild family, for example, is very cleverly reused here. The question of why the Jew keeps his fortune away from the officer is never asked. No one mentions the tax system within these particular social classes. <br /> <br /> In addition, the level of excitement (or level of disgust) in the film is slowly increasing and the solution-like end of the film fits the goal and the need for propaganda. The audience would leave with joy and gratitude the coming times ... well done. <br /> <br /> In the film, there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perceptions of the audience. The movie is a kind of story today, so you do not really have to worry about it. However, in this simplicity of the words of ethnic humiliation, an attentive observer can find relevance to today's cultural hate, violence, decivilization and the problems of integration. Overall, fine garbage.
