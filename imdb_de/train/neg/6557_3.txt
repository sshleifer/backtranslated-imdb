Really, you wrote it in the credits BRAIN, not in BRIAN. <br /> <br /> OK, they did not have the budget for a spell checker. The entire production money went to great old cars. At least two Packards are visible here. One is a Darin Convertible. A beautiful yellow Packard Cabriolet. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the film studio show that some money was spent on costumes and decorations. Old cameras, a Ciro exterior, street signs, and everything needed to make a visually appealing image were there. Badly written and addressed. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it runs about 104 minutes. It was more like 85 minutes. It ended without coming to a conclusion. There was a collision, but no conclusion. The film has just beaten against the credits. 99 cents for it. I paid 99 cents for it. I could have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cat's face while he felt more excitement. For a few seconds in the Ciro scene, after Darren McGavin got a call, it looked like maybe. .. this film would have a surprising twist that would make for an interesting movie. Then it just sat there. <br /> <br /> The young Latin American actor, played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya), could have a much bigger role in what was going on here. This cast could have made a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think if they cut off Brian's role and put Steven Bauer in his place and change the script, keep the Packards and lose the band and add a Johnny Otis sound band, then they have something. <br /> <br /> Here's Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
