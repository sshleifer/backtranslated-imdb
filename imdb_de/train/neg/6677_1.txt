After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb, I was very excited about this movie. But it's really a horrible movie, the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes long (the rest of the movie is cheap), the acting is over the top and the story, oh boy, what story? br /> The story does not seem to go in one direction, first they take the alien (after 7 years!), then they do not know what to do with it (after 7 years?) and even want to publish it ( why the hell did they catch it?). Then the girlfriend, who is the most acting, wants to leave the madness behind, suddenly she does not do it, then again, and then not. Then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill all humanity (and remember that in all those years no one else has seen these permanently settled aliens) and what are they doing? They torture and blow a bunch of aliens in peace. <br /> <br /> This is my first review on IMDb. I am a very easy-going person who does not write very soon. So listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, do not look at this movie.
