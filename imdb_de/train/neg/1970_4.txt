If you look at this movie for the action, it's more of a waste of time because the figureheads work better on the ships than the humans. It is a pity that Anthony Quinn could not persuade anyone to let him make other films after this turkey. <br /> <br /> But it's full of amusement, since Yul Brynner has hair, Lorne Greene is not convincing French accent, and the rest of the big names roam like a comic.
