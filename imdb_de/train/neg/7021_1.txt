Whatever happened to Keaton is what I want to know. <br /> <br /> Actually, I do not do it, I crawled limping away, thinking she owe half of the bookies in Vegas or maybe not, maybe she was just brainwashed, blackmailed and bored. She was rich enough to adopt a Third World country, and she somehow had to play in another cookie cut, clich√©-rushing droolathon based on the same character franchise she's been using since 'Father of the Bride' ('91). has laminated. , You would think she would go head-to-head with Mr.Bean. <br /> <br /> (spoiler) <br /> <br /> So, my husband (Dax), fired by a disgusting son of the boss, his mother (Keaton.), leaves his father after the classic Quarrel and crash with her own dog show in tow, oh these little crooks. Hubby has cold feet for the diaper use, the clock is ticking and hey, let's throw a space cadet as a second housemate for a good tone in one day, all in one day, because that's so funny and original. The woman is fed up and leaves, Mama leaves her father for the space-Cadet and the couple makes the credit good in good time, very long minutes later. <br /> <br /> Well, if you have to have a space cadet He can not be wrong, he can not find an excuse for his stay, and when mom leaves dad, she can not hop into a pumpkin-clad taxi just because a scriptwriter was upset about how he cheers up. <br /> <br /> In addition, the gag with which you invite them must first be discovered that they have their dog escorts in the taxi, must now be banned. And you only get a disgusting, two-dimensional boss who devalues. Another movie killer would be the screenplay the cadet passes in space, allegedly more lame than the actual Dejas-ad nausea. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler does not seem to be happy here. Her voice was strange at times, and I wondered if they'd later put some of it down, and she's a smart one, she has played great roles and we will forgive her for Jersey Girl, it could have catastrophic consequences for anyone. Dax Shepard was good to see and that is generous given the material. <br /> <br /> Personally, it's the director, the scriptwriters, and most of all the producers I'd see Tar'n'Feathered for before they are sent to Guantanamo as toys, and that's what I think 'lite'.
