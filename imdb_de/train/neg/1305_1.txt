"Demons III: The Ogre" is not related. Pre-Sequel is a cool 1980s horror classic on "The Demons" and "The Demons 2". "Demons III: The Ogre" is a very stupid, bored, cheap monster. Confusion about the writer is "Demons III: The Ogre "(Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are inferior writers and stupid, who makes the boring spirit of William Shakespeare or the demon's demon of spider web or what Huhuhuhuhu the girl's dream). I am very sorry, very very very very boring movie I bought the special DVD box "Demons" in the 3 different movies "Demons III: The Ogre", "The Other Hell" and "Black Demons" has no subtitles and subtitles costs $ 14.99 at the Best Buy store in the city of Downey. Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are a bad writer who makes the stupid movie almost like "Halloween III" does not have a Michael Myer monster, but people wear Halloween I'm very confused. I love "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 are better the boring dumbbells". D Emons III: The Ogre "is not part of" The Demons "and" The Demons 2 "are the same demons. <br /> <br /> Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
