Could someone please stop John Carpenter from constantly ruining his reputation? How deep can you go? It seems that this man has lost his respect. <br /> <br /> This episode looks like it was made by a film student, it's not even worth talking about WHAT was bad because it was just a Borefest made by someone without talent as a filmmaker or With no motivation ... <br /> <br /> Come on, Mr. Carpenter, please pull away with a bit of self-esteem right away and stop spilling the garbage in a bad tradition of Escape from LA to to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Drunk instead.
