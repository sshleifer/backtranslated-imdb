I've never made a movie online, but I felt moved after seeing it. You do not show up at a funeral and say to the bereaved: "My relatives have died, why should I take care of yours?" be called "art". As a daughter of deaf parents I was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick. Any deaf person who senses a vibration of this immensity would probably have studied it and not ignored it. As a writer, there are a few topics I would keep away from: The Holocaust is one; that's another. I wish these filmmakers had not been so arrogant (and incompetent).
