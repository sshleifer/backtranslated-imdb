POPEYE AND BIG FOOT **; POPEYE'S MOTOR COMPANY **; POPEYE'S GOAT ** GETTING AWAY ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> I used to scrape her together as a kid, but I saw one episode of the series with three consecutive cartoons, that is, several years later (they preceded the predecessor) theatrical screening of pirate yarn RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953]), I can see that they do not hold up too well! The character of Popeye is initially not exactly sympathetic, Olive Oyl clearly arrogant and Blutos antics did not arouse much interest? In short, the scripts were worryingly thin, pretty awful, and generally unrecoverable. They are strictly teen, but I doubt that today's children would even have the patience to stay with them! In addition, the animation style is unattractive. <br /> <br /> If you take each brief short, they probably have improved from one to another: After the initial shock, one adapted to its mediocre quality, so that the third cartoon easily leads to that he enjoys the most? Popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immeasurable appetite gives him no end to mischief (hardly original, I know, but always a funny trick). An interesting element was that the short films were provided with Popeye books, which provided the children in the audience moral wisdom.
