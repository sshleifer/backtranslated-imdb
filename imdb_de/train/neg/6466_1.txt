Marlon Brando had long lost interest in acting in this film. His performance as "The Swede" is the worst in his career, and that's what he wanted to be. He does not exaggerate. Instead, he just looks bizarre and makes his embarrassing gigantic scope fun. The scene where Brando climbs over the toilet is probably the worst and funniest moment in the history of cinema. When we witness him fall headlong into a bathroom, it's hard to believe we see the same actor starring in A Streetcar called Desire, On the Waterfront and The Godfather The Godfather The real question is why Marlon behaved so in his later years. Was he fed up with the movie business? Would he just like to make of himself a complete and totally fool? I think we will never know. But this film is a fascinating study of what bad acting is all about. <br /> <br /> In this context, you should look at Donald Sutherland, the contributing veteran, who tries to deliver his lines because he is ashamed of himself for wanting to join in this travesty.
