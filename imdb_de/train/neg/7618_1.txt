This is not a cinema. It is not a talent. It is not informative. It's not scary. It is not entertaining. It is nothing. <br /> <br /> I got it because my cousin says "Diablo! COOL!" Yes exactly. The only cool thing about this experience was the lonely fact that I did not buy it, I rented it. <br /> <br /> It was shot like a bad soap opera. No wait. Soap operas at least look professional ... sorta. These? It looks like it was taken with a camcorder. It is terrible! Misery! It sux. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is abominable! WHO is this director? I do not even bother to look it up. He stinks! The performances of these poor, unsuspecting actors were far better than this deserved crap festival. <br /> <br /> 2.6 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> That registers about 0.3 / 10 on the "A" scale of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
