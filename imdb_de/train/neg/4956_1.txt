When this cartoon first aired, I had the impression that there would be at least a half descent. I have to admit, watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin starring George Clooney all those years ago. I watched a few episodes and two of them literally kicked Batman left and right off the penguin who fought like Jet Li and beat Batman's crap, and I saw another episode in which Batman rejoined the Joker was kicked. who apparently used Jackie Chan movements as he threw in the air like a ninja. Since when was the Joker or the Penguin ever suitable for Batman? and worse, when Joker and Penguin Kung Fu were colleagues of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It is really embarrassing, depressing and sad how the image of Batman is portrayed in this show. The animation is awful and the dialogue is awful. As a Batman fan since childhood, I can honestly and strongly advise you to avoid this show at all costs, as it does not represent the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more of a wannabe kung fu flick and if you really want to see a classic Batman cartoon I recommend Batman's Animated series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of S --- T! Get Batman: The Animates Series and do not waste time with this cartoon.
