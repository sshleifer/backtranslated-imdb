I mean, really ... either I suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie. It's stupid, ridiculous and just not funny. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the preview, I knew it would not be a great movie. I just did not think it would be that bad. .. <br /> <br /> What happened to the good old days, when you could find smart, witty lines in every movie? If the actors did not have to play ridiculous roles to be funny? Now we find ourselves with films like this, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4, in which I could not find the funny parts! <br /> <br /> Just skip this garbage piece PS (sorry for my english)
