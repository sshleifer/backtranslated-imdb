I'm not sure why Spike Lee made that train the wreck of a movie and got poor Stevie Wonder to forever associate his wonderful music with this theatrical mess. I also resent the way he uses profanity as part of the normal prose of professional blacks. The abuse of his influence on ethnic moviegoers is a shame. Scenes that seemingly come from the blue and have nothing to do with the topic or the subtopics, play as if a college student had written this. I especially loathe the ridiculous scene in which the two leads are groundless for no reason and the police come and rub Snipes. Exaggerating the leads makes you feel like Spike has no respect for your viewers, or he has no idea what a movie is about. It seems that the last scene was thrown to justify the use of a sledgehammer. This film also supports the myth that all creatives use the F-word in random conversations. I hope he will notice that the rest of his films are in the same pool as this, where he does not grow as a filmmaker. I think his association with Scorcesee in Clockers was a smart move. He should stick to documentary films like the Four Little Colored Girls. Shock movies do not make an Oscar.
