Wow, the scariest thing about this episode was the price of homes 40 years ago. I'll say with a foreword that I'm not a fan of narrated episodes. If the story / actor / etc are worth their salt, they should be able to convey most of the narrative without having to read it, reminding me of people who can not think of the cuff, but of teleprompters leave. The psychobabble was boring and boring, but some like that, it's just not my tea. They could have kept the narrative, but at least made it more believable and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something else. Small things like Peugeot, which is in the house, which has a unique semicircular driveway, have to be stolen, but he seems to have parked his car in the tree under which he stood because he was standing neither on the street nor on the street Land can be seen. Sloppy editing as she turns into the driveway (for what seems to be the 100th time). Who are these two guys you see in 24m30 as they approach the car as they drive into the driveway of the abandoned house? The dolly close-ups were also over the top, like a Jr. high school drama student who first saw the zoom feature of his camera. I could go farther apart, but that gets almost as boring as this episode. It kept on going and the real purpose seemed to be to use all the footage they had shot of Elaine driving the Newport cabriolet. I had absolutely expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle game, while a voice-over told us everything about the 8-track player, the automatic top, and so on. No loose ends tied, nothing explained or finished. Not many would notice, I suspect most had already changed channels or had fallen asleep at the end.
