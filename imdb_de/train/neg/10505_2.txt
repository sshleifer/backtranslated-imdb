If you liked "Blair with," you like this one. It has the same lousy camera work and the same soundtrack, and it has the same nonexistent plot and exciting moments. <br /> <br /> It also has Tom Savini, if you expect Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" or Tarantino and Rodriguez "From Dusk Till Dawn". He is an icon and a very good actor. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This movie is definitely the worst movie I've seen in a long time and I've seen some movies - even bad ones. I can tell you that in a sense I find most horror movies entertaining, but this was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 was the naked chicks and the hot action with all those sharp-looking plastic teeth ... No, I'm just kidding. I must have missed it before I press "submit" on the voting form. <br /> <br /> Stay away, even if it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover!
