I read "Lorna Doone" for the first time about 20 years ago and was absolutely thrilled! It is a classic historical romance from the 17th century, when the western country was several days away from London and law and order were much harder to enforce. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. The acting and production values ​​are fine, but the way the story was confused was awful. Why are these TV adjustments? Why would you think that the thousands of fans of a book want to change the story ??? One of the great secrets of life !!! The BBC has created a terrific version that was televised for Christmas in the early 1990s and that I'm still trying to find a copy of! Take my advice, read the book and do not bother with this miserable version!
