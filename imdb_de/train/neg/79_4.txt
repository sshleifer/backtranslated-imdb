The original book was written in the 1950s, but that's not suitable for the television series, as most people pay attention to the style of the 1930s. Ironically, the subway train near the end was a 1950s train that looked like a train from the 1930s, so the subway can also play in this game. Hanging the plot on a plot over Jarrow March was weak, but the '50s version had students pondering the world around them. I think if you think about the poverty of the marchers, it's the same. Everything Japp had to worry about was also weak, but they had to do something to fill the time. This would have made a decent half-hour show, or they could have filmed the book and made a better long show. It is obvious that this episode is superior to the style of the content.
