A call girl witnesses a murder and becomes the murderer's next target. Director Brian De Palma really plays a pretentious role here: his camera races around the corner in a museum (after spending a long time working on a painting of a monkey), splits into a split-screen sequence for artistic reasons (again in the split screen) in which two characters watch a TV program about transsexuals and stage his (first) finale during a thundering rain. "Dressed To Kill" is exhausting, especially because it requires so much swallowing and nothing substantial returns. Much of the acting (with the exception of the young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of De Palma's own "Carrie" - not to mention "Psycho". The explanation of dirty deeds plays like a parody of Hitchcock, not homage. Cold and stylish, the final result is clearly half-baked. ** from ****
