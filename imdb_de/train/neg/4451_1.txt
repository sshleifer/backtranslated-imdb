This movie was probably as stupid as The Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). Case Study: <br /> <br /> 1. To pretend to be drowned, Roberts secretly takes swimming lessons in the YWCA. After her "death," the YWCA calls her husband to work to express her condolences. Hello, how did you get your job number? <br /> <br /> 2. Before she leaves the city, she lets her wedding ring to the bathroom. Days or even weeks later, she finds her husband in John. Does that mean the toilet has never been flushed? <br /> <br /> 3. There is no explanation as to how she pays for caring for her mothers in the old people's home (since she did so behind her rich husband). Towards the end of this boring movie Roberts suspects that her husband is in the house. Instead of running for her life, she runs into the kitchen to see if the cans are neatly stacked.
