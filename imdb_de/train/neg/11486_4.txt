Because some people like me want to know EVERYTHING about a movie, even if they want to see it, including the end. Anyway, here's the end I remember because I could not be older than 8 when I saw it on TV for the first and only time. But I tell you, it sure scared the little kid I was, and I thought about it for days afterward, and it still springs to my mind today, though a few details are a bit vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I do not remember it! I did not even remember that old Barnabus was in this movie, and I loved Dark Shadows. In the end, the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Is lured by the judge (Joseph Cotton, I guess, though I remember he was an old family doctor or something other than a judge, do you see the memory fade?) To the wedding venue who, as I recall, is in a kind of cave? Maybe I got it wrong. and Shelley Winters laughs there, and the judge has a cape on, and the camera angle somehow looks up at him, and he throws back his coat, he has goat legs, and he announces that he is actually her father, the devil, and she played straight into their hands (the satanic cult) because the "mortal" man she fell in love with (I think that's Robert Foxworth) also turns out to be the man to whom Satan calls her The Demon marry with yellow eyes, and yes, of course, they show Robert Foxworth and his eyes are yellow. In the last minutes of the movie, there are many close-ups. Everyone laughs and rejoices except Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy and cries or screams or something, and that's the end. The bad guys win.
