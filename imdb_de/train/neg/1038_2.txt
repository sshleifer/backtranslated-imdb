Breeding Victor Vargas is just a bad movie. No rejection or ad dollar-backed advertising with this sad fact. <br /> <br /> Maybe Peter Sollett saw that he did not have the money for the movie he wanted to do, and decided to go the easy way through a bad movie cynically the principles of the current "edgy filmmaking "simulated. Maybe he just does not know better. It's difficult to say. <br /> <br /> What's not hard to say is the result. Apart from a few viewers who internalize the bad movies for an attempt at pseudo-realism, only a few will like it. <br /> <br /> I know that I did not do that. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and pass on this movie.
