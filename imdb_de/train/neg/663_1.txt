Imagine the scenario - you're only in the cinema because you're in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're done with the museums. You think you might see the Sarah Marshall movie while the trailer looks like this and you do not have to deal with your brain. It's sold out. Options? - The bank job, In Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom Night. You've seen the bank job (surprisingly decent robbery movie) and In Bruges (again pretty good), so you only have two left. You do not like it when Clooney or the nice one from the office walk around in football uniforms from 1930, so watch the evening night, right? Not correct. They take the $ 8.50, go to a stranger on the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $ 8.50. It would be money that is spent better. <br /> <br /> It's more like a comedy than a horror / thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. If I financed the film and they showed me that as a final cut I did not know if I should laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to everyone's intelligence ... my roommate laughed out loud most of the movie's time, because for acting they might as well have robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles they were more realistic. The detective must be the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his acting so much that I do not care how you spell his name) .You are relieved of your titles.> <Br /> So, in summary, "not good"
