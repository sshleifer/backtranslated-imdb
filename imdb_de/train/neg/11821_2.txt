Encouraged by the positive comments on this film here, I was looking forward to watching this movie. Bad mistake. I've seen more than 950 films, and this is really one of the worst of them - it's terrible in almost every way: cut, tempo, storyline, 'drama', soundtrack (the film's only song - a lewd country song - is not played less than four times). The movie looks cheap and evil and is extremely boring. Rarely have I been so happy about the credits of a movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing stopping me from getting a 1-point rating is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from the best performance, he seems to be trying at least a bit. Only for Keitel-Obsessive.
