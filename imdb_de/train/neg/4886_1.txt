Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again played by Priscilla Alden) is released from a mental institution (even though she has killed six people) and taken to the Hope Bartholomew Halfway House. Once there, she immediately falls back into her criminal, crazy ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her food. <br /> <br /> HOLY MOLY! Is this movie shit! You know you're in trouble when the open credits begin, and these are just the credits of the first movie, which were apparently filmed from a television screen. Nick Millard (under his pseudonym Nick Phillips) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel ten years later with a budget likely to cover the cost of an empty tape and a video camera for the weekend. Let's just say that Millard's unique style is not good for video. Seriously, I've made home videos with more production value than this one. And Millard tries to draw SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT 2 by filling half of the runtime with material from the first movie (which looks like it was taken from a worn-out VHS copy). Alden is good again as Ethel, but the film is so inappropriate that she is sorry that she played in this trash. I mean, at least the first movie tried. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if at all possible), shaky camera work, terrible audio and editing that looks like two VCRs are connected. Avoid this at all costs!
