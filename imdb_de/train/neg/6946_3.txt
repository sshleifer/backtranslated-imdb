I saw this movie a long time ago (about 10 years ago) and liked it then. I remembered the other day and decided to take a look again. The second time was not pleasant. Acting is "like that", the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I'm sure the actors did not have a hard time playing these characters. The conspiracy ... it's impossible that those women were beaten with the first raid, let alone the second. (Side note: why did not TT realize that even if she spent a lot of money on her court date, would ask her where she would get it, and she would not have a logical answer! Ding, Ding ... we have a rogue!) , Black women were terribly stereotyped when they said that the only way to "blacken" black women or get a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. It's too much sympathy because everyone dies in the end (Bar Jada), but it's not sad (you think, 'They were so stupid, they deserve to die). You just do not really care about the characters, unless you're a flat person. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie has a value above 5.
