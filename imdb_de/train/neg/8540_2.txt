As someone mentioned, he starts with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat. Then the main story: A photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) meet by chance and take a trip to the mountains. First, they spend the night in an inn shouting at Gaffari, the dumb landlord, with growing public annoyance. Once in the mountains, they seek refuge again and are invited by a friendly old lady who seems too hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, anyone?). t. Well, I like Eurohorror, and that would be better if only Artigot (writer and director) had made an attempt to tell logical stories. The scenery (Pyrenees?) Is an excellent and fascinating place for mysterious and occult events. The green peaks could easily darken supernatural powers and those who command them. The photography is beautiful. I just wish the whole thing made sense. You can watch this movie on archive.org.
