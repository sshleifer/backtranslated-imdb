It is said that a girl named Susan Montford wrote and directed this "movie." No wonder she has no other merit for writing and governing. She made a serious professional mistake when she decided on her career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. <br /> <br /> The basic thing about this movie is, aside from its ridiculous story of a woman fleeing from four weak thugs, the obvious and utter lack of LOGIC. <br /> <br /> ** After leaving the mall, they are approached by four thugs as they surround them. Tell me which woman would SHOWEN a potential attacker aggressively when he is surrounded and verbally offend her? I do not mean, after an attack has already started, because then of course it is completely normal for someone to resist. But she pushed the guy and took it a long way to the next level. No woman would do that if she did not 1) have a weapon, 2) is sure that the fuse is very close and therefore relatively safe from harm, or 3) the attackers are so young and look weak that they are pretty she is sure she can take her. None of this was true in this situation, so she behaved like someone asking to be raped or invaded. Incidentally, when the guard approached as soon as he came near Kim Basinger, why should not she come to him or scream at once? <br /> <br /> ** When she drives off after the guard is shot in the head, she drives into a deserted neighborhood and crashes. She had a good three-minute advantage over the pursuers instead of just walking past houses in a diagonal direction and climbing fences and moving on, pulling out her red toolbox and starting playing around under her hood. I understand that she tried to fix her car, but she should have run. <br /> <br /> (I did not want this to be a chronological summary of the movie because I hate the people who do that, but it's just that every main sequence of this movie has something stupid about it ** Why should she wear a loud red toolbox as she's trying to sneak away in the dark? If caught, one of the Jokers will ask for her to open the toolbox. First she resists, then she finally opens it and pulls out a wrench This scene here is so rich in subtle overtones that the dramatic effect has completely failed, I need to break it down, it's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie At first, she refuses to open box as if it were her plan to have one of the thugs open her in anger after she had not opened it, just like someone in an action movie might have in device that an enemy demands that that person touch / push / open / manipulate, and as soon as the hero refuses to open it, the enemy attacks that device just for this device to automatically release a chemical into it Face Shoots he was unconscious of what the hero's plan was. It feels like they've tried Kim Basinger when she opens the toolbox dramatically, quickly pulls out a KEY and sends out one of the thugs and somehow gets away from him and the other three thugs br /> ** Seeing throughout the rest of the movie She's basically this suburban house woman sneaking through the woods while carrying her Red Toolbox and bringing out various tools used as weapons for KILL THE ATTACKERS. <br /> <br /> ** How did it happen when she ran away to go back to the thugs? I think it was the scene where the radio was played as a tribute to the dead guy. She somehow crept up to her when I thought she was moving away from them. <br /> <br /> ** After all, this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason why she is being hunted at all is that of the thugs. From this perspective, she witnessed a murder she had previously committed against the security officer and they felt they had to kill them. How ridiculous. One of the thugs even said they could have just left the city and returned to the city they were driving from. Nobody but she had seen her anyway, and she probably did not get a license plate. Even if those options do not work in their favor, what's the point of killing someone to kill them and improving the chances of coping with the original murder?
