A note to all aspiring film writers: Study this movie. If your dialogue reads like the dialogue in this movie, please delete your script and try again. <br /> <br /> I did not have high expectations, but was intrigued by the description, which indicated that the Christmas ornament was a mystery factory. The mystery is dissolved very early and the film becomes a romance. I stopped it almost 5 minutes, 10 minutes and in the first break. My spouse, who is a fan of Hallmark & ​​Lifetime, quit on the first break. Forest River is a corporate city - the main business is Aikens Ornaments, which makes all kinds of Christmas decorations. The patriarch of the company has recently passed away, which may jeopardize the future of companies. We'll soon meet Noelle, who would rather be on Wall Street than Main Street, and the mysterious Justin, who's dating Noelle after a big snowman she crashes into Justin's car. After meeting Alison Aikens and doing due diligence on the board, we set up our story. <br /> <br /> If you can not hit all the story arcs until the first commercial break, you have not seen enough of this kind of holiday movie. Maybe that's a good thing.
