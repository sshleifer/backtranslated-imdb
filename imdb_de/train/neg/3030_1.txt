Repetitive music, annoying stories, horrible cinematography effects. Half of the action seemed to focus on the shock, and the other half seemed focused on placating the crowd that hosted people to start a fight. "Delete Scenes" section, the area in which she and her mother are in the office of the Principle. I do not understand why they cut that off. The movie seemed desperate to talk about what he could do, and Domino, who talked about sororities, would have been a highlight of the movie. Ridiculous camera work reminiscent of MTV and is not necessary for a movie film. Speeding up the movie just to get past many things and turning the camera around a bit got old the first time. It's as if the directors wanted to use up all that extra material that they did not want to throw away. <br /> <br /> Another movie with Jerry Springer? I should have said, not to see it from the preview. <br /> <br /> A popular movie for the "in" masses.
