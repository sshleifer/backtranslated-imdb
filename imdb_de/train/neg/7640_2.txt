Basically, I found Eden's Curve to be very poorly built, which made the viewing difficult. But I have to say something about how the director has captured the atmosphere of the early 70s in the choice of attire and clothing. The philosophy of "back to earth" and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs, which were not dramatically decadent, as shown in many later versions of the '70s, was just as true as the "do not ask, do not tell" pseudo. Liberalism of the fraternity, made up of East Coast intellectuals, apart from the fact that I thought that this was more of a school in New England than in Virginia, where I imagine that the mentality of the "good old boy" is even elitist schools like these dominated one. Another thing I appreciated and got in touch with was that at that time homosexuality was not so much associated with leather men or drag queens, and I appreciated some homosexual roles that did not focus on those terribly overused images Respectively. I found it very unfortunate that "gay culture" in the 1980s took on certain forms of Castro and Christopher Streets that shaped the movement and left out a large number of gay men who were more likely to be subject to their lifestyle. Above all, I valued the film as a way to remember in a more natural way how we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without the "scene".
