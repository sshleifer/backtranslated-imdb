This movie is an idiot attempt by an action thriller. A tour bus on the way to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white garbage hijackers driving dune buggies. They drive them into the desert and steal their valuables. The action changes constantly. They are looking for a minute to kidnap a rich Rancher daughter, and in the next, they're looking for a $ 90,000 collector's stamp. The dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie.
