This movie is a very poor attempt to make money with a classic theme. I loved Superman movies, but I wanted to do that myself. Very bad-looking, outrageous special effects and a plot of zero. In summary, Superman leaves the Earth because scientists discovered parts of his home planet, some were in space (duh), do not tell his girlfriend anything before he (Duh again) takes off in a spaceship (?!?), Comes back, I think 5 years later, and look forward to reuniting with his girlfriend (who is now sacrificing his son, who in my opinion is at least seven years old) to the ground. And what about the Lex Luthor? You want to grow a new continent to sell land? You're welcome !! <br /> <br /> I choose 1 out of 10 for this movie just because I can not choose 0. If you have anything else to do with your time, do not watch this movie And even if you have nothing else to do, stay home and watch TV!
