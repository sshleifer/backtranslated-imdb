The title above is used to introduce the movie "Gen" to its audience. Gene is about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The movie begins by leaving her mother behind to start her new job. As she drives, we realize that she is not so close because the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as she enters the garden of the hospital, she sees the death of a patient. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. Two police officers come to the hospital to investigate the suicide. In fact, they have to stay in the hospital because all roads are closed due to bad weather conditions. Your entire communication with the outside world is also interrupted. There is no way out!! In these few days, there will be even worse murders. Everyone now suspects each other. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is awesome. It could have been very scary indeed. There are, of course, positive sides to the film. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. Actions are alright. Some of them try too hard to be mysterious and scary. I think the last shock would have to come out of the movie. What I mean by that is that it was a good turn, but instead of showing it as a parody in the end, we should have realized that's what happens when we see what happens. The director had to explain everything that did not work well in my opinion. The most dangerous patient in the film is said to be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the director. I am sure he will improve. This is his first attempt. I recently found out that he is only 21 years old. That's why I felt more positive about him and his future films. I will not rate this movie but *****.
