Somewhere buried deep in this movie is a reasonably decent movie trying to come out. The only traces are a few early scenes in Los Angeles (in a bar and cemetery) and then a few pieces of production design. As I said, very deeply buried. One of the biggest challenges with watching movies with the supernatural is how to credibly make characters react in unbelievable situations. Annie Mcenroe's reaction to the news that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace from the first movie) is a werewolf (was?), Is a werewolf, if I remember, in the manner of; "Really?". None of the better answers to this challenge. The non-successors continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirba, the (seemingly self proclaimed) "Queen of werewolves." As Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie. Yes, even better than the group of werewolf group sex, Reb Brown's drama and the oddly simian-looking werewolf suits. The creditor has a small legend status and is available in all its splendor (at least until the censor finds it) on Youtube. Look at the reasons and remember, the whole movie is about the same. If you look at it on US TV, the credits have been reworked to replace the endlessly repeated shot of Danning, who's torn off her top, with another endlessly repeated shot from her outline of a cloak. It is a kind of absurd, cherry-on-the-moment, that defies satire.
