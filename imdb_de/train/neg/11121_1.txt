I really can not understand how anyone can give this disgusting movie more than a star ... How do you like such a retarded movie in which all animal abuse scenes are real? I do not even want to imagine the excruciating pain these innocent and defenseless creatures felt at those terrible moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "human" would she torture for no reason or just out of money? I tell you, the director is either mentally retarded or he is just a monster with a "heart" of stone. Or both. He really deserves to cut off his hands and burn him alive. <br /> <br /> It contains several horrible barbaric scenes that can shock a sensitive person and children in particular: A real frog is skinned alive, fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water, a dog is beaten, birds are thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> This movie is more than terrible; It must be the worst and most backward film ever made, along with another called the "Cannibal Holocaust" or something like that. I will never watch or buy movies directed by this heartless monster. Nobody should waste their time looking at it, especially when there are really many great films that feature all of the animal abuse scenes. Luckily, only a few people liked this - which is natural as it is the worst movie ever made, and therefore unsuccessful. I hope that the backstage director will realize that NEVER praise such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence against REAL animals and that he will stage all scenes of animal abuse in his subsequent films. I firmly believe that everyone receives what he gives! There will be a day when all the retarded and cruel "people" will experience the same pain they once inflicted on others. However, this is probably my only "negative" review. Usually I do not comment on a movie if I do not like it, but this time I just could not shut up. I had to tell the truth because animal abuse has to stop!
