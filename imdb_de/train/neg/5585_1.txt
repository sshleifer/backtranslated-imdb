The problem is the role of the characters in the movie. Man to Man depicts a British anthropologist who has abducted two pygmies and brought them to Scotland and then realized that they are not animals or subhumans, but that they are equal to themselves. The problem is the role of the Pygmies in the film - two people who kidnap how animals are treated and yet play such a flat, stereotypical role in the film ... The kidnapper (British anthropologist) is the hero of the film because it " manages to refer to the pygmies ... No idea how the two hostages feel, their perspective, their agony ... I think it's a flat film with a one-sided, basically racist view ... never makes it to move away from the perspective of the "White Mans"
