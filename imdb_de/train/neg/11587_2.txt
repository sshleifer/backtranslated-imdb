This is like the sixth movie. The movie is really bad. It offers nothing in the death section. The one-liners are bad and should not be included in a NOES movie. Freddy is a happy kid throughout the movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that pays off. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all, better than the sixth, but still one of the worst movies in the series. My rating 2/10
