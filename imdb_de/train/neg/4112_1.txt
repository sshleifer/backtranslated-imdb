I think if they made a complete bomb like this with ANY MONEY. I have to get into the film industry. I wiped my ass off a piece of toilet paper and made a better script once. Watch as the guy runs through the tunnel, he uses the same 30 feet of the tunnel OVER and OVER and OVER again and never changed the place of the stupid HANGING light. I think when I get that After meeting the director of this GEM of MOVIE, I think I'll quarrel with him and start by defeating his LOAFERS. I think I have to puke now
