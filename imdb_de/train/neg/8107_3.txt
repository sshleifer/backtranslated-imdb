This movie is pretty boring. There are snippets of naked flesh tossed around to keep the viewer awake, but they can not. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin - she masterfully does her character, but Day-Lewis whirls away most of his lines. Kaufman obviously had no idea how to film this. Disagreements on the impact of household / marital problems and political crises are poorly coordinated. The characters' settings change without explanation. Badly connected
