The name "cult film" is often given to films that continue to be shown more than a generation after their first release or sold in home theater format. Superchick, first released in 1973, is now in this category. His cult status is largely attributable to the continuing interest of women who see him as an early and effective feminist film. Despite the connotation "Superwoman", "Superchick" is not a comic book character, but a very competent young woman who works as a stewardess - a career option that was generally considered one of the most glamorous women of all girls in the 70s, and which allows her imitating traditional Matelot, who is said to have a wife in every port. Since she has the status of a black belt in karate, she is able to make it clear that she is very happy with her bachelor life and is by no means obliged to her extensive male admirer. This film is a situational comedy that avoids the usually much shorter-lived appeal of a decidedly farce. Her appeal for feminists is also compounded by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate skills to avert a kidnapping and save all other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. To make sure that this film appeals to both men and their partners, the director has wisely provided generous eye candy. Superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light, easy-to-watch comedy that they will soon forget after viewing it. It is so forgetful that they will probably find it equally good if they are looked at again in a year; Despite its age, it may therefore still be considered a cult movie for some time. Dialogue and acting, however, would make it difficult to rate this movie as more than 4/10.
