This is not the worst movie I've seen of Peter Greenaway, but it's close. This dishonor goes to the even worse pillow book. The films of this director of 3, which I have seen, I think all unhappy. Like The Cook ... the positive cinematic flourishes he shows are not fulfilled by the aversion of his material and his overall presentation.
