Through the number history of the Kid (Prince), a singer who is on his way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his wife-beating father (Clarence Williams III!) And his self-destructive behavior. I saw this in a 1984 theater. I was not a big fan of Prince, but I liked the three great songs from this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy" and "When Doves Cry". The concert scenes in this film are great - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately, that's a very small part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is obvious and has been done many times - and much better. The subplots are mismanaged to fit well. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I was actually insulted. His wife beating the dad is needed for the story, but the scenes are treated so badly (in acting and directing) that I could not believe it. The script is awful - lousy dialogues and some really painful "comedy" routines. And here there are tons of misogyny - The mother of the child is beaten; The child beats Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia undresses and swims in a dirty river. The characters of Williams and Princes treat women in a terrible way. <br /> <br /> At this spectacle this movie REALLY fails. Appolonia is cute and beautiful - but not an actor. And Prince is (slightly) the worst actor I've ever seen. His blank face and the dialogues of wood are so bad that I could not believe it. This movie is brought to life only during the concert scenes, but there are not really many. The "dramatic" scenes are played and treated so badly that they make this movie a must. You should have made this concert film easy. I give this a 2 - just for the music.
