The fraudulent cover, the title and a very small, hidden deduction from Power of Prayer have led me to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It started really well and pulled me in. I really liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 of it, the film began to bring in things that were unfinished and made no sense. My first thought was, "This is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story." In the end, I looked at parts of the movie again and thought I had missed something. When I reached the last quarter of the movie, it was all boring, annoying, erroneous, that it all made no sense, said nothing, and was annoying to hear; I turned off the sound and made a fast-forward to the end. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch DVDs with the names Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions. <br /> <br /> And I'm Catholic.
