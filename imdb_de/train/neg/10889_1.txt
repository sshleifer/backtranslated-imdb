The worst movie I've seen since Gingerale Afternoon. I assume this is a horror / comedy. I pretty much predicted every scene in this movie. The special effects were not that special. I think I could get the most out of what I have around the house. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I'm afraid I can not. Even Coolio should be ashamed to appear in such a turkey. After a moment's reflection, I have something good to say about this film - it ended.
