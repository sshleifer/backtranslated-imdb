Lolita is a rebel and she will share some little sex stories between Sci-Fi and Fantasy with our eyes wide open. Well, this production of Surrender Cinema is not very good: very bad acting, terrible music and a story without any story or line. BUT, the sex scenes are pretty well done, many lesbian scenes and Jacqueline Lovell, as beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax, offers us a very good graduation and very hot strip show. Only for Lovells fans.
