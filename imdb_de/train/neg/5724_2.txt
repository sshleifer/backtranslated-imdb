I agree with the last reviewer that this movie had a terrible acting. Yes, there was a lot of blood and some nakedness. But it was overshadowed by a slow, meaningless plot and a mute ending. Where should this actually be filmed: in a Canadian Chinatown or in Hong Kong? Hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend to see instead. A technical nuisance with the DVD is that the Spanish subtitles are displayed again after a few scenes and then you have to return to the main menu and switch them off again. Also, do not waste time with the deleted scenes because there is no audio data and it just looks like tourist stuff.
