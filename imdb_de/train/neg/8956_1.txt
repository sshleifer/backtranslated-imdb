Pretty disappointing prequel to the first two films, it has neither the tension of the first nor the interest of the second. Focusing on the guys who "let it run" basically eliminates any tension in the cube because we just do not care about the inside figures. Much of the film is just boring, and it's only with the introduction of the glass-eyed superior and the green-eyed crazy Marine that it gets really dreadful. After that, however, it rises in unforeseen joy. The end, however, is fitting and binds it indirectly into the first. The script is terrible, the acting mediocre at best and the direction inconspicuous. A much less follow-up.
