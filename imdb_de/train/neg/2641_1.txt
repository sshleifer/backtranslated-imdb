Almost every detail of the plot in this film is illogical and implausible. It's not the appearance of a real human story, dead and boring. It's a parody of Hollywood, with musical trumpet parts reminiscent of a Denzel Washington movie, shaky camera shots and focus, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and funny shots, and gestures of famous people in clothing catalog positions. It's meant for the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life comes from watching celebrity names. The only good thing about the movie is the credits and the funky song that accompanies it. I feel like an idiot when I see that, save you.
