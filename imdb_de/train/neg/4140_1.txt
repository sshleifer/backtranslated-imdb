As you might not have heard, there are no real fights between vampires and zombies in this movie. One might then ask why the title suggested such a thing, but it is in a sense appropriate because nothing else makes sense in this film. There was absolutely no story or conspiracy, only things happened. Acting was unbelievably bad, worse than advertising for advertising. <br /> <br /> Not only was there no fight between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies in it. Her make-up looked like it was being worn by an 8-year-old girl. The scene was completely random and out of place, featuring one of the characters who fought the zombies with a hedge trimmer (I'm not joking), but they used chainsaw sound effects. This was undoubtedly the poorest movie I've ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I would not completely ridicule every person responsible for the production of this film is when I learned that the film was produced entirely by 11-year-olds I offer here, I suggest Watching this movie solely because it's possibly the worst movie ever, and that's why it's pretty weird. Even if you only count the mistakes, you should talk.
