<br /> <br /> "Step back for Hollywood veterans?" (The Wayan brothers were "asked"), that's what Hollyweird demanded, and so it was. However, like so many recent decisions, this was an amazing mistake. <br /> <br /> The director has SO contact with today's audience. Trying to restore physical pratfalls and gags instead of a funny dialogue is just a disaster. I knew it, the audience knew it and the CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> What a shame, why did you even think about switching directors? Not only that, but the two Wayan brothers played two of four main characters, without them it's just a farce and a sad one. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
