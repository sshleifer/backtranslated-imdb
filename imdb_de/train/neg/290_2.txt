Killer Tomatoes films have that special kind of humor - they love him or hate him. I personally like it, but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone. The tomatoes are not the same, jokes are lame, even the actors are not so funny. Because that's the only thing that's supposed to be that kind of movie - funny. <br /> <br /> So, if you follow the plot to laugh, that's annoying. They really should not have done the fourth part of the Killer Tomatoes trilogy.
