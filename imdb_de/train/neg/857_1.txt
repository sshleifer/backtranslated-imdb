Many King fans hate this because they say goodbye to the book, but the movie is a different medium and books should change if they make the leap. Regardless, the film fails completely, but it decays in relation to the movie. I'd like to beat the people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made. I always follow the question "Really ... exactly what scene scared you?" Every fan I asked stops. Occasionally, someone who because of a decent fear (there is no ...) calls a loss, the purchase price for "grape juice shootout." If you are afraid of it, I do not know what to say, except perhaps that you are easily afraid. I just rolled my eyes and watched the Z-class H-horror ideas in this flippant, incoherent movie. A place where he deviates from the book, and really bland is the boring work that the film makes to Mr. Halloran to miss, just to kill him; The dumbest member of the audience knows that Jack is waiting behind one of the pillars in the hall, and Halloran FOREVER needs it to go downstairs. Really one of the dumbest sequences ever made. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a good choice for Mr. Halloran's artwork Stanley! Blacklight Afro Nymphomania contribute significantly to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Was there ever an "off" portrait in a movie that was ever made? <br /> <br /> I think it's a miracle that I could finally handle this jerk, and agree that Kubrick's 2001 is a really important movie, given the immense "bad will" that is felt by both this stupid, stupid film is also produced by the cult of botched but inarticulate Kubrick fan-boys who could not describe any idea of ​​a work resource with the Library of Congress in front of them. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the grotesque overacting of Jack Nicholson, the introduction of dull one-liners in tense moments and the Razzie-nominated performance of Shelly Duvall, and you have a very crappy movie.
