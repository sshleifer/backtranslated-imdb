How the hell did they do that ?! The misunderstood "$", which presents itself as a capricious comedy, consists essentially of two hours of people mumbling sentence fragments. The usually reliable Warren Beatty looks drunk and the usually funny Goldie Hawn looks like Depressed. As for Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. Not even the guy with the champagne bottle of LSD can save this litany of worthlessness. <br /> <br /> Do I compare this movie to "Plan 9 from Outer Space"? I would not do that, even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was made idiotic, but ended up amusing; This has been made idiotic and makes you feel as if your brain had just melted from your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made up for that when playing in "Shampoo," but then they played along in the dreadful "Town & Country." Maybe they just should not play in movies. All in all, I would rather tear my skin off than see it again. Dreadful. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should make it new with Jackie Chan. Then I would pay for it.
