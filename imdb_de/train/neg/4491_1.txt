1/10 and that's only because I'm not getting worse with my ratings. <br /> <br /> skip this "movie" and wait for the last movie of the "trilogy". Do not buy or rent it. Trust me, you will miss nothing. The architect does not bring any new information: _ (spoiler) _ There were more NEOs in front of him, he's like # 6 or something. This was something you could already find out from the first movie: Agent Smith told us that the first matrix that was created did not work because it was too perfect. Trinity died and Neo's "love" brought her back, where did I see that before? Oh yes, in the first movie the roles were reversed! As well as the action scenes nothing new, only with more opponents. the action scene (the over 20 ships) in the BIG battle we did not see (maybe in Revolutions?) betrayed by someone (hmmmm, maybe the guy who holds the knife that wanted to stab Neo?), the the camera has encountered EGM button until soon. <br /> <br /> All in all a shameless trick to make money (especially from the guys who have seen it more often), which seems like a charm.
