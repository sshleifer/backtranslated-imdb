Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can see this movie and feel good, you are a better person than me! While this film is a great attempt to "imitate" Laurel and Hardy through looks, sound, and routine, it is too short to honor or even be a movie of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. The dialogue has been torn out of old L + H movies and planted unrealistically, the plot is confused with the futile characterization of the other unnecessary co-stars, Pinchot's accent was bizarre for Stan, and although Sartain did an outstanding job with Ollie's accent, he tried It was hard to create the wonderful mix that Mr. Hardy was. Where was a (good) music number? The editing is choppy, the acting is stiff, the lines are awful, the physics is - tellable - (though they may have tried to give her the feeling of cheap sets?), And on the whole it is a terrible thing to be a witness , It is even more painful to look at than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo wrote and photographed his last film in the terrible time of the 1950s. Do yourself a favor and look as much as you can at the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy movies and see how things were. You know what a MAGNATE is, right? Stan Laurel did not always answer with half-moral jokes on every sentence. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for anyone who thinks this is a decent update / honor of the guys. Where was THE CLASSIC THEMENLIED?!? Why ruin 'Here is still a nice mess'? Why skip "the wiser"? Why was there a pointless bunch of co-stars ?! WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ ???? WHY SARRY HARMON MUST BE WITH YOU? WHY BOZO!? And has THE LEARNING CHANNEL helped finance the thing? <br /> <br /> I mean, really. Fart jokes, for heaven's sake. <br /> <br /> Fart jokes.
