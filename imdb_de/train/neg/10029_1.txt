I had no idea what the movie was about before I saw it because Tashan had only teaser trailers during the promotion. So, I asked my friends if they knew anything about it, saying, "It's the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya, who wrote the screenplays for Dhoom 1 & 2, and Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim made his debut in the film by writing he plays a child in his flashback ". <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I understood why it was not a real trailer because there was nothing to show in the movie. The story was extremely stupid and even a 10-year-old child can come up with a better story. There was hardly anything to do and the camera wobbled at every possible angle and it's hard to figure out who's killing whom. The action was stupid and unrealistic, z. A man with a pistol managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns. <br /> <br /> While watching Tashan, it reminded me of 3 movies: <br /> <br /> Sin City: During the opening credits <br /> <br /> Koyla: Anil Kapoor's terrible English like Amrish Puri in Koyla. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even funny. <br /> <I also heard that the budget is 40 crores, which is equal to the amount of Dhoom 2, and I do not know where all the money goes. If you do not like Dhoom 2, there is absolutely no chance that you like Tashan. The race was hot on the heels and that's a million times better. <br /> <br /> The only two good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs are shot in good locations in Greece, but what good is it in a garbage movie? Even Anil Kapoor's terrible English could not save those inconveniences.
