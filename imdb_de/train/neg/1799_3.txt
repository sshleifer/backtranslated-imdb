Skippy from "Family Ties" plays Eddie, an insane 'Metal' nerd who is picked up. When his beloved funny metal singer, Sammi Curr, dies, he throws a hissing attack that tears down all the posters on his bedroom wall. But when he later receives an unpublished record, he keeps the spirit of his dead "Metal" idol. He is first drawn into revenge ideas, but then he does not want to go as far as Sammi. This is not really as far as his main victims seem to go to the hospital. This movie is absolutely ridiculous and has about as much to do with real Metal as "Rock Star". OK, maybe a bit more than this piece of garbage, but you understand my point. And as EVERYONE can play "Family Ties" for a guy from Skippy, I have no idea. Gene Simmons' cameo is fine and Ozzy Osbourne achieves coherence, I applaud for that, but otherwise I skip it. <br /> <br /> My degree: D <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets topless, a topless extra on a pool party
