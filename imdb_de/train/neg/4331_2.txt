Soon after you've seen this movie, you'll find out why he did not even make it to the theaters! This movie does not deserve the "prequel" tag. Instead, this is a common theme in Hollywood. Rip up good movies with catastrophic prequels, sequels, etc. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie jumped everywhere like a ping-pong ball and character development was nonexistent. I felt like watching a comedy in some parts of the movie because acting was so bad. P Diddy has to stop spoiling movies with his terrible acting, he really made me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks great in this movie It was a bit fun to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a big Carlito's Way fan, I suggest you stop looking. If you still decide to watch the movie anyway, treat the film as if it had torn down the original, because that's exactly what it did.
