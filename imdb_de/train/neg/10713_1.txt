Come on, let's be real. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi or the Knights Templar, as they are commonly called, did not exist until the early 12th century. The story is so ridiculous that it is pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked bored. And if you wanted a real Templar, then just use the Knights of Christ, which still exist in Portugal. At least they should have taken the story into account. The only redeeming quality I could find in this film was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to fit medieval or gothic pieces. The acting was bad, the plot was awful, the action awful and the props were okay.
