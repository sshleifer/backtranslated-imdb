I read the book Celestine Prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie. Note that the movie is loosely based on the book. Many of the book's most interesting points are not featured in the movie. It's at best a "B" movie. Many events, characters, how the characters interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur. The flow of events that are very fluid in the book are choppy and fed like a child to the view. The character development is very bad. Personalities of the characters differ from those in the book. The direction is similar to a "B" horror strip. I understand that it would take six hours to depict everything contained in the book, but the basis of the scripts has missed many points. The casting was very good.
