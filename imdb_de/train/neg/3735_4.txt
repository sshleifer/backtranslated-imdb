Actress Patty Duke wrote an enlightening, funny, rough book about her acting career, her crazy quilt love life and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts that almost put her off. With this rich material (and Patty plays himself in the final act), one might think that a cracked TV director like Gilbert Cates could bring it all together in the movie, but "Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow of Duke's autobiography. For those who have not read the book, the sketchy narrative (jumping forward in time) is not exciting. We must never stray on what's happening, and production seems to be hampered by a low budget. The actors are miscast, and the value that Duke himself finally appears does not pay off - the unreal reality of the film is so big at this point that Patty does not give the scenario any stability. It seems that the producers are sincere enough (and mind-centered) to anxiously direct the film to the ultimate diagnosis and intellectual freedom of Duke, but leaving out many dramatic possibilities.
