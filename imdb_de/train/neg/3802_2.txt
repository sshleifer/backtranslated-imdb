I know actors and actors like to try different kinds of films - hey, nobody wants typography - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should have known better. "Angels in the Outfield" is another movie in which everything seems to be lost until someone or something magically saves the day. Do I have to tell you how it ends? The film is simply simple escapism (examples of high escapism are the various science fiction films from the 50s). If these films had a political undertone - or at least gave us a new look at life - they would be fine; this is just useless. Much closer to the devilish than the angelic. Also with Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I suspect that they do not want to emphasize that in their CVs.
