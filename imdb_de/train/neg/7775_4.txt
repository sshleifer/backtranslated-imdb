I'm not familiar with the trilogy but came across this movie last night on Showtime. The film looked very good with the scenery and the cinematography, but the script was stilted and made of wood. The acting was pretty bad - I thought the two female leads would be useful. They never really believed anything the supporting actors said. There was the stereotypical, bible-tattooing Reverend without a hint of nuance, an authoritative captain, an ingenious soldier, etc. I'm sorry to say that I immediately identified it as Canadian because of these shortcomings without it being so The Telefilm Loans Canada gave it away. I know that I am a terrible person. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something in the beginning, but the hostility towards the girls is never explained. Here they are besieged by werewolves in a fortress, and the men waste time and energy brutally brutalizing two young women. People in focus. There is a more urgent situation outside your walls than if these girls are lesbians or not - that is just my conclusion to the hostility that is directed against them. If you can aim and fire a weapon, you can do well with them. The question of their "immortal soul" can be solved later. <br /> <br /> Also, I think this refers to the rest of the trilogy. These girls are supposed to be the protagonists? One of them ended up killing the Indian who saved one of their lives. I think that one is only a victim of her condition, who can not necessarily be blamed for his actions, but the other is just a murderer who does not deserve her happy ending.
