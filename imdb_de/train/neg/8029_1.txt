A friend of mine bought this (very cheap) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present. I thought I would never see it because I knew it was a joke and the cover of the DVD looked pathetic, but then my friends and I really got bored and looked at it. from the beginning to the end! I know a lot, but it's a masterpiece. It's hard to describe. You should see it, it is a real lesson that people are capable of when they think they are creative and smart, and they really are not. The "acting" is sous-terrain (you can actually see that the "leading lady" sometimes laughs, she's definitely the worst). The "story" is too stupid to be summed up and really sucked everything in this movie. Please pay special attention to "the sheriff". The guy is an adult and therefore has absolutely no excuse to be involved. He is also extremely bad. whatever there were some funny moments. Look at it, haha
