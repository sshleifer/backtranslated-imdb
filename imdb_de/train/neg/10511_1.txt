Note for horror fans: The only horror here is when you realized that you've just spent 95 minutes of your life on a movie so worthless that it's insulting. <br /> <br /> I saw that because: <br />> The premise sounded promising: that's not true. It's just an excuse to use the same lame sets from other low-budget Slasher films that were not good either. <br /> <br /> The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice, even if the movie turned out to be horrible: that's not the case. It is not like that. Amateur photography ensures that the "fallen angels" are about as sexy as the average homeless. <br /> <br /> The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: he is the king of low budget special effects and less expensive trading. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason not to see this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he has since milked on horror conventions. <br /> <br /> But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. Obviously, the author is allergic to originality. The script is awful. That's all after the first 10 minutes. But the unsuspecting pace; the way the director treats "conspiracy" and "characterization" as a nuisance, he believes that nobody cares anyway; and the excruciatingly long and boring driving, walking and nature sequences (undoubtedly added to extend the runtime to qualify the film for distribution), show a total lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general. <br /> <br /> This is another great example of how to determine if a movie is going to be bad: if written and directed by the same person, you expect garbage.
