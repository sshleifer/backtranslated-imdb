This is unbelievably bad and embarrassing for a Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. The National Ballet is one of the five largest companies in the world. BUT WE MAKE BLOODY AWFUL MOVIES! That's not very bad. It's particularly typical and generally poor, filmed in 2-bit hotels and public parks, with a thin orientation, acting on the high school level, and "Gee Whiz ... let's see what that button does on the camera?" Photography. If Michael Moriarity was so interested in making a Jack Nicholson imitation, would not he at least have made a good Jack Nicholson imitation? And if the movie was shot in Vancouver, truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and also a center for yacht building (part of the "conspiracy"), why do we let this endemic Canadian inferiority complex claim that this is disguised? Seattle??? Not only am I mad at this movie, I am ashamed more than a little. The Australians are doing great. We produce pretentious second rate piffle. Gawd !!!!!
