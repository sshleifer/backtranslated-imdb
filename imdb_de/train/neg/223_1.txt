Not a women's movie, but a movie for the gang. One of the worst movies ever made about male by a male director. Director Andy McKay just does not know a woman. Tips of bad taste, the humor style of American Pie, rough story, no sense, baseless story, rejected characters. Vulgar fantasies came alive on the canvas. Insulting and definitely not funny. I wonder how three good actresses were willing to participate.
