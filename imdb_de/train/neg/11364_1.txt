The first ten minutes of this film about an international film in Belgium are alright: you see real chaos on the set, a producer on the brink of a nervous breakdown, the cool director (Mickey Rourke), the bad-tempered star, etc. You've seen it all, but it is well done. BUT THEN! In the rest of the time the film is repeated only ten minutes and over again. No climax, no dramatic development, no good acting, not even bad acting, it just goes on and on and on. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his damn career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. All in all, 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
