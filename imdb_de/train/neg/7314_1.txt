Anyone who has read my review of Uwe Boll's "Alone In The Dark" will remember that I compared the unenviable task of sitting through this piece of human waste with every hair on your arm. Well, take that analogy a step further with this impregnable gutter waste and try to imagine how painless it is when your teeth are extracted without Novacain. If you do, you have a general idea of ​​what Eli Roth's "Cabin Fever" is all about. <br /> <br /> I never thought that a movie could overcome the horrible filth delivered by Uwe Boll as the "worst movie ever". To be honest, I have to say that "Cabin Fever" comes very close. This is another sad excuse for a movie that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theater release. For someone who claims to love the horror genre as much as Eli Roth, he has created the most annoying and awkward patchwork of a movie I've ever seen in my life. How do you mess up such a story? Think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters, without the bad writing, and without all the unnecessary and merry comedy. A film dealing with a grotesque carnivorous virus could and could have been so much better than Roth chose for us here. This script failed me on so many levels. And while I do not doubt the obvious talent this director has, I know he fumbled the ball with an idea that might have redefined the horror genre. <br /> <br /> To say, this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a rough pun. A generous amount of blood and disturbing special effects can not even save it, and that's an item I usually count for. There was really nothing about "Cabin Fever" that I could recommend to anyone. When three-quarters of the viewers walk halfway out of the theater, you know the movie is going down fast. My best advice for those who read this would be to simply rent them before buying. A visit was more than enough for me to know that I'll probably never go back to it.
