"I thought I was locked up in an upholstered cell and they would throw away the key" (This is a paraphrased dialogue from "State of Mind".) One wonders what has become so tangled Forest Paula Milne and her co-author found the magical mushrooms they must have eaten to create this faint "whodunnit" and put such garbage on our screens. A padded cell should actually be available. <br /> <br /> Niamh Cusack did her best (as did the other actors), but her talent certainly deserves a better vehicle than this one. The level of absurdity is reached, and this particular "state of mind" is best buried and forgotten, and certainly not "put in a box and locked in a drawer".
