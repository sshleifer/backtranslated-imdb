The cast you want to die for, in a movie that is considerably less. Vanessa Redgrave dies, but before she leaves, she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that have the appearance and the expectation of being one Great movie, just because they have so many great actors and actresses. So it seems to be something other than the potboiler it really is. Not so bad, but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all with outstanding performances), you expect more than a wacky story thats more as a harlequin romance. <br /> <br /> Waiting for cables.
