Wow, that's shit. I will summarize it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> A count invites 4 naive sluts into his castle. A heap of nothing happens for a long time. Some lame and unexotic softcore sex scenes occur. Some girls get their heads cut off (off screen) -The end. <br /> <br /> The only things that are for this one are the decent-looking sets and costumes. and a few short nudie shots. And believe me, these things are not enough to save the 90 minutes of boredom this movie is about. In fact, the best part is tackling the beginning of the trader, which contains some nasty Goth chicks covered in blood and showing off their boobs - and again - this is definitely not worth the price of the garbage. As everyone else has noted, the title of the movie is completely nonsensical, as there is absolutely no bloodsucker or dance of any kind in the movie. It might as well have been called "the goat-raper leads the circle-jerk," and then it would at least have had a better title, which also concerns nothing in the movie. An exact title would have been "90 Minutes of Torture" - another tantalizing title that would have been at least true ... for the viewer. Honestly, the trailer on the CD shows the best parts (and I use the term "best" extremely loose ...). I strongly recommend that you see this if you are still curious. I can not imagine anyone liking this wreck of a movie - please take my advice and leave it on the shelf here. 2.10
