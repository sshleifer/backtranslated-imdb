Well, I saw this movie yesterday and unfortunately it's worse than you think. First, the plot is idiotic, it has no meaning at all. The script is full of deliberately funny dialogues. The audience laughed many times. And the tension is very low. Actors play so-so, with the exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments, but also some terribly bad acting moments. The saddest thing is when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like "I want * you * beep *", and it looks like we're being very gentle, a very mature woman who looks rude and not sexy. This erotic tension of BI1 is completely gone. From a technical point of view, Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre film - better than typical directly on DVD, but at a much lower level than the original film. For example, the scene of crazy rides is done badly. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven and that shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his shows. The script is made by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas. The film looks cheap and poorly cut. I'm sorry, but my first thought after leaving the theater was, "Why did not they make this movie earlier and stand behind the success of the first film with original talents?" All in all, the original movie is like Citizen Kane in comparison. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of breakthrough in popular cinema. It was provocative, sexy and controversial. It had the best performance of Sharon Stone in her career. It had that specific style of Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is an unintentionally funny movie that is poorly directed in many categories and a sure Razzie Award Winner. It's a pity they made this movie.
