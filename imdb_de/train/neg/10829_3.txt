Magnolia presents itself as a mural of screaming, shrieking, overwrought, hysterical twists, all plagued by regret, guilt, and pain. PT Anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker, but maybe he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him that he had to work on this extra-ordinary mess. <br /> <br /> A look at the cast is displayed I tell you that the performances were excellent and they were. I only wish that there was no exaggerated shouting or a long digression into the sins committed and the pain involved in each scene. <br /> <br /> I also think that Anderson fails. Create a story that runs parallel to the bizarre tableaux that open the movie. The opening sequences are wonderful to show how destiny can bring together people and circumstances mocked even by the most optimistic believer of a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings. However, the story that develops then lacks what these opening fables show. I have always been waiting for a form of cosmic convergence to present itself, but instead we only get waves of regret for morally challenged characters who see their past spreading and now seeking absolution. In the end, throw a biblical plague out of the left field, and all you endure is a cadre of Anderson followers who will marvel at his genius when everything is proven to have actually read the Old Testament I'll say that the music of Aimee Mann was great and I will be looking for the soundtrack CD. In short, a good movie to watch and listen to (ie music) if the actors had tuned or toned down the sound
