Unfortunately, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and I tell you, THIS VERSION SUCKS! I do not know who of all people will raise the money for this flotsam, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classic game and made it the most boring melodrama imaginable. This version is literally so bad that not even the presence of a great thespian like Maximilian Schell in the title role can save it. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was a great food for "MST3K". Mike, Servo and Crow had a lot of fun with this. <br /> <br /> But in any case, I'm sure Shakespeare, if he was alive when they did that, would not have associated his name. This "Hamlet" is not even so bad that it is good; it's just bad. Absolutely terrible.
