Unlike its title, this film does not spice up and the audience is exposed to a tasteless dish. The entire humor appears forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged and reminiscent of the Pakistani pieces available on video, including the behaviors. Everyone screams, screams and does strange things for no reason. The premise looks interesting as it is a direct lift from Hollywood's Boeing Boeing. John Abraham, who is so natural in almost all of his films, is totally off the mark here. If we ignore the moral factor, the bizarre events are also trivial. Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two seasoned Stalwarts, are trying to lift the film because they are natural but futile: at the very least, the characters of three girls should be contrasted to bring some interesting elements, but unfortunately, all of them appear without Brain, buxomed bimbettes (3Bs) who talk, behave and even scream in a similar way. The main hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at home and pretend they never met to do sex, what else? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways. Therefore, the drama is not easy to digest for any reason. But surely big meat shows and enticing promos always give something like that. Such films are a great initial. For those who call it a situational comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. The humor of such a moviegoer is certainly corrupted and denied to the extent that they connect with a sadistic, crazy and crazy kind of humor in which they do not laugh at the characters, but at themselves and at themselves frustrations that look like How senseless we have become, so that we have to endure with such things?
