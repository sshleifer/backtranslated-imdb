This is the worst show. Buntch of adults who behave like children, no humor, nothing. Sesame Street has even better humor and more adult friends than friends. "Friends" may be the worst thing I've ever seen on TV, and I was sitting in front of the tube watching friends. "The intelligence of" Seinfeld "and the wonderful self-pomp of pomposity that is the hallmark of" Frasier. "The characters in" Friends "seem destined to be repelled. <br /> <br /> The unintelligent Show is completely free of any kind. The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric - though this is deliberately the case Writers may need to hold slaves to lessen their abilities so as not to confuse the faithful friends of "friends". )
