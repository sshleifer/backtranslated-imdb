Steve Carpenter can not do horror movies. At first the casting was very wrong for this movie. The only decent part was the hot brown-haired girl of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This movie has no gore (usually a key ingredient to a horror movie), no action, no drama and no suspense (also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but he is so dry and sober that it is sad. There were a few parts that should be funny (sequel to the teenage horror / comedy movies), and nobody laughed in the audience. I thought that this movie was rated R and I did not pay attention and found that it was changed to PG-13. Anyway, watch this movie if you want me to still know what you did last summer. That's the only guy who could fear this movie from afar. And seriously, that's Steve Carpenter for you, stop making horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like a Texas Chainsaw massacre.
