Maybe I'm missing something because I read more positive things about the man who betrayed himself when I read bad reviews - and I just do not get it. I like it when my noirs have a bit of style with characters who speak and look like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence, or whatever you want to call it. Take the lead actor Lee J. Cobb. His crumpled, rolled-out gaze is so far from the brisk, sleek Noir archetype you'll find. Or, as another example, take Jane Wyatt as Femme Fatale. This is one of the worst cases of abuse I have seen for some time. She simply can not convince the role. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, she is tired and lacks real surprises or something new for the genre. I would have predicted the result of the man who cheated on himself after about five minutes. And this last cat and mouse chase scene is just boring. Ten to fifteen minutes in which nothing happened have really ruined any tempo the movie might have worked for.
