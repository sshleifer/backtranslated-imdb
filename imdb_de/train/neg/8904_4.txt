Personally, I really liked "The Prophecy" from 1995. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and although the film was not immaculate, it was a scary and very original horror / fantasy movie that entertained immensely. This substandard sequel to 1998 is still worth seeing, but mainly for walking. Walking is, in my opinion, one of the greatest actors, and once again he is outstanding in the role of the fallen archangel Gabriel, whom he plays here for the second time. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human lady Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the determining factor of the Sky War ... As I said, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. In addition to Gabriel, "The Prophecy II" unfortunately contains a number of terribly annoying characters. The character of Valerie was annoying enough and Danayel annoyed me even more. But the biggest pain in the ass was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who did not want to shut up. Nevertheless, Walken's performance is not the only redeeming quality of the film. The whole movie is pretty dreary and well taken in dark colors, which adds a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene is pretty impressive at the beginning and one of the coolest moments in one of the "Prophecy" movies. "The Prophecy II" is nevertheless the weakest of the three "Prophecy" films with Walken. Definitely a one-man show by Christopher Walken, entertaining, but nothing more.
