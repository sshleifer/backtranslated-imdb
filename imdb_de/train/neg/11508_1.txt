Whatever Guy Ritchie possessed to recreate Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a mess. There was another person in the audience when I saw it, and she let in about an hour. (I hope she asked for a refund.) The only reason I stayed through to the end was that I never got out of a movie. <br /> <br /> But I was sitting by this piece of garbage that totally messed up this Madonna and Ritchie could actually think that they made a good movie. The dialogue is ridiculous, acting is cruel and the only beauty of this film is the scenery. Ritchie took Linas film and turned him into another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> This is a movie you will not even spot on Cinemax. Time is too precious to be wasted on such a crap.
