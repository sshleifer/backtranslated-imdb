This is a dreadful production by Bartleby, but not as the other reviewer calls it "unfilmable", but because this version does not uphold the spirit of the book. It tells the story almost painfully. If I look at it, I could turn the pages in my book and follow it, which is less fun when dealing with an adaptation. Instead, look at the 2001 version of Bartleby with Crispin Glover. This version, though humorous, brings new details to the movie while preserving the spirit of the novel. What's important is the mind, not the minutia of things like attitudes, character names and costumes. The difference between these movie versions is like day and night, boring and hilarious. This version is a lesson on what can go wrong when treating an adaptation with a bad, painful, and startling stroke.
