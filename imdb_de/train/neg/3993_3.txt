This movie was exactly what I expected, not great, but not too bad either. In my opinion, PG13 movies are not scary enough, so I already knew that the whole movie would be boring to me. Sure, in the hotel room there were weird things, but nothing we have not seen yet. I guess I did not like it because I thought too many twists and turns would happen. it got old and it repeats itself. I also did not understand if all the things Cusack experienced in the room were real or not. There is no explanation for the events that have occurred. The film just keeps on going and when it finally comes to an end, it should keep running because you're still waiting for someone to tell you what the movie is all about. What I liked was the special effects. Other than that, it was not much fun. Maybe it's just me, but I thought that would be below average.
