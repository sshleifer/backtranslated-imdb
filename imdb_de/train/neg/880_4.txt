Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at "modern day" Las Vegas and the gap between the generations, his first directorial work since the 1940s! David Janssen is a bit grumpy as a big casino owner who unites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks as uninteresting as an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches each scene in the same way: defensive with a chip on his shoulder. To play this role cool and relaxed is too much to ask of Janssen, who barks like a grumpy husband (he even pisses Don Rickles out and makes him cry!). His son, who is never in search of his own identity, makes harsh comments about how young people look down on Vegas (give them another ten years), and his rejection of the father's lifestyle leads to friction. Brenda Vaccaro is sweet as a confident secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun showgirl as a showgirl during an audition. Unfortunately, "Where's At" has little more to offer than the traditional ethical considerations between adults and their children, some quick T & A shots and amusing satires in the high stakes world of gambling - most of them are now adnauseum. ** from ****
