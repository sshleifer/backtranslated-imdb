... was such that with a clear conscience I could tell everyone how horrible this movie is. I barely made it twenty minutes before I started thinking, "Wow, that's pretty bad." To be honest, I would have given this movie a star if Esai Morales had not been (although he had very little screen time). He's the only well-rehearsed part of the movie, which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought so. <br /> <br /> Looking at it, I thought of his role in "Shawshank Redemption" and realized that it was not as good as I thought. Problem: His jail-hard act seems to be just an act. His dialogue sounded like a very bad impression. Has he ever met someone who speaks as if his character had been SUPPORTED? I doubt it, but maybe he should have. <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, they've managed to inject a little prison philosophy and make it appear as if they're thinking that the rhetoric is talking about a "rasta" with an accent whose accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural. <br /> <br /> Normally I would not hit a movie like this, but when I saw the movie, it was pretty fair cheap rating. I felt betrayed and lied to, and I thought I should try to spare someone the misery of having to watch this movie. I say BOOOOOOOO.
