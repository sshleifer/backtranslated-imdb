First things first: I'm not a conservative. And although I would never call myself a Liberal or a Democrat, from the beginning I was against the war in Iraq. I think it's safe to say John Cusack, and I would probably see politics at eye level. I'm sure we would become drinking buddies if we ever talked about how great the BBC documents of Adam Curtis are. My point is this: do not discredit this criticism by thinking that I am not part of the choir to which Cusack in War, Inc. preaches. There is no question that WI's policy is tailored to my population, but the problem is that tailoring is inferior and the film co-written, produced and played by Cusack is inferior to a cheap suit. <br /> <br /> As they say, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." Cusack, his co-authors, director Joshua Seftel and even the participating actors undoubtedly had the intention to make an anti-war movie as snappy and funny as Robert Altman's M * A * S * H, unfortunately for the viewer, they ended up with an equally listless one and unintelligent ones like the Canadian bacon by Michael Moore. <br /> <br /> The current state of US politics, foreign policy and the "effort" of the war is already absurd and therefore tragic, pathetic and, unfortunately, weird - just look at the Daily Show and see for yourself The conclusion is: you can not write such a funny material as what the Bush administration makes available to us on a daily basis, so why try to compete it? in a hurry together. In order to achieve this, Cusack has basically put the Big Pointe Blank (one of his best films) into cannibalism, changed the attitude, and put it in a shopping list of ideas from the collected works of Naomi Klein. Most of these ideas get stuck in your throat during the first twenty minutes of the movie. What makes them so disgusting is that none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious allusions to Halliburton, the Neo-Cons and the US occupation of Iraq is resourceful or funny. The authors are so blinded by their own dogma that they felt the film was funny and subversive by simply addressing these issues. The problem is ... it's not like that. Meanwhile, these ideas are the news of yesteryear, and if you have not lived under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance, denial, and sheer stupidity (say, a right-wing Christian), those jokes are insultingly simple. <br /> <br /> Maybe WI would work if it were differentiated, subversive, offensive and with detailed research / insights into the crew. As it stands, the jokes and eyesight are superficial and so bad, with so little finesse, subtlety or satirical malice that they made little more than moan me. Homer Simpson once said, "It's funny because it's true," and The Daily Show proves it every night; War, Inc. proves that it's not funny just because it's true. Conclusion: When it comes to weakening the policy of the US / Neo-Conservatives, no exaggeration is required. It's a joke enough. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
