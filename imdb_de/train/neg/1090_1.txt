This was the most meaningless movie I've ever seen since there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care. 90% of the movie had absolutely no action, I laughed so much that my ribs hurt. the play in which the old men captured Robert Duvall was ridiculous. At the directorial level, creating a noir movie does not require a lot of rain scenes and pointless close-ups of the main character. This is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller, and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. since this was based on a "manuscript" by John Grisham, this is not one of his book adaptations, as it shows neither the tension nor the exciting action as films like "the company" or "the rainmaker".
