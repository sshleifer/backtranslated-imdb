I'm afraid you'll find that the vast majority of people who rate this movie as 10 are very Christian. I'm not. If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you are looking for a good general movie, unfortunately, you have to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I was upset with the characters and their illogical behavior. The premise of the film is that teaching morality itself, without teaching that Jesus was the foundation of morality, is itself false. One scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal, and then the character says it was Jesus who taught us this. I find that offensive: should we believe that "you should not steal" came from Jesus? I assume he wrote the Ten Commandments? And before that stealing was acceptable? I borrowed the movie from Netflix. I should have recognized the nature of the film from the comments. Well.
