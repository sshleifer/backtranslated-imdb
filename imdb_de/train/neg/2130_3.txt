I think I'm late for the party. I have just seen this 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV. I did not know it existed and was ready to watch the 1963 movie version when I turned it on because I remembered it was so much fun to do it. This newer version did not impress me. It just was not enough fun. It was not colorful. It lacked the exuberance of youth. The lighting was bad. Nobody seemed to mention this fact. This is not an atmospheric musical, it is bright and vibrant. Choosing the lighting was a poor creative decision. Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of errors. I have no idea about it in this version. The lighting was terrible and clouded the overall performance. The dance numbers also seemed to be anemic. We have music videos today. At least the dance numbers should have reached some of the best of them, or how about the best of Broadway. The choreographer slept at the wheel as it seemed. <br /> <br /> Although all the actors were outstandingly talented, there were some really bad casting decisions. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and with so many talented Latin American artists, it would not have been better to play one of them in the role of Rosie. Vanessa is African-American, amiable and talented, but poorly staffed. Jason Alexander's efforts were amazing, he always does smart work, but he just was not Albert. He was miscast and I think that's obvious to most people who see this release. <br /> <br /> The medium of film is not the medium of the stage. There has to be a translation from one medium to another. The exuberance and the lightning of the stage musical have to be TRANSLATED to the film. There is no merit to be faithful to a script during the shoot. The spirit, the essence of production must be produced. For me, Bye Bye Birdy's 1963 film production was bright and vibrant, while the 1995 production was as bleak as the lighting and as dull as the dance numbers. It turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by many truly talented people.
