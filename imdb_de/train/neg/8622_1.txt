Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came, there has been much talk about a revival of Hong Kong's film industry. Do not Believe It The people who are now filming in HK give the word Crass a new meaning. Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name of the draw, but he spends most of the movie grinning idiotically and tossing a coin. He throws the coin over and over again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a policeman chasing the handsome boy. But again: who knows why? There's a pretty actress in the female lead who runs a kind of company, and she has to pay a ransom or something, but most of the time she just looks like she's in a spa or a mall rather than a camera. Nothing makes sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. All there is is a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
