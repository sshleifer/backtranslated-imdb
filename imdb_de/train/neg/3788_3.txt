There is much to like here. The actors are first-rate and the script provides a good dialogue that best captures the ambience of a close-knit, sympathetic family. For this reason, the film does not sound right. We see that Leo, who seems to have just learned of his HIV-positive diagnosis, is essentially responding in a way that is not attuned to the supportive atmosphere for which he is. The film also ends a bit abruptly to avoid what Leo, his brother, and the rest of this close family must have made because of their love for him. The young actor playing Leo's brother Marcel is impressive, as the rest of the cast is generally so. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide whether to pursue a revealing dissertation on the impact of HIV on a functional, responsive family or the impact of the devastating HIV infection on the victim - just two. While this movie is thought-provoking, the viewer wants a lot more than he delivers.
