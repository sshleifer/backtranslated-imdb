While some appearances were good - Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and the two Italian friends - the story was lame and distracted, the emphasis on the girlfriend's racial background was at best clumsily addressed, and the loved ones were mostly portrayed as stereotypes rather than real people. In many moments, which were supposed to be funny, I flinched uneasily. I can barely understand why the local paper here in SF said it was a good movie, and I wonder who published the glowing review here on IMDb. Very disappointed with this movie, and I really went to a theater to see it, based on the flawed connection to Garden State, which is a much funnier, more ingenious and touching film than this one. I have to mention in particular the emotional climax in the church, which was so wooden and number that I almost left, and some in the audience actually did. This was followed by a dumb climax in the cemetery, which I saw 10 minutes before the event. I really do not like that I'm wrong to spend my money so useless.
