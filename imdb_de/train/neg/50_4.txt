Three-part "horror film" movie with a guy in a boarded-up house pleading with the viewer not to "go out" and (unfortunately) giving us three stories to prove why couple in a car accident hit two psychos. It leads to two completely predictable twists. Still, it's fast (about 15 minutes), violent, good-natured and well-done. Predictable, but pleasing. <br /> <br /> The second is a man who escapes after stealing a lot of money. His car collapses, he is attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and extremely slow. It's too long even after 30 minutes. Good acting. <br /> <br /> The third is just a horror story. It's about a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has nice set designs, a nice erotic feeling and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even scary. <br /> <br /> It ends very stupid. <br /> <br /> All in all, the first look is worth it, but that's it. Turn on the sound and turn it off.
