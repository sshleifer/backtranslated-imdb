It does not take long to see why Code Name: Diamond Head was not included in the network plans. The TV pilot does not go beyond the credits before it becomes obvious how bad it will be. Maybe I missed something because the plot made no sense. Based on what I've gotten out of the mess, a terrorist or thief or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something that has something to do with a secret weapon. The world's most boring secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), wants to stop him. It could have been more, but trust me? it does not matter anyway. <br /> <br /> Action movies should have action. Exciting moments should have tension. And dramatic moments should have drama. In Code Name: Diamond Head, there's nothing like that. I have seen others use the word "turgid" to describe this TV snoozer. and it's better than any word description I can imagine. None of the characters is in the least exciting or worth taking care of. And Roy Thinnes ensures the worst possible leads. His charisma is just north of a snail. Ian McShane is by far the best the movie has to offer, but unfortunately it does not seem to everyone that he will return as a normal actor. If McShane had been cast in the lead role, you might have had something. <br /> <br /> I quickly realize that these terrible 70s Gawd TV movies are making great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes. And that goes double if Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny stuff from Mike and the bots. While I may only be able to give the movie 3/10, I rate Episode # 608 at 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
