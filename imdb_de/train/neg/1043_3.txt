What a bad, bad movie !!! I can not believe what a hype this presumptuous, amateurish excuse for a real movie was awarded !! I left the theater before the end, amazed at how bad the direction and camera work of this movie was !! And to read respectable parents who claim that there is truth and reality in this film, when in reality it is only a brazen attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and shabby. <br /> <br /> At least, this movie once and for all has shown me that the Sundance Festival has become a joke and that it's more of a bad movie label than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. You will want your time back! I know that I did it.
