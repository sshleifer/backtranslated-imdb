I'm so sorry for Jean, after having such a good original movie, perhaps followed by his worst movie in his career. This film was terribly depressed by terrible acting jobs by Goldbeg (Romeo) and whatever the name of the computer was. Also, some scenes may have been just a bit unnecessary. Really a bad movie.
