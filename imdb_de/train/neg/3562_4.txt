"Indian Cemetery Field": When these three words appear somewhere in a real estate list, look for another neighborhood. A young couple with a young daughter and a toddler son move to a Maine house next to an animal cemetery - and after a hike to O-o-o-o-ng an old Indian burial ground. Seems the Indian soil can bring Fido or Fluffy back from the dead - if you do not mind having a wild animal for a pet. It can do the same for the dead - if you do not mind having a murderous zombie in the house. old neighbor and a kid who really is not getting enough supervision, and I think you can figure out what's happening from there - an exaggerated, illogical mess that in all fairness it scares a few. <br /> <br /> Well, there are worse Stephen King adjustments (like "Maximum Overdrive," which King has also addressed). But there are also much better ones (like "Salem's Lot", "The Dead Zone" and both versions of "The Shining").
