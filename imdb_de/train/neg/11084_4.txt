"Tyson" is a normal television product and tries to be a serious biopiece by extending the moments of fear to the effects, moving quickly through the esotericism of corrupt boxing and confusing the sensational stuff, which is the only thing Tyson did even interesting from afar. A lukewarm clock in the best case, which appeals to the general public rather than the boxing fans.
