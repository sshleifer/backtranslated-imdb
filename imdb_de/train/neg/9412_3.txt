This film was screened at the 2007 Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival. I did not expect the movie because someone else chooses it for me. <br /> <br /> I like movies that take time to develop, movies that allow the characters to unfold and make the story flow. Silence is good. But this movie was just slow. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to the two main characters. There was a sense of tension between them when two completely different people, really inadequate, got together in a very clumsy way. There were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about her. <br /> <br /> I also liked the attitude and the way it was filmed. It was claustrophobic and monochrome, adding to the intimacy of the movie and reinforcing the character's strangeness. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand the end. What was the meaning of everything?
