It was so terrible. It was not fun to even watch. Even the scene where the girl uses a vibrator is not fun in this movie. Once again I say that the scene in which a girl masturbates with a vibrator is not even fun. Or maybe, if this was the only part of the movie you saw, just a girl with a vibrator on the couch. Maybe they should have just released this one scene in the cinemas, maybe then the film would be pleasing on a certain level. My advice, fast forward to this point, look at it, rewind the movie, look at it again, rewind, repeat. Maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours. This film ranks next to me with your grave and Doom generation in the category of the worst movies I've ever seen.
