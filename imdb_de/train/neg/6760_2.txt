Renowned writer Mark Redfield (as Edgar Allen Poe) attempts to overcome old addictions and start a new life as Baltimore, publisher of the Maryland magazine. Blackouts, delirium and rejection, however, threaten to hinder his efforts. He also wants to rekindle romance with an old treasure, a very erroneous view of how things turn out. Mr. Redfield also directed this dramatization of Edgar Allen Poe's mysterious final days. Redfield uses a lot of black-and-white, color and trick photography to create mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) is relatively good in relative terms. It's not enough.
