I rented the English version of Lensman and hoped it had some substance because it came from well-known novels. Although there were references to substance in the film, which usually did not go beyond the level of children's comics. Maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book or lost a lot in the dubbed version. Or maybe even the source novels were lightweight. But for some reason there was not much there. <br /> <br /> I have noticed many details that were distracted, sloppy, badly dramatic or otherwise deficient. Some examples: The opening scenes were from the Star Gate scene of 2001 and the Star Wars image of hyperspace. The robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized "R2-D2". <br /> <br /> It starts trying to lend its comic-relief style to Star Wars, but mercifully (as the humor does not work) gives up on comedy and plays it seriously. In that sense, it's superior to the Star Wars franchise, which began with a wise sense of humor and eventually deteriorated to Jar-Jar's annoying stupidity. The agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never before seen a farm. The combine drove through the uncultivated middle of a field, pouring silage onto unharvested crops instead of working from one side to the other and dumping the silage into already-harvested rows or into a truck. Corn spilled out the grain shed, but the farmland was like a wheat field. <br /> <br /> When it was time for Kim's father to face his fate, there was no dramatic weight on the scene. This could have been partly the fault of the English-speaking speaker, but the drawings did not show much Mass. Kim's reactions in this scene were similarly unconvincing. <br /> <br /> When a person named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little reaction, although apparently she was close. (Henderson's death is not a spoiler, his name will not be known until his death.) She seems to forget him immediately. Someone's compassion shows more emotion than she does. I think the voice actor deserves the most guilt in this case. There is at least a hint of emotion in the drawings of Chris. <br /> <br /> On several occasions, bad guys can not fulfill their orders. A bad guy often punishes these failures with miserable deaths. I can not say if that was lifted by Star Wars or if it came from an earlier source - possibly from the Lensman books. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which a spaceship crashes. When descending towards the ground, parts of the ship break off. But so many pieces fall off that nothing should be left until the landing. <br /> <br /> While Chris appears in most cases as a competent, tough space hero, there is a scene in which she screams at an incompetent woman in distress. Someone tough enough to overcome Henderson's death so quickly should at least be able to shout, "Help, it got me and I can not reach my gun!" Instead of just screaming. <br /> <br /> The character with the most personality (almost too often) is D.J. Invoice. He sounded like Wolfman Jack, the D.J. in American graffiti. I wonder if he is just as well in the original language. <br /> <br /> Two planets in the movie have exploded. The explosions were unimpressive and seemed to give Star Wars a lot of inspiration. In his opinion, however, the cause of the explosion was completely different from the main weapon of the Death Star. The dialogue had a good, interesting explanation for the cause. Many other explosions in the movie looked good, just not the planetary explosions. <br /> <br /> Some of the sound effects are very cheesy, as if they were borrowed from a video game of the late 70s. Some of the images look like primitive video games, and some Tron influence is also visible. On the other hand, the sound effects are often quite decent, though this emphasizes the cheesy-sounding parts. The art is also good, especially if it stays away from the often cheesy-looking computer graphics. <br /> <br /> Finally the story. If a movie tells a good story, it can get away with many production flaws. But the plot here was pretty easy. A naive boy tries to help someone on a crippled spaceship and gains a power he does not understand. He and his band of very virtuous companions are fighting against a powerful, unsaved enemy. He connects friends, learns about his special power and grows up to a young man. If he is persistent and virtuous enough, he can even defeat the evil enemy. Details along the way can make such a story go beyond the simple outline, but in this movie there is not much more than that. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just a kiddie cartoon. But since it looks like the primary target group is older children, it may not be more.
