The movie starts slowly when we came to the cinema. We thought it looked pretty good, but after about 5 minutes we were all bored and wondered what kind of movie we had seen. I would not recommend this movie I would not recommend it to anybody, the best part of the night was when the alarm and the lights came on again because the project collapsed because we thought we could all go home. This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. We were all totally bored and most of the people in the cinema actually ran out the doors because it was so nonsense. I am surprised that nobody went out before. If you go and see, make sure you are dealing with something better yet. Do not go and see it at all.
