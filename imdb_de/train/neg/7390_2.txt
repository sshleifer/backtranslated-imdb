How do you spell the fat Italian, who can barely perform a martial arts move without needing heart medicines? In this movie, we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of achievement - since the beginning of his career, it has been a steady decline in pathetic, careless behaviors that have destroyed his career. In this movie, most of his training looks like ordering Fetuccini alfredo every day at his restaurant. <br /> <br /> He is fat, slow and very old-looking in this movie, hardly a hero of martial arts action. more like a laughing stick-clown. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire. This movie includes about two hours of reasons. <br /> <br /> Content: fat Italian with a great reputation In power, the wind gets wind, which a gang of criminals can play with a drug designed by the military to produce the ultimate warrior reaction. This pretext, though pathetic and ridiculous, offers the opportunity for some fight scenes that drag like a comic through walls. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this movie is totally shitty and Steven Seagal is a total joke? Yes. I did.
