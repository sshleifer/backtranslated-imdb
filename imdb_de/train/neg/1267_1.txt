Why me? Why should I be subjected to such a murder, which could have made an interesting conspiracy ?! At least if I can warn other people, it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this horrible movie for a college class. Otherwise, I would have looked at the overview on the back of the thing and clearly controlled. The film was slow, PAINFILL had little character development and focused on the idea that a scary little white man can get cool when hanging out with a black LA-style man. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the stereotypical LA feeling of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie. Keep in mind, however, that this film does not reflect what we think of as "LA Lifestyle," but a wonderful example of the products that emerge from it.
