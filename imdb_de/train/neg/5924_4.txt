Diana Muldaur appears for the second time on Star Trek, but this time as a different character. No one on board seems to notice - maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time she is not the container for a god (see previous episode), but a very famous lady with magical powers that allows her to communicate and see a medusan without going crazy (the normal human reaction) , Unfortunately, the man most in love with her is a few cards less than a full deck, and tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (who strangely lives in a small box - this is a nasty way to travel). And unfortunately, Muldayr himself is not well wounded. What happens next is sort of stupid, and when the episode was over, when I saw her for the first time, I was pretty relieved. Seeing all the men on board as they crossed Muldaur was pretty stupid, and Spock's acting when he went crazy for a while was pretty squeamish. Do yourself a favor - if you have not seen the show yet, choose another episode.
