Poor plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, idiotic director, the annoying porn soundtrack that ran continuously over the overclocked script, and a shitty copy of the VHS can not be redeemed by consuming alcohol. Trust me because I've stuck this turkey to the end. It was so unfortunate that I realized that Hitler was a fourth-rate spoof of spring. <br /> <br /> The girl Janis Joplin played was the only weak spark, and that was only because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something similar, but a thousand times better, then check out Beyond The Valley of The Dolls.
