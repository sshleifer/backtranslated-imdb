Spoken like a real hard-core Ganga. The story is no worse than a series of gangster strips, but never confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II or Goodfellas. It is not in the same league. <br /> <br /> But what makes the movie painful on a regular basis is that all these Italian Americans stumble around faking bad gangsta lines with an even worse accent. Pacino would have been great if they had just dubbed him. I was looking forward to seeing Abraham and Loggia, but their stinging accents spoiled the fun. <br /> <br /> Well, the script is not too hot either. Don Corleone would have made that disappear five minutes after he hit him. He smiled and patted his back all the time.
