OK, so it was written before September 11, 1996. So you can agree a little on the fear of terrorists and the idea that the CIA director is planning a plan to blow that damned plane out of the sky before it brings the downfall. The world is looking ahead. That's it. That's the good stuff. Acting ... fair. The plot ... stupid. The "twist" ... superfluous. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not as if no-one ever thought about what to do when an airplane becomes contaminated. Do not you think that bureaucrats have a handbook for "epidemics" and how to stem them? Proper implementation of such a plan is always a problem, as we have seen after Katrina. But they have a plan. They should not send them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, why then opened the aircraft door and the "shooter" stood there without protection? Did anyone even notice shooting at her legs? That would stop her. But not so dramatic I'm a jerk. I always watch a movie to see the end as soon as I start doing it. But that was a waste of time and for the most part predictable. I saw it with a recorder, so I did not have it. That was a plus to see all the ads. That's a good example of why I watch so little network TV.
