Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who does everything to make his wife look young and beautiful. To do this, during the wedding ceremonies, he picks brides to give the impression that they are dead so he can steal their bodies. I do not know exactly what he does with the bodies. I can not remember that it was ever fully explained. All I know is that he takes something from them and injects it to his wife. (I guess it's just spinal fluid.) Back in the 40's, spinal fluid was the craze for crazy scientists.) The rest can be guessed pretty well here. <br /> <br /> There's a couple (well, actually more than a couple, but I'm just writing about two issues I'm having with this movie.) Bela is used, of course, he's on his own Way a decent job (BTW, the rest of the cast is just miserable) but if he hides behind a hearse or sneaks into the reporter's bedroom to do nothing, that's stupid, why does he have any stooge, the Does he make you look angry? Well, somebody kidnapping comatose brides does not really have to make you look bad. <br /> <br /> The second problem I have is the idea of ​​fighting drugs, why brides, would not a woman under the age of 20 do that? When I saw Bela go through these gyrations to get his victims, I became involved with the idiotic fisherman in I still remember what you did last summer In any case, it seems one making it easier to reach your goal than to use a seemingly impossible plan that depends too much on circumstances beyond your control. (By the way, an alternative title for this film is The Fall of Missing Brides, which I think explains in part the need for "brides.")
