I watched this with growing discomfort. Why should God, in the form of Ian Hunter, help this particular human being in her escape attempt from Devils Island? And what did he do there anyway? I mean, I know that God works mysteriously, but he helps thieves and murderers and prostitutes find salvation, forgiveness, and heart transformation in such a godforsaken place ... Anyway, it's not a sympathetic movie. Whatever Gable had as a charm is missing in this portrait of a thoroughly egotistical man, Crawford is as lovable as ever, ie for me, not at all, and the whole look of the movie makes it seem like it was made 10 Years ago. Compared to high-contrast films like "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" that looks prehistoric.
