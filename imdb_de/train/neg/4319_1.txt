I'm sorry, but I'll ruin both the storyline and the end for you, hoping to avoid a vacation fiasco like the one I'm encountering now. The father dies and the mother asks Santa Claus in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas ... and Santa does it. Dad is peachy, happy and does not know that he died. Everything is syrupy sweet. <br /> <br /> But when a parent watched my five-year-old boy lose his best dog friend, it was a horror strip. Now my son is convinced that he only has to ask Santa to bring his buddy back! Do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart - no persuasiveness can convince him that it's just a movie and that his dog will NOT come back for Christmas. It was heartbreaking to watch his joy, knowing only that he would have to deal with his loss again on Christmas Eve. It's hard enough coping with the loss of a child, but there are some desires that we should not even present as a possibility.
