My friends and I hired that from Blockbuster because we saw Nana Visitor's name on the box. This movie is a travesty, I hope she negates her CV. <br /> <br /> The "conspiracy" was loose and limp, the acting was in some places mostly dry and unbearable. The movie made no sense at all. The rash action of an extraterrestrial parasite that infects humans has often been made through films with much better scripts than this one, for example, by invading corpse and faculty. If you ever have the misfortune to encounter this movie, I suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> What he calls a horror movie, when no fear, tension, blood, terror, or any other common horror film was needed. Techniques that I do not know, but if you still feel like watching this movie I suggest you have lots of sugar in front of you so you can find some of it funny.
