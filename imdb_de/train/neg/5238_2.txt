I can not understand the positive comments on this film. It's cheap and uncomfortable at all levels, and I can not understand how it was ever made. <br /> <br /> There are countless cartoon characters. None of the characters is likeable from a distance - except short for Sue's Asian friend, but even he turns out to be a domestic violence! The two do not despair either, I have no idea why Rita and / or Sue would rush to a perfect creep like Bob. So many critics maintain how "realistic" it is. If that's true, it's a sad reflection on society, but no reason to put it on film. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie at all.
