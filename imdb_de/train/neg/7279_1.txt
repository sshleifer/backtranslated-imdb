I just saw this movie on a local TV station (TV8 "Big Chuck and Little John" in Cleveland, Ohio). I had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> I do not know any thesaurus It can even almost help me to describe how bad this movie really is. The script is awful. Acting is meaningless except for one of two exceptions, since there is nothing in this material that deserves real effort. <br /> <br /> It looks like a bunch of little ideas left over from different writing sessions where thrown into a blender. It's not just funny. The aspect of "parody" is tense at best. Some references were almost out of date (even at the time of publication). No wonder I've never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than anything that made Saturday Night Live, MAD TV or even In Living Color in their worst days. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on TV, it's a good example of how to NOT make a movie. Whatever you do, do not waste a penny. <br /> <br /> Adam
