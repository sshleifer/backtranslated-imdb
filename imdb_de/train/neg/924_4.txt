WARNING SPOILERS ***** A really stupid movie about a group of young excursionists in Italy who find armor from a mythical warrior with demonic souls. One of them wears it and is possessed by the spirit of a demon. Time is dead, and some of his friends die under his blade to revive the demon's body. <br /> <br /> A waste of time for the viewers, as the fine young women in the movie have their clothes pulled, all this is best ridiculous, and the acting is terrible, perfect pairing for such a bad script <br /> <br />
