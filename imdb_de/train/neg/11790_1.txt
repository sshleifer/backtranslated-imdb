Deep SH .. is rather like that! The eels are drawn only over the film. Think "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" meets "Leviathan". Very sticky. <br /> <br /> No character or relationship development. So-called "romantic" scenes are very hackneyed and predictable. An interesting idea, but a poorly written script and LOUSY special effects make this an absolute must!
