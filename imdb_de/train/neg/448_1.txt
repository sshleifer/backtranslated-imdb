What I hate about this show is how badly the leads are written. These women have no self-esteem or dignity. The whole action throws itself on guys. Amanda Bynes' talent is completely wasted. She was brilliant at "All That" and her own show. Why she writes them and Jenny Garth as a vapid, airhead, desperate, men chasing "old maid" wannabes is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Your actions and dialogue remind me "The Simpsons," says Homer Whenever his cartoon character Poochie does not appear on the screen, "Everyone should ask, where is Poochie?". All these conversations are about moaning about a guy and then moaning to a guy. Sometimes they change it and the guy whines instead. Then they come together again or separate at the end. The two women are either flat, stupid or addicted to sex. The only word I can think of is "sucks".
