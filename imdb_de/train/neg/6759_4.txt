Another case of a decent DVD case, in which the quality of the video recording of the film is revealed. <br /> <br /> It was not that bad. Rochon does a decent job and Damn! the cast looks good. I have never seen many muscular guys hanging around regularly. This movie really wanted to make Rochon the killer, but it was not meant to be. My biggest problem with the movie was that in the end, I did not care who the killer was, and the real killer made little sense, since he was out of the blue and the filmmakers thought 'ha, betcha did not see, like that come, you idiot! Yes, there were continuity flaws (mainly in Mrs Rochon's ever-changing wardrobe), but it's not so bad for an indie slasher. I was pretty sure it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless, but that was just a joke. The dialogue was too thoughtful and at times painful. <br /> <br /> Do not have high expectations, and it will not be that bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated.
