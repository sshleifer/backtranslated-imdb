On the surface, the idea of ​​Omen 4 was good. It's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the exorcist, it is very effective when girls are obsessed or devilish. But in Omen 4 it stunk. <br /> <br /> Delia does not make me think that she could be a devilish child, rather she is a child with problems. Problems that maybe only a therapist, rather than a priest, could help. She does not look weird or devilish. She looks rather grumpy and moody. <br /> <br /> This movie had potential, and if made by the same people who made the previous three films, it could work. But it is quite offensive to make a sequel to one of the most popular horror trilogies, as a special created for the TV movie. <br /> <br /> On so many levels it gives way. It looks cheap, the drama is hammish and the effects are typical of a TV drama. The characters do not bring compassion, and you do not set a route for them. I looked at it recently after someone brought it to me for Christmas, and it's terribly dated. Watch one of the others, look at the exorcist, or look at the good son. Do not waste your time with this jerk!
