This movie starts slowly and then tapers. After watching for about an hour and absolutely nothing happened, I went out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Post Code. Nada There is no story. The characters are vague depictions of the most boring people that each of us knows. The producers of this film could be sued if they try to sell it as a "movie". There is no movement. I could have told the same "story" with a few stills with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any scriptwriter in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not that I've spent 60 minutes of my life looking at "love in the time of money" but missed a great opportunity to be an executive. I could have gone out first, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I saw about 20 people walking in front of me.
