This is probably one of the worst French films I've ever seen, among more than 100 French films I've ever seen. Terrible script and very medio-sacral / unprofessional acting make the director powerless. It does not matter how well western French scene and fancy music can contribute to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the main drawbacks of this movie is that these two characters DO NOT attract people I do not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised how this film won the jury's award in Cannes, man, I love almost all excellent Cannes films, but not this one. A big disappointment for me.
