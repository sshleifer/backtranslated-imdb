Man, what a scam! Not because it was not good (since I did not really expect anything), but because I was misled by the DVD case that ignorantly introduced its "stars" as Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens, and Tony Bill. Sure, their names did not appear in the opening credits of the movie, let alone in the rest of the movie !! As it turns out, the only movie that connects these three actors is the equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (1975)? But what does that have to do with THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER? <br /> <br /> Even though I paid $ 1.50 for the rental and was still in a monster movie mood, I decided to watch the movie anyway and, yes, it stunk! Apart from the fact that there was no unnamed cast and anonymous crew, there was an unmistakable mood from afar, and what I could do with it is laughter at the JAWS-like pretensions and intentionally over the reluctant antics of two idiots Layabouts boat owners who often quarrel with the amused local sheriff. The creature itself? a Plesiosaur, d. H. half dinosaur / half fish ?? is (of course) incompletely realized, but as with THE GIANT CLAW (1957), which I've just seen, this did not seem to bother the filmmakers as they flaunt it as much as they can, especially during the second half of the movie!
