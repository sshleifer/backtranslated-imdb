Channel surfing and this caught on LOGO. It was one of those "I have to see that because it's so terribly bad," like Roadhouse without the joy. The writing is cruel; completely crazy and acting is bad to throw in the mouth. <br /> <br /> There is a small budget and then there is the abyss where this epic should be thrown and never be seen again. I mean, the main characters go to a ski retreat in a rented house, and the house takes some getting used to, which is not a big deal, but they show that all the house guests are pouring over it like it's the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry, but 6 guys are looking into each 10'x10 'boring room with a futon in it, and the bubbling is lame. I think they have not learned anything from the Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see hotel room check scene) ... wow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I do not buy it all over the top, so everything is routine. If it smells like ... and it looks like ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague. <br /> <br /> edit: Apparently other, more open-minded reviewers I think that since I did not like this movie, I'm an "obvious hater" of whom I can only assume that I'm phobic, which of course is not true. I chose to do this crazy, crazy thing and judge the movie by the actual content of the movie rather than by its mere presence (ie, its refreshment ...). <br /> <br /> Surely it can be refreshing to see, but that does not mean a great movie. Just give them better material and a closer alignment. In fact, I welcome the effort. To be honest, I would rather listen to my catalog of kitchens of distinction than to see it again.
