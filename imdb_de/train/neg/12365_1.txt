I think this dump is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed. Why do all American entertainers believe that kids today want stupid GI JOE versions of good stories? The Looney Tunes are some of the most popular characters in the story, but they were not created as Xtreme, I mean, come on !!! Tiny Toons has been a great example of how an old idea can be updated without losing its original charm, but this dump is just one example of stupid business decisions that just want to create a cheap, idiotic show that kids love because they love it !! ! Kids love superheroes right? The whole show is just a waste of time, in which we see the new versions of the Looney Tunes, but this time in superhero form this does not sound so bad, but the problem is that this show tries too hard to copy series like Batman the Animated series or the new justice league, the result ??? bad copies of flash (the road runner) or superman (who else ??? bugs bunny) the problem is that Looney Tunes should not be dramatic, they should be funny !!!! As I said, before this series is shit, many people wonder why anime takes the whole world along ??? This show tries to be dramatic and action-packed, but few series and anime can do that. If you want to see a good upgrade of an old show, take a look at Tiny Toons. This is an example that can bring back to life ancient characters, but with a good history and respect for the original roots. Too bad that this show is already dead, I suppose it's another business decision.
