Okay, I have to say that before the unveiling of the "monster". to say that he really did not fit into this category, just a weird thing that had an annoying shriek! And personally, I think a granny could run away from the thing, but still. I actually got into this movie, even though the main character was a drunk and a heroine addict, did not come to a call. But such scenes as when she runs away from the train, and you can see that the figure at the door was somehow scary, even where the guard was just killed and the "monster" put his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then the disaster came in the moment the monster was revealed to be an average horror, with limited thrills. Slowly I got bored and wanted to turn off the thing. I like the way most people said they would get the homeless to do it, especially the guy who gave me some cheap laughs here and there. I think this movie could have been something special, instead it has become what every other horror is today! Just boring and not worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a cheap scare here and there, or after a mindless Gore festival (which is indeed limited) there's definitely a problem going on, but for all of you as a horror Watch, look elsewhere for much better movies.
