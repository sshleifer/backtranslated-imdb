An Italian / American co-production with Linda Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff: How could a fan of trashy horror resist such a treat? <br /> <br /> Well, based on the uneventful, extremely boring, and completely nonsensical in the first forty minutes or so, I would have said "very easy"; Fortunately, with the advent of several imaginative death scenes, it becomes a little more entertaining, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, it's also a bit nudity (unfortunately, my copy was visually edited to remove such offensive material.) > <br /> The Hoff plays Gary, a photographer who escorts his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island to get photos for her latest project, a book about witches; heal a bad case of blue bullets by freeing Leslie from her virginity but his plans for Nookie are disturbed by the unexpected arrival of property developer Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), her pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son Tommy (Michael Manchester), the pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) and the estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) have come to inspect the city The hotel of the island. <br /> <br /> After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners. When suddenly a violent storm comes up, returning to the mainland is dangerously committed to spending the night in the old building. Unknown to the new guests of the hotel is unfortunately also the spirit of a wicked witch (Hildegard Knef) at home, the human sacrifice calls to bring back to life. Gradually, the victims are drawn into a swirling red vortex (guaranteed to bring unwanted laughter) before they suffer a terrible fate. None of this makes much sense, and the acting is abominable (Manchester) Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff has proven to be one of the better performers (which speaks volumes about the others), but those viewers who leave the bleak first half behind , are rewarded with a few decent moments: Rose has her lips stitched together before they are roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured by Hagen and impaled by a swordfish (!!); Freddie's veins pulsate and break out in blood in geysers; and Gary gets stabbed in the back. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Leslie gets raped by a man without lips and Blair gets obsessed (again).
