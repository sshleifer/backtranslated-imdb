This is complete and absolute garbage, a good example of a bad movie. That can not appeal to anyone, not even for B-movie fans. Do not waste valuable time of your life with this garbage. Bad acting, bad directing, terrible (but really terrible) script and total lack of any idea of ​​what entertainment (of any form) is. I bought the DVD for $ 3, I swear I could almost pay someone for it. The burning would not be enough for what this movie did to me. I like B-movies, the killer toy, the strange lagoon monsters, but that's not nearly so far. You know the films that are so bad that they are funny? Not even. Just old pitiful.
