It is not the cast. A finer group of actors could not be found. It is not the attitude. The director is in love with New York City, and at the end of the movie we're all! Woody Allen could not improve on what Bogdonovich did here. If you fall in love or fall in love, Manhattan is the place for you. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is nothing. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. According to the director's experience in Hollywood, this happens when they work on set. For him and his peers, it's a reality, but for most of us in the real world, it's a fantasy. In the end, the film is hollow and flat and without a message.
