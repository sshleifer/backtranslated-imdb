That the reviewers liked this movie surprises me. The plot is a mess. The characters are made of wood. Michael Bowen spends most of his time spying on the other characters and misjudging them all. Nobody has a redeeming quality or a point of interest. This is not a nervous job. It is not imaginative. It is not ironic. It is not smart. There is nothing direct to this boring work. That theater release is missed, is no surprise. The broadcast of "This Network" reduces this venue. In any case, I highly recommend a repeat of the Garden Smart Show on PBS, or even good information, if you've come across this mess on late night television. If you watch it on TV, take a long walk. Even if you go into smog, you will feel better if you have not suffered through this mess. Life is short. This movie is long.
