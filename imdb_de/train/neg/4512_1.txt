After living in Japan for several years, this film does not reflect Japanese culture and does not even explain what it means to be a geisha. Unfortunately, a great opportunity was missed to bring Japanese culture a bit closer to the broader Western audience and to demystify the country from which Zen, Samurai and the geisha world of Kyoto originate. Some of the film's most poignant moments are when the Americans are shown in Japanese surroundings. The geisha dances were not authentic. There was far too much Chinese music used. A small but essential detail: The correct use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. The sakura scenes were almost obscene cheesy! Interestingly, some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese.
