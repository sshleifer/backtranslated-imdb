If you have seen friends, the writing will feel very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of Friends often have the same comedy settings. <br /> <br /> The show is about a group of people whose connection is that they had the same class when they were quite young (about 10 years old, I think). Now they are in their mid-twenties and meet again at a reunion. This is where the series begins. A typical episode deals with several storylines simultaneously. They are usually connected in no way. Each story is divided into several sections, which are then displayed in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> In the sketches are my problems with this series. As in Friends' later seasons, this is often a pretty silly setting with hard-to-believe situations. One of the main characters does something really stupid, that's hard to believe. The situation is then greatly exaggerated, as if she were not stupid enough. If you are interested in this kind of in-your-face humor then you may like this series. It's a great change for me. <br /> <br /> The reason I started dating friends is due to the first few seasons. There are interesting and, above all, credible storylines, with some romanticism that makes them the characters. The class has none of this. The characters are just too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far. It is therefore not possible to relate to them and to like them. <br /> <br /> At least with friends, it took several seasons before the steam ran out and all the character traits were milked out. But in class, it seems like it has no steam at all.
