How can so many corrupt cops be without one of them shaking? With enough police officers to conduct a mini-war involving weapons like flamethrowers, you would think they were caught before anyone wrote for a weekly coupon newspaper how someone would thank a corrupt cop. <br /> <br /> You will never get your 90s back. Life is too valuable to borrow this movie. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the big actors who made the mistake of making this movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Justin Timberlake, feel free to rent this movie. He has a huge stake in it, so fans would like to see him. <br /> <br /> But I think most of his fans are young girls who could be put off by the violence in this movie.
