Dancing was probably the ONLY observable element of this film - and even that was disappointing compared to other films. My gawd! <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst film - a movie that assumes it's a work of art because it has everything like movie-as-art. Yes, it is beautifully photographed, but ultimately lacks the depth and excitement of the dance that the film is supposed to surround. Tango is curious, it's hot, it has drama, it's bold - just what this movie is not.
