*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This fantastic movie sets the record right from the start: it's a classic right away. It does not take long to realize that this movie is big, bigger than "Kindergarten Cop" or "Police Academy 7". The sheer size made me speechless as I walked out of the cinema and headed directly to the ticket office to buy another dozen tickets. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that simply requires multiple visits. At first sighting, you will surely be familiar with this weird "huh?" Feeling, but not embarrassing - it happens to the best of us. The story is so devilishly clever that one has to wonder about the mortality of its authors. What looks like a simple idiot story infiltrating the FBI is an allegorical story that works on multiple levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life. The complexity of the plot structure will amaze you when you first look at it, but do not give up! It was only after my sixth or seventh visit that I discovered some of the hidden secrets of 'Corky Romano'. And watch out for the unexpected twist in the end. Otherwise, you may be completely surprised to learn that FBI agent Brick Davis is the FBI's most wanted criminal. Corky is not a real FBI agent. Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits that he is illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual. I am surprised that I can say so much. <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan's comedic talents are second to none as he leads his character Corky Romano through a maze of totally unpredictable situations. Kattan recalls John Reynolds' performance in 'Manos, The Hands of Fate'. He accepts countless personalities and tackles all scenes with perfect comedic timing. But Kattan is not just about comedy. He is also a master of drama as he controls the emotions of the audience with the least movements of his face. His facial expressions reflect life in a certain way. In the scene where he fits into the faces of his brothers, one sees, for example, the expression of social injustice and alienation, which are clearly reflected in his desperate face. At such a moment it is difficult to find a dry eye in the house. Screenwriters David Garret and Jason Ward are the true heroes of `Corky Romano '. Such a story makes it easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be deployed to complete this ambitious project. Her clever storytelling and unorthodox structuring make "Pulp Fiction" look like a mediocre Saturday Night Live sketch. Garret and Ward's story is so captivating and tempting that she grabs you by the hair, completely swallowing you, shaking you and spitting you straight out. At the end of the "Corky Romano" experience, which is located outside the world, you find another person with different world views and different ideas and with only one question in mind: <br /> <br /> Why God? Why?!?
