This movie was ridiculously bad. A friend rented it to Netflix and let me look at it. There are so many goblins and fools that it is impossible to know the characters and the conspiracy at all. How about these for example ... <br /> <br /> The "Vermont Airport" is surrounded by palm trees. <br /> <br /> Ben's miraculously appearing shirt during a telephone conversation. <br /> <br /> The priest's palace office ... complete with folding map table <br /> <br /> Behind a very bad movie hides a decent story. But even if you look past the technical flaws, you will find terrible acting and casting. What tickled me most was the casting of a flamboyant gay actor who played the right religious fanatic. His opening scene sat in his immaculate home, caressing his cat. <br /> <br /> I applaud the author / director / producer / publisher / star / caterer / dentist / composer (and whatever else he did.) did this for the move) because a movie like this one actually distributed has been. If you have nothing better to do, this could be a fun group movie or even the basics of a drinking game, but do not hire it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriages.
