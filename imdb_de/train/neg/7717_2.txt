When I heard the storyline for this movie, I just had to see it. I mean, whole cities are wiped out by killer tomatoes! Unfortunately, the title is about as funny as it gets. Led by Detective Dick Mason, a special team of military and scientists (including Greg Colburn, who never takes off his SCUBA outfit, and Lt. Finletter, who is never "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes") is a parody of B-movies, in particular The film begins with a woman of normal height being spotted by a woman washing herself away in her kitchen before we find ourselves in the middle of a crime scene when tomato allegedly killed that lady, and I'm telling you that the movie is not getting any better! To be fair, there are a few funny moments, for example, when the Japanese scientist Dr. Nokitofa talks about his voice being coaxed with an American accent, or the "If masked expert Sam Smith abducts the tomatoes, can anyone pass the ketchup?" Likewise, this movie was probably a lot funnier in 1978, and the whole thing was so bad n good concept. Unfortunately, for 'Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes', parody films such as the 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' series have been released, which have made this kind of comedy much better. <br /> <br /> The spectacle is abominable; There is no continuity in editing and it just feels really slow and there is a lack of energy. For a parody movie to work, you have to do many things at the same time, a gag after the end. The song of the film seems pointless and the ad for the furniture store that flashes across the screen is damned bizarre, even for this movie. Ultimately, however, one can see why this film is a cult. I can not see that many people are indifferent. Unfortunately, it would be terrible how I would summarize that.
