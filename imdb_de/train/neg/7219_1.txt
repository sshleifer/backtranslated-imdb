It's still hard for me to realize that a movie as bad as this one could be filmed in Hollywood. The drama and the story is just pathetic and the direction is terrible. I do not see any logic behind this garbage, except that the director had nothing good to do. It took me ten minutes to realize that I had wasted my thirty rupees. It filled me with dismay that I would waste more of my time with this crap. I bet the movie was shot in less than a day. I do not know which category it falls into. Please avoid this movie at all costs, just do anything, hit your head against the walls, but do not go for this movie.
