This anime series starts off great: Interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and executed. Not everything is immediately explained by dangling a proverbial carrot in front of the viewer and tempting the viewer to see each subsequent episode. However, imagine the disappointment that the sci-fi thriller / giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho-chattering and quasi-religious sermon exploitation. If you want to hear, "You're alright. It's good to be you." Once you have been countered with negative slogans and the negative emotions of the characters, this is for you. If you want a good sci-fi movie that's just fun, forget it. Both the original and the alternative end were very disappointing for me. All this, AND this movie was to be preached.
