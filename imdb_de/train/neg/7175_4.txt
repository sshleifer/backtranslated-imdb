This may be based on historical events, and we know that the creators of this TV documentary drama have taken the liberty to make it more dramatic - I can live with it - but it was just so bad! I was amazed at the airborne crisis, how calm everyone was, certainly someone would panic, and what a smooth flight, no obvious inconvenience to the passengers -. Not sure what the regulations are, nowadays some of the airline security forces seem to be OTT nonsense, but why should you take your shoes off before landing? The footage of this huge plane on this remote runway was unconvincing and spurious. In reality, it would have been a fantastic sight, viewed from the ground nearby. In this movie he was disproportionate and looked like the model he probably was. Emergency slides appeared on the front and middle emergency doors, but no one seemed to be leaving the front, though the fall was much smaller. The captain went back to the plane after landing - why? that was never explained. We know that the emergency landing was due to the fact that no fuel was available. Even so, some fuel had to be washed around the underside of the tanks, and the danger of explosion had been a very real danger, but the evacuation seemed almost leisurely, and everyone stood at the bottom of the escape slide rather than moving as far as they could I would have done it for sure. There were just too many inconsistencies, mistakes and wrong actions. I would have preferred to see a representation of the drama in real time and with realistic movement of the displayed plane. It had the potential to be quite exciting, but undoubtedly because the budget constraints failed, and you felt that an airplane that lost all engines was not a big deal, and you would certainly slip to a slightly bumpy landing, but no real danger! - the reality is of course something different!
