In Texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the Halloween night before going to a party. In the meantime, they call the American Nightmare Pirate Radio for fun and confess their innermost fears. A serial killer listening to his confessions makes his nightmares come true and kills each of them sadistically. "American Nightmare" is a comical low-budget movie that has a terrible start: Without prior explanation, a woman kills two couples in a remote campground as if it were Friday the 13th. Then the story changes to a bar, in of the seven friends celebrate Halloween. From that moment on, the story has great potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance and also shows some beautiful breasts and nude bodies, as is common in this type of C production. The end of the script, however, provides no explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse Jane Toppan, which gives the feeling that the budget ended before the end of the shoot. With a better start and a better ending, this weird story would be a good low-budget Slasher movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agonia" ("Agony")
