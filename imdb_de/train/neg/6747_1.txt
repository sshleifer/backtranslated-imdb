Wow ... speechless about the making of this movie, I can not say much. The coverbox in the local video store should have said it all ... nothing but 6 actors / actresses who lose on the set of Scream and decide to make a movie! <br /> <br /> The acting was apparently not in the budget, but they could afford nudity and good-looking actors! Style over substance is almost noticeable, except that most of the mistakes of the drama class keep forgetting that there is a conspiracy that must go somewhere after reading this script. After only 4 or 5 killings by the so-called masked murderer and a confusing plot about a murder club that the stupid lead actress thinks is a real club she can join (only if she can run into a girl who bumps into her Car), you want to stab your hands with the next sharp object to remind you that you will never feel overly excited about a possibly good movie like this one. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the people who bought this movie can not find anyone who takes it from their hands. Another example of what's going on with the growing number of horror releases directly on video without worrying about the basics. Throw it away when you buy it.
