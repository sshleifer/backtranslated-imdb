This film was advertised on radio, television, magazines and so on. Almost every hour or every issue. So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But oh man, how sad is this movie! It's a Hollywood-style movie about a film in a movie. Shades shows are so clear that we are not ready to produce "big Hollywood movies". I'm not a movie critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As my subject says, it is nothing and then looped. You could also just stare at the TV without really seeing anything. That was the feeling we had when we saw Shades. Shades is a bad production !!!
