I really wanted to have this movie - most of the shootings were done in Pittsburgh and the trailer had wonderful photos. But even for a filmed cartoon, it was a really bad movie. The continuity and the pace were just terrible. The best parts of the movie are under the credits, so it's (almost) worth it to keep it out to the end (though, strangely, it goes beyond the last half hour) /> If the best performance in a movie is Andy Dick, know You, that there must be a problem ...
