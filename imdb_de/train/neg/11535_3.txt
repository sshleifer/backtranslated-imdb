Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, dedicated career woman who gets away from the working class for a fun-filled night out with Danny Dyer. After a stupid accident in the countryside they are brutally attacked. After recovery and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to revenge ... <br /> <br /> I thought "Straightheads" was awful. Violent, brutal, misogynist and unpleasant. If I did not reject the sentence very much, I would call "Straightheads" uncomfortable. Surely it was the kind of film that could not have been released on budget in the dark days of the eighties. Honestly, I do not know how "Straightheads" got a movie release. <br /> <br /> I'm not a scammer. I have nothing against sex and violence in the movies, but they have to be married to a movie with a) a good plot or b) a good characterization or c) preferably both. Straightheads had neither. No progress in the plot or characters and too much unexplained and not said. Fortunately, "Straightheads" did not go fast anywhere. It was only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because here was the germ of an interesting movie with a particularly interesting twist in the storyline in the last third. How many times do I say that, but it could have been good if it had been done right. Too bad. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they had nothing to hide with this movie. She is especially undervalued (and still very fit). <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good British revenge movie, borrow or buy Shane Meadow's "Dead Man's Shoes". It's a little masterpiece. Last weekend, I should have seen his "This Is England" instead. Ce sera sera ...
