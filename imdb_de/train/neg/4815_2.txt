Like most of the comments, I saw this movie under the name The Witching, the title of the reissue. Apparently, Necromancy, which is the original, is better, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most Witching scenes still contain most of the Nekromancy scenes, and these are still bad. In many ways, I think the additional nudity of witching has at least some entertainment value! But do not be fooled - there are only 3 scenes of nudity and it is of the people who stand out in diversity. No diabolique rumpy pumpy involved! <br /> <br /> This movie is inherently awful, it's hard to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is awful and straight from the Troma locker. At least Troma is a joker though. This is straightforward boredom embodied. Acting is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora, the obsessed kid in The Innocents, you would believe!), With her shrill, screeching voice the worst. Welles just seems to wait for his paycheck. The other female lead has a scary face, so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust the movie! And the doctor is pretty bad too. He also looks disturbing, like Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It is improperly filmed with scenes that change without cause, and the editing is choppy. This is because the Witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one. Only the lighting is fine. The sound is also terrible and hard to hear with the awesome new soundtrack that never stops. The 'Ghost' mother is also garbage, but the actress is so weirdly bad at acting that she at least brings some unintentional laughter. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie (at least the Witching) is just for the careless. It can not have many sensible fans as it is quite unsurpassable and I found it really impressingly boring! <br /> <br /> The best part was when the credits rolled - enough for this bad excuse for a movie LIKE THE PLAGUE!
