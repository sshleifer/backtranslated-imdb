...... in a horror movie so. Alright, first with Kate. Their main goals include being dressed to the ground by George Clooney, looking good and not least messing up everyone. I have to love her. She had about three amazing chances to finish this sicko, but ..... instead she ran. I mean, she did not want to take Guy out for 10 minutes, and when she did, it was too late. I mean, the guy was trying to rape her. I can not get into those movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean, who would honestly appreciate a man who does anybody she met in one night. The movie kept going. And as a result, all lost its credibility.
