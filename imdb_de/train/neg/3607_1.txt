I start this review with a big giant spoiler for this movie. Do not read on ... here it comes, turn your eyes away! The main heroine, the girl who always survives in other Slasher films, is murdered here. There I saved you just 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of those cheap movies thrown together in the midst of the Slasher era of the 80s. Although the heroine is killed, this is just inferior garbage. <br /> <br /> Both priests and college students get a bad name here. They are portrayed as over-zealous, sociopathic idiots who have far too many internal problems to deal with what looks like a junior college campus ... and the college students are getting worse. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" is If you have nothing better to do, if you have nothing better to do, I suggest you look at your head band, that would be more fun. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gore, obscenity, very brief female nudity and sexual cues. <br /> <br />
