Wow, it's ironic since this movie is out for a while. I think someone else rated him JUST a few days ago. Anyway, I only saw this movie because he has Nick Steel for the record. The movie was ridiculous. The characters drove me insane, they were SO Clich√© and STEREOTYPED. This movie had some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard. It also had too many plot changes. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the movie that is impressive, but the scene is "Warm heart, cold gun", in which Nick Stahl kills the vile girl in the shower. (Well, they were actually disgusting.) But his acting in this scene was excellent. The look on his face reminded me of American Psycho (a good movie). The scene is worth seeing, but not worth watching for the rest of the movie. Do yourself a favor and do not watch the movie.
