When I saw this movie, I could not believe my eyes. Where those funny creatures, garbage cans with big pointed teeth, should be really scary? Or where they had a good laugh (I sincerely hope so). If you look closely, you can even see that the strings are operating (better, drag them across the screen). The whole thing was funnier than scary and I had a good time watching the movie because I was totally surprised that he was not able to do a good job at all. It's a big joke from start to finish, and I think this movie belongs in a new category: so unbelievable that you'll laugh from start to finish. (I will not even try to comment on the drama or all the other things.)
