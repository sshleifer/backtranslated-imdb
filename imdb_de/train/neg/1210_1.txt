Where do I start ... Oh, yes, message to the bad guys: When you first find the person who persecuted you (to kill), as witnesses of a crime you committed, you do not spend any time with it to talk to her another opportunity to get away. Message to the victim: When the thugs talk and argue with each other, take the opportunity to run away, do not sit there and watch them until you make a sound that they hear. Message to the Director: If you have a 5 or 10 minute lead in a vehicle or on foot, you can not immediately catch the bad guys on the heels or on the bumper! Time and movement do not work that way. It would also be nice to believe that a woman does not have to brutally kill (4) men in order to empower themselves to leave an abusive relationship at home.
