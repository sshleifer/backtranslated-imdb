I can not believe that Blockbuster is wearing this movie. It was so bad. I was totally deceived by the box art. NOT BEING FOLLOWED !! It is not worth your time, I promise you. I do not know if the positive reviews for this movie were a joke or what. I am so disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> The description on the back of the box does not even match! The girl who took the voodoo is a stripper, the summary on the back says that she is only 17 die People who write the description for the movie even bothered to look at it! These positive reviews had to be a joke that they just had to do, and if anyone really liked that movie, I lost all faith in humanity /> And do not even teach me the story versus the title, or the fact that the entire movie was shot in two places, or that the cops did not have nearly real uniforms, so why should I say that? Who cares about the cops' uniforms? The uniforms were just right compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all its fans.
