I saw this movie in the cinema many years ago and one thing so negatively surprised me that I could not see any redemptive virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was a cop who never smiles or smiles, while his smile and grin are two his trademarks. Danny Glover was considered the villain, but the imagination of most viewers could not go far enough to believe him in this role. Even Jared Leto was not credible as a former medical student. The tension was simply not there because the killer was known very early. Again, the finale was neither dramatic nor tense: no one cared about what would happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all a disappointing evening in the cinema.
