Mad Magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for it ... but obviously someone had common sense there when the powers that were deprived of celluloid waste ... editing el el crapo, the action is incredibly thin stupid ... and the only reason why it's going to be two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off some clothes and we get a nice chest shot ... I never thought I'd be sorry if Ralph Macchio made the decision In this thing, but I do it ... and I REALLY feel bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, gifted actors who should never be shown in this piece of film ... at least Mr. Leibman had the Cajones refuse to to put his name somewhere in the movie ... and he's coming along ... there are actually copies of this thing with Mad's opening sequence still on it ... If you can find one, sch grab it, because it's probably worth something ... it's the only thing that's worth the movie ... and a note for the people on IMDb.com ... there's no way anyone can spoil this movie. .. the makers have spoiled it by itself ...
