At first, there was nothing in this movie that really grabbed me. It was not a bad movie, just another movie where I said, "Well, that was nothing special," after I saw it. There was probably drama and stuff, but it just did not grab me, it was rather dark. As I said in the headline, it was kind of cheap. The quality of the film itself (the images) looked like a poor quality and reminded me more of a cheap TV movie than a respected English filmmaker. The camera angles and shots were in my opinion very amateurish. Actually had no close-ups or similar effects to create interesting scenes. I have not seen many English films, and the ones I saw did not really impress me, and they looked similar with the camera work, the colors and the like. "Game" tried to be cooler, hip & smart (see my review of "Lola Rennt" if you want), but I did not succeed either. All in all, just a little indifferent film that was nothing special (at best I'm afraid) and was basically wasted over two hours.
