I caught this movie on AZN via cable. It sounded like a good movie, a Japanese "green card". I can not say that I never liked an Asian movie, on the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror movies of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I'm a HUGE fan of John Woo's Hong Kong movies. I'm not being rude to lighthearted movies like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I would like that. Well, I'd rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this cumbersome, malfunctioning movie again and again. <br /> <br /> I think the director Steven Okazaki must have peppered the water with Quaalude, because no one is here. This movie had a personality. And if one of the characters DID tried to act instead of mumbling a mum or two, his performance seemed forced and unbelievably fake. I honestly do not believe anybody had ever acted before ... the ONLY person who sounded real was Brenda Aoki. I find it amazing that this is advertised as a comedy because I did not even laugh. Even more surprising is that the CBS morning news called this a "refreshing touch of comedy." It was neither refreshing nor a touch of comedy. And the end was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things. <br /> <br /> AVOID this movie, unless you want to see a boring, predictable storyline and a wooden game. I actually think that "Spike of Bensonhurst" is a better working movie than this ... and I went half way through this movie!
