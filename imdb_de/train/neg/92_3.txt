Really, I can not believe I spent $ 5 on this movie. I'm a big zombie fanatic and thought the movie could not be that bad. It had zombies, right? I was wrong! To be honest, the movie had its moments ... I thought it was cool when the guy tore off his head, but that's about it. All in all, I think it would be better to push a razor blade into a vinegar tub on my bare Nutsack and then watch that movie again. The movie could have been better if we could see some breasts, but I had to watch the trailers for the other films of this company to see that. Buyers beware ... if you are not in masochism.
