This Hitchcock movie bears little resemblance to his later suspense movies and seems more like a very old-fashioned moral story. A young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy. They spend the money to travel around the world and live a very hedonistic existence. But after some time, the excitement subsides and the couple loses its existence. But out of nowhere, on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything - and in the end become much happier because they value life now! What a strange, stupid and preaching movie! Personally, I want to inherit all the money and find out if I'm feeling sick! <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are relatively poor compared to later productions - a rough movie with poor sound quality and more amateurish acting.
