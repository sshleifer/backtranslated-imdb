I just saw it, and my better half could not believe how horrible and bad it was. If someone else thinks it's good, you have to be happy. I actually gave up one night to look at it, everything was done before. IE. Hostel comes to my mind, but at least that did not shock you with the bad acting and the lack of action, the same old stuff, re-hatched, I read so much about this movie, I even recommended it to my colleagues Someone said it was good! no more bloody, horrified or disgusted than an average "scary movie", you have to say, please do not bother about this movie. Get Mary Poppins. now this is scary! I'm going out now, go to the movies and see something more sinister than that, maybe I miss the sunshine
