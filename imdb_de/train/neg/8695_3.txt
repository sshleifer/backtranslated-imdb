Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress in all the Law and Order ADAs, and her acting is even worse here. Her attempts with a Texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic. Nor can she muster the intense emotions necessary to play the mother of a kidnapped child. Sometimes, while her daughter is missing, she just sounds vaguely annoyed, as if she can not remember where she left her keys. <br /> <br /> This is an important, true story, so it's terrible. The actress's acting is so distracting from the message. The rest of the cast is talented enough, but they can not overcome Rohm's tendency to simply lean on a particularly thick imitation of a southern drawl whenever action is required.
