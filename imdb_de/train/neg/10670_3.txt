Flat characters that do not interest you and will never interest you. Cring-inducing dialogue in places. No twists (they think they have one, but if you do not figure it out in about 40 minutes, you're not too bright). Lots of well-known actors in roles and performances who will happily be forgotten for everyone involved as soon as the credits roll. <br /> <br /> I do not mind if it's slow movies, but they have _somewhere_ go. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> The storyline was not the reason why this movie is playing directly on DVD. This is just a very practical excuse to make a false controversy. The current 37 (!) Ten (10) reviews must come from people who are involved in the production.
