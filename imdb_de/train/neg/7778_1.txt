This must be the cheesiest, dumbest and most delayed monster movie of all time. It is an absolute joke that this even came to the theaters. It's like watching the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This movie deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, be ashamed. The people involved in this stupid garbage pile must be lobotomized. Waiting! Maybe I give them too much credit. I'm sure they were lobotomized before the shoot. How else can one explain the total and sheer stupidity contained in this bucket of manure? Do not spend a minute of your life watching this. Do not even waste your time by sending a review.
