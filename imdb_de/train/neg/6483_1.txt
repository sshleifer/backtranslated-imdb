It was not good The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality came from the memories I had of the previous film, which differed from (or lacked) the "new" personalities. I seriously thought that the opening scene was a nightmare for Ariel because it was so absurd. It was meant seriously. It just reminded me of the annoying characters on the Disney Channel - all are hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes with no real connection. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing part was the terrible songs - not catchy not amazing. In the original, Ariel had an amazing and powerful voice and the entire song is catchy and fun. You remember her and want to sing her. But the songs in this movie were not in the least creative; It's as if they're talking in an annoying sing-song voice - pretty weak, disappointing. I do not feel the need to sing it, as you would normally expect from a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> It's like nobody wanted to make this movie, so they did not try hard. , , This movie would require a new storyline, new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm, without the annoying "look at me! Look at me! I'm so annoying!" Mentality of this generation of Disney. : '(
