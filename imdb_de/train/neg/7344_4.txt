This is the story of a young woman who was seduced by her older, married lover and then released after she became pregnant; she takes revenge with black magic against him and his whole family? Disappointing, she does not do it herself, but someone else did it for her. Good production values ​​for a Thai horror movie. The inconspicuous script, however, never creates tension, the director approaches the material quite conventionally, and the last act loses the sympathy of the viewer for the victims by throwing the logic into the wind. At one point, a character has the best opportunity to simply shoot the belt line dead, and instead she gets up and runs away without picking up the weapon. Bad writing ?? you are deep in yourself! <br /> <br /> Some icky gore effects, including a really tasteless late fetal corpse and a guy who has to die from blowing hundreds of live eels out of his stomach. Only recommended for genre completeists who just have to watch every horror movie in Asia in the last 15 years.
