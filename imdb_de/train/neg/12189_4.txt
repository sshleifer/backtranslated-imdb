I am surprised that this movie is rated so high, even if I would go with the typical grading scale of 71 a c or d. Maybe that's fine, but this movie was just a typical thriller, except boring slow and unrealistic. Not that a typical thriller is realistic, but this seemed to be trying, and yet, the woman who was rapped, has not filed any charges because she did not want to be tried in court, even though she broke the man who hired the man her arm, knocking the crap out of her and raping her for life, but she also protected the lawyer she had feelings for and his family not just random people she did not even know. There were other similar issues with the film that would have been fine if there was some kind of moral that could be taken out of the movie, but the few moral questions as to whether it was right to kill / beat Kady before doing something Illegals did were a bit biased since Kady was just a crazy bastard who focused on revenge so the lawyer was entitled to protect his family since he was waiting for Kady to actually rap his daughter, so he did something legal against it could do something absurd. So I just got more of my life for this stupid movie, so please do not see it, so at least your life has no waist, meaning my 2 1/2 hours or so.
