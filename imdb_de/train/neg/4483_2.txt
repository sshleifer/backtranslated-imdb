I admit that I liked the first one and I really looked forward to the sequel. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. Sure, the special effects were technically amazing - but they were not credible. It looked more like a cartoon. Okay, I admit to like 80% of the chase scene - but the fight with all Mr. Smiths? It was too obviously animated. <br /> <br /> I can accept it all. What I can not accept is that the non-active parts were crap. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew I was giving a speech that lasted forever and meant nothing. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed with the little action that existed. What this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie (except about the existence of the Matrix). This movie was a bit like seeing the episode of DALLAS, in which you realize that the entire last season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ugh! I want to get back my $ 7.00!
