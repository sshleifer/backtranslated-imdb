The plot of 'Edison' was decent, but especially one actor ruined the entire movie. Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the film. He is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and should suffer the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. Squad. <br /> <br /> Whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake has managed to ruin her. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this movie. Do not bother downloading it. Dwarf poros would be a much better choice. <br /> <br /> And Justin, if you read this, stay with the music. Even if you can not do that well, you did a wonderful job in getting people to think you could actually sing.
