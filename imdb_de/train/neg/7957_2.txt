Whoa. In the Twin Cities we have a station that shows a "Big Bad Movie" from Monday to Friday. Today's Nugget was a movie with Carrie Fisher called "She's Back" about a really annoying woman who gets murdered when thugs invade her house. Bea (Beatrice) comes back to pursue her husband. She wants him to take revenge on her killers, so "she's back". And she does not let him rest until he does. She irritates him endlessly ... and also the audience! This movie is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Hey, I like bad movies (my favorite movie is Xanadu). I really shook my head throughout the movie and wondered who thought this was a good idea for a movie. Bea is just so annoying. The plot is stupid; the spectacle is bad; the story ... well, you get my drift. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad movie - really bad movie, look at it. You will not be disappointed. Heh.
