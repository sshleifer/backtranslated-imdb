... especially since Ju-on 2 contains incredible FORTY minute footage that literally comes straight from the first Ju-on - and considering the sequel is only 76 minutes long, you have 36 original minutes. Value of the film. Ho-hum. I found that deeply irritating - as if viewers just would not remember the same thing! - not to mention the boredom, you have to look at it again. <br /> <br /> OK, aside from this complaint, the breeze for Ju-on 2 was that it left many of the unanswered questions from The first movie, which honestly goes beyond 36 minutes, is not that much to understand the intricate plot of the original. <br /> <br /> However, there are some really nice new horror sequences that show how good the movie could have been if it had had some time to develop; and some of the original questions - some but not all - are answered. <br /> <br /> So, in the end - if you liked the first original movie and you want to see some more developments in the story, then keep in mind that you can hold your remote with your finger on the screen for forty minutes Hold the fast forward button in your hand.
