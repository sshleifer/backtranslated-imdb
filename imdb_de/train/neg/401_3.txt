That's what I kept saying in the remarkably awkward third act of this apology for a movie. First of all, the computer effects are absolutely stunning! These computer experts really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie though ... <br /> <br /> None of the characters acts in a realistic way, especially in the above-mentioned, despicable 3rd act (I promise I will not betray him, but trust me I'm not worth a secret!). Many laughter in the film come unintentionally, for example when they try to explain that the eyelids of an invisible man do not work. Please give the audience more recognition! <br /> <br /> Some of the sexual aspects of the movie were interesting. After all, what would you do if you were invisible? Nobody could catch you! These themes were treated much smarter in the 1933 classic The Invisible Man. In particular, a scene of violence is so incredibly ambiguous and will not be mentioned later. If it had paid more attention, the crazy scientist of Kevin Bacon might have made a bit more sense. <br /> <br /> The film would actually be much more successful than a porn because the premise could be done in a unique and interesting way. But this work ... see something else. Or not and live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
