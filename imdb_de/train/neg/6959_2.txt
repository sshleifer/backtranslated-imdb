I looked at it a few days ago and it's hard to forget this movie ... for the wrong reasons. This movie is supposed to be funny, is not a single laugh in the theater (maybe for Jose Garcia and Gerard Depardieu), and it's boring, boring, boring. Sometimes it was even hard to understand what they were saying. They just talk too fast and do not open enough to understand us. I was with a friend and I got caught more than four or five times when I said a line that was supposed to be funny "What, what did he say", and I'm a Frenchman. I hate to say that given the fact that I think that good films are made here, but I apologize in advance for any foreigners who will see the movie (if ever shown outside of France) I'm so sorry for this cr @ p. 2.10
