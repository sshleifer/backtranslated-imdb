Annie's wig does not look good. She's not cute and pretty enough to play Annie. Annie stands out in the movie as her outfits look like Halloween costumes. terrible acting and terrible conspiracies. This movie is such a change from the 1982 version. I think a younger and a smaller girl should have been the main character. Ashley Johnson portrays a very boyish Annie. At least not appealing. At least the casting director got it right with Daddy Warbucks. Mrs. Hannigan was also a Miscast. Camilla Belle played alright Molly. "Warning", this movie could offend your IQ so you only want to show it to little kids. 8 and younger. Some of the actions are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world.
