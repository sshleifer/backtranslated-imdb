CQ could have been good. But it commits the only unforgivable sin: it's b-o-r-i-n-g! The pace is deadly slow and the plot is quite confused and so artificial that it is almost impossible to be interested in where it is going. The story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class given by a thoughtful and sensitive eighth-grader, but this video should have been a warning sign: "ATTENTION: student film, only suitable for the relatives of the filmmaker."
