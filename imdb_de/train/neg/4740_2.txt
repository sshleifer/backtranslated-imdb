I'm so offended by this movie that it's not even funny ... And I thought "Mulan" was amazing! As low as my expectations of Disney are, I never thought they would do anything so stereotypical and yet so outlandish. There is no respect for a true Chinese culture here, just the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that they tried to make Wendy a normal teenage girl ... But fortunately normal teenage girls - especially Asian teenage girls - are of such superficial aspects of Life much less obsessed. And from a cultural point of view, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls packed in popularity and fashion, but they are pretty rare. And even those who are, are pretty decent scientists. Maybe another stereotype, but a pretty true one. Because Chinese parents work that way. This is how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted authenticity, they would have turned Wendy into an ironic girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family. <br /> <br /> This adds to my frustration with American films. Asian culture is not about meditation and vague, nature-oriented sentences that sound smart. We do not go around enigmatically smiling all the time and do not know every form of martial arts. We are a people, and I would appreciate it if someone wrote an Asian part that does not portray us as a sad cartoon.
