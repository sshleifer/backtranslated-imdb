This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was disappointed for two reasons. 1) Maybe it was the fifties morale that talked, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) It was not an android, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. The popularity of the sex doll industry over the next few decades could have been traced back to this episode had done it right. In fact, the modernization of sex bots is in the news as I speak. <br /> <br /> Robots were not news to film and television when this episode was shot, so at least they could have behaved like a different person. Their fleshiness would have added a scary element. Instead, it becomes a beautiful little love story about two people on a distant star. The Twilight Zone has always stretched the imagination and credulity. Normally, nobody cared. But this episode seemed to waver by a Calvinist morality that resulted from a masturbation with a machine or pure negligence.
