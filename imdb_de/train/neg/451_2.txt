I do not care how many nominations this garbage got for the best. I did not know if I turned off the device or filed a lawsuit with O.J. should submit to my mental health due to wrong injury. I was rarely so bored; Calling this manure entertainment is a slap in the face of every moviegoer around the world. The whole story was stupid, the acting was unimaginative, the "drama" was emotionless. I am grateful that I did not have to pay for this unfulfilled experience.
