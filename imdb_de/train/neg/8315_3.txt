What a wasted opportunity to make an interesting film about a complicated topic. It is hardly explored what it really feels like to be a pure (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. The dancers always talk about their art as if it had no erotic component. They may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are indeed sex workers who play out fantasies and sell private sessions that offer more than just dancing. From the film one would get the impression that they appeal above all to the women who go to the gay clubs and then rent the "dancers" for private sessions. Even the recordings in the club only show women in front of the stage and the "dancers" only play with the women in the audience. This is just not the reality of these clubs. It would be quite difficult to live from private dances for women and couples. What do you really feel about your gay admirers and customers? We learn very little. Instead we get fillers. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of just dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes of the drag acts, but does not provide insight into the lives and attitudes of the dancers. <br /> <br /> The pictures of Mexico City are generic. The phallic assembly with sausage roast is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is a totally simple movie that should be interesting only to those who want to see some pictures of pretty boys dancing. The rest of the movie is an insult to gay men.
