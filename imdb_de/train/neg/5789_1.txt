My wife and I really had high hopes for this movie, but it was a big disappointment. It was an American version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who fails everything he tries to do. Fishing, hunting, in an obvious way, he subjects his family to his wild fantasies. His "visions" are not only ridiculous, but he lies to his son many times over various obvious things. Words can not express how bad this movie is. The children and woman are very real, which makes the movie even sadder. I do not understand the humor, unless you want to laugh about other people who make a fool of themselves. I do not understand how that could have come for prizes. Save your money, it's not worth renting it.
