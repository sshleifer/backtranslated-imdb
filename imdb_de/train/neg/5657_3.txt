I'm a big admirer of Lon Chaney, but writing this movie just did not work for me. The story bounces around strangely (I've learned by now that the movie lacks a section), and characters appear and disappear with irritating suddenness. Some of the subtitles are overly explanatory (eg, "Why are you no longer a child!") - for a long, slow beat back to the picture - "You are a woman!" Yes, we did it for the first time), but there are some talking sequences that beg for explanations that never turn up. (Let us hear, please, Luigi and his blonde girlfriend!) The conspiracy that incestuous wishes (in a figurative sense, albeit technically) involve was disturbing, as it was hard to watch them. In the author's opinion, this problem was treated as a problem, and a match between May and December is not presented as the inevitable inevitability of some Mary Pickford films (eg, "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Chaney performs well, as always, but I think he has done better in the past - he has exaggerated it a few times, IMHO. I really enjoyed the clown sequences and was very impressed by the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, if surprisingly young. The movie has its moments, but so far it's my least loved Chaney image.
