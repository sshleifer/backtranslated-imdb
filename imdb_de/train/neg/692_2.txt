Pranks is one of many Slashern, which emerged in the early eighties. Pranks is only notable for an early performance by Daphne Zuniga (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2). Her character dies pretty early, and the rest of the movie is completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> During the Christmas holidays, a group of students volunteers to clean a condemned university building from its furniture. However, a crazy killer throws a key into the work by pushing the adolescents methodically in different, cruel ways. <br /> <br /> Using every stalk 'n' slash clich√© in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow delivers a boring and upbeat horror, where I had to pray for the killing of the characters so I could watch something more valuable , The majority of deaths (which is why we usually watch this type of film) are short and not so bloody; The only truly gruesome imagery comes at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivors (there is a particularly bloody, dismembered corpse that the film could have done more with). <br /> <br /> At the last minute, the film is saved from the shame that I received the lowest possible score from an unexpected downbeat final score, but this is really only for Slasher executors.
