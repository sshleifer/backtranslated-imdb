Student Seduction finds Elizabeth Berkley from Saved By The Bell Alumni on the other side of the desk and draws the attention of young and handsome Corey Sevier. When I speak for myself, I can honestly say that no teacher except me has ever done anything hormonal for me as a student. This was a woman Diaz, who was a music teacher at junior high school. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I could have played in any way from Elizabeth Berkley. Corey is the hotty he is. He is also used to going his own way with women, whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents confirms this belief. He craves chemistry, which Berkley teaches, and to uphold his GPA she agrees with the teacher, but no longer believes. <br /> <br /> If he seeks rape and does not get an answer, it harms his ego. When Berkley leaves the canals and reports the crime to the police, the police officers who are aware of the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau simply do not believe in this. Sevier's parents have the tools they need to get a good ad campaign for their boy. <br /> <br /> Student Seduction, which is a misnomer of a title, if there is any garbage that pollutes all the way. After the beating that Berkley demanded for showgirls, this television movie was not a career climb.
