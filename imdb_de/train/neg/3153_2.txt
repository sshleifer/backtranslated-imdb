I'm a jerk for a good romance, but it does not qualify as good or as romance. I had pinned the plot before the credits were done. With such a bad dialogue, plot and character development, I recommend you invest one and a half hours. I had to rent and rent Serendipity for the third time so I could get that bad taste out of my mouth.
