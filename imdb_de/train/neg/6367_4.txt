This movie has the look and feel of a student movie project. Yes, there are some interesting (though tricky) edits and recordings, but the end result was youthful. <br /> <br /> The director did not seem to say, "Watch this movie." It seemed like he was saying, "Look at me, I'm a director!" <br /> <br /> Thumbs down.
