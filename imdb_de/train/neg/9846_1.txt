You might be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears in it. That would be a mistake. This is one of the most meaningless movies ever made. I've always been waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny is going on in this movie. Even the movie industry realized that this was a very weak movie and did not even try to promote it. It's a miracle it's ever been shown on video. <br /> <br /> I wonder what kind of contract seller has caused to be in this movie. I also wonder why those responsible for this film were allowed to make other bad films. Surely this movie is a waste of the money used to create it and a waste of time when someone looks at it. Surely there are students who would be able to write / produce a film that acts as an act.
