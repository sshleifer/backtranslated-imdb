'SherryBaby' is a rather painful and dirty melodrama playing in jersey. The story of a young mother who is locked up after a drug rape from prison and struggles to stay clean, to find a place in life and, above all, to find herself Her brother's family. The only reason the film should be seen is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career who fits very well into the role and wears the entire movie on her shoulders. However, this is not enough, because the storyline is too simple and to be expected and the emotional emphasis is in the wrong place. I've always wondered if I'm sorry that the ex-and possibly future drug addicts want me to regret Mama as a director and scriptwriter, or about the innocent kid who's in the middle. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting could not convince me that I should not care about the boy anymore.
