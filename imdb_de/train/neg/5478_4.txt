With nothing better to do, I decided to check "Aztec Rex" (as it was billed) for Hell. <br /> <br /> The stupid story would have played better if the dinosaur effects were convincing. They actually looked like animatics (those rough designs that artists use later to end the CGI effects, adding more detail, smoother movements, etc.). Absolutely horrible-looking dinosaurs. That's the only reason you probably want to do this anyway. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor was the beautiful Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl. She maintained my interest; If only the budget had been increased and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. At least, cast and crew had a free trip to Hawaii where the movie was filmed.
