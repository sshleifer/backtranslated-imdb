I loved the show along with millions of others. So I decided on this movie and thought, if not good, it could be a bit dazzling and funny. <br /> <br /> WRONG! All I have to do is ask if Charlie's Angels was really that boring. I do not remember that. But this movie, bad as it may be, had little resemblance to the excitement of that time and show. I have seen everything, despite the negatives it was not unsurpassable. But it was very boring, which I do not blame the actors at all, especially the women who played the angels, because they really looked like that. The movie was just not that interesting. It was tried to make each angel a "character". (An angel is too persistent, one is the "good girl", one is in her husband ....), all the characters were depicted with a key feature that defines them and little depth behind clich√©s. The excitement of the show was missing and the dialogue was ... dialogue. That's pretty much everything. <br /> <br /> Not terrible. Not the worst of TV movies. But misses.
