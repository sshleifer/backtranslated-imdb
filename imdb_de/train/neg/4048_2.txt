Maybe not, but it's terrible. Even the fantastic cast can not save it. OK, I admit, it started out pretty funny, but it seemed like the girls were jumping in the generals' house. Bill Murray turned from a witty, funny guy into an asshole, who started bumping into people on the street who were just not funny, as if he was trying too hard to be funny. His character has stolen a gun (a camper, come on ...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and God knows how many soldiers he brings to death to laugh. A good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and feeble they really are, if unintentionally. I actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda junk could really be released.
