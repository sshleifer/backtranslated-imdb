Koen Wouters is a Flemish singer and presenter. In the early nineties, he also tried out movies. But this incredible piece of trash has finally ended his acting career. It also ended the acting career of Dutch actress Nada van Nie. I actually saw this in a (almost empty) theater because I was a fan of the band of Koen Wouters, Clouseau. I very much regret having spent money on it. It looks cheap, is a terrible story, and is badly executed in every possible way. Some people think it's so bad that it's funny. I am not one of them. I just found it an incredible waste of time and money.
