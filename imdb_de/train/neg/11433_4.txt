The first half of this movie is a real pleasure. Novel. Funny. Wonderful ideas. A close-rooted brother and sister living in Manhattan fall for the same woman! Adult. Bright. Funny. What more could you ask? As a romantic comedy it starts refreshing. It goes into unexplored territory. And then it falls apart. <br /> <br /> It's all about a universal comedy for adults to a coming-out-of-the-closet story that has been done many times. What a disappointment. As a folk movie, it starts with such a promise. Why does it have to turn into such a pedestrian movie "I am who I am". The still shot of Heather Graham jumping in the air to celebrate "her happiness in finding herself" underscores the banality of the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> It could have been different. It could have been magical. It was the same old age.
