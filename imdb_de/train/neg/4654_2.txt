A female vampire kills young women and paints with her blood. She has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so he has to do whatever she commands or turns into a bloodsucker. After a few kills, the assistant feels guilty and falls in love with a homeless girl. What can I say about this movie? That his tempo is too slow, that it has weird sound effects (never a bite sounded so weird) and ambience (new jazz here, I'm coming) and that lights do not seem to be in the set. It looks like an "auteur" horror movie with all the self-sufficiency inside. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid and as you can imagine, the female vampire explains how he kills her, even if she does not have to do it; Of course, crosses, light, garlic and sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> It's not even a funny lousy movie. Some friends and many beers may not have funny sides (to be honest, it's funny in the last 10 to 15 minutes towards the end of the movie). Do not be fooled by the Troma sticker, it's the bad movie they're presenting.
