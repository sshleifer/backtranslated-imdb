This afternoon, when I was home with a little flu, I got into this streak - otherwise I would have missed it. That would probably have been the best. <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good artists - and thought that this would be worth a look. It proved to some extent, but only because it is one of those stories that are so terrible that it fascinates. <br /> <br /> Zoe McLellan only recommends her talent, except for her Jayne Mansfield or Loni Anderson-style bosom. Unfortunately, Mansfield and Anderson are acting in comparison to Garbo or Davis because of their acting skills. <br /> <br /> The young rat's white rat, the owner's cat, the young nut in which the owner was expelled and held back in her own house, and a lot of doophus (including the case of young nuts), running around a biohazard, and the absurd conclusion. I have always waited for at least one scene or action to have at least some degree of realism, credibility, or the ability to evoke empathy / compassion - but this proved futile.
