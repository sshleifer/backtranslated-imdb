Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his films. A mother and a son are secretly moving to a small Indiana town. They are sleepwalkers, feline creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of bruises and special effects; plus evidence of incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is excellent as a mother. Others who pop up are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King came as administrator of the cemetery.
