SICK. really stands for such incredible crappy I killed myself. There was absolutely no acting. The best part of the entire production was the artwork on the cover of the box. The budgeting of this film was sufficient. The filming took place in Sesame Street. The production looks like the underground shooting for mob hits. The props in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. The end was so predictable that you should rewind and laugh for the last 5 minutes. If there is a book for this film, I'm sure it's better. I would avoid that at all costs. I enjoyed the intimate scenes that were worth the whole movie. Was just a joke.
