This is just before a full-fledged Gore festival based on a Stephen King story. Two boulevard reporters, one seasoned (Miguel Ferrer) and one less successful (Julie Entwisle), believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) could actually be a vampire. Stranger than weird, this modern bloodsucker does not move naturally, but seeks its victims with the help of a black Cessna. The Gore actually becomes cruel when the movie approaches its stupid finale. Remember, Mr. King had nothing to do with this movie. I admit that it is a bit scary in the early hours of the night.
