To make a film about the supposed end of the world, there should be some facts and realism. 1. We are never told why these people believe that. 2.Location is New Year's Eve in Toronto, Canada. SO SOME ONE IF I STAY LUNCH AND WHY (based on the costumes) BE LIKE SEPTEMBER 3. The drama was in this neo-au-natural style that needed a director who knew how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. The individual story was all bleak and without purpose. I could go on, but I do not want to make it as boring as the movie. <br /> <br /> rating * 1/2 (out of 4) 2 on IMDB scale <br /> <br /> Thank you as always <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
