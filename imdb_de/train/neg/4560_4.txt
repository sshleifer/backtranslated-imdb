Men In Black 2 was a real disappointment to me. While the actors, especially Smith, have done a pretty good job, there's no cure for a bad script once it's in production. The film really had a kind of "sequel" and played partial events of the first movie. The story was in a word ... bad at best. It was not well thought out and sometimes looked very choppy and incoherent. <br /> <br /> On the first approach, the MIB organization had some kind of "elite" controversy. They had a few special agents, and it had a "secret" feeling. In the sequel, the MIB organization has a JROTC summer camp ambience. <br /> <br /> The movie was not terrible or anything. He simply lacked the "coolness" (lack of a better expression) of the first film. Much of the old humor was recycled from the first to the second time and did not add originality to the MIB universe. <br /> <br /> A perfect analogy would be episode 1 of the first 3 movies. Was it decent? Yes. Is it worthy to wear the title? Not really.
