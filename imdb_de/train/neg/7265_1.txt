I saw it at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it, unless you have sleep problems. It's a movie full of pretensions - it starts with a little quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and it all goes downhill. Camerawork - Imagine a kid trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Story - Smokey Robinson and the Wonders "The love I saw in you was just a mirage" was extended from 3 minutes to over 2 hours, but full of repetitions. Because of dull pain, this film ranks with the benches in the Methodist church to which my parents dragged me as a child. I want 2+ hours of my life to be refunded. Julian Hernandez 'promoter put the comment before the commentary, the film is "controversial" - this is only true for the narcotic effect of the film.
