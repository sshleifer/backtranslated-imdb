Let me tell you something about this movie. I saw it twice. The first time I was a kid and the movie was pretty entertaining to me. I really want it. I found it funny and interesting and the main character was kinda cool. <br /> <br /> I saw it again a few days ago. It was terrible. Really. I do not know why I used to think it was funny, but now ... I did not laugh at all. It was not even entertaining. It was just stupid. The story was weak. The acting was nothing special. There are great actors in this film, but acting is mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The worst part is the fact that this movie is racist. Really. Do not get me wrong, usually I do not complain about racism in movies. However, I've seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like "The Shaolin Temple" or the fact that the only black man in "The Street Fighter" is one of the bad guys or ... Whatever , You get the point. There are people everywhere who see racism. I wonder how they would react to a movie like "The Meteor Man". Why? I will tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. There are no whites among the good guys. In fact, there is only one white man in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys. All the good guys are African Americans. Do not get me wrong, I do not care if the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What interests me is the fact that we can hardly see a white guy in this movie. This is the only movie I have ever seen. It's just not realistic. If there is only one black guy in a Japanese movie, which is the case with "The Street Fighter", there is no problem - most people in Japan are Asian. But if there is only one white man in an American movie, there is a problem - in the US, most people are white. It's like filming a Japanese movie with only a white cast and only an Asian villain. Only not real. <br /> <br /> That's it. I give the movie the rate of 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I did not have fun with it as a kid.
