The only reason I remember this movie is that it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money. I was 17 years old and my friend was 18 years old. We were old when action movies were our thing the most (ok, the second most). We left home so insulted that we wanted our money back, but time could never be regained. <br /> <br /> The cut killed this movie. As the truck is attacked with rocket launchers by more and more vehicles, the film offends the audience's intelligence by shooting these vicious villains in 4x4 VW bugs with rockets at the truck. Please, missiles of a truck known to carry plutonium? Worse still, these VWs get 15-18 shots from a 4-rocket launcher. One would see on VW with 4 rockets as 2 of them are fired, the truck is turned over with the last one attached, one second later with two missiles attached, come back one more, then go in front of the truck and now it is full set of 4 rockets. <br /> <br /> We hounded it hard on a big goal that never happened. It looks as if the money runs out and stops. <br /> <br /> Just ridiculous.
