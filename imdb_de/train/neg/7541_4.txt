big puzzle, but the film goes downhill from there. The beginning is promising with a car crash and a wife and daughter burned alive in front of a cop Edward. He is traumatized about it and sees pills popping. A mysterious letter appears from an old friend who asks for help in finding her missing daughter. So Ed travels to an island community made up mainly of women. They do not like outsiders. It is shown a lot of filler with Ed as he searches for the girl in the city. That made the movie too long. In the end, it gets a little better when we hear about the mad rituals of the woman, and finally the sinister plan that Edward expects. <br /> <br /> Overall, no well-written story and too long. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: I would skip that.
