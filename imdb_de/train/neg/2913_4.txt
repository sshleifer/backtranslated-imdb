Of course, it's great to see improvements in the Turkish film industry, but I would have expected something more creative from Togan Gokbakar. Based on the script that I believe was not written wisely, as some say. especially the cheesiness of the dialogues, which put the audience in a position as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations, which makes the film mostly unbearable. it also has an obvious end; You can easily guess the killer from the beginning. The weakest part of the scenario is that it is difficult for mentally ill patients to behave like normal people, like professionals straight away !!! Have you ever looked for the possibility of patients who are in severe medical conditions to behave like professionals and use them all? The medical terms that even ordinary people can not use ????? !!!!!! Also in the scene where employees searched for the most dangerous patient, without any weapon to protect themselves, another strange point of the film was. and this scene was so well suited for the title "Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir" !! These are not the only weak parts of the movie. There were also many precision in the film. The portrayal of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy of Hannibal. Also, the appearance of Togan in the end is obviously the worst mistake he could have made in his first movie! The noise about the size of the movie and the interviews the actor gave made people just curious and compelled to see them. Gene is a total disappointment. I would wonder if Sahan was not so famous, would Togan be able to record this movie with so much budget? I hope Togan realizes that playing a role as a director is out of fashion, as he said in an interview. It was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Shyamalan continued it successfully! he should be aware of the fact that he is not yet Hitchcock or Shyamalan !!!! hoping that next time he will be more cautious and creative in this big industry!
