Oh my dear! Rarely has a "horror movie" made me so boring or made me laugh like this. After a spirited start with a fascinating premise, there is nothing much further than a Slasher movie with some supernatural and sexual aspects. The usually excellent Alice Krige is wasted in this case, and the plots of the plot are ridiculous. Do not bother unless you are really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
