Shortly after seeing this movie, I questioned the mental competence of all actors and actresses who accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a commendable actress. Why should she take such an overrated opportunity? However, I have to give credit where credit is due. Few moments in the film were unpredictable and quite captivating, but they barely made up for the biting perverted tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character Sebastian Caine. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman, who has any kind of self-respect.
