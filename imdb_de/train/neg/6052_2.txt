Despite its shortcomings, I enjoyed "Cigarette Burns," John Carpenter's first season in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story seemed like a cheap cross between IN THE MOUTH of MADNESS and 8MM, but was still pretty good for the budget and time constraints. With "Pro-Life", however, the low budget and time constraints definitely prove more than anything else. There is solid direction as always by Carpenter, but there is a quality in writing and in the entire production itself that gives the feeling that it was made in total and total hurry. The script is not always clear, the message is fuzzy, and the story is full of holes when you look back at it. If Carpenter had rewritten the script, it might have been a worthwhile episode. Instead, it's a mess that only hardcore Carpenter fans will enjoy. Definitely the worst Carpenter ever made. 2.10
