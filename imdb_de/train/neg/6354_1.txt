Woody Allen has lost his ability to write dialogues or characters that are significantly different. This is the case with "Melinda and Melinda," in which all characters speak of Allen's generic pseudo-sophistication and have problems and points of view that can not be found for anyone outside a four-block radius where Allen lives. They also share the strange condition that they can afford multi-million dollar Manhattan apartments that seem to have been designed by professional decorators, regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living. <br /> <br /> The only character outside of this boring mindset is Will Ferrel as a mandatory replacement for Woody Allen. Although he does not just make a Woody Allen impression (like Kenneth Branagh in the dreadful "Celebrity"), Ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that the real Woody had when he himself played the part in his best films. <br /> <br /> The end result is another result of a series of self-indulgent drilling by a once great filmmaker who has been trading on his previous reputation for years.
