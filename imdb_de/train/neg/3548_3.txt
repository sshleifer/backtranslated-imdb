For those who like depressive movies with dark characters and a dirty plot, this one is for you! From the somber atmosphere of New York City, which appears to be a bleak and almost hopeless place, to two different main characters with no sense of morality, this film is a real downer. <br /> <br /> Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at the time that Hollywood had the freedom to show what it wanted when all the codes of morality were abandoned, celebrating that fact , The filmmakers were then like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited account in the local candy store. Hollywood gave the theatrical audience (probably for the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, childrens nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds that only her twisted brain found attractive ... and then excellent work. <br /> <br /> It also hoped to shock the mainstream crowd. Well, it has succeeded on this level. The audience was stunned by what they said and heard, and the academy, proud of itself because it was able to show dirt and make money at the same time, could not help but glorify that gilded trash. <br /> <br Forty years ago, as a very young man, I also found this film fascinating. When I saw it again in the 1990s, I left such a bad taste in my mouth that I never saw again. <br /> <br /> The show was good, but what's up? Acting is good in many films. Nobody ever said that Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight could not act. Hoffman was especially good at playing young people at a young age. He was a bit like the Johnny Depp of his era, he played in this movie guys like "Ratso Rizzo" and later became the "Rain Man". Yes, "Ratso" is a character you will never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is one that you want to forget, but the story is so shabby that it overwhelms the good acting. <br /> <br /> This movie is not "art" and does not deserve many awards. She did not lift the envelope until 1969, which is why he loves to be remembered in the hearts of movie people and critics. It's two hours of profanity and ultra-left, religious low-cost, crazy crazy (Andy Warhol is even there - no surprise) and generally despicable people. <br /> <br /> I liked the catchy song Everybody's Talking, which made Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was wrong because Fred Neil wrote and sang the song better before Nilsson did it. and few people have ever heard of Neil (what their loss is). And - as mentioned - the name "Ratso Rizzo" stays with you! <br /> <br /> The movie is a milestone, but in a negative sense I'm afraid: this marks Hollywood as "officially" going down the toilet, and since then it has stayed in the sewers.
