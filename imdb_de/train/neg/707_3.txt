"Feast of all saints?" From where...? When ...? <br /> <br /> Have the story and theme of all the feasts of all saints been cut out? <br /> <br /> What a waste of a wonderful title! There is never anything in history that has the remotest connection to the "Feast of All Saints". There is also nothing in the story about "All Souls Day" to which the term refers. Why should you use this title if you never intend to record an action or theme about "All Souls Day" or the "Feast of All Saints"? <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad script & amateur writing <br /> <br /> How did you attract so much talent for this Klunker? The writing is such that amateurs - characters who have known each other all their lives - speak in big, long speeches about their life story for the benefit of the public. Not at all, as people talk to each other. <br /> <br /> What was the director? <br /> <br /> The director is just as bad! The forced and overly targeted style feels amateurish. In one scene, a character calls "Take your hands off of me" and NO touches him! However, the worst-looking scene is the incredibly exaggerated fight scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Excessive Gore in a very fake, silly fight scene <br /> <br /> There are so many dead in the scene with the most fake battles. It looks like a Saturday Night Live Sketch !! You can see extras waiting for their hints to go through the camera. Everyone plays their death scene like the boys of the 4th grade - exaggerates every little gasp and twitch. The blood of the victims is so exaggeratedly and carelessly applied that it looks as if someone had used a ketchup dispenser and just sprayed red lines on the costumes cheesy war movie. They almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride a horse and deliver the punchline. Who would ever behave like that in real life ?! <br /> <br /> The most ludicrous piece of writing, directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene: A little girl stands under the corpse of her hanging father - he is terribly mutilated and literally squirts blood from his gaping wounds. Even a total idiot would know that he is dead! Nevertheless, she keeps repeating - very monotonous - "Daddy, Daddy ..." while watching someone outside the screen. She provided it with as much credibility and passion as one would expect from a non-actor child who had repeated the camera all day for the cameras. <br /> <br /> Even though the poor kid had acting skills, the scene is absolutely incredible. The little girl would not be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of slaughter, surrounded by hundreds of corpses, while standing still! Natural instincts would have screamed and frightened the child and run away from the bloody carnage! <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to be horrified or laugh ...?! <br /> <br /> One particularly silly detail that gives the scene a SNL satire tone is the father, who has a huge hook through his mouth and cheek. He looks like a fish on the hook! The unintentionally funny details make the whole scene seem unreal and stupid. <br /> <br /> In Fantasy La La Land, mothers and daughters are the same age! <br /> <br /> Another funny detail is that at the end of the scene and in the next scene, which occurs more than 20 years later, a central figure - the little girl's mother - is about to be seen! She is still young and beautiful and now as old as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost switched off the movie right away because the direction and the writing were obviously terrible - but I tried to get through because I wanted to see the Louisiana settings and I like all the actors. I do not know what these good actors thought when they took on these roles. Who was the target audience? Excessive amount of blood and ill-traded violence in the US The opening scene is not quite right with the following tone of the soap opera. It's also a strange way to start a movie that is focused on romance-reading women for the rest of the time. Strange inconsistency in the tone!
