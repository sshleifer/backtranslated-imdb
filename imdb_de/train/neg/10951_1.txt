I have no idea what idiots gave this movie a Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was cruel! I was actually watching the whole thing just because I could not believe someone would make such a worthless movie. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are without depth and there is no attempt to create an ambience with music or sound effects. If you decide to waste two hours of your life watching this movie, you should definitely bring something with you, because cinematography is someone who walks around with a handheld camcorder, see the main topics. This style has been used much more successfully in films like "Blair Witch" because it creates suspense. In Rosetta there is no conspiracy and no tension that would give this style something. I should have known better when it started at 2am that it would be terrible.
