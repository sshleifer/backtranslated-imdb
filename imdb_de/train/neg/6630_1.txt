This so-called remake is terrible. I looked at it tonight ... on the first day, because the anticipation and the hype were too much for me. But within the first half hour, we knew this was a disaster. It not only does not fit the created hype, but also offends the original blockbuster. The script had loopholes, the editing was messy a few times. Mohanlal, a great actor, did a good job. Amitabh was fine. The director wanted to show how evil his character is, but he had gone overboard a bit, which made him powerful. Ajay, who is particularly smooth in such roles, was also a disappointment. Let's not even start with the new guy Prashant. You would not be proud to start a career with something like this. Rajpal Yadav, who was thrown for a few laughs, could not even smile because of his powerful humor and shrill voice. Nisha Kothari has proven to be one of the worst actresses we have today. All in all, RGV, which I thought was one of the most talented and talented directors India ever had ... has failed miserably. He took such a great challenge and responsibility to make the best Hindi movie of all time, and made a mess of it.
