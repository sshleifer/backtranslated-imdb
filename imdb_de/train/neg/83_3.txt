Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture) is an attractive, nice woman who is overpowered by a teenage daughter Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a small, two-time husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), were boringly self-centered and vile. <br /> <br /> This was advertised as a troubled family being persecuted by a mad killer during a relentless storm. <br /> <br /> The storm is just over the last 5 minutes of the movie, and then it's no good running someone into the storm cellar. <br /> <br /> The stalking will not be intense until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie we spend listening to Jill and her unbearable daughter Liv quarrel until I want to beat her daughter back to the next week. <br /> <br /> Jill's problem with Liv She has dealt with Zack, a boy of questionable character, and they keep on their way - in fact, Jill comes home to find them on Liv's bed. The rest of the time we listen to Jang's husband Sean, either complaining or criticizing her. Sean was not appealing at all - since his face is so full of freckles that you could tie the dots together. The story begins with Jill being notified of a pending bill on her credit card for a hotel she has never been to and that she thought Sean had never been there either. <br /> <br /> Jill goes to the hotel where she meets owner and manager Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, elderly, divorced man who sympathizes with her. When he sees her husband there, he calls Jill and gives her away. <br /> <br /> Jill returns to the hotel and sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, leaves without Sean seeing her, and does absolutely nothing. In fact, she does not even tell Sean when he gets home. That did not make sense to me. Jill gave Richard her business card and so he calls her and she seems to be in real estate. She shows him an apartment. After that, they drink something, and it gets cozy between the two. <br /> <br /> Richard and Jill get it hot and violent. In fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary when Jill suddenly decides to quit the game. <br /> <br /> Jill and Sean have a confrontation with his scam. Sean whines about how Jill has failed him since her father's death. Apparently his lack of morality is all their fault. At some point, Jill admits that Sean has no morality and almost adultery - and of course that's her fault as far as Sean is concerned. <br /> <br /> The little family decides to go on a camping trip. -What more means moaning and rumbling among them, especially from the spoiled daughter. <br /> <br /> I was so rooted that the stalker got everyone, but Jill. <br /> <br /> 3 stars
