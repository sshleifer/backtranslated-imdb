This was a funny movie. It started pretty well. A solid soundtrack behind flash images of Gore and Chaos when our psychopath did his thing. Next comes his downfall. Here I could say that I had a really cheesy "B" movie. Bad action, I mean, how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? These guys could not. After the death scene of our psychopath, we get the opening balance and the movie starts ... <br /> <br /> From that point, it's bad, big boobs, the occasional bucket of blood and badly made death scenes means, I have given the film four, because he has saved a kind of horror despite his shortcomings, which I just could not shake off. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie but I have to admit that I got worse.
