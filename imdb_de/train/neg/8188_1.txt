The most ludicrous thing about this ridiculous film is the idea that when you become a saint, he or she and his or her family and his or her other significant other person will live forever. Forgetting that the saint must be dead to become a saint, and the saints have no significant others. That Nick has been the funny elf of Fred Scrooge for a millennium is never suggested! Open up to Nick, who learns how to make toys, and then to Fred, how he runs numbers. Nick, who gives a sick child a dolly, Fred takes the dolly back together with the family farm! After a few more episodes, today's Fred turned into sibling Anonymous while his colleagues nod of empathy. There I just wrote a more coherent story than this idiocy! <br /> <br /> This Santa Claus, one ho, ho, ho, ho, ho "from a massive coronary, is a neurotic wuss caliper the queen of harpies, an operation straight from the mega-mall Hell, and answers a board (huh?) that gave the easter bunny his pink egg. Oh, and his right hand is a dull blonde in a skintight mini dress and go-go boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> But what really got me over the edge was that Slam was named # 1 on the list of Frechen. Should not a naughty list be reserved for future Hitler's and Stalin's? Children, who are the true incarnations of evil? No, Old Sausage-Fingers, a good boy who evades because he is unwanted and unloved, is the demon core! <br /> <br /> The Nimrods behind Fred Claus should be cooked in their own pudding! Bah!
