This movie is self-complacent garbage. Watch this movie if you just want to hear spoken Gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack. Look for another reason and you will be disappointed. It should be charming, but it is not - it's just irritating. The characters are hard to take care of and the acting is bad. The stories in the film are also without charm and scary. I was expecting a heart-warming family movie, but my 14-year-old daughter had not addressed that either. It's rare that I can not see through a movie until graduation, but it has made us both better. <br /> <br /> Although the film is playing in the current time, it looks like a cheap East European movie from the Cold War. There are not even enough beautiful Scottish landscapes and movies to save them. A real shame, because as a film that is embarrassing for Scotland.
