A good cast (with one big exception) is pushed through Epstein's Smart Light satire. Mansfield has never been better or funnier than she is here with Walston, a veteran determined to become a Congressman to end the war. He and his buddies - including polite fellow campaigner Grant - head to San Francisco and embark on the city's spirited party as they decide to escape service through industry speach tours. The only thing not quite pleasing about this movie is Suzy Parker's one-note performance as Grant's love interest, which takes too much time and slows the pace in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry. The trick is that she's set on loving every soldier (of course, to fulfill her duty for the war effort), but he's a married man who still loves his wife. They steal the film with little effort from Grant (who is amused here in the first part of the movie when he is not paired with his non-actor co-star).
