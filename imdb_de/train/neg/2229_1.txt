Maybe that's not fair because I only made half of the movie. One of the few films that I could not actually see because of lameness. <br /> <br /> The acting is awful, the camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy. For example - during a coke deal, the Coke is simply kept in a briefcase - I'm not an expert, but I think people usually pack it in a bag. <br /> <br /> They use the same stupid sound effect whenever a blow is triggered (it's the exaggerated 'crunching' sound) and they use toy pistols with synchronized sound effects. <br /> <br /> Worst movie of all times.
