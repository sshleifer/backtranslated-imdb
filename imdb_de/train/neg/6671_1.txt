I felt that this movie started well. The acting was just right and I felt the situation of all the characters, although the true family unit was not fully revealed. We have never received enough information about the Father to truly perceive His pain for all His commitment or building His hostility with Tobe. I mean, in one scene you can see him admiring her for tension, and in another scene he's just taking off his head. Another problem with the movie was that it was simply riddled and eventually lost all focus, and I begged the movie to be over. Any movie with such a lengthy and painful ending should never receive an automatic rating of 7 or higher, just for acting. We consider the overall quality of the movie experience. In the case of this film, the end is so bad that I seriously thought about just leaving the theater. This movie pulled me in, then he simply spat me out.
