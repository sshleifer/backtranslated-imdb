This movie has some of the worst acts I have ever seen! Some scenes are as original as the nails that come through the floor. This nail trap gets these bad guys. The rest of the movie decreases with time. I can not believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time. I also can not believe that there are sequels! The next crap movie I want to see is R.O.T.O.R. Could R.O.T.O.R really be much worse than this? <br /> <br />
