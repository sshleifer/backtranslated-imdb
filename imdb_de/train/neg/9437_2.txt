I've never really considered myself "student" when it comes to watching movies. I look at it, form an opinion and that's it. But Unhinged changed all that. This film is without a doubt the most inappropriate attempt to make films that I have ever seen. Any child who is shocked at the university and believes that he or she is the next Spielberg or Tarantino must submit the film along with a handbook titled "How not to Make a Movie". Not only is there no story, the filmmakers were not even competent enough to make a film that is impressive. It's been a while since I saw it, but I can only say how to watch the overhead tracking shots in the opening scenes. They never stop! It's almost like having your teeth pulled, just not so much fun.
