In this extremely cheap budget (I've seen home movies with better production value) that have been signed by Australian films like "The Burning" and "Friday the 13th", a band is planning to shoot a music video on a houseboat. They are being pursued by a serial killer who was burned years ago. This movie is even referred to as the "worst Australian movie of all time" in its DVD promotional material. That's just a selling point! Complete and total garbage in every way. Maybe a few giggles here and there for bad movie lovers, but I still wanted to burn my retina. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a short flash of barely existing small tits in a lame shower scene br /> <br /> My Note: F
