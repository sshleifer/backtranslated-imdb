Although the film is in an Ivy League college, it was actually filmed entirely in Northern Arizona, mainly at the Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I was in the theater department and most of the extras Theater department. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely ridiculous scene in this movie (if you know your geography of Arizona), where several members of the cast cycling from college to a creek are shown. We NAU''ers know that the campus and the creek (Actually Oak Creek Canyon) are about 60 km apart. While the ride there is downhill, it would be literally IMPOSSIBLE to cycle on the same road!
