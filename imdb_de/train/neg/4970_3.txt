Good people, I stumbled upon this movie that evening as I sorted the papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has ever earned the genre as it deserves. The Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I've ever seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This sci-fi version ranks with the Christopher Lambert version. Yuck. <br /> <br /> What did not I like? CGI for one. Amazingly bad. Even more important is the fidelity of the plot, not to mention the stilted acting. I'm used to both versions I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Delighted director, Peter
