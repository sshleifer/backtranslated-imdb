I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I was looking forward to it. I was fascinated by the company's pre-hype descriptions, its tight submarine style, and its harsh technology compared to the treks we're used to. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything interesting in this pilot. I found the plot confused and confusing. <br /> <br /> I admit that I liked some character developments - entertaining people as a "youthful" species willing to overcome their brothers. <br /> <br /> And the volcanic baby had an incredible rack. <br /> <br /> But I do not think I'll be excited about this series. <br /> <br /> 3/10
