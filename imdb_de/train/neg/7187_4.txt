Here we go with other Slasher movies, good-looking people and actors of all was really good! <br /> <br /> Few children play pranks, make phone calls, and kill parents from the killer in front of the children! 20 years after they are friends, they go into a huge house, have fun, drugs and sex (no nudity) for at least half an hour of the movie! Again they start talking about pranks! and then the killer comes back, kills them one by one and the killer is in BIG BLACK COAT with the ax just like the Urban Legend movie A nice Slasher movie in this part would make 7/10, but made the turn at the end of the movie the whole movie somehow meaningless. <br /> <br /> The phrase brought the movie to a close for me, so I'll give it 4/10
