I had to watch the movie for my work, so I did not pay for it (on the contrary, I got paid), but I still found the film above average. The jokes were lame, the two leading actresses ... Well, to use the "First Wives Club" division of the women's ages in Hollywood, they are no longer in their "hot chick" age, but rather in their "district attorney". What annoyed me most about the movie was the main plot that almost completely plagiarized "Beavis & Butthead Do America" ​​(in which the guys are all jazzed over a guy who offers them money, "money for his wife"). to do it without her realizing it is expected to murder her). All in all, a mild crap.
