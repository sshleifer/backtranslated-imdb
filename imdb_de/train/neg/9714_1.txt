I hate this program: Not only is the concept ridiculous, but it is also very hard to implement (something that was not taken into account by similar "I confess" endeavors like Muder: She Wrote). <br /> <br /> Sigh Why can not the authors in this program be intelligent enough to provide evidence that they would make a decision in court? <br /> <br /> Come: After X number of years of unresolved cases, why does ANY SUSPECT, EVERY EPISODE * (damn it!) have to confess to a murder that would otherwise remain unsolved? , shucks, Officer, you are a smart man. If you've discovered enough to convince yourself that I did, then I can admit it and make it easier for you in court. What can I say? fair cop. "<br /> <br /> Absolute dog and insult to those of us with enough brain to even hear from IQ
