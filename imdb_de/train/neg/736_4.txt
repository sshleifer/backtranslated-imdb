Twenty years ago, five-year-old boy Michael Hawthorne saw his father kill his mother with an ax in an empty street and later commit suicide. Today, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend the Halloween with his grandparents on the farm in the country. He asks his friends to wear costumes that are their greatest innermost fear, and together with his Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon) they would perform an ancient Indian celebration with the carved wooden doll Morty (Jon Fedele) to eliminate their fears forever. The biggest fear of Michael is becoming a serial killer like his father, but something goes awry and Morty becomes his father and kills his friends. <br /> <br /> "The Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and pointless blow A film that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest inmost fear of every friend before it grows, but in a messy script full of clich√©s. There are some exaggerated performances, such as Mrs. Betsy Palmer; others are very weak, but in general the action is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to life; Although surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or grief when each of them dies. The slow pace over more than fifty minutes could have been used to build a more dramatic situation. At the very end Michael shows a charm that his father was interested in, which I did not notice in the story. I do not know if the previous reference in the DVD released in Brazil was processed with a running time of 87 minutes. The special effects are very reasonable for a B-movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: A Night of Halloween")
