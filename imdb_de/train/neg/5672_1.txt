I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The best buy factor for the DVD is the short movie with bonus features. My voice for this movie is a big, fat ZERO. Do not misunderstand, I'm a horror girl. but I want some meat behind the story, not to mention I prefer the evil that happens to humans, and not to be tempted to look, as it seemed, to be eternally long clips of animal snuff. Brutality acts interrupt painfully long silence and bad action. If I was forced to make a comparison with another film, I can only think of the Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, pointless and a completely uncomfortable watch.
