!!!!! Of course there are spoilers !!!!! I am sure that this project started with a screen writing workshop to avoid clichés in horror movies: Protagonist - Check Bad Things Happen Drug Users - Check Heorine Beats Down Villain - Check Heroine does not notice that villain recovers unconsciousness - Check Frame the Sequence So Unfortunately, it seems that someone has sent this cliché list to a movie studio instead of using it for class. Dear oh dear, if only the London transport were as regular as the clichés that appear here. In fact, there are so many clichés and it has all seen before the moments that no one has actually thought about what the crawl of the same name is or how long he has killed people in the subway. I think it's the result of a human experiment, and maybe that night he decided to take revenge on humanity, but all this is so vague that it's meaningless. Not to be totally negative The producers thought they were making a movie that would sweep the Oscars this year, and there's always a horror movie market. I also doubt if the price is too expensive and has an eye on the DVD market and not on the cinema distributor. I'll say it's a little better than the 1972 DEATH LINE, which also hid a murderous cannibal on the London Underground. It's just that if you think all the clichés in this movie have been used up, another cliche comes to lifting his ugly head
