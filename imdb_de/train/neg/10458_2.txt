I went into this movie with the expectation, from the hype that it would be enlightening and uplifting. Certainly more than a cheap promotional item for the band "Wilco". Instead, we get a lot of moping and whining about "the trial," a dishonest and certainly one-sided portrayal of a band member driven out by the prima donna singer / songwriter, a disturbing confession of the fallen friend's for over 18 years, stating that "the friendship took its course" and this whiny, unaffected story about how to make a record label "hurt their feelings" by dumping them, just so the band could get 50 quotes from other labels right away (oh, the tension. .. not!) They tried their best to make it look like a burden, but I suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to create a tragedy that did not exist. Not even the long stretches are taken into account, where many of their latest songs with no story, insights or a decent job in cinematography come on us. The tense attempts of emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life have made me sick. <br /> <br /> From the movie, this band sounds like a bunch of bad little babies poking around to find a voice they can not find and think they are a kind of guardian of the art of music, what they are definitely not. And I found the music bad and I could not even understand the lyrics because of the singer's mumbling style. <br /> <br /> I'll give her a 2/10.
