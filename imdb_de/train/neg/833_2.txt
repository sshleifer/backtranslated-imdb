There was really no big story in this movie. It was loosely based on the events of the first Lion King movie. It should be how Timon and Pumbaa met through their loneliness. But there is not much more than that. <br /> <br /> Some scenes from the original are mixed, then it is discussed how this film has changed them a bit. But is that it? I was hoping for something more. All I have to show is an empty plot with little explanation. If you wanted to see other meerkats in the Lion King universe, this is the case. Apart from that, it does not do the animators justice. Disney should really stop these direct-to-video productions. It was really boring and could have used Jason Statham. "D-"
