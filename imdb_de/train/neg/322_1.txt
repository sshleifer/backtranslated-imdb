I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it is still in me today. I was fully aware of how awful it should be, so I blame myself only. But like most, I did not believe in negativity. As a Sandler fan, it seemed unthinkable that one of his films could really be that bad. I thought it was just Sandler haters. I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a comedy that does not even contain 1 second of anything funny. That's actually an achievement. You might think in a 90-minute comedy that you might accidentally come across something that was amusing even from a distance. But no, it's just awful. It's not "that bad, it's good," it's just bad. You can not laugh about how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you laugh, but they never come. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the movie The Ring? Where do people watch videotape and die 7 days later? If this movie were on the videotape, people would die by themselves, and there would be a smile on their faces when they realize their agony is over. > <br /> You are welcome to see it, just to see how bad it is and not to restrain your curiosity. Do not please do not. Trust me, I'll do you a favor. There are two types of people in the world, those who think that Going Overboard is the worst film ever made, and those who have not seen it yet.
