Andy Lau plays in another police submerged. Daniel Wu plays Nick, who works for the police and is also close to the head of a drug trafficking gang (Lau). The movie begins as we watch the police try to make a drug addiction just to see it break. Then we are introduced to the young, drug addicted mother and her daughter, who lives near Nick, as well as to his cronies and the bull. After 45 minutes I turned off the movie and posted the news. Well played and great to look at, a movie is so unshakeable as I have not seen it in a long time. It's not bad as such, it's just that you really do not care. I mean, I did not really care. I actually started doing something else that I completely forgot when I had a subtitle movie. I wish I could have hated the movie, but the movie is such a nothing that it almost did not impress me (it's not even something I could have slept to ignore). Come on the box called it the Chinese scar, what was after he was dead? This is one to avoid.
