Impressive! I remember so many horrible movies loosely about high school in the early 1980s. They usually had an incredibly tense plot and many 27-year-old actors posing as students. When I saw this movie, I felt a bit of nostalgia when I grew up in the 1980s. Then I find out that this movie was made in 1989? Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, that's just awful. The action prepares the city for the closure of a high school and threatens to take all students to the inner-city gymnasiums. Which is strange, since the students of this school are both rich and rich. In fact, the main character lives in a villa. They are surprised that they can not find any money to keep this school alive. Have you never heard of property taxes? Oh, but here's the kicker. The school board says they will keep the school alive if students can raise $ 200,000. The seniors do that. Hmmm, you're raising $ 200,000, but instead of saving that for college, are you heading to the rescue of high school where you're a senior? And why should they close a crowded school before the year is up? And ... ahh forget it, this movie was stupid and was made in 1989!?
