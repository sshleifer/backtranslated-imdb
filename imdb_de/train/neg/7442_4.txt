Sorry, this movie did not scare me, it just annoyed me. It was just so frustrating when I saw the potential and it all fell by the wayside. The children! The father! The premonition! Had so much potential and Ziltch! zero, nada! I have heard everything before. Creepy! No! I can scare myself alone where I'm sitting, as it would be possible in the movie. Are there any men who write this figure that women should be so annoying? Huh This movie was very atmospheric. Or at least it could have been if the director / writer had done the work. We could have had good music, which would have increased the suspense, if someone had taken the trouble. What I really want to know is why they get the money? Just give it to me and save all the trouble. Leaving? ... no, we were betrayed
