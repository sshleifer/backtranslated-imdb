Kid, who was found in the trash as a baby and raised at a martial arts academy, has a knack for submerging baskets. With the help of the man who found him, he goes to college and is promoted to mastery while looking for his real parents. An infinitely better piece of action comedy is a total mess. It seems like a brighter basketball version of Shaolin Soccer, but the comedy is Scatter Shot, her focus is more than a Chihuahua with ADD on quadruple espresso. I kept asking "What am I watching?" I have seen it from start to finish and still do not know what the hell happened. It's a shame, as there are some great action scenes, some funny jokes and occasional moments, but nothing, none of that comes together, I would take a pass.
