When you watch this movie, you hold a grudge against the cinema, the director, the producers, the actors and the person who asked you to watch the movie! Be ashamed, Sarah Michelle Geller, for giving your name and face to this poor excuse for a movie. It might have been scary if the Japanese actors had simply spoken in Japanese instead of trying to "act" in English. I wanted to boo when the movie was over ... a real disappointment after all the hype on television and the movie trailers promoting this lame money maker. Sarah Michelle really did not have to act to shoot this movie ... She just practiced her frown. Do not waste time and money on this movie.
