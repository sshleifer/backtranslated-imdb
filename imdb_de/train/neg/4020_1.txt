I will never be a member of any club that has me, especially this one. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is a single mother / stripper who is attacked by an attacker. > <br /> female vampire and left dead. She begins to crave blood and meets with John Savage, who looks like he's wondering where he left the phone number of Michael Cimino. Savage <br /> <br /> is also a vampire and wants Andreef to join his little vampire family <br /> <br />, which consists of a British vamp, the blond vamp, the <br /> <br / attack Starr and a greenhaired dwarf (I do not do that <br /> <br />). <br /> <br /> The family does not want Starr, so they try to kill Savage and Starr br /> <br /> and Starr's kid. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell John Savage that this is a drama. He <br /> <br /> spends most of his screen showing more facial than Hugh Grant on a Jolt Cola bend, and he reads all his lines like <br /> <br /> he makes a farrelly brothers movie. Andreeff tries to make the most of a badly written role, but screenwriter / director Ruben goes for all vampire clich√©s, like Starr, who eats her son's hamster <br /> <br /> and buy lots of raw meat to crave to fight for blood. The kid <br /> <br /> is also pushed around a lot, for those who think watching violence against kids is really entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie is especially bloody, but not in a wild, exaggerated way like "Killer <br /> <br /> Tongue". Here the Gore is crude and never justified, it only occurs. <br /> <br /> It's only in the budget. Most of the R rating goes to Andreeff's <br /> <br /> employees, who run through embarrassing strip routines in the background of conversation scenes. The budget does not include <br /> <br /> vampire teeth! All vampires here have to stab their prey to eat. <br /> <br /> Good idea, unless you have already seen George Romero's <br /> <br /> "Martin". <br /> <br /> Even in 77 minutes, and once you throw in the artistic direction (twisted images, blurry scenes) in Rubens' attempts, this is a boring, stupid and dirty ride. Leave this club and take a shower. <br /> <br /> You will need it. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, violent violence and sexual violence, strong blood, strong obscenity, female nudity, sexual cues, substance abuse and adult situations. <br /> <br />
