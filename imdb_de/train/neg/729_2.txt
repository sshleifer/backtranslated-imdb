Before I started watching the show, I've heard that it's great and aesthetically very interesting. What a deception, the scripts are so stupid that I'm pretty sure the authors are the son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. And as for the SFX and the colors, they are so extreme that it's painful to watch, the colors are not saturated. This show is like a bad pie in which a child would have only given sugar and butter because they are the best ingredients for them. Unfortunately for this show, the only two parts of this show are ultimately vacancy and a lack of credibility.
