If you choose a movie, I hope for one factor that you will consider: Do the actors of the film use their fame to positively or negatively influence the moral fabric of our society? This is not a political statement, it is a moral problem that affects society. If a comedian / actor makes sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and his dad, we should ask ourselves (would I support this behavior)? In this case, Foxx's behavior rips the social fabric that teaches our youth right out of good, bad behavior, that loving kindness is better than hatred. Mr. Foxx should keep in mind that it's just for entertainment and there's a lot of it we can choose from. Sorry to say, do not pull him off the hook. It will not hurt the pain too much or eliminate the bad behavior it spreads on our youth. One way to end this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. Do not see anything to which they belong. We can not change them, but we can stop the glory we give them.
