In SÃ£o Paulo, the upper-middle-class teens, Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel, have just come to university, and on the eve of the opening class they attend a drug and alcohol party. The next day, after class, Cristiano's date arrives at his home the previous night and the three friends rape the girl. The girl dies, they panic and decide to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother comes, startles Gabriel, and rolls down the stairs, breaking his neck. The trio decides to dump the corpses in a landfill and burn them, but more tragedies occur at night. and is certainly the worst Brazilian movie I have seen in many years. The flat, tragic and dark story is actually a black comedy with a bad taste. The script is not funny, with stupid lines and dialogues and boring, manipulative and stupid tracks with interviews with idiots and teenagers at the beginning and end. The drama is terrible, apparently with many improvisations but no talent, and I was disappointed with the presence of the promising Caio Blat in this garbage. The camera, the frame, the cinematography and the edition are amateurish and of very low quality. The sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are talking about (probably a plus as this strip is shit). The gangbang is very realistic and is used to promote this mediocre film in a very bad marketing of sexual exploitation. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Cat's bed")
