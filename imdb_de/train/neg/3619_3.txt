Basically there is a family in which a little boy (Jake) thinks there is a zombie in his closet and his parents are constantly fighting. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than a soap opera ... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. <br /> <br /> OK, especially when you're making a movie, you have to decide if it's a thriller or a drama! The movie can be seen as a drama. Parents divorce and argue as in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet, which totally ruins the whole movie! I expected to watch a BOOGEYMAN-like movie, and instead I saw a drama with some meaningless thriller spots. As far as the recordings with Jake are concerned, just ignore them.
