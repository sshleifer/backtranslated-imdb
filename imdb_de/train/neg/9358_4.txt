There is already a discrepancy from the beginning of the film. As this film plays on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East, and is also an international film, one would expect to present proper accents. This does not happen because the majority of the cast sounds American. I also think that acting is best rehearsed. The plot is a bit difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise, the film in costume and scenery is very accurate. If you want to watch a movie to get a sense of what it was like in the past (albeit with no accents), then this movie is worth the rent. If you're looking for a movie as epic as the Kingdom of Heaven, look elsewhere.
