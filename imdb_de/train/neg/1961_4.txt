... the child actors were annoying. It also seems that the creators in this movie have 90 minutes to fight. Decent death scenes. Without the death scenes, this film would have a very discrete feel. <br /> <br /> The child's main character did not seem to be nearly as scared as she should have been. If I was in the middle of the forest with a tooth fairy ghost killer guy, you can bet I'm not out and about riding a bike worse (ie waiting), but it's not something I'd look at again , or recommend it to anyone who deals with it, unless you are an avid horror collector.
