Why why? ... did I pick this up? Well, I needed a breeze in the summer heat, and the cover looked cool. <br /> <br /> Of course I should have known better. This is a really bad movie. And it gets embarrassing when the makers know it's bad and try to cover it up by adding some sexy / beautiful women and some sex scenes. Well, people ... it does not cut, right? <br /> <br /> If you like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very, very good, well played and fun: rent Los Placid! (that's an order)
