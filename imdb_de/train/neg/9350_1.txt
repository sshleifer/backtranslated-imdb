This movie was awful. The first half hour is like ... well, sorry for the lack of articulation, but it was just a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost copied from one of the first in Clockwork! Supposedly it was a tribute, as the Clockwork poster appeared on the wall of the protagonist, but "rip-off" is the appropriate word. The film felt like it had been torn right out of the Kubrick classic, filmed only by the eyes of a new director. A blind director. Unfortunately, the movie gets even worse when it stops its massacre of Kubrick's work. As another commentator said, the depth of this movie is simply thrown in the neck. Arrogant, self-absorbed and ultimately meaningless chatter. <br /> <br /> Maybe the protagonist's talk would hit a nerve if there was a character development in this movie. I felt absolutely nothing for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I think if someone could feel something for him, it would be me. Terrible character development, dialogue and action. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is the title. For a movie titled "16 Years of Alcohol," alcoholism plays little role. See first paragraph - it was such a slaughter of A Clockwork Orange that I can not overcome. A more appropriate title would have been "16 Years of Violence" or better yet "A Clockwork Banana". If you ignore my advice and still take it out, drink it. Trust me.
