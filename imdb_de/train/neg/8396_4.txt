... but I have seen better too. <br /> <br /> The story here is predictable - a film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders took place. Three guess what happens. This is not a total bomb - the cast is pretty good, with professionals John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine doing the best. It's reasonably well done - for a low budget movie. Just do not expect nudity, cursing, blood or blood (the film has a very mild PG value). I was never totally bored - it's fine if I look at a quiet night. I saw it on video - it was a terrible print - very dark and some scenes were not visible. Still, I did not hate it and it has a cool ending, which surprised me - basically, nothing happens until then, so it does not surprise you. Worth seeing, but only if you are a horror movie.
