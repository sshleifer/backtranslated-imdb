"True" story of a deceased monster that appears when an American industrial plant pollutes the waters. Amusing, if not really good, monster movies have a lot of people trying to get the monster and finding out what's going on. Give us points if you give us a huge monster, which you obviously built to scale for some scenes. Take some that looks like a non-threatening puppy. An amusing recycling film that is pleasantly stupid in the right mood. (My only complaint is that the pressure of the Elvira version is so bad that it looks like a worn videotape that exceeded its best 20 years ago.)
