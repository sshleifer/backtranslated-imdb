With an unknown cast that probably stays that way, this "movie" is another cheap Slasher movie that amazes me how this movie was released. In particular I have no problems with horror and slasher flicks, they are my favorites. But if they made THAT BAD, it really needs the monkey and it's no wonder the genre has such a hard time. The story is as clich√©d and unimaginative as possible, with a group of people in a lodge in the woods being battered and hacked by this zombie / ghost guy. It's not the most annoying story, it's the cruel drama and the dialouge, homemade directorial quality, and a horrible soundtrack. Aside from ridiculous effects and some incredibly lazy movies - these idiots are out in clear daylight, but we think it's night? What the hell did the director think with this movement? What, he only had one day to film it all? He was afraid of the dark? (It's weird to see a policeman running around in the clear light of day with a torch that behaves as if it were pitch black so they could at least escape from this movie without ever being noticed, I'm sure one of the " Teenagers' at the local pub Bingo is playing - but she is between 40 and 45 years old. <br /> <br /> Good for a laugh, but just another waste of film and time.
