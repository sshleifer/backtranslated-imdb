The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic. Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry that goes down. I've actually seen better behavior in low-budget porn. I thought I had actually rented a gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: Take care of your ass: Nick: Take care of your (together): I will not leave you behind! The production is horrible, but it's really funny: good people have transformer weapons! In one scene they all have fake HK MP5 submachine guns. Next scene, AK-47 replicas! To top it off, switch between scenes with a few M-16 weapons. I think they had a tight budget for weapons, not enough to switch between the good and the bad. Battle scenes are badly coordinated and fake like hell. You need to remove the pin / spoon from a grenade so it can explode by itself. You can not fire shoulder-fired missiles while flying in a helicopter. Weapons that you throw away do not suddenly reappear. If a weapon is out of bullets, it's still pretty stupid to throw it away. Unless you have no idea how to reload. Large, slow-moving trucks driving around in first gear create unpleasant action scenes. I really can not believe that such films are actually produced. This movie would be funny about laughing gas or maybe just drunk.
