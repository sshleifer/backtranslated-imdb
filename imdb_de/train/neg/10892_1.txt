This movie is WUNDER! I do not know where to start, I'm speechless, I can not even describe how terrible that is. The blood is first fluorescent, and the spectacle is WUNDER! The only good thing was the biker chick that saves the day. This movie was ridiculous, I do not see how he ever got a voice of 1. It looks like it was done by students.
