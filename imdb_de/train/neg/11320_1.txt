someone had to pay a car ... that's really awful ... makes Jean Claude's cyborg look like the wind ... this is an hour I wish I could sue for coming back ... luckily, it caused severe drowsiness ... from which I fell asleep. How can actors of this caliber create this dog? I would rather spend the time growing algae on the side of a fishbowl than participate in this terrible concoction of various genres. I now use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table. $ 5.99 at walmart is far too much to spend on this movie ... If you really need it, wait until they kick it out after you've been stocking it for several years, and you're frustrated that it is would not sell. <br /> Please for the love of God, let this movie of darkness die.
