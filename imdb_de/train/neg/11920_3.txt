Oscar Wilde's comedy of manners, perhaps the funniest piece ever written, is almost destroyed by a second-rate cast. Sanders, as you might expect, happens to be brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the whole process a waste of time. Jean Crain tries to set a stage accent in alternative sentences, and the other members of the cast seem to think that this is a melodrama rather than a comedy; In fact, the entire production has bookends that make them a tragedy - no doubt the Hays office insisted. Premingers direction seems to lie mainly in the fact that there are enough servants and even the music looks banal. Stick to the optically perfect silent farce, as directed by Lubitsch, or even the 2004 version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or read the piece for the joy of words. But skip this version.
