If you thought the original of 83 was bad, try this modern masterpiece. How could it be worse, more you ask? Well ... at least Ally Sheedy had to jog in a sports bra. Apart from updated graphics, modern themes (like terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Ripley, this is unfortunately the same sad tired story. Anyone who saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story should go. And for those who have not seen it for the first time ... you're lucky that you only saw it once. Maybe Hollywood will try again in 23 years.
