I expect the same excitement as I spit on your ditch, but I was disappointed, just garbage, how can you even call that a movie (kind of a mini-porn). It made me sick when the guy wanted to eat his own business. There is no history that makes it fast from any murder. If you like to see naked women or even men, there are spots in the movie, and there's even a masturbation point in the movie that makes it a porn, not a movie. I've seen some stupid movies in my time, but this is number 1. I'd like to take another look at it. The actors even looked bored during the movie, so they probably needed urgent money to shoot this movie.
