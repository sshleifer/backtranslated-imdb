Special effects? Well. <br /> <br /> script? Awful. No plot No depth No meaning. This movie made Superman a meaningless hero, a hero without an archetype. In the original film he represented America in the Cold War. Here he was just a hulk. <br /> <br /> Sure, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was a good choice. <br /> <br /> This still does not solve the problem that this movie had no depth. I can not see how anyone can get anything meaningful out of this movie when Superman was and is created daily to be a major hero not only in comics but also in people's minds. This was a real waste of money, considering how many directions this film could have gone. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: Lex Luthor could be a villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and on and on. He was just another hackman incarnation. <br /> <br /> And Superman? What did he stand for in this movie? Nothing but another hack "savior" figure. <br /> <br /> Wait until the Dollar Theater arrives, if you ever see it.
