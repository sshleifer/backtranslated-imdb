The past sneaks up on a rehab addict as he rejoins his sick brother and a former girlfriend after he hopes he has spent his last detox. "Dramas of Life" presented here in the simplest possible way (not even the script has a bite or a joke). The cast consists of attractive-looking actors smiling grimly, and the music and photography are deceptive (a few visual effects are ridiculous, indie clich√©s stink of a frugal budget). Although written and directed by a man, this was produced by a woman, and I'm not sure, but I think that's a clear reason why this picture of two men, alienated brothers, never come closer who never feels completely natural seems to be lived. It's an attempt to enter into a male relationship, but careful, sterile presentation is a scam. No heart is in this area that lives, breathes, or bleeds this material. "The Perfect Son" is quickly dispelled by too many chefs in the kitchen.
