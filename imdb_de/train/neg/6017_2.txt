The only pleasing thing about this highly ridiculous film is the "guessing" of this place. Which landmark of Toronto will stand for which American / international location. Who knew that the anti-Christ would be Russian? Obviously he can not be American because we need the jokes to save the day - oh Buck ... They tell us the whole truth ... They show us the light ... and the way out of the building should make them disgusting Anti-Christians have their way. <br /> <br /> Five golden raspberries. Faith is not enough to hope that they will not do it again! We do not need prayer.
