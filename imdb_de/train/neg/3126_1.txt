Mr. VanHook had a good idea and kicked like a football. Unfortunately, the goal did not succeed. The giants' historic theme is a good one, but pour in the milk and you get a huge cheese wheel. I say, take this roller wheel and roll it off a cliff. I could not see the whole movie. That says a lot because I rarely get away from a movie. I always give them a chance for last-minute redemption. It is impossible to save something so bad. Well, at least the acting was good .... NOT! <br /> <br /> The only thing that "falls" in this movie is the rating. 1/10 and sink in the negative numbers!
