Please spare me these films that show us that crime is fun and legitimate. A couple with a blank screenplay with an intense desire to be a Farrelly or Coen brother, plus the life of another group of supposedly high school-age people performing their Dawson Creek-branded kid and annoying with a GenXYZ soundtrack Make the movie "cool" and we've got the satire intense and painfully awkward. <br /> <br /> This is not even the watered-down "Ferris Bueller" ... I would rather watch a traffic light change. <br /> <br /> There is only one scene that is almost worth the price of the recording: when the girls from Betty Masked meet a friend of Richard Nixon Masked. It's a surreal moment. Priceless even. <br /> <br /> But for the rest I would rather have a toothache. At least I can use benzocaine (TM) to stop the pain.
