Listen to some interesting things that our battle hero faith healer Pat, his son Gordon (TV service seems to be a family business) and Terry Meeuwsen (Won Miss America 1973) wear by wearing a swimsuit and show their legs. Oh my goodness, gracious! ) say, when our poor spectators are sick and need help. <br /> <br /> 1. Someone with a "right tooth" has just been healed.2. Someone with a "twisted gut" has been healed.3. Then Terry said there was a person with a "strange state" (you mean, God does not know?) A burning in the legs that has just been healed. Then Gordon said there was a man (that narrows it!) With swelling of the sinuses in his right cheek, with severe pain behind the right eye, but he is now healed.5 Someone with a problematic right hip, limited mobility stroke, may go now. 6. Terry said she saw someone with severe stiffness in the neck bone, but did not know exactly the suffering (God does not know?) - that the person is now healed. 7. Somebody who is paralyzed on the right side, especially (not exactly ?!) the right side of the face is healed now.8. A man (who makes the world population closer again.) Having a plate in the skull is always a problem, and the doctors just do not know what to do. Terry said she saw the bone forming around the plate (The funny bone ?!) and the man's pain disappeared, he was healed. <br /> <br /> Your war hero Pat helps our sick and poor people. 1. There is a woman in Kansas City (Missouri or Kansas, but she is limping.) She has a sinus, which the Lord is now drying up. Thank you Jesus. 2. There is a man with a financial need - I believe a hundred thousand dollars. (I believe you God must go to school or something!) This need is being fulfilled, and within three days the money will be made available through the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit. Thank you Jesus. 3. In Cincinnati there is a woman with cancer of the lymph nodes. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it has been diagnosed (ask your vindictive god, Pat!), but you did not feel well, and the Lord is just resolving this cancer! (What?!) 4 There's a woman in Saskatoon (I suppose, Canada.) In a wheelchair curvature of the spine. The Lord is straightening that up and you can get up and walk! (If you have this condition, ignore it!) It's yours and it's yours. Thanks to you, Jesus! Amen, Amen! <br /> <br /> When Pat Robertson suffered from prostate cancer, did he go to Peter Popoff, Oral Roberts, Benny Hinn, Terry or Gordon? No! On February 17, 2003, Pat went to a REAL DOCTOR for surgery! (You mean he does not trust his faith healing friends, Terry, or his own son Gordon ?!) <br /> <br /> When LT Pat Robertson was in the Marines during the Korean War, he was an Alcohol Officer, who was responsible for keeping the officers supplied with alcohol. He was known to drink himself and frequent prostitutes, and he feared he had contacted gonorrhea. (Should have asked a faith healer for help!) <br /> <br /> The reason Pat came out of the fight was because his father, Absalom D Va (1946-66), was chairman of the Military Equipment Senate Team. Sept. 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks We viewed ourselves as invulnerable and in the pursuit of health, wealth (Pats worth) between 150 and 200 million dollars of people!) Material delights (a villa in Virginia Beach Virginia with helicopter launch!) And sexuality (he had had sex with his future wife before marriage, who had a son!). It happens (terrorism) because God cancels his protection from us (statement released on September 13, 2001). Pat Robertson reminds me of mayor over Santa Claus comes to town and his vicious, vengeful god reminds me of Venger in Dungeons And Dragons. <br /> <br /> Pampered brat Gordon does what Papa Pat tells him, and Terry is a paid woman who does not have her own opinion! <br /> <br /> This will really grab you! The issue of The 700 Club on September 5, 2005 included a report by Christian Broadcasting Network's correspondent Gary Lane outside the New Orleans Convention Center, which housed most of the impoverished black disaster victims throughout the weekend. Lane said, "They contain this voodoo mug with the slogan" May the curse be with you. "A shot from a plastic cup souvenir mug from one of the countless jewelry stores in New Orleans appeared on the screen. "Also, music CDs titled Guerilla Warfare and Thugs 'R' Us. "Lane said pointing to a stack or rap CDs scattered on the floor. (His bigoted dad Absalom taught Pat Racism well!) <br /> <br /> If any of you Good People always remember To donate to these sexist bigoted people, please in the name of God: Sponsor a softball or basketball team, enter a food shelf, be a big brother or a big sister to a child, but please do not give it to these people, because They've been there for over 40 years and nothing has been resolved. <br /> <br /> If you still do not believe that Pat Robertson overheard a commercial break on the Web and pressed "Search" and if you hear what he really likes it, I just know that you will not give these treacherous liars a cent! And by the way, Terry had divorced once and Pat often talked against divorce in his shows. <br /> <br /> I want people in Dover Pe nnsylvania, orlando florida and the nice people that are here say hello was met by Hurricane Katrina and i hope it's a nice day. Was Operation Blessing helpful to New Orleans? (I doubt it!) Please inform our readers! I do! By the way, if you are ill, go to a real doctor and make everyone laugh about these liars. One day, Mayor Pat, Gordon and Terry can go to another place and take their angry god Venger with them!
