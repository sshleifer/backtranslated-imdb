It is possible that A Man Called Sledge has caused irreparable damage to the bottom of the cutting room. Maybe someday somebody will ask for a director's cut, but I seriously doubt it. James Garner decided to make some money in the western spaghetti market, causing a large number of Americans to occupy the cast. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow, who both wrote and directed the film. Garner is always cast as sympathetic villains because he's so good at playing them. But he has played seriously and done well in movies like The Children's Hour and Hour of the Gun. He can and has successfully solved his usual stereotypical part. But A Man Called Sledge can not be considered one of his achievements. <br /> <br /> He has the title role as a Luther Sledge notorious outlaw with a high price on his head. After partner Tony Young was killed in a saloon and Garner takes appropriate action in the Eastwood style, he is followed by John Marley from the saloon. <br /> <br /> Marley's spent some time in the nearby Territorial Prison, and it seems that there were gold shipments there, locked up and keys on a rest stop for the people who regularly carry the stuff. Garner gets his gang together to commit a robbery. <br /> <br /> Here the movie goes completely out of the wall. As a rule, Heist films show that the protagonists plan much methodically. That was certainly the case in The War Wagon, whereupon another reviewer quoted. But here Garner decides, as a prisoner of the fake US Marshal Dennis Weaver to break into prison and trigger a jailbreak, to which the gold is stolen. <br /> <br /> That was just too much to swallow. If it was that easy to take the gold, it would have been long before that. But I'll say, for those who like the blood and courage of Italian westerns, there are enough for three movies during the prison break. <br /> <br /> That's not the whole thing, of course, the outlaws fall out and we have another gore on it before the movie ends. At the time, however, the entire film has lost much coherence. <br /> <br /> The great thirties film singer, Allan Jones, is listed in the credits. But I can not find him in the movie for my life. Maybe a choir of the Donkey Serenade could have done better. <br /> <br /> Could not hurt anyone.
