Some commented that this is the worst Elvis movie ever made. Well, they are only partially right. For me, this is the worst movie ever! I have never seen anything so gross and insulting and abominable and against human nature as this movie. A real embarrassment to the film industry, that's not so bad, it's good. There's no shabby fun to be found here, like in some of Elvis' other bad movies like Clambake. This one is so corrupted that he hurts because of his pain. Pure garbage. Native Americans should file a lawsuit here for their clich√©d and stereotypical treatment. In fact, perhaps ALL people should complain for the crime and seriously damage the film for the entire genre of 0 stars. Note: F
