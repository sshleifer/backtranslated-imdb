When I saw this movie cover, I thought at first that it was made for video. The second thing that came to my mind was the resemblance to another dreadful movie "Darkness Falls," the story of that dumb witch who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was a real masterpiece compared to this garbage heap, and this movie should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a little backstory for the witch, or more like a pointless introduction by two young children visiting the Tooth Fairy, hoping to give them a shiny new bike for their tooth gives. The opening is badly filmed, and like the rest of the movie, it's certainly not scary. At the present time, the film revolves around Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter rents his house, his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West) and her daughter Cole come here. Cole meets a neighborhood kid, and they talk about the tooth fairy, and how you should not lose your tooth, or she'll come for you. Seconds later it looks like the tooth fairy is stealing her bike and throwing out her tooth (how ironic). Will Cole survives the tooth fairy's anger and will be able to rescue her and rekindle her romance from her mother and Peter ... This is a bad movie, you could probably find out. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this idiotic movie is how undefined the tooth fairy is. They say she kills you if you lose your tooth, but no. She's more like a serial killer who kills arbitrarily, and if you lose your tooth, you'll definitely go. She steals a bicycle, so she's obviously a thief too. I said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get the inspiration for the Tooth Fairy performance? Just take a look. She looks like a burnt offering, and she used to be in the neighborhood to slaughter children. Hmmm ... it's almost as if she's reading Freddy Krueger from the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies. And that's not the worst part of this terrible mess that is the highlight. This movie could have the most ludicrous climax (not literally ridiculous because I found it offensive rather than funny) that I've ever seen. Do not see that. <br /> <br /> Just a little something. Lochlyn Munroe was in Scary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3, and both were there. Obviously, scary movie stars are forced to end their careers with bad, scary movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 80 min. R for violence.
