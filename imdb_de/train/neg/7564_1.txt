The Wicker Man. I'm so angry that I can not write a correct comment on this film. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous, thinly tied and generally just lame. Nicolas Cage ... be ashamed! I assumed it would be decent at least, since you were there. It was not. <br /> <br /> I felt like a lot of the film was lying on the bottom of the cutting surface, and even when it's complete - the movie was just weird and stupid. <br /> <br / At the end the mouth stays open, the mind is mixed up and the taste is offended. I've never heard so many people leave a theater with so much hate on the opening day. People complained in small groups in the mall, four floors from the theater next to the entrance. It is so bad. <br /> <br /> I've heard it in comparison with Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My friend was so angry that he would not even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
