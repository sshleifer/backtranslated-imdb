It was obvious that this movie should appeal to the audience of Chick Flick, to whom I sat and had the most fun. However, this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (who herself became damn annoying). Their acting was exaggerated and it seemed that they were over-cautious compared to their colleagues, who were relaxed in their roles. This movie could have been more, as there was a reasonable budget for settings, actors and a decent story. My wife and I agreed that this was "Muck" in the end as the movie ended with a painful embarrassing climax! Good luck next time, hope Miss Graham sticks to the kind of movies she belongs to, like From Hell.
