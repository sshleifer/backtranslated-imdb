I'd like to start by being a Republican, even though I disagree with many of the things Bush did in office. And I love the daily show and the Colbert report. You have to be on TV two of my favorite shows. I enjoy the bush jokes about Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest man ever to live on earth (I do not think he's the dumbest either) not so funny anymore. I see where it can be funny and it is (hey, he makes fun of our authority figure who he is funny). But Comedy Central just tries to make it fun. I mean maybe a special episode, but a whole series is just stupid. It seems that CC only says the same bush jokes we've heard about WAY many times before. I can not really see this show running after a season.
