It just seems to be true, a movie with Dolph Lundgren is bad! I do not know if it's the fact that the story is full of holes or that Dolph is such a bad actor. No spoiler here, he seems to overwhelm the urge and push, gripping and touching in this movie. In my opinion, it is a wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to get into the can and the theater.
