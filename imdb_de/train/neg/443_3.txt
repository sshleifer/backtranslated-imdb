Overall, a very disappointing picture. Very, very slowly to the basic action. The role of Maria Schrader in the search for her family secret. (Every take seems to last forever.) There really is no rhythm in the movie.) *** SPOILERS *** Her mother Ruth is rescued from the Nazis by a German woman played by Katja Riemann. The whole character of Ruth is so one-dimensional, so stereotypical. *** SPOILERS END *** The film cuts back and forth between today's New Yorker and Berlin and the 1940's. As you do so, give the audience an indication of exactly what time the story is taking place. There is never a clear time specification? very annoying. The worst is the end. *** SPOILERS *** The whole show and the fuss that the Jews are so terribly tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. So the Jews came out of Rosenstrasse? The question of who freed the Jews is NEVER answered. Was Goebels, who freed her? Did Lean Fischer sleep with Goebels? In Venice, the film won a play award for K. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. Does the Jewish theme have to be?
