I was a filmmaker myself and had a dark and subversive sense of humor. I thought I was expecting something good when I took "My Wrongs ..." home (not that the DVD cover would reveal anything, but rather the ambiguous one.) Quoted by controversial director Chris Morris ("A short with scenes "). I really should have known better, and shunned that bland (and often offensive) bit. <br /> <br /> The scene in the church is disgusting to see (especially because we are too familiar with Morris's distorted take on pedophilia from his infamous television series Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than shock. I'll never understand how this movie is called a comedy. <br /> <br /> The runner's comment basically sounds like a novel idea (since I myself was a runner, he's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filming process). Unfortunately, this is not the case here. Instead, we are greeted with a few public students who complain about dogs in the movie before we come to the conclusion that there are no really great movies with dogs. It's all very interesting, but it does not pay to make a single celluloid frame. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie goes nowhere would be an understatement. She relies too much on her exalted style at the expense of action, character, and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely distraught and unfulfilled. His oversimplified message - the man should take responsibility for his actions - is both obvious and poorly illustrated. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments of a pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism that, however, can not convince to entertain, enlighten and in the end be annoying. If you want to see a really great piece of short film, I recommend "Franz Kafka's a wonderful life" by Peter Capaldi.
