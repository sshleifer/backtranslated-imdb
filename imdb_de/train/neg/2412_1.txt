This film is yet another long-cut movie with no budget, no hassle, no talent films captured on video and a smooth cover to fool unsuspecting tenants in the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what When you watch this movie, you can grab a video camera and a red food coloring and film yourself and your friends wandering around in the neighborhood at night, and people will growl and grow "attack". Congratulations, you just made "Hood of the Living Dead"! Now see if a distribution company will buy it from you. <br /> <br /> I've seen a few low budgets shot on videotapes that showed talent from filmmakers and actors, or with the least amount of effort, but none have. Avoid, unless you are a true masochist or are amused by badly made horror movies.
