The cast is nothing special, everyone does a good job, the story seems like a good idea, the script is bearable and the end has a good twist; So, what's wrong with that? <br /> <br /> First of all, the special effects are really bad (if this was done in the 60s), it might be fine, but in 2003 there is no excuse for such bad pictures. It makes me laugh that the DVD cover claims to be very proud of "the special effects creator of Jeepers Creepers." Secondly, the direction is weak, this film does not capture the essence of the story, A Doctor Providing the soul of the hospital inmate with the devil (or creature of demons) should be tense or frightening. It just is not. All in all, this is a pretty bad movie, and although he is bearable and sometimes mildly entertaining, he is probably still best left alone. <br /> <br /> A rather sad 4/10
