Scary Movie 3 (2003) was not a good idea at first. The last movie was a mediocre attempt. Put it next to this charge, it's a comedy classic. While the second part was filled with a lot of old humor and cheap recordings, it was at least funny. There is nothing funny about enforced humor. Of course, jokes, pratfalls and visual gags are supposed to be funny. It's not cool to beat the viewer with tired jokes. The humor in this film was geared towards youthful idiots who will laugh at everything. When they addressed the audience of junior high school, any sense of self-esteem was thrown out the window. Ring parodies are not funny. I have seen her in comedies since 1998. They are so dated. Michael Jackson jokes are not cool either. It is even worse to make fun of two broken performers whose "best days" have NEVER been. <br /> <br /> The death of American cinema was slower. Films like these are the nails that are beaten into the coffin. What happened to real humor? I have not laughed in a movie for a long time. Too many bad movies spoil the brain. You want a proof? Visit your local Mega chain rental store and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Do not believe the hype. I would rather see Scary Movie 2 in an endless loop than to suffer again and again from this bad excuse for a comedy!
