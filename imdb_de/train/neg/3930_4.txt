In the second Renaissance, Part 1, we want to show how the machines first rose against the humans. It all starts with a single case in which the machines claim they have a right to life as well, while people claim that a robot is something that they possess and therefore can do whatever they want with them. <br /> <br /> Although an interesting premise, the story of (violent!) riots between the robots and humanity will be really stupid from now on. Somehow it does not seem right, as another reviewer points out, it's all a bit too smart. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix stories that are close to the core of the Matrix (especially Osiris) work for the best. For the second Renaissance Part 1, I would say that it is too violent and too stupid. 10.4.
