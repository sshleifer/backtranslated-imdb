Seriously, I do not even know where to start. It's as if someone had given a bazillion-dollar budget to an autistic third grader and said, "Make a movie about the secret service." The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was at best random, every single syllable was completely reserved and the director ... well, was there a director at all? Everything was so pointless and lame and pointless ... and by chance .... and lame. <br /> <br /> Here is a SPOILER for you; This movie is the stupidest thing you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed this piece, you will enjoy it too; Deterrance, Dark Blue and a partial frontal lobotomy.
