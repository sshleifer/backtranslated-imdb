Such a common horror story about a luxury building in Brooklyn that hides the gates to hell. It is reminiscent of Polanski's "The Tenant" (released a year before "The Sentinel"), but is in no way too far removed from the film by the Polish filmmaker. "The Tenant" was so disturbing, while "The Sentinel" does not work at all. <br /> <br /> What's more surprising in this film is the cast: it's full of big names in American cinema (Burguess, Gardner), gelding), experienced actors who act for food (I think). <br /> <br /> Conclusion: barely entertaining. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 4/10
