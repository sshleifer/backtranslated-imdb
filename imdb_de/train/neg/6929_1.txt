I read the reviews for this movie and decided to give it a try. After all, I'm an open-minded guy and have given some pretty bad reviews good reviews. As the credits rolled on this title, I searched for meaning and something beautiful to say. Here it says: "This movie was mercifully short." That's all I have. <br /> <br /> Okay, okay. The sets and visuals were well done and the music helped to give the atmosphere of asylum life, but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took the good parts off. I laughed at this movie, but the way you laugh at your best friend who has just embarrassed a large crowd. At the time of the "chicken dance" in the finale that I had I decided to roll with the movie and drop the bodies where they fall. I do not know what could have saved this movie. The acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget, but there was no way to make it observable. not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts. Maybe I should have started a doobie or had to drink a lot of beer to get the full experience of the movie. In any case, I will not see this movie anymore if I'm not really depressed. Then I can tell myself: At least I was not in Dr. Tarr's torture dungeon. I'm better than these guys. "
