I bought this DVD in the Dollar Store. The DVD was on $ 2 for $ 1, but since it contained Michael Madsen, I thought I could buy the movie even though I had never seen the movie before. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I do not I do not like the movie. The film was more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else. I found that using the director's flashbacks did not contribute to the story for me. I would have preferred to look at the plot in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I will not throw her away like one of the other commentators, but it might take a while for me to watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since this is the film debut of Michael Madsen, it may eventually have an archival value.
