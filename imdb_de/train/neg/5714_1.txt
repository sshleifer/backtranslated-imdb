I've seen a lot of good Korean movies, including thriller and darker overtones, but this one is shit. The director seems to be a sadist who happens to have someone make garbage. The movie has no entertainment value and is not even a thriller. I can not believe that someone made such a movie. Even if acting is okay, the story and the feeling it leaves behind is terrible. No sense of filmmaking and total disappointment with thriller moments. All this shows scenes with psychopaths who waste the roles of badly shot scenes and show more blood and violence thinking, which makes it exciting. Very disappointing movie and I strongly recommend skipping all movies of this kind.
