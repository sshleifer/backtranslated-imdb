I was disappointed. The film was a bit predictable and did not meet the hype that was plastered everywhere. The characters were well developed, the Windego myth was used in a unique premise, and the house was pretty scary, but I just did not have it. I've always been waiting for this big AHHHHH or BOO! But it never came. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie was plagued by bad special effects. So show too much of a bad thing and do not use the viewer's atmosphere and imagination to create the horror and tension. Try movies like Session 9 or the Cube if you are looking for a cheap but well-designed horror movie.
