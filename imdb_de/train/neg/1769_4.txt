April 29, 2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Campy's vampire-like Stephen King movie has so many strange and stupid elements that you start laughing at the extreme craziness that is about a quarter of the way The movie means and you wonder if this movie could be cult for King fans. It is the story of a mother and a son who are sleepwalkers (a morphing cat, carnivorous, vital, almost extinct humanoid animal) that moves from town to town looking for virgins to feed themselves. They look pretty normal to the upper class, unless they are secret lovers and cats hang out day and night. Cats are deadly to them, so they put traps in their garden to keep the population in check. We can see them breaking a pair of noses when they attack (which is also a premiere in my movie) - hopefully no real cats were hurt in creating the movie. The boy is behind a cute girl he has a crush on until he turns into a "sleepwalker" and then he just wants her body. There's so much Campy uniqueness in this movie that it might have been better if it were a totally satirical comedy for suburban life. Instead, the director tries to scare you every few minutes until you wish he could get over it. Bring the wound out. Finally, that happens and the movie ends with the typical Stephen King downbeat ending. The movie is interesting because King's humor is more than usual, but its craziness is also very present and what you have is a movie that fans will probably like and should have in their collection, but as a rewarding movie experience this is not really the case cut it.
