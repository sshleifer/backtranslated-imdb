Cynthia Rothrock, (China O'Brien), "Manhattan Chase", 2000, made this movie interesting to watch and of course, this cute little wife burned her screen with her artistic skills and hot, sexy body. China O'Brien is upset with a police officer and decides to give it up and return to his hometown to return to her roots and her father, the local sheriff. Her father is getting older and the city has changed, gangsters have conquered the city and are beginning to make the local women do tricks, and the city people were tired of their city going to hell. Well, you can almost guess what's going on, and you're right, China O'Brien fights back after a big tragedy has killed her. Bad view of the picture, but Cynthia Rothrock brings this film to a wonderful conclusion.
