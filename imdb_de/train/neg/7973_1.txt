I go to a lot of movies, I often bring my 5 year old son, I'm so glad I did not bring him. There is a lot of evidence of sex and a thin scene, but that's not the main reason why I would not make him do it. The trailers make you think it's a carefree comedy; Nevertheless, practically all the funny moments are in the previews. I've always been waiting for it to be interesting, funny or anything but serious. However, I almost fell asleep as the story continued without a plot. I understand that dogs can be a great company. The whole story focused on a poorly-behaved dog the owners were not smart enough to train. If a person did so much damage and chaos, that person would be banned. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson is a waste of their talent. The best way to sum up this movie is, couple gets unruly dog, falls in love couple in dog, dog dies, couple sad. The end.
