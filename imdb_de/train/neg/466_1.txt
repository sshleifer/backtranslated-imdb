How can I best express my feelings about this film: abominable? A headache? Lack of coherent writing? simple stupidity? Try all the above points for this travesty. And that only for the direction. <br /> <br /> History? Well, I think there is a story. Two dumb blondes are looking for a job after dropping a plane onto a golf course. They are mistaken for a "world murderer" (sarcasm) and hired by two "gangsters". One says, "take him out" means a date and the other gets the little actor she dreams about. And of course the turtle reserve for the farting turtle that they build with the casino winnings. Rate again. They try to make fun of it, but it's not like that. Movies are not well done. I have seen better movies in Hong Kong movies. Visuals are average for a movie of the late 80s. But the problem is that it's a 2007 movie. <br /> <br /> It's not worth watching this movie ever again. Although Danny Glover's "Out" movie from the early '80s is still not the worst film ever, this movie is in a class of its own. "F"
