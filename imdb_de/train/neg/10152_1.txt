As a fan of kitsch horror movies, I saw this in my video store and thought I would try. Now that I have seen it, I wish it no living soul on the planet. I get my rental films for free and I have the feeling that I did not get my money. I've seen some bad horror movies in my time, I'm a fan of them, but that was just an insult.
