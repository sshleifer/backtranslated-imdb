Sunshine is a European import that plays between 1880 and 1980 in Hungary. It is the epic story of the Hungarian Jews, the family Sunshine. This name literally means "sunshine". The family has modest beginnings, then becomes wealthy, becomes mobile up, changes its name and hopes to align itself with Hungarian society so that future generations can progress professionally. The story is told in three generations from the eyes of the eldest son. Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed World War II and the Holocaust in Europe, the lifestyle of sunshine does not work very well. <br /> <br /> Sunshine is recognized as an artistic achievement, but is missing an opportunity. The story dominated by world history is predictable and transparent. This is reinforced by voice cover stories and newsreel footage. The "conspiracy" of the family falls away from a foreseeable event. the Habsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, fascism, communism, etc.] with little continuity, depth or detail. The subject of Jewish assimilation is not focused, and important subtopics (the "secret" diary and the family philosophy) that could have conferred the family character and credibility are up to the very end of time. Alternatively, the filmmakers offer generational continuity using general themes such as incest / infidelity. Ralph Fiennes shows brilliant moments, but his performance is far from award-winning material. The casting format "3 for 1" is a distraction to the viewer and feels more like a cheap movie theater gimmick than a good theater. Sunshine is essentially Hungarian "History Channel" material. It has the look and feel of Winds of War with Forrest Gump with Something About Sex. <br /> <br />
