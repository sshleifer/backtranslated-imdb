The first scanners might not be a great movie, but it was at least an original. There is no such novelty. Acting is worse in my opinion and the story is slower and nothing special. I also do not like the dialogue. And the special effects are no better than the original. This film is inferior to the first in every respect. The only thing that is different is that he is sometimes loud and chaotic. But that's not true. I'm doing a good movie. If they had made something better and interesting with the story, this could have been a decent movie. I could not go through it without a quick run. For me it's an unforgettable movie and not much else. Despite everything, there are worse films. When I am in a generous mood, I enter Scanner 2 4/10.
