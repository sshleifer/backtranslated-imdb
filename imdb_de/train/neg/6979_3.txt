I also saw this movie, and although it is very well done, I found it heartbreaking and would not recommend it to women who have small children. Train is really heartbreaking. And the sad thing is that she dies inside. Finally, she goes back to the Applacian Mountains. All the money she makes from making dolls does not hide her grief. I remember her desperate face as she pulled money out of her clothes to try to heal her child. I am surprised that this movie is set in Detroit, because when I saw it, I was sure the people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio. This was also a route for the poor in the mountains.
