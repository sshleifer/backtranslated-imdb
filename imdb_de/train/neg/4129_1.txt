After seeing about half of it, I was ready to give up and switch off, but I held it to the end. This is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. The drama is bad - far worse than the drama in 80s T & A films. <br /> <br /> There are several attempts of humor that fail miserably and the movie is 100% predictable. If you're a teenager, this movie may have a charm, but for those who have watched many movies, you'll know how the movie develops after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time is spent in agonizing condition to wait for the credits to end. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this.
