Was just a joke! This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen! However, it was so bad that it was hilarious. My friend and I purposely rented it because it looked so bad. Cheesy old horror films are always good for a few laughs. The action stank, some of the voices were dubbed, the quality was appalling. But I really had a great time seeing it!
