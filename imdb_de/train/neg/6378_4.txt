This movie was sometimes amusing, sometimes it was even totally funny. <br /> <br /> However, the underlying message I got from the movie was that women are responsible for all the man's problems. Every time a woman is portrayed in the movie, she is lazy, slutty or seduces a poor guy for no apparent reason. I do not think the message in question is good for women or gay men. <br /> <br /> But it's a comedy and a work of art, so it's just someone's point of view. Even if I do not agree, they still have a right to it. <br /> <br /> An amusing movie, but some comments made by others are just stupid. Best movie of my foot.
