Description: Corny, completely stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and lame that you wonder why those stupidly stupid people even spent 2 months or so to spend a budget (I guess ...). It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I give you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Save yourself, save time, money and life, NOT - I repeat, do not think about whether you should watch this movie. This movie is so hackneyed that your face will turn violet with angry boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ, be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You could actually admire it. (As I said, IF you have a single-digit IQ) <br /> <br /> With about 12 of my own actors, a few dolls you bought in a flea market, and of course cameras and music, I thought so make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap.
