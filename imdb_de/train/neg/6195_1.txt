Poorly made. A horrible drama and an end that the director seemed to be making from nothing, since the film was frankly just boring. Shockingly, this film is being considered for a prize at the Gij√≥n Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Everyone who came out of the theater agreed with me - what was the point of making the movie? The references to Iraq were either bizarre or not properly thought through. I am amazed that this movie was released - very disappointing and a waste of my time. Sorry, terribly negative feedback, but hopefully some people will be prevented from making the same mistake. What a pity we did not have a question and answer at the end of the film - now that might be interesting.
