First of all, I would like to say that this movie is worth more than the four stars that I rated. I gave him four stars because this 86-minute movie always looks like two and a half hours to me and is not enough to go through it all. However, "The Big Alligator River" (the title my DVD calls it) is better than the average nature that beats the movie back. <br /> <br /> A tourist resort in the jungles of Southeast Asia is just beginning to open and engage the natives as they try to manipulate the wildlife. Mother Nature, seeking revenge, comes in the form of the god Kroona, a giant alligator. But the creature is not the only thing the tourists and the main characters (a photographer and resort staff) have to worry about, the natives are also rubbed in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> This movie is a movie pretty well made adventure / horror story with good music and direction. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the film, is obviously fake. Some of the close-ups of his jaw are good, but that should be all we need to see. Some of the far-off underwater shots make it painfully obvious that we are alligator squeaky toys that you can probably get in a zoo souvenir shop. But the natives are believable, if not authentic. <br /> <br /> Probably not the movie that gives you an uninterrupted thrill, if any, but filmed and produced well enough to be mentioned. And like many creature films, this film ends with an extremely high body count. It also has many good jungle landscapes. Acting is below average, but who expected it to get better, right? <br /> <br /> Much better than the American counterpart "Primeival", but nothing that can be compared to "Jaws". But remember that in some places it is not interesting.
