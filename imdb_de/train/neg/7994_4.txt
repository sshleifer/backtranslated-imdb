A pretty worthless movie for TV that follows the Killers Insect script pretty much. Ants mysteriously turn into killer toads near a hotel. I think it is from the hotel food, because the wastewater from the hotel kitchen flows directly into the ant bed. There is not much tension in this movie and it is not scary either. Seeing a bunch of ants sting their victims is not terribly scary. <br /> <br /> section on spoilers The stupidity of the hero is almost incredible. He is told that the health inspector the ants could not be the hero. It has to be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says so, the hero takes his bulldozer and destroys the huge ant colony. This bothers the millions of ants and catches the people in the hotel. <br /> <br /> Final spoiler Overall, this movie is very lame. I do not understand why there was a DVD release, although so many deserved films have none. My only guess for the DVD release is that Suzanne Summers can be seen in the movie. This is a movie to avoid.
