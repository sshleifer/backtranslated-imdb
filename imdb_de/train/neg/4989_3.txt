Les Visiteurs, the first movie about medieval time travelers, was actually funny. I like Jean Reno as an actor, but there was more. There were unexpected twists, funny situations and of course plain absurdity that would remind you a bit of Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors and the same time travel. The storyline changes a bit because the characters are now supposed to be experienced time travelers. So they jump up and down the story, ignoring the fact that they become more and more absurd as the movie progresses. Duke Jean Reno tries to keep it together, but his character has been emptied so that he can not do much to save the film. <br /> <br /> Now the slave of the duke / helper, he really has all the attention. The movie is just about being awkward / annoying / stupid or whatever it should be. The fact is; This character tries to make the audience laugh, but he does not succeed. It's like someone told you a very, very bad joke, you know, but he insists on saying that joke to the end by adding details to make your suffering a little longer. They liked Les Visiteurs , do not spoil the taste in the mouth with the continuation. If you did not like Les Visiteurs, you would never consider sequel. If you liked this sequel ... well, I suppose you still have to watch a lot of movies.
