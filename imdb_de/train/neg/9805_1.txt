The popularity of Saban's Power Rangers show was never clear to me. It was simply a second-rate Americanized version of the ultra-thin Japanese Super Sentai series of the last three decades! What was cool about the Japanese version is completely lost in the American version, in characterization, in special effects and so on. <br /> <br /> Of course, many children will say that Power Rangers are the biggest, but they are wrong. <Br /> <br /> I'm sure if they speak Japanese, they'll find out how much better Super Sentai is over the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers is terrible, try Super Sentai instead! If you're looking for a better show, try Voltron The Third Dimension!
