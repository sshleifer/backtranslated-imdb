Again an insult and a slap in the face for gay men everywhere. This lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend. Again, we have an attractive "hero" who is reportedly unable to interest a woman. Yes exactly! And we are also introduced to the "likeable, attractive" gay friend, who is actually a fat, bald, ugly old man whom the leash is supposed to find attractive. Even I did not find him appealing and I'm a fat, ugly old gay man (but fortunately not bald)! Whatever the acting talent, this is a bad script and a really awful direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be excluded from the movie, but he's no different from the countless other hacks working in Hollyweed.
