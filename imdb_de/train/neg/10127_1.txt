Through this show, I felt physically ill and distanced myself completely from the British society as a whole. It was programs like this and Blue Peter that pretended that there were no class divisions in the UK. They always said things like; "Go into your loft and maybe you will find that ..." or "Go to your backyard and ..." - what about us 'shabby' worker children who never have a "loft" and a "garden" Public Broadcasting - yes, and it was terribly depressing to see those stupid bourgeois kids play around with old plastic pieces on their own backsides, "What was not more than a square meter of balcony on the 14th floor of a council building? "Have fun" ... do me a favor and "why do not you" go and slit your wrists or make an overdose of coke on "Mom and Dad" money ... you make me sick
