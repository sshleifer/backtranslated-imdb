I remember that I saw this at the best time when I was about 7 years old. I was a huge comic book reader at the time and everything that had to do with superheroes was eagerly awaited. The end result, however, was not too impressive. <br /> <br /> I knew about Diana Prince's "Emma Peel" stories, as they had recently finished and Diana had returned to her Amazonian form. However, there was so little action that I was bored in most movies. The graduation costume was an interesting idea, but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie again in my late teens. It had not improved much. Cathy Lee Crosby was better known thanks to That's Incredible, but her acting was no better. The script had some good ideas, like the rogue Amazon and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but it just did not come together and was still boring. <br /> <br /> I think they should have built their backs on story better and built the show into an epic climax. It was too much like a mild spy movie, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book before. The Amazon elements were fascinating, but had to be expanded. <br /> <br /> The film managed to force producers to go to the drawing board and come up with something livelier, albeit with too little stock and a small budget. The budget was also pretty low, and superheroes are not cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the movie was available on DVD, if only as a comparison and as a historical document. Even Superman 4 is available and has nothing about this movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It is worth seeing, for the sake of curiosity and a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions.
