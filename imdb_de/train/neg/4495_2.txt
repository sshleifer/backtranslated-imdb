Spoilers of this and the Matrix follow. <br /> <br /> I really liked the original matrix. It was not a deep movie, despite Fishburne's attempts to philosophize, but it was pretty well done, funny and I have a thing for fighting in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Originally, Neo was the secret life of the rather unfortunate cube worker Anderson. Corporate drone during the day and brave hackers in the evening. At some point he is eventually forced to choose between these lives through his actions - becoming an outlaw fighting the machine or going back to the safe, forgotten world in which he started. Interestingly, he discovers that one is once plagued by illusions Life is shit. He has his girl by his side and his blessing mates, but he eats processed schnapps, dresses in sweats and lives in a really crisp machine. Nevertheless, the truth frees him. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of this first film was in the "what if I ask" questions posed in the eyes of the beholder. What if _I_ the impossible was possible? What if I was "the one"? It does not even matter what you are. The one example with a cool title like this. Agent Smith made a wonderful villain as he embodied all the fear of authority we carry with us He was as unstoppable as a terminator and merciless. At the end of the matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom. <br /> <br /> This film can not fully implement the original film's ideas, with so little of its own verve, bad script and bad cut that I can not believe they had planned those changes. If the dialogue is in a fifth grade and various long words have been randomly inserted, I can not believe they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> My short list of characterization errors: <br / The Oracle goes from mildly helpful, albeit fraudulent, to an absolutely obstructive human being for no real reason. Great "personalities" of the Matrix are introduced without necessity - the Keymaster, for example, was a sweet idea, but just not so interesting a figure. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses his "advisor" role and gets nothing to replace it. <br /> <br /> The people of Zion are not very sympathetic, nor would you really want them to rule the world. <br /> <br /> Problems with special effects: <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are useless and intermittent. In The Matrix, you believed that Neo could lose and that he needed to grow bigger in order to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, it's just the point of view of a badly plotted video game. <br /> <br /> The fight on the highway looked a bit spotty and was not that interesting. <br /> <br /> Pacemaker problems. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, the fight scenes were endless. <br /> <br /> The rave lasted too long - everyone in my row in the theater looked at the clock. Not because we care about good dancing and good orgies, but because we did not know or care about the persons depicted. <br /> <br /> Whatever the hack has written, the Soliloquy of the Creator should be blacklisted. It snaked, used words that the screenwriter obviously did not understand, and was a waste of time and pacemaker. The Creator's speech could have been held in a tenth of the time and with more danger than "Zion exists to give rebels a place where they can not destroy the Matrix." There are now too many people who do not believe that Matrix is ​​in danger of crashing and killing all people who are connected to it, the earth can not even support the people in Zion, not to mention those other people.You can choose one person from Zion to the new one Forming Zion as I wipe away the memories of the Zion people who are currently in the Matrix. "<br /> <br /> Instead, we got a long, elongated heap of Twaddle. If someone argues that it is deep, ask for a transcript and try to break the sentences. Each is too long, through multiple clauses, and uses words with clearer, shorter synonyms. <br /> <br /> So in summary not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I saw the third one. and despite what some reviewers have said, skip it. This turkey will not be saved. <br /> <br /> The reviewers, who think the second and third films were "deep", should see some really deep films. Maybe you read a book or two about rhetoric and debate and maybe a bit of philosophy. This movie is not difficult to understand, but it's hard to bear. <br /> <br /> Scott
