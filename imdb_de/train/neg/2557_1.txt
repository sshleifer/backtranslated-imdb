I actually like asylum films. I made a habit of seeing as many as possible. Even the rip-offs they made were as cool as EXORCISM AND IF A KILLER CALLED. That's just lame. I can not believe that the same guys who did DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA CURSE made that movie !!! It's not even ridiculously bad, like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which is pretty bad, by the way). That's just bad! I mean, I can appreciate and / or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an asylum movie, but this movie takes itself too seriously. I really hope that SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better. This is a movie I can not wait for.
