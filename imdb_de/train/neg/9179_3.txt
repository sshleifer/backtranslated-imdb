It is cheese. If you just want a video game that looks like a movie that looks straight from the computer, the movie is too cheap to make special effects, that's it. My friend and I really had a great time seeing it as the theater was mostly empty and we could pant a little. This movie REALLY requires a fight. <br /> <br /> plot? There was a conspiracy? OK, some stupid college or later types are invited to the "Rave of the Year" and go to one of the San Juan Islands ("If only they had stayed in Seattle, they would have survived." - direct quote, or almost.) visit. They come there and everyone is gone and the site is a bit destroyed (but hey, the barrel is still full!). With the help of an old, encrusted Captain and a Coast Guard (who has behaved a little less tough and less well than Cynthia Rothrock) they fight against many zombies (some who spit acid), get an ear for crazy legends. and mostly killed. That's it. <br /> <br /> It's not quite as bad as Demonicus, but not much and still better than Severed (they are a kind of personal alpha and omega for bad movies - the first is bad fun to pant, and the latter is easy too bad to see more than once). On the other hand, if you expect a video game movie that's as good as Resident Evil, then run away !!! Run away now !!! <br /> <br /> OK, some really big questions (without too many spoilers): Since when did Spanish ships of the 18th century venturing into the Pacific Northwest ????? Why does anyone in the Pacific Northwest smuggle weapons and who - CANADA because he shouted loud ??? Why is a rave on an unnamed (alas, sorry, it's called "Isla del Muerto", Shya, right) San Juan Island - and in the open air this is still THE PACIFIC NORTHWET. And the rave has about 30 people - "the rave of the year," my jerk. <br /> <br /> Luckily, there are many hatchets. Many of them. Everyone has them. It must be a hatchet outlet nearby. <br /> <br /> When the movie started playing with a little "parody" (kicking off I Know What You Did and Jaws), he did not do it nearly enough. <br /> <br /> OK, in the end, if the introductory comments (in one voice, not less) casually mention that one of the characters "gave up their friend to focus on fencing," you can be Make sure there will be some fences at the end of the movie. Not a good fencing, but a few people hacking with swords anyway.
