This movie starts with a normal funeral ... and it's so much based on that ordinary funeral feeling that I lost interest and skipped scenes within 5 minutes of watching it. It seems to me, whoever made this film is so affected that he is trapped in a permanent morbid trance and can not consider anything but death and destruction. Well, I'm not a dark kid from Southpark, I want a movie that gets me into an interesting story within 10 minutes. I will not stay seated and only see 10 minutes of nothing except preparations for a funeral. In her last years, funerals were intriguing, maybe she has enjoyed this "movie".
