I would rate this negative if I could. I did not expect much in this movie, but I was open minded. The whole thing is stupid! The snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a fool and a guy Johnson. Oh how original; If I was a 12-year-old boy, I could laugh about it. I have no idea how this movie became so popular. Seriously the worst thing I've ever seen. I was not entertained, it was not funny, I was not even bored! It was not so bad that it was good, it is just bad. Actually ridiculous. Please do not waste money on this movie. Do not lend this movie. No idea how it is rated that high.
