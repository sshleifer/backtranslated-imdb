The idea was great, the actors were incredible, the story could be very scary, but the writing was bad and there was no depth. I could not really understand this movie. I could not feel the characters, there were many cliffhangers, and the movie ends in a weird way. Was it a happy ending? I dont know. Was it a sad end? Again I do not know. They leave the theater dissatisfied. The movie had so much to give, but could not. Just because you can edit does not mean that you should do it, right? I would not really recommend this movie because you just can not say you left the movie as if it was finished. You will only be confused. Trust me, you will probably thank me if you do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
