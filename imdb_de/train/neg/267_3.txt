The episodic version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers is set at a deadly slow pace after Johnny Rico leaves his parents, the (not very attractive) girl he longs for and joins the mobile infantry. The aliens on the show are nothing to the barbarian bugs from the movie, but are like squid-monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths. <br /> <br /> While watching this version, I was always amazed at how fruity it was. You managed to do it all. The show's main focus is on the relationships between the recruits and the aching, prolonged glances they get through their armor sights, with the '80s synth pop sometimes arriving * during * the sparse fighting sequences that eventually emerge in the last few years episodes. In terms of design, Top Gun owes it a debt that has shared in terms of pace and content (and everything that goes with it).
