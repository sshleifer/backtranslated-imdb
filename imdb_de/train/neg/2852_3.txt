This is a totally uncomfortable, if smooth, movie. I tried it because it's the two good actors, Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, and because the plot line - a mob boss just released from a psychiatric ward - sounds promising. The movie is a comedy, sorta. What we have is an endless series of shots - you should forgive the pun - of people in dimly lit and elegant, albeit somewhat unreal interiors shooting at each other - in the head, stomach, kneecap, foot, heart (not part of the Heart) anatomy is avoided, it seems), while vague and cryptic dialogues are spoken, some apparently postmodernly humorous. Goldblum's dialogue for the entire movie could fit on a 3x5 card, and he wears a single facial expression - a sardonic grin - throughout. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines are doing their best. Burt Reynolds makes a cameo. The credits include Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I somehow missed them (good steps from their side). The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and unappetizing; I suppose, a heritage in the style of "Pulp Fiction", "Fargo" and "Natural Born Killers". If you liked them, you will probably like them.
