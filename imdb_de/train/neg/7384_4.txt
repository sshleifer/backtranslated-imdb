STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is sent on an intelligence mission to France along with three new recruits of the young strike teams after disobeying a direct line up. But the night before the scheduled stroke, they are all roughly slaughtered by a murderer with seemingly inhuman strength. As the French police romp around with their own investigation, he goes in search of those responsible themselves to uncover a corrupt faction of the military that is dealing with a deadly new drug that alters a human's DNA and gives them terrifying new strength. <Br /> <br /> Wrong cover. Bad title Bad manipulation in post production. And bad trailer. Pretty bad movie. But I have to say, I do not think Attack Force is the worst thing. I know this will make me unpopular with most other reviewers (maybe not with Steveday!), But I think a lot of criticism goes back to the bad news that went before the movie, not to the actual quality itself. <br /> I have to say that there was not nearly as much synchronization or uncomplicated editing as I wanted to believe. The sync there (which sounded like Martin Sheen with a groin problem!) Was pretty dreadful and quite common, but was not used for as much of the movie as I had thought. The plot went pretty smoothly, considering that the original finished movie called Harvester was all mixed up. As another reviewer has noted, the movie has a nice gothic look, a new note for a Seagal movie. <br /> <br /> The absolute killer nadir however was the complete and complete lack of exciting action, with only a few ill-filmed fighting scenes for every fun. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest, but I would rather see that as Flight of Fury, Today You Ster or Out for a Kill. **
