When discussing a movie titled "Snakes in the Airplane," we should point out early on that the snakes are damned important to the plot. <br /> <br /> What we have here are very bad CGI snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes. Snakes are scary because they appear slimy, they crawl and slip. These snakes do nothing like that. They glide along like in a video game. They are cartoon snakes. I would go so far as to say that even someone who had a great phobia against real snakes would not find them scary. Why on earth should you then include extreme close-ups of these CGI failures? Why not rely on suspense? The whole thing is less ethics. or better still, why should not they look the same? and then maybe use them sparingly <br /> <br /> take a look at the carpenters of John 'the thing'. Here we have real mucus and uncanny proportions. 20 years pass and we get this bunch of stinking Sfx-filth "snakes in the plane". When will these people wake up and smell the coffee? Special effects go backwards! <br /> <br /> You could say that, but the movie is a joke, right? I am sure with this idea, but make it good! In addition to the above, this movie has crap dialogue. and the music and sound effects are by no means scary or memorable. <br /> <br /> I could handle any other actor that is part of this movie except Jackson. What did he do there? the man who played the trumpet ten years ago. Is this a career development? Do you offer people value for money? No. I'd like to know what Tarantino was thinking when he was halfway through the stink of a movie. <br /> <br /> The current generation seems to have very low expectations. and Hollywood seems to offer them exactly what they want. On leaving the cinema, I saw a series of ads for some really horrible-looking future releases, including ... DOA: Dead or Alive, (another) CGI animal movie titled "Flushed Away" and another crap comedy named " Click ". Also, I've seen some horrible trailers, including one for (another) crap British horror / comedy. I have not really seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time. <br /> <br /> I expect this movie to be on sale in the DVD bargain section for Â£ 1 in 6 months. And if you expect to see a black comedy with tons of great-looking snakes, and some cool dialogues of samuel l jacksons. Forget it.
