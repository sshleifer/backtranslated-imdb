I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because a friend really wanted to see it, so I went with it. When I went in, I did not care about the movie, but when I left the theater, I really regretted having spent two hours of my life navigating this lukewarm production. The "stories" are almost forgotten, except that most of them were terrible. What do Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have to do with Paris? The endless parade of American actors definitely gave this French film a remarkable non-French feel. The stereotypes about Paris were endless. Yes, most of them played clichés about Paris, but because they had made fun of French clichés so much, they directly and regrettably encouraged them again. Yes, Paris is the city of love. We understood it. <br /> <br /> The worst segments were: that led by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); the one with Nick Nolte; the pantomime (the worst?); the hair products; the one with Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as cowboy in the middle of Paris?); the vampire (when I think of Paris, I think of Elijah Wood). The one with Natalie Portman, who really looked like a commercial by Mentos and was stupid (the blind young man should know that Portman only played a role when she called him). It went on and on. It felt endless. <br /> <br /> I did not like the Coen Bros that much. It really plays with these Parisian clichés, but I did not find it funny. Just annoying. The Gus Van Sant was interesting, but he was so small (and the punchline was obvious) that he barely registered. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby in a nursery to babysit a baby for a wealthy woman. Nice irony there. And the segment about the African being stabbed. It's the best segment in the movie, but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. The story could have taken place in every city in the world. <br /> <br /> The last segment, that with the chubby middle aged woman, was also interesting, but the tone was bad. They wanted to celebrate their limited understanding of French, but the segment proved condescending. <br /> <br /> The entire project felt compelled and uninspired. Almost as the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism. All in all, "Paris Je T'Aime" was a terrific movie experience with only 10 to 15 minutes of interesting material.
