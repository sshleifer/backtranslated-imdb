I can not usually say that a movie is not worth watching, but this is certainly a milder circumstance. The only true benefit of this film is Cornelia Sharpe, who looks pretty attractive and the fact that this movie is REALLY short. <br /> <br /> The story in the movie is unbelievably boring, and it's almost never going anywhere in the movie. None of the characters are of any interest at all, and there is no need to worry about anyone. I'm not sure why all over the world Sean Connery agreed to make this movie, but he definitely should have passed it on. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could see this movie is if you die -hard Sean Connery fan and just want to see everything he has done. Save this for the last moment. <br /> <br /> Well, if by some miracle, despite my rating (or any of the other reviews on this site) seeing the end, then I hope you enjoyed it more than I did. Thanks for reading.
