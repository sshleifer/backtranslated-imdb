It is a bit strange that a story that takes place in part of Oslo, where a very high percentage of residents are of Asian origin, does NOT show ASIAN or AFRICAN persona, even as an extra. This fact probably describes the Norwegian race relations in general. - <br/> <br /> NO SPOILER - ONLY A BRIEF INTRODUCTION DESCRIPTION: Buddy portrays four young people living in a shared flat in Oslo. The protagonists are two young men who are unable to seriously manage their lives, and one could say that the film may be about being undecided and avoiding responsibility - a kind of fear of growing up. The story plays with typical teen dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models. Quite the clich√©. Although the story is a bit funny, the acting is good and as a "young person" you can somehow identify with the "crazy" situations of the characters and complicated love affairs, I do not find the story or the characters very believable. Too polished and missing in the depth. This film uses all the classic tricks that the public likes to create an entertaining movie as intellectual as "Friends" (yes, shown on TV). <br /> <br /> Has the Norwegian film found its identity? Fallen in the well-known American style. <br /> <br /> How about seeing Lukas Moodysson's Tillsammans (Together)?
