This is an extremely stupid and little-watched movie about slavery in the West Indies and it plays Puddy from the "Seinfeld" show! Patrick Warburton made his debut in this film and is much slimmer here. Oliver Reed has received a top bill, but he is hardly in the movie. Warburton plays a white slave and it's funny to see all the young and horny women of rich old men bid on him because they all want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays a brothel owner and they are so much nudity in the movie. If there are no drunken orgies in the brothel, it is the young women who are with him. Then, of course, towards the end of the slave revolt and there is the bloody conflict. No real political message like the movie "Burn", but just another constructive tool of action to drive the story forward. Incredibly they made a sequel and Warburton and the rest of the cast came back! I hope they paid a lot of money because this first movie is pretty bad. Nudity makes it easy to see, and Warburton's lack of accent sometimes makes it ridiculous. Very bad movie, but I have to admit that I want to see the sequel.
