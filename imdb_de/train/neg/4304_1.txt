This is an anti-Serbian propaganda film for television. <br /> <br /> "The Muslims are good, the Orthodox Christian Serbs are bad." <br /> <br /> That's the message. <br /> <br /> The use of "entertainment" to deliver a propaganda message is nothing new. <br /> <br /> This movie puts it on dick. <br /> <br /> And apparently many viewers and reviewers take it up. <br /> <br /> I know better. <br /> <br /> The Serbs have rescued under General Draza Milhalovitch and his Chetniks 500 downed US German airmen during World War II. Churchill chose to betray Milhalovitch and put British support behind the Communist Tito. Roosevelt followed this example and as a result Yugoslavia was handed over to communist Tito after the end of the war. <br /> <br /> And US ally Milhalovitch has since been smeared by the media. <br /> <br /> This film is part of the anti-Serb propaganda campaign developed by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG), which culminated in Kosovo "war" in which Serbia was bombed by NATO because the ICG " false "mass graves claimed" in Kosovo filled with "victims" of the evil Serbs The fact that there were no such mass graves and the Albanians (Muslims) did not have a business in Serbian Kosovo are facts that are not printed by most media. I chose this movie to see it One sentence description on the video cover looked interesting. <br /> <br /> Imagine my disgust when I found out I was wrong, one Instead of hiring another branch of the propaganda machine that targets Serbia, instead of this propaganda, someone should make a film about the fact that the Clinton administration is unwilling to talk with Congress and with the American people about its K complicity in delivering weapons from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> I will not stop waiting for such a movie.
