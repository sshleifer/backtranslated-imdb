My wife and I like to rent really dumb horror movies / sci-fi movies and laugh with our friends. We saw it on fullmoondirect.com and decided to include it in our Netflix list. Well, when I say that this movie is awful, I mean it well. Everything about it, the drama, the camera work, the story, the costumes, are just cheeky and inexpensive, but that's what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually going to go there. I really hope that the one who made this movie did not mean it seriously, because if so, that would just be sad. If you really want to see silly horror movies to make fun of them, then I recommend them.
