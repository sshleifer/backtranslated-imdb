I've seen the Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's Scary Stories book. After this story, the Wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - tows you, tows you to the skies and pulverises you. Although it sounds like a rather bizarre idea, Schwartz's story has a pretty coherent idea. <br /> <br /> The movie "Wendigo" is not. It essentially consists of every horror movie clich√©: The family moves into a new house, and weird things begin, everyone who does them harm asks for it, and everyone should listen to the old Indian. I saw this stuff so many times that I did not count anymore. <br /> <br /> However, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey in "Malcolm in the Middle") have done much better.
