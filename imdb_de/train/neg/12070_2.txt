I just bought one of those "Legacy of Horror" 50 movie pack collections and you would think that I'm still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie in it. Sometimes you find an entertaining but pugnacious movie like The Devil's Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of Alfred Hitchcock's great films (some are not horror, they're only there because Hitchcock has done some horror and excitement), but sometimes it seems that they put on films like The Island Monster and that because they can not accept the fact that they would easily forget and that should be the case. <br /> <br /> So we are opening up a kind of Westing game idea. The rich but cruel and abusive father, played by Carradine (that is a feature of this character), has died leaving his inheritance to his children and servants, whom he still hates. Carradine performs as good as ever, but he's mostly lagged in a voice-recording and flashback sequence, so we can stay in the mediocre / terrible performances. The rest of the cast is either over or underacted in scenes. Since this was an independent movie of the 70's, lighting and effects are pretty limited. It's hard to get much suspense when the viewer does not see what's going on in some scenes. At least some actors like the servants Igor and Elga are trying hard, and I'm ashamed to admit that in the end I giggled mostly for sheer stupidity, but still with somewhat less luck, that they pretty much made one version of Twist to another who did it, but not enough to improve the quality of the film. They are not meant to like the characters because they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic, but they take them to a whole new level and make many unsurpassed. The death scenes are pretty bad and the tension is not really there. It proves that you would probably enjoy the movie package "Chilling" with 20 films like House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop of Horror with Jack Nicholson and Night of the Living Dead about it. This is best avoided.
