If you are not petrified by Russian people or wild boars, this movie is a runny nose. Actually, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes and had to resist the urge to just leave the theater. I wish I had. A waste of an absolutely beautiful Saturday evening. <br /> <br /> Even "Silent Hill" was more frightening. Heck, even "Pan's Labyrinth" was scary. I'm still unclear what should be scary in this movie. <br /> <br /> At first, I am very suspicious of films that use "Pidgin Russian", as was the case in the preface. It has been embarrassing since I brought a group of my Russian friends and we are all crammed together. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, luckily for me (and probably you too) this movie has already escaped my mind and I just came out here an hour ago. So I have no details, just grimy images that go nowhere, and some languishing, now dead, hope that anything would happen. <br /> <br /> Maybe I've seen a completely mutilated version of this movie because I can not believe it got such great reviews here (which is why I saw it) and ended up being not just horror or suspense, but also the entire entertainment value was completely missing. <br /> <br /> I give him a 2, because yes, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up and did not leave.
