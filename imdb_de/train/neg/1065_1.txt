On the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invited another couple to this film. I really apologized to them - all four of us hated it and spent all of our time looking at our watches until the movie was finally over. Half of the vignettes are bizarre and have a very low entertainment value. There were few scenes from Paris - for example, I was looking forward to pictures from the Latin Quarter, but could not see anything. Most of the scene was in a bar. No one in the theater laughed at anything or reacted in any way. If you like bizarre, sophisticated, pseudo-intellectual films, you should not miss this. If you're down to earth like me, you'll be sorry to see it.
