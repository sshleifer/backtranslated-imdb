Literally, every aspect of this sci-fi low-budget streak falls into the categories classified for its predecessors, contemporaries, and the following. Bad special effects, a faint plot, ridiculous amounts of blood and blood, annoying and pointless characters, all you can expect. "Attack of the Sabretooth" is about a new resort where owners make genetically modified Smilodon cats an attraction. The cats flee and start killing people, the guy who runs the show wants to save them and does not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them. There are a group of visitors and some employees who want to rebel and kill the cats <br /> For the special effects, the film is an average performance considering the budget. The sabretooths are represented by bad CGI. Surprisingly, the cats are more realistic in a closer, more detailed shot than in the longer, more distant shots, where the CGI is better hidden. Their attacks are ruthlessly bloody and unpleasant. As expected, they attack, tear off arms and legs and leave very little behind. This is part of the reason why the film is in poor condition. <br /> <br /> The plot and the characters are just as disgusting. We have some college kids coming to the island and they're planning a scavenger hunt. And take it very, very seriously. Even as much as invading private property, manipulating security systems, and stealing. Why are you taking a simple game so seriously? Did I miss something? Was there money there? Or were they sent to do it? I do not know, I could barely follow the movie. But it seemed to me that they were just kidding. Nevertheless, they went too far for normal. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Sabretooth" is a very bad movie. Even for a low-budget sci-fi movie, this is a very poor and cheap example. It will bore most viewers to tears, might be attractive to some and make you giggle and laugh. And remember, this is not a comedy, it's a cheap horror movie, so that's not funny.
