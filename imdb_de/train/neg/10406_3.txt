Attention: This review contains smaller spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well, the authors of the first tremors have no official ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for direct entry into video art. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very boring movie. Where the hell are the Graboids ??? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative lack of Graboids in the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this entry into the series should be a "character study". Unfortunately there is no interesting character in the film, except for Billy Drago, who is given too few lines, too little to do and ends up with too little screen time. What saved the second and third movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. If there was no action on screen, you could rest assured that Burt Gummer would also be interesting to listen to and / or watch. In this film Gross plays with Hiram Gummer a very bad and boring replacement. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) look good on screen, but that's about as good as it is. <br /> <br /> I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was performed at 101 minutes. Pretty good for direct video. After watching, I am sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long. There are long dialogues that are boring and do not drive the story any further. Was there a rush to make this movie? I do not think more time could and should have been spent on the script. <br /> <br /> I thought I had met a goldmine when I saw Tremors 4, which was packed for sale with .... What luck, I thought, pay for # 4 and get # 1 for free. Well, after watching Tremors 4, I like to think that I paid for the original and got this mess for free. I can not imagine paying a single penny for Tremors 4 even. <br /> <br /> Tremors 4: The Legend Begins rated 3 out of 10.
