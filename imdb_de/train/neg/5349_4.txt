This video buffer is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis' career. As in the tradition of Disney, quality is sacrificed in the name of a quick deposit; This is a lazy retreading process in which Moranis accidentally shrunk along with a few relatives, allowing them to repeat the best scenes of the original film. Instantly obsolete visual effects and somber dialogues abound in this cheesy lamer, making me a jaw for the days of "The Incredible Shrinking Man" when these things were done right. Amazingly, this is led by top cinematographer Dean Cundey, who should either stay with the day job or choose better material next time.
