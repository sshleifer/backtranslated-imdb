The opening scenes move as smoothly as frozen Velveeta. The attempt of a dramatic dialogue only makes me wish that I could better control the fast forward. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or mangy disgusting creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy. Usually I count a body count, so there was a cat (who does not count) a bum, a girl who fell from the sky with a sword in the air (whatever that was) and then the action. Foley artists are respected for using celery to produce the sound of a broken arm, but the sound of biting into an apple for a vampire who bites a victim is simply stupid. I liked Warlock, but this movie just stinks so bad we turned it off, and it was so forgotten that we rented it a year later, just to turn it off.
