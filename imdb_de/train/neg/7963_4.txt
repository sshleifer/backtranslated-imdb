I'm a big fan of old horror movies, and since I'm middle-aged, a movie for me was old, shot before 1970, with most shot in the 1920s-1960s. I'm not a big fan of modern horror movies, with the exception of Creepshow 1, which I thought was great. I could remember the stories, but I really enjoyed the monster in the boxing story with Hal Holbrook, and that too about the really clean guy was a great ending. All stories were great. Why do I like her so much? The characters had a decent development, the lines were very clear on who was good and who was bad, the horror pieces were raised with a scary face nearby, and the funny parts were really funny! This sequel either lacks these elements or they are completely missing! I'm just writing that because I saw it in part because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things, like writing movie reviews on IMDb.com, lol. If George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get a top bill, they'll tell you something I do not know what this was rated about, but it looks like PG to me), and that's not good for a movie that does not do anything else is going. It will be displayed on the Encore cable channel when you die (yuck yuck) to see it.
