The drama is a bad ham, ALL jokes are superficial and the target group are clearly very young children, provided they have a below-average IQ. I realize that it was meant for children, but also Malcom in the middle. Nevertheless, there are still humor and situations for adults. What should we expect from a show directed by Bob Saget, the only comedian? Who is less funny than a ball beating the groin of a man is probably the reason he stopped giving America's Funniest Home video to college. Expose your children to stupidity and they become more stupid.
