I have nothing against religious films. I think religious people need to see something on a Saturday night. What really irritates me, though, is when the report on the DVD box does not show this fact to the potential viewer. It's NOT cool to play religious propaganda as a conversation, brother. <br /> <br /> And even if I were a religious person, I would have to agree with most of the other posters here, this movie was a mess. Badly judged, badly played, badly handled and the soundtrack attempt was weird. The wrong accents were terrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes and the continuity was out the window. The only reason we sat through this lame waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead. Should have just gone to bed. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no redeeming qualities for this film, unless you are the religious type who immediately advocates everything that preaches your beliefs to the unbelievers, even if it's a garbage heap. If not, avoid this at all costs. Do not be fooled by the spelling of the box.
