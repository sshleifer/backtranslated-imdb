Read on and note - you could save 88 minutes of your life (that's all!). <br /> <br /> Indefatigably gloomy, this movie focuses on the production of a modern American town in miniature fable in the Capra style. If failed .... completely and absolutely not. I tried to think of a good cause and I can not. Let me mention some of the highlights ... <br /> <br /> People are not dying, they can spend eternity as immigrants in the Santa factory. Angels are actually ex-cowboys sitting in trees. Santa Claus can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /> <br /> And the conspiracy ... I will not spoil it for you, but in movies there has to be some light, just to stand out from the dark, but there is none. Even the photography is bleak - snow is shown at the end of freezing and looks cold, damp and miserable everywhere. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the movie has a happy ending. What a relief !
