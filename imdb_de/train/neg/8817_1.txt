No, I have never seen one of the "Santa Slasher" series, d. H. "Silent Night, Deadly Night", the original "Black Christmas" or this "Christmas Evil". I've heard everything about her reputation, or, MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas). I thought I would rent this because I heard that it appears as a reference in a 'Fat Guys At the Movies' segment. <Br /> <br /> Mothers should be against it, but not for the ooooohhhh "killer" Santa, but for the matter, this movie was just crap. Boring, long? even in just 92 minutes, crap. <br /> <br /> Little boy sees Santa Claus coming down a chimney in 1947, bringing presents, eating some goodies and miraculously floating up the chimney. Boy goes to bed, but returns to the living room to see mum and Santa (somehow) how to start. Apparently this kid messed up the rest of his life, though the scene was about as hot as when Ralphie's dad got the "leg lamp" in "A Christmas Story." He was so restless, he went to the attic and cut his own hand. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to the future! Well, it's 1980 and the boy works in a toy factory. We smell that he's a bit offside, and he's following both children and parents alike. Who is naughty, who is nice, blah blah. It takes a good two-thirds of the movie to finally catch him? as if that is not suggested by the first picture. NO FILM should take that long. <br /> <br /> I admit, this movie had built its tension, but only because I had always expected it to do something with something. When he finally punishes "good-natured", he is as graphic as a "garbage-card" card. And I did not mention the WTF end. I think it was a metaphor but in reality it's just as weird as the rest of the movie. (Take the brother who is upset that his sibling is killing, and his solution is um, the killing.) Do not open this mess, even on Christmas Eve or the Evil One. Again, I did not look at the other "Santa Slashers", but they sucked badly. It has built tension due to the nature of the film and never brought a decent gift.
