Apart from a few good films, I can hardly say anything positive about this film. The only real question is the dilemma of the protagonist, whether he wants to stay with his childhood friends in the world of misery or leave them and start his own life. Plenty of "emotionally powerful" scenes do not fit this plot and, due to bad acting, do not manage to create the intended atmosphere. The director manages only to introduce the dilemma of Anthony and finally brings a simple solution. The characters do not seem to develop, though it's difficult to talk about characters ... except perhaps Sonny. Next to him, actors can not play much, and when some of them are obliged to do so, they come out as self-loving amateurs. I wonder what has ruined the movie more: the superficial script, throwing away all the potential of the conspiracy, or the bad acting that disturbs any remaining stimulus.
