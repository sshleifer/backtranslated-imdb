Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who made her fiery sinking in 1957. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie is mainly set in 1986. The movie falls in the 80s / stupid special effects, including some crazy, denied rocking horses. Anyway, Mary Lou's mind does bad people and tries to take over a person's body. Whether she succeeds or not, you have to be careful to find out. Anyway, the movie is mostly boring and based on a bunch of worthless characters. This is not really a sequel, the only thing that is common with the first one is the name of the grammar school. It has the average horror movie falling back, Gore, senseless nudity, beating against the Catholic Church. Basic stuff, boring movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is decent enough to get 3 out of 10 points. You can waste your time doing something else.
