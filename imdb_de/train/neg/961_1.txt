Stupid, simple and short, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN FROM NOWHERE) is nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> This short story (just over 60 minutes) is not so much inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns It's a rip-off of Sam Raimi's THE QUICK & THE DEAD (his well-known tribute to the spaghetti westerns ), which was brought into a contemporary environment. In QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone's character seeks revenge against the insidious sheriff (played by Gene Hackman), who when she was just a villain, put her father's fate (a short Cameo by Gary Sinise) in her hands; She accidentally shot him through the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by nimble Ryoko Yonekura) seeks revenge against the insidious Mr. Tojo (played with the minimalist allure of Shingo Tsurumi) who, when she was just a villain, put her father's fate in her hands; She slipped her foot off the clutch, and dear old father was pulled and quartered by a tractor-trailer. The only major difference, despite the attitudes, is the fact that Tojo Saki is sadistically crippled with ?? Well, I will not spoil that for you if you decide to look at it. <br /> <br /> In short, saki? a pale imitation of Clint Eastwood's "man without a name"? is riding in the city? Basically there is a car dealer and a tavern next to an American military base, so that's enough for a city? corrupted by Tojo, the local Crimean lord with a ridiculously high price on his head, for reasons it has never explained or explored. Saki, who professes her real identity as a bounty hunter, shoots at local gunmen whose choreography shows more than a passing resemblance to the works of Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, at the end of the film, Saki has had to endure all her torture by the bad guys, but she rises for the occasion. on his knees, in a ridiculous attempt at a surprise ending? and defeat all their enemies with a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Do not ask where she gets the rocket launcher from. Just look at it. Do not try to laugh. <br /> <br /> Image quality is average for DVD release. Several sequences have a grainy quality, but all in all this is not a bad transmission. The sound quality is sometimes left to the imagination, but it is not a bad transfer. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie.
