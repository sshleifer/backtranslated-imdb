Absolute garbage, worse fighting scenes than a 20-year Van Damme movie or American Ninja, etc. <br /> <br /> Really awful drama, not a skill that's in sight throughout the movie, is like a cast of wood sculptures /> <br /> Just look at how bad this movie is. It was acceptable in the 80's, but this is a movie from 2006, I did not have much love for this movie since it was not born in the movie 80's. <br /> <br /> If you like real combat movies, then check out Tony Jaa at Ong Bak and the Protector. These are real martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> Have a laugh and look at this today. You can see the unintentional humor of how gloomy it is.
