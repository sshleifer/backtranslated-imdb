I absolutely love the book that Robin Klein wrote, and I was very excited to hear that a book-based movie was about to start. <br /> <br /> But I was very disappointed when I saw the movie because it did not record what I loved about the book - the absolutely ridiculously funny Erica and the interesting way she did it Considered world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning I realized that it was not the same as I had imagined in the book. So I just drove along. It was not that bad, I think. Miss Belmont was completely different than I imagined! I did not think she could smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who plays her, is hilarious! <br /> <br /> I think the movie and the actors / actresses it contained were good job, but unfortunately I'm such a fan of the book (one of my favorite books ever) that I could not help but be disappointed = P
