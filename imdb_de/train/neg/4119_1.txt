Thank God I did not go to the movies for this movie. I would apologize very much for the money I have given. I saw it on TV and could not believe my eyes. I wonder if a movie could be worse than this one. They spent millions of dollars on this film. terrible spectacle and terrible scenario. I think the other people who wrote comments are the man who works for this film company; Can you still laugh about this kind of movie in the year 2000? embarrassing...
