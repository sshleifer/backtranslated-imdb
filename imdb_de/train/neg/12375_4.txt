The good thing is at least fresh: Almost no films about dance music and the club scene (if made at all) have come to the cinemas. And it also radiates a lot of energy, from the music to the presentation of Ibiza. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that it can not decide what it wants to be. Although it's definitely a mockumentary in the line of This is Spinal Tap, the creators also realized that they did not want to play copycats. However, it fails because of the jokes, because it is not written very well and most of the characters are underdeveloped. And it has no bow in its script and the instruction to bring it to 90 minutes. Why not reduce it to 75? The production department and cinematography are still trying to save the day (eg Paul's home). <br /> <br /> Strangely and unexpectedly, it's all over. Especially the scenes with Beatriz Batarda provide a theatrical power. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's a mess, it's a bit entertaining on a simple level, but you'd rather spend a night at your favorite club.
