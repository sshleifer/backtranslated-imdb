I experienced "Sorrows Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I think I had high hopes in this movie. Unfortunately, this is just another business card from Visual FX. The story is pretty lame. The poor lighting and camera, along with the less good editing and music, make the film of low quality. <br /> <br /> Is it really too much to ask if FX shorts have better stories and the rest? The technical production is at the FX level! Not only can you get away with cool FX in shorts, it's been 5 years since "405" made a big jump. At least as short, cool and even a bit funny! None of this can be said about "lost worries".
