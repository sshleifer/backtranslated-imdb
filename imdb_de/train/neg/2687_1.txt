Eleven "big" filmmakers, eleven garbage. Eleven minutes of pure boredom, sophistry, condescension, forbearance. Treats for people of all nations. Yussef Chahine from Egypt gives a "Hip Hur Hurray!" for terorism in its amateurish segment. On the other side of the green line, we have Israel's Amos Gitai, who uses his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a jerky newscaster. Mexico's Alejandro González Iñárritu focused on the Twin Towers, but seemed to have forgotten to turn his camera on. Sean Penn did not know there were no buildings in the shadow of the Trade Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura from Japan ignored the whole thing. Claude Lelouch focuses on a banal and clichéd love affair. Ken Loach from the UK focuses on Chile. Etc.
