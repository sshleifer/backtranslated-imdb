What a disappointment! It started with a fascinating mystery and interesting characters. Granted, it moved at the speed of a snail, but I was still firmly in control and kept watching. David Morrissey always has good value for money and he was a good leader. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were embarrassed by possible terrorist connections. <br /> <br /> But then Morrissey's character was killed and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was boring, boring and boring. It turned out that the whole thing was a very small beer and the DÃ©nouement was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> Five hours of my life for it? My advice: watch the color dry instead.
