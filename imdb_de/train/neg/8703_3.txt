Primal Species (1996, dir. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists are surprised when it turns out their cargo contains living dinosaurs. The Army Command team must now think fast when it comes to preventing the extinction of human species rather than reptiles. That's pretty much everything. The spectacle is acceptable only for a few characters. The story is bad, the entire movie is based on the army and the Marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. This movie was released three years after Jurassic Park. Instead, this movie seems to have appeared 13 years before Jurassic Park. The dinosaur costumes are so badly made, and I mean costumes. There are obviously people who are disguised, and this movie makes no attempt to hide it. A scene in which a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way that looks like someone is riding the creature. That's a good thing that comes from this movie. The short term. With only 1 hour and 15 minutes you do not waste too much on your life, but try to avoid it altogether. - Officer (Brian Currie)
