Everyone does things that they regret later. Things that they desire could be attributed to drugs or third-party property. Things that seem rational at the time, but later turn out to be inviting invitations to suffering and endless charges of stupidity. For some it is the signing of the new lobster, for others it is picking a murderous hitchhiker, for others it sends their bank accounts to millionaires of the Third World, who are mysteriously strapped in cash. <br /> <br /> For me it was a movie. <br /> <br /> D-War: Dragon Wars In retrospect, I should have guessed how eco-friendly and thoroughly recycled this film would turn out to be from its dull and repetitive title. But with my willing suspension of unbelief and a naive belief stemming from the cool-looking poster in the lobby, I wanted this movie to work. By the time the old man in the pawn shop explained the whole back story after fifteen minutes, I had the sudden sinking revelation that resulted from knowing every plot point of an unseen movie. And worse, I knew how bad every point would be. <br /> <br /> Let me be very clear here, that English does not lack enough nuance and depth in the realm of the ultimate evil to describe exactly how bad this is. Film is real. <br /> <br /> I was wrong to know all the twists of the movie. In the spirit of the old Godzilla films, whose scales are not worthy to fill, they sped up additional negotiations each time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogues. <br /> <br /> It was infested with close calls, wondrous escapes, and concentrated deposits of ill-explained fears. <br /> <br /> This movie would happen if the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers were allowed access to the state defense budget. And a lot of schnapps. <br /> <br /> Let me try to explain it. <br /> <br /> Imagine being able to get all the coolest sets of successful action films of the last decade: First take the rasta-speaking army of Amphibians from Star Wars Episode One and remove their Prozac until they willing to beat Navy Seals. <br /> <br /> Next, make approaches to Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise (you can even call him Ethan as a "subtle" Nicke of the Mission Impossible franchise.) and give them a lot of film noir Narrative, so that no one feels confused when he tries to follow the depths of the pools of their thoughts. <br /> <br /> Finally add a croaking villain in pointed armor worthy of a Lord of the Rings Yardsale and some giant cobra. They are furious that their scenes from the last issue of King Kong have been canceled, and put them all in modern order on Day Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Now go to the pharmacy to find something for your sudden migraine headache. When you return, pur√©e these ingredients until all the overlooked signs of originality are dissolved in a homogenized mass of cheese and semi-gelatinized. <br /> <br /> In several places in this picture I said aloud: "Stop the bad movie" and burst into tears. <br /> <br /> Talking about a B-movie would be an undeserved promotion. After the summer school and a lot of physiotherapy, you might get a C-level movie if you could sleep through most of the time. In short, if you're ever dealing with money and brain burning cells, and the need to punish humankind for vile, unspoken sins against humanity, maybe Dragon Wars is the movie for you.
