I love kitschy horror movies. I do not care if the acting is below average or if the monsters look crazy. I liked this movie, except for the confused feeling from the beginning of the movie to the end. I do not need a 10-page dissertation or a sign with large letters, which explains a conspiracy. But Dark Floors needs the "What's in this movie?" to a whole new (annoying) level. What is this film about? <br /> <br /> This is not uncommonly scary or exciting, but if you have one and a half hours to kill and / or you feel frustrated and confused, then hire this winner.
