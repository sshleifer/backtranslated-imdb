I will give this movie two stars, because it is teeming with beautiful photography. Otherwise, celestials and stereotypes teem with us: mountain dwellers are either dumb white rubbish of the fanatically religious or ragged racist type or white indians. Indians are magical people who can move around without noise, disappear in no time, talk to animals and read long-distance thoughts. And so on. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I kept wondering what the movie was about (except that I have pretty pictures of mountains, log cabins, forests, an assortment of animals, spirited mountain dwellers, and freaky people in the world) Church). <br /> <br /> The story touched on a whole range of topics, but did not examine any of them in detail. This was neither a story about growing up during depression nor about orphans and the struggle for identity. It tried to be all those things and more that made it superficial and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Although the film should be from Little Tree's education, we learn almost nothing about it. He received a brief summary of the history of his people (who were brave and stoic) and a distillery demonstration; tried to chop wood (where he failed) and run whiskey (literally); learned to read (and possibly write) with the help of grandma and her dictionary - and that was it. Apparently he did not learn much during his boarding school stay because he was locked up in the attic. <br /> <br /> Grandmother and Grandfather and Graham Greene's character, however, made Little Tree a true one in the end. A spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - to which I am paraphrasing here - is "riding the Navajos" and "being involved in a few wars" was to "catch up" grandmas and granddads and Graham Green's character in heaven (instead of, for example, marrying girls, marrying, having children or something nonsense). <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to say that I found Grandpa's trade offensive. Why did it have to be a whiskey? To counteract the stereotype of the "drunken Indian"?
