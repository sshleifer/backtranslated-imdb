I really wanted to have this movie, but it was just impossible. The acting was extremely hammy, the plot was annoying and the tempo was slow, sooooo slowwwwwww. The whole time I was sitting in the theater, I wanted the movie to end. Twenty minuets to film and I pray for an end. Sure, some of the visuals were nice, but guys, I mean really! And for a movie about a man who is tuning magical instruments, there really was not much music. The music was annoying and boring. There were also sometimes loud high pitched sounds that were annoying too. Mainly I managed to bore this movie and at the same time sneak out. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it's over. I have to see Tideland and wash that bad taste out of my mouth.
