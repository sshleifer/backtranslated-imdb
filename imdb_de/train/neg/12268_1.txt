I saw about four more Japanese horror movies that were not particularly impressive. However, I could sense that a sensible script was leading the way. <br /> <br /> Not here, no way. It's about a detective trying to bring together similar killings that have happened. When he finds a suspect to interrogate, the suspect freaks out because he constantly sees a ghost. Then the mind begins to follow the detective for a reason that is never explained, and takes up more than half of the film. <br /> <br /> Bad enough? Oh no. The movie is constantly changing to different characters who do not have much to do with the story. I have seen this in other films, where it shows a different perspective. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Even what is actually happening on the screen ends quickly. For example, there are some scenes with a light instrumental score that builds up and ... then it just cuts to another scene. I am aware that this can have a dramatic effect. This is definitely not the intention here. It's just bad editing. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the "mind" that screams only in a way that is not scary or unintentionally funny. It's annoying and a lot happens throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> All the horrors have been done in a better way before, so you can see them all coming. After one of them the movie is over. At that point, a wave of confusion swept over the audience as I sensed that we all felt we were wasting our time. Someone clapped and there was a laugh. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put, AVOID.
