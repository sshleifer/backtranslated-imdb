To make a movie about the prequels and the "real" Star Wars trilogy would even tax a great filmmaker ... Mr. Lucas is not that filmmaker. <br /> <br /> To illustrate the case of a movie A good man in the dark needs a good actor ... Mr Christensen is not that actor. The first 60-80 minutes, with just a few pockets, even more lightsaber fights are overwhelmingly boring, but there is a lack of edge because you already know which main characters survive to the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) has a very volatile role here and the best idea is to keep Jar Jar Binks quiet! <br /> <br /> No, the film only picks up when the chancellor gets in line with the Jedi and has a large (oversized) sequence on the lava cases
