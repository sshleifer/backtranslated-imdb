STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Alice, who defeated Freddy at the end of the last movie, is now try her to readjust her life. But her unborn child carries a demonic presence - Freddy trying to get back into her world. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to know which directors had their big breaks in the Freddy movies - Charles Russell (Eraser, The Mask) Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2 ) and Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2). But while Russell and Harlin did well, Hopkins IMO did something about it A podge with this entry should be quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> The story seems to stretch as far as it can go here, with Freddy, a ridiculous father, and the ridiculous-looking demon baby. Even after about one and a half hours, everything gets pretty tiring and of course not scary at all. <br /> <br /> The phrase "Good appetite, slut" is the only memorable point of this other wise very memorable entry. *
