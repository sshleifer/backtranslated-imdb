Three Russian aristocrats absorb the decadence of Monte Carlo, even though they only have the last franc. To support their lavish lifestyle, the three use the services of a forger and use the banknotes in the casinos, hoping to exchange the fake currency for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, an American envoy, arrives in Monaco with his wife Helen, and the three of them decide to make friends with visitors hoping for financial support. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to continue on his way towards Helena, disappointing the count's maid, who loves Sergius. After all, the circumstances are against the three aristocrats. It is obvious that Von Stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the stupidity of American women and the inappropriate behavior of the aristocrats) rather than telling a story, and the film can really bore modern viewers like me by doing so. Even the acting, which is great in later Evs like Greed and the Wedding March, is being conducted here by the mill. The film could have used improvements at different levels. Rating, 3.
