I lay on my bed and had a really bad cold, flu or whatever. I think maybe I would kill some time to look at some horror movies that my mother bought for me some time ago. I wish I had never selected this movie! After seeing it, I felt even sicker and wanted to vomit. After the words (when I got better, of course), I researched something about Dennis L.Rader and noticed that the Dennis in the film was not comparable to the real one. I hope nobody looks at this movie, but if he does not eat at all, you'll feel the way I felt afterwards. I think you would have a better time to see Santa Claus. 3. At least this movie had better reviews on this site.
