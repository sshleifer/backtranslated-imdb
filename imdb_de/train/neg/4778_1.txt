This is the worst show I have seen in years. I think it should be removed from TVV because of its delay. It's so stupid that I could pass out when I see it. (though I never see it because it's soooo poor) <br /> <br /> Goofs: If Mac says he can not; Almost everything in the world has sugar !!! In the episode "Eddie Monster," when Eddy screams monsters at Terrance, he falls twice in the box. What stupidity. I can not even say the word Fosters Home. I even did a song with my band about how delayed this show is. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
