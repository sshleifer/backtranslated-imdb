Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs. Authority film. Vovochka, the main character, is early branded as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. In the words of the wisdom of some adults he meets on the way, he finds it hard to change his mischievous ways that are worth doing. Personally, I found the actor who played Vovochka too angry to sympathize with him, but the change in tone of the film would make most of them feel the emotional struggle that Vovochka has when he wants to be good, but it happens still bad things. This fight makes the movie a little different than other films of the same genre, that's the little taste I meant. All in all, I did not really care about this movie, though it was most likely meant for a younger audience.
