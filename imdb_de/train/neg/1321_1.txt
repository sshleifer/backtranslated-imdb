Richard Dreyfus is not the star here. He has about three 20-second cameos and what is Gene Barry doing in this movie? No idea, the director was probably his brother! This is a movie that makes no sense at all. The awkward author / director (the same guy) has slaughtered all the talents with his awful uh ... work. I got the DVD for a dime, so I can not complain! But it is funny! And you feel weird and not good. This was in the 70's and it looks like the director was on a bad acid journey and wanted everyone to know what it's like to be in his head. It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched record it quickly foul. It has this "Manson family on acid" mood about it. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how the other reviewer got everything that he made of this movie? Maybe they worked at that time? In any case, be prepared to lose more than 80 minutes of your life and you will never come back. Yes, that's so terrible!
