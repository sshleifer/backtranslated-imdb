It was not a good idea to let the class see this in English. Movies that are more serious and educational can have an impact, but it seems the film has no impact on the class. When the teacher left, the conversations started quickly and I did not hear the words "Shakespeare" or "Tempest." And if you look at that, it's easy to understand why. Acting is nothing special - everyone seems bored Shakespeare always preferred to plan the confrontation with actions and death, but I just could not understand a word that someone said The costumes are not so bad and not even the special effects - the class may not have loved the movie, but they did not have the p * ss either. However, it's hard to joke about a movie that contains no inspiration or joy - the scenes on the ship at the beginning The film was not too bad - although the rain looked a little unrealistic, everything else was done well and well, but where were the severed heads and exploding masts? o was the death? Where was the inspiration? The character of Ariel would have been taken much more seriously if he had been wearing clothes - but since everything was shown, it was just another excuse for a joke. This movie is in no way interesting for both sexes. The women and girls will not enjoy romance or comedy, and there is plenty of naked men and lack of action or death that will scare off most men and boys. The Tempest was not bad, but it felt like something the producers had to do, not something they wanted to do. And the general boredom and the lack of inspiration show. 3.10
