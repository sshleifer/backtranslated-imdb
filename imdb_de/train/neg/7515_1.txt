Sucks. That's all I have to say about this apology for a movie. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. I mean, what the hell did you think? The idiots involved must never shoot other films. The acting was so bad that it was not even entertaining at a bad level. The attempt of a "lesbian scene" was sad. I felt so bad for the ladies involved. This movie is shit! Sucks! Sucks! <br /> <br /> I heard rumors about a sequel. <br /> <br /> God <br /> <br /> Help <br /> <br /> Us <br /> <br /> All
