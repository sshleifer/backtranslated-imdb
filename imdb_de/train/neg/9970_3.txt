People who really liked Problem Child (1990) need to have their heads examined. Who would accept the idea of ​​seeing a malicious little boy make chaos with others and think it's funny? The movie is not funny at all, from beginning to end. It wants to be a cartoon, but the authors do not know that slapstick is not funny when people are attacked by bears or hit by baseball bats. It may be funny in cartoons, but not in a movie. The film's young hero is Junior (Michael Oliver), who has been adopted by foster parents since childhood. The families reject him because Junior finds it difficult. <br /> <br /> He is then thrown into an orphanage where he terrorizes the nuns and writes pen pals to the convicted bow tie killer (Michael Richards). He is soon adopted by Ben and Flo Healy (the late John Ritter and his wife Amy Yasbeck), who want to have a child to be like everyone else in their neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Junior becomes a member of the Healy household, and "Little" Ben is interested in him, though he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear onto the grounds or calling his father "Big" Ben ( Jack Warden), a bigoted politician. <br /> <br /> I think we should look after Junior so that we can look for him if he takes revenge on the people. His new mother Flo is a slut, his grandfather is completely selfish and a little girl - who abhors adoptive children - is such a spoiled brat. <br /> <br /> But what is Junior doing to get the last? Laughing is not funny - it's mean, cruel and sometimes life threatening. <br /> <br /> And what is the message of the movie? That children should solve problems with violence and vandalism? That they should seek friendship by writing to convicted murderers? You definitely do not know what it's like to be a bad kid. Junior is not, he's just a sadistic little guy. There was a time when it was bad for children to beat others. Well, everyone laughs when Junior beats kids up with a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that this film was marketed as a "family comedy". Worse is that the problem child is rated PG. What did the MPAA think when they saw that? There are a lot of profane and mean pranks here, so you can wonder about the separation between PG and PG-13. <br /> <br /> Kids will enjoy that, but parents will be shocked at what's on the screen. For most people, Problem Child is considered a classic for "guilt feelings." A film that someone will disgracefully admit, if he likes, even though the prevailing opinion of the serious viewer is that the film is a piece of crap.
