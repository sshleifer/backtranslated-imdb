After searching this film high and low, I actually found it when I least expected it, one day early on the Sundance Channel. Why I've been endlessly searching for a little vanity project that Chuck Barris did on TV during the last few years, I have no idea. The movie is just awful. The scripted part, which refers to one week. The highlight of the film are of course the real actors who were "too hot for television" or were rejected for some reason. This part is still terrible, but it is pleasant in its own way. Now that I've seen what I've been looking for, will I look at it again in my life? Summoning no !! Do yourself a favor and just look at MUCH MUCH better "confessions of a dangerous spirit" or look for old copies of the current show. The girl's act of provoking licking was only funny, but he saw Jay P. Morgon flashing, and the audience was likely to make me infertile. In retrospect, I am so happy that this was a huge flop, because if it had been a massive hit there could have been a "$ 1.98 Beauty Show Movie" and my friends would certainly have brought the Apocalypse. > <br /> My degree: D
