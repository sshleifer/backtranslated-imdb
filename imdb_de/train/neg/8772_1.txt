There's nothing new for me to say: 4 hours of people keep dying on the same hill. The cast was excellent, but the producer / director / editor / god messed up unfortunately. He should have been eating modest cake (if not for his own sake for the men who died in Kargil), one of those brilliant Bollywood directors, a real scriptwriter, a real editor, a musician hired, a musician who does not care did in a sense (and who seemed to have heard a bad version of "Apocalypse Now" about a cheap Indian drug) hired a real professional crew, threw away all fireworks and told a real story. Unfortunately, like the giants of the Indian army, he made decisions that were terrible to his actors and terrible to his audience. We all died again and again. <br /> <br /> Please do not do that again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal ps: The next time an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha Regiment, I suggest he hire more than one Nepali to represent the team. Surely there are many Nepalese men in Bombay who were last 40,000 to a half million.
