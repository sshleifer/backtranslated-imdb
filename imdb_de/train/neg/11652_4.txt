The script for "Scary Movie 2" just was not finished. This is a problem of the film that is obvious to both the actors and the audience. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans and many of the actors are funny people. and so the movie is not completely humorless. The movie has some funny moments. Overall, "Scary Movie 2" is not nearly as smart and amusing as the original. <br /> <br /> The first "Scary Movie" was a laughing movie. The smallest details of the Slasher film genre became comedic gold. The humor in "Scary Movie 2" is just as cumbersome as unoriginal. They even miss obvious ways to parody. Two of the movie stars are former cast members of "Beverly Hills 90210", and this was a show that begged to be parodied! Ultimately, "Scary Movie 2" is like a fine bottle of wine that opened way too early. The script took much more time to age. 2 out of 5 stars.
