Leave it to geniuses like Ventura Pons, the Spanish director, to convince the higher ones in his country to subsidize this misguided attempt at a movie. The sad state of the film industry in this country is the result of an attempt to make a film out of such thin material. Most of the images that are made in Spain fall into two categories: those about the Spanish Civil War, which like to present the past as the writers see fit. The other kind of movies shows the viewer with a lot of free sex because the "creators" have nothing interesting to say. <br /> <br /> As the movie begins, we can observe Pere's penis as he tries to cut it off and place it on one of the plates in one of the plates. Later, Sandra will show what the audience admires. The story of Pere's appeal to Sandra, a married woman who seems to be happily married, is wrong from the start. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in watching the movie with an earlier, better-portrayed image of Mr. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but unfortunately that has nothing to do with the mess we are punishing at this company to get. In the comments submitted in IMDb, all negative votes come from the Spanish audience, which speaks volumes from them!
