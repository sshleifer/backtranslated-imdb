Eleven-year-old Luke Benward (as Billy "Worm Boy" Forrester) moves to a new city. In his new school, young Benward is grabbed by the other boys. They put worms in his thermos. Benward throws his gag reflex under control and throws a worm at the freckled bully Adam Hicks (as Joe Guire). With the help of bets, he can eat 10 worms in one day - without belching! <br /> <br /> Tall, whimsical Hallie Kate Eisenberg (as Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses her archery skills to help Benward. Director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman promises: "No worms were injured in this film." In a related note, SCTV star Andrea Martin has a fun scene. "How to Eat Fried Worms" is loosely based on Thomas Rockwell's popular novel. Teenage children should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> **** How to Eat Fried Worms (25.08.06) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Alexander Gould
