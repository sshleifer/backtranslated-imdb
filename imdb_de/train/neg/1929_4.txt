Some have praised -Atlantis: The Lost Empire as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so - at least not for adult thinking. <br /> <br /> This script suggests a beginning as a live-action film that appealed to someone as a kind of crap that you can no longer sell to adults. The "crack stick" of many older adventure films has been made long before (think The Dirty Dozen), but -Atlantis is one of the worse movies in this theme. The characters are weak. Even the background presented by each member seems at best incomplete and unpleasant. An MD / Medicine Man, a Tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted to have sons, if we have not seen them before, we've seen mix-and-match quirks. The story of how a companion, Vinny, played by Don Novello (Br. Guido Sarducci), has gone from flower shops to demolition works, is not convincing. <br /> <br /> Only the protagonist Milo Thatch, a young Atlantis-obsessed scientist voiced by Michael J. Fox, has every depth to him. Milo's search for Atlantis continues that of his grandfather, who raised him. The opening scene features a much younger Milo sitting dizzy on one knee while his grandfather turns his tropical helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And although the characters were thin at best, the best thing about -Atlantis was the vocal talent. Commander Rourke does not lose touch with James Garner. Although Rourke is a fairly current military type, Garner demonstrates his ability to easily enliven characters through his delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the climax. I am sorry to say that Leonard Nimoy's dying king is nothing more than obligatory. In addition, as a breakaway expert, Vinny Santorini, Don Novello was notable for one or two well-made, funny lines - but I've always liked Father Guido Sarducci. <br /> <br /> Also well done was the computer animation. This is the BACKGROUND animation. The character animation does not work if flat characters are even flatter. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say they are crazy or banal. I'm not so sure. Any useful action can be transformed into something new with the right treatment. Shakespeare often based on a known story and action and was famous only for applying a new coat of paint. The treatment is the thing. And -Atlantis obviously lacks that. <br /> <br /> I can not begin without logical gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The bridges of the plot snap like string, and the end makes no sense. In addition, the script and the animation are riddled with annoying sloppiness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Right at the beginning, when Milo reveals that runic or Celtic symbols are in place, the "Coast of Ireland" has been misplaced Coast of Iceland ", we have problems. The scriptwriters need to know how the British take Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignore the older Latin term Hibernia. In addition, they must know about the Viking conspiracy to name the greener island of Iceland and the icy island of Greenland. <br /> <br /> By making it the business of a misspelled "letter," the writers have condemned this to calling for a rune version of English and a post-Roman date in the script. Because this is to be sunken long after Atlantis in its underwater cave. And with no visible clues and less technology than Milo, the inscription was far less trustworthy. The Shepherd's Journal could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis, otherwise it would not know anything about the cave or the crystal "in the eye of the king." It must have been written after the downfall, but without the technology that Milo's expedition had, how the hell did anyone get to the Leviathan? How could it know more afterwards? And why should it be written in atlantic? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and out of body experience do not have to be written in Atlantic. So it has to be a kind of automatic writing. With no one left to read in Atlantis, the spirits of the crystal-clear messages must be on the surface. That would have made more sense. Could also have been explained in the movie: Milo could have found out to Hirte that this force had called him his entire life - appeared in dreams etc. This had to be explored in the film. <br /> <br /> The Atlanteans just could not understand modern languages. No one expects the original Indo-Europeans to be able to talk in Europe, even more than the Romans would understand, that hard "c" or their days became French "ch" (pronounced "sh", not less!). <br /> <br /> The current Atlanteans lived off the catastrophe - when they could * read * apparently, but are no longer able to read what they had done before, or to operate similar machines. <br /> <br /> The mass literacy indicates a crucial flaw in the movie. Nothing seems to have happened to this culture. It seems to float in the air until Milo can save it. Even if life does not seem to be a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to compose poetry or write novels, and maybe it's a combination of Atlantic school systems falling to the end and the lack of good fiction, the Atlantis would crash illiteracy. <br /> <br /> Kida can be excused if she does not know how to read or operate the machine when she was so young when the catastrophe stupidity set in - but EVERYONE qualifies her father for Deification! ! Kashakim's stupidity almost single-handedly wiped his people out of existence. He killed a bunch in the catastrophe, stalled progress (not killed much here, but it resulted in a massive decline in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everyone if he did not because of the giant robots cooked in lava were not there to protect them. <br /> <br /> A blaze of blue energy would have shaken Kashakim's similarity as Kida tried to integrate her father's image into the circle of the BIG Kings of Atlantis! Although Milo was the only one who could read Atlantic, Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish for a page on a crystal he knew was a crystal and not as stylized astrological or "stylized" phases The Sun Chart. <br /> <br /> When Milo's grandfather told Rourke about it, it still does not explain how Rourke had to suffer from Milo's reading than he did Read Part of the Book - Ripping out the page - which was in Rourke's hand with ears to face even though Milo apparently did NOT find any signs of a torn page in the book - was only there to tell the viewer that "something is wrong" If the word "crystal" did not raise any alarm in Milo's head that someone would try to steal it, Milo would not have suspected anything - it's just a big foreboding. <br /> <br /> The Crew's "Double Cross" was not a character change, we experienced That Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie were with Rourke from the start. The "change of the heart", however, falls flat. It was a change and had to be better motivated. Hard to do with characters who have not been given anything. <br /> <br /> Think for a moment that the lava flows over the dome instead of filling in the rest of the area from which we look at the sequence. It is liquid; It will not flow over the protective dome until it fills all lower areas. <br /> <br /> The end of STINKS! - and makes no other sense than to appease political correctness. With the restoration of the power source, Atlantis is no longer a weak power and must be restrained. The giant robot guards and blue flashes of lightning in the sky suggest that they have fewer of us to fear than they could. The technology is our superior and definitely the early 20th century. In the end, Milo has to teach the Atlanteans to read, for what? The whole idea is to leave their small, quiet, torn culture alone, not to send them into a hyperdrive. The turn of the century should give me an indication that this is more of a tribute to pulps. The mistakes I find with the film are in line with this idea. But I do not know why I should pay to see skinny characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them too. And pulp stories are part of the "crap that they can not sell adults anymore" anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp must also grow up. Raiders of the Lost Ark have lost nothing of their flesh and avoided so much bad. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is fun, but when I think about it, it gets deeper and deeper.
