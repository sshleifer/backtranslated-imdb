I bought this movie at a bargain price on a sale after reading the back of the DVD case and assuming that I can not lose it. If it was rubbish, no loss, if it was a good thing, then a bargain ... <br /> <br /> Then I looked at it ... <br /> <br /> I am usually one Fan of Christopher Walken, but in this film he had very little screen presence and did not seem to be doing much The death of his friend at the beginning, which triggers the "action" in the plot, seems to affect him very little, and his later revenge is only boring and undramatic. <br /> <br /> Usually a movie that has themes Grand as Revolution and Revenge are able to capture the audience and make them feel something for the characters, but the sight of this movie felt more like as if he saw a series of confused and almost random events loosely assembled to their final conclusion ... <br /> At that point, I cried ... <br /> <br /> I thought this film is the terribly painful piece I've ever seen The scene in which the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out of the explosively laden truck because he does not want to kill civilians is not so tragically sad but disturbingly terrible and painful, though not as bad as the emergency operation on the wounded girl. Acting was poor all around, the script and story were weak, the action was even weaker, and the visuals were not too visual. In summary, there are films that are good, films that are bad, films that are so bad that they are good, films that are awful ... <br /> <br /> And then on a whole new level is "McBain"
