This is a weak movie with a problematic history of cuts and renames. It does not work at all. First, the dramaturgy is wrong. First, it is very slow and then it comes to an end hastily and unsatisfactorily. But there is also (and this may have to do with the cuts) an uncomfortable switching between genres. It begins with being a thriller that is believed to be face-up, and then degenerates into a farce instead of a satire. The end may be funny, but it's also so dull that I almost felt it insulted my intelligence (which is little). So the film tries to be everything, but does not succeed on any level. You can see that in the unsteady character development. One has almost the impression that Connery plays three roles.
