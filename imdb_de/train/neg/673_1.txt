... let me count the ways. <br /> <br /> 1. A title remake that takes every cliche out of the Slasher manual. <br /> <br /> 2. An action that is so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. A completely weak execution of any attempt to create tension or thrill. <br /> <br /> 4. A PG-13 rating that does not guarantee violence, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. A villain who is not scary or even secretive. <br /> <br /> 6. A cast of characters so thinly spelled and stereotyped that we could not possibly take care of them. <br /> <br /> 7. A lack of an effective scary atmosphere (unlike the original prom night). <br /> <br /> 8. A script of dialogue that is beyond the poor - it is amazing. <br /> <br /> 9. A series of cardboard performances (not sure if the actors or the lousy script mentioned above should be blamed for that). <br /> <br /> 10. A totally inappropriate slasher remake for teens who are not brave enough to have a fantasy - or even show a pool of blood /> BOMB FROM ****
