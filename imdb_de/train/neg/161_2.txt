If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a New York street pennant or John Wayne as a communist spy, you might consider Pat Boone as a youthful delinquent on his uncle's farm in Kentucky and you might enjoy this movie. <br /> This film is so stupid that it is not even combative for a sexless love story of the 50s. And the problem is that Hollywood has made such a big deal about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman and not his wife on the screen before releasing that the audience knows he will not kiss Shirley Jones. It's like watching a western where the cowboys have no weapons. <br /> <br /> The story is pointless. Even the title song is sung with painful enthusiasm. April Love is next to Ishtar and Plan 9 from space in the worst movie basket.
