Usually I do not comment on that, but there are things that need to be said. Where should I start ... <br /> <br /> The acting of Jeremy London was terrible! I did not think he could be that bad. The plot could have been good if it had been well-directed, along with a good solid performance by the lead actor. Unfortunately, this is one of the films that you read that offers great entertainment potential but is disappointed from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Well, at least I got good laughs. I would not waste my time if I were you.
