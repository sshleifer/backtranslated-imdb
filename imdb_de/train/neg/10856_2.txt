Well, I will not lie to you, but I only got this movie from a friend for $ 3.99 because Danni Filth, the singer of the ever-popular Death Metal band "Cradle Of Filth", was there. Of course I counted on violence and Gore at its finest, because that's how Mr. Filth can be portrayed under a plotting line. <br /> <br /> But God, I was so wrong. This movie bites seriously, great. Since this is a low budget movie (haha, wait, make this ZERO BUDGET), it obviously lacks the beautiful notes of the Howard Stern Orchestra and the Spielberg special effects. No, it's all a camera, bad angles and bad blood scenes. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, when our star and violent fraud, Mr. Filth, violently kills a Mugger. A grip on the throat and blood spits out, but oh, it looks like a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man's shirt. <br /> <br /> To you, Cradle Of Filth fans: you'll hear it Two songs throughout the movie, but with the camera angles and the modest filming, they pull down the overall pleasure of the song. <br /> <br /> My last comment: steer clear. It's blood, blood, breasts and hey, even a modest story. So if you like horrific violence, almost no voices (yes, there are hardly any words in this movie), then buy them by all means. But if bad movies are not your thing, then avoid them. Do not waste your money.
