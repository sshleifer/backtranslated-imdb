This was the first Ewan McGregor movie I saw outside of Star Wars. Since then, I've become a big fan of Ewan McGregor, but I still can not bring myself to forgive the existence of this movie. <br /> <br /> My sister was always a big Jane Austen fan who was exposed to various classics, including Emma. I've always thought it irritating, stupid and boring. However, after seeing this terrible portrayal, I had to admit that the original Emma was charming and charming. Ewan McGregor does little in this film after he has hacked and mutilated Frank Churchill's part. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation to anyone interested in English drama ... look at the originals. If you're an Ewan McGregor fan ... believe me, if you skip this movie, you've missed nothing but five minutes of him with a dumb hat and a bad haircut.
