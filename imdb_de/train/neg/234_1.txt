This movie was choppy, incoherent and came up with it. It was also a very common representation of women. I hired it because it was performed as a comedy (that's a stretch), and because Andie McDowell was playing a storm, according to cover on the front page. It was not her. I'm a girl, I saw this movie with two guys, and we spent an hour after that saying how bad it was. RAMPANT SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a rather hackneyed conspiracy about an older woman engaging with a younger man, to the severe disapproval of her two jealous, single girlfriends. They want her to marry a boring man of her age who is somehow in love with her. But she's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you care about her enduring, and she decides to marry the guy. But her harpy friend, supported by the "Wishy Washy," is planning a plan to make our heroine believe the guy is cheating on her. It works out. She has a fight with him, he runs out of the house and gets crushed by a truck (Remember the title of the movie?) Now he's dead, two-thirds of the way through the movie. And although our heroine is a headmistress who spends her time looking after girls, she has apparently forgotten to use birth control and is pregnant. Alone and miserable she decides to marry the boring guy. Did I mention that the boring guy who somehow loves her is a minister? She had asked him to marry her to the young man (nice, right?), But now she tells him she's going to marry him, and he does not seem to object to his being turned around that way. But her friends save her at the altar and take her home, where they do not quite admit that they were mainly responsible for their love being doomed to failure. She has the child. In the last scene, they leave it in a cot in their house while they go out on the porch to drink, smoke and be complacent. I'm not kidding you, it's so bad. I've skipped the part about the red herring crab and the ridiculous lesbian moment of the harpy.
