I saw this movie because I noticed that Kari Wuhrer was in the cast. I've long had a theory about her that she's a talented actress, but that never seems to prove, because she's always in that kind of low-budget B-movie. She is still beautiful and still trying to act on the unfortunate material in which I always see her. That is not different. The movie is often ugly and disturbing, but that does not do him good. George Wendt played against the guy, and that was so shocking that he was recognized for his role. Another note about Mrs. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have shrunk significantly since I last saw her. Possibly a reduction of surgery or (more likely) removal of implants. That's not a bad thing. She still looks good. I would like to see her in a better movie.
