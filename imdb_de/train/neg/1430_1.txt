As I leafed through the canals on a late Saturday night, my friends and I came across this movie. First of all, Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as a Native American? Serious?! His accent broke through so much, though his character was apparently Scottish. Next, I was stunned to find out that this movie was made after playing James Bond / Agent 007 at least twice. This film plays the stereotypes with the inspiring professor figure. The girl who played pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut. And this movie won a prize? I can not believe it. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we wanted to seriously assess our eyes after watching for just 10 seconds. We switched to it from "Kicking and Screaming" and wanted to return. We saw the 1995 children's classic "The Indian in the Cupboard" in the early evening, in which the Iroquois were also discussed. The following line shows our desire to run away: "Take me outside, Erdgreifer." From "Gray Owl": "If you do not like it, you do not have to be careful."
