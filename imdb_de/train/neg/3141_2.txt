I just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch of kids, ages 14 to 22, put the DVD from Titanic on a fantastic state of the art for mega-screen home entertainment. Only two of them had actually seen it. But everyone had seen Kate, Leo, and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the movie. Shortly after the epic began, they became restive, and some of them asked the others, "Call us when the iceberg appears". were still there They were screaming: iceberg, iceberg. A stampede followed, they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat with open mouth and beamed Ohs and far out. As I thought, when the movie first entered the scene. What's this? Wait an hour and a half for the damn thing to go down, but what about the rest of it? Dr. Zivagho, for example, had a similar duration, but remember how much in that movie takes place within the same time span. In "Titanic," Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the supposedly crème de la crème in the ship's world-class dining room. Check out the historical details if you can find them. The plot is so thin that they have to introduce weapons and shots into a ship that is just sinking. The real downfall is from film standards. All efforts focus on special effects and the opening week. The movie became the highest revenue movie ever. What do I know about it?
