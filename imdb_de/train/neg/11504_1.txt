AKA: Mondays In The Sun <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I just saw. Three men wander aimlessly, drinking, grumbling about everything and everyone on their way. This is supposed to be a drama, but what it is is a total waste of film, without a single, redeeming quality. "and" heroic. "I'm afraid I can not agree unless these guys turn up to be the dumbest and most ignorant proto-humans who ever left. <br /> <br /> All in all, this was not a movie and loses everyone but the audience, I've looked at it three times and can not see for my life what someone sees in this garbage - there's nothing profound here - it's crap. <br /> <br /> It rates a ZERO / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
