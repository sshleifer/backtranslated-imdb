If you have not figured out what's going on in this movie in the first five minutes, give it a few more minutes. Lilia is a widow. She was left on the shelf too long and wants to break out. She has a teenage daughter, which only emphasizes that she is not getting any younger. As she searches for her daughter, she discovers a world she has never dared to do ... the cabaret, where she can dance belly-dancing in tight, sequined outfits while men throw money at her. The film is very misogamous. The portrayal of men is grim. Which is rather strange when Lilia wobbles for her, not for money, only for hell. If she manages to wake her, she feels like a woman again. She does not want to connect with them, but she's addicted to attention. The other dancers are all aging women looking like men in tow, realizing that their time in the limelight is short-lived. Not short enough, I say. She finds romance, however short it may be, with which you guessed it ... No surprises here we did not see coming. Although the end is good, you realize that there could not have been another end. Maybe this film is not just about my demographic personality
