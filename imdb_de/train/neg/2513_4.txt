When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it should have come from the children's area - it's very funny and sometimes humorous and is actually a good story, but it lacks the "romantic chemistry" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are able to deliver. I have to say that Walter Matthau is perfect for Albert Einstein and his performance is extraordinary, but that's the only exception. This film seems a bit forced, the director lacks substance, and oh yes ... the music is ridiculously horrible, it did not make me feel very good. But if you do not expect a clever, well-made comedy / romance story, this can certainly be entertaining, as I said ... it should be in the nursery. Einstein and his buddies are a relief from Tim Robbins' boring, almost tense search for Meg Ryan's heart. A very contradictory film, but as long as it is not taken seriously, this can be a good movie.
