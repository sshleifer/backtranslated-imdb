I love horror movies, low budget, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s ... but how do you think this is a very good horror movie? Let's compare it to titles in similar films with similar veins. the haunting, changing, shining. or for a similar technology-based horror movie that was better FAAAR (though still far from great) Demon Seed. OK, I will be fair. Compare it to horror movies made for television! do not go to sleep .. waaay scary and better done. Salem's fate, the night fighter, the night gallery, even not going to the basement or Crowhaven Yard, was much better. * SPOILERS * First and foremost, for such a good scene as the bloody shower scene was, you have a scene like the opening scene. Oh boy! The garden hose comes alive to strip off some playful teens! AWFUL. And just what we understand about the house ... it apparently has to use its video cameras to see what's going on, and it's a very emotional house. no spirit or demon or being, it is a house that is "obsessed" but by what? We believe that an inanimate object has learned to love Suzie / Margaret, our protagonist? Now that I'm on the subject of Suzie .. another scene that totally bothered me, this poor old crazy lady is coming, says she was your nurse, pours out her heart, falls into the boiling pool and fights for 45 seconds Pain and what does margaret do? Does she risk her hands being burned to save this poor elderly woman who came there to warn her life? no, she stands there and watches! The acting was mostly above average for a horror movie, but here ends the positive. At least an interesting and funny horror movie about an inanimate object that kills people when you see the death bed: the bed that eats. I have the feeling that the people who rated it this way either did not see it since it was originally aired, or remember it scared them off as children. This movie was earned pretty much less.
