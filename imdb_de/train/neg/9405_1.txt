I just saw it on TV and what can I say, but that's the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm ashamed to come from Melbourne, where the movie was filmed. Devilish, amateurish make-up effects and a REALLY bad soundtrack. As for the plot, it's even stupider! Some of the scenes left me amazed at how bad it was. There is a reason why they show this kind of movies on Late Night TV - because they are totally rubbish! Avoid at all costs.
