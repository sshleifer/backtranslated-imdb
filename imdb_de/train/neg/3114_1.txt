If you try to compare or portray this "schnapps" as something "Hitchcockian", it is an outright attempt to get the fans of Hitchcock to waste $ 7 on this movie ... <br /> <br /> No real tension, no thrill. They are waiting for the big payoff or even some payout, due to the weakness of this movie ... You have to think what the hell it was all about. <br /> <br /> And please, enough with the movement to do "alternative lifestyles" HIP and politically correct !! ... I can not recommend that to anyone ... Did I mention how weak the drama is? Williams did better than Peter Pan and "Mork." But those were MUCH innocent times ...........
