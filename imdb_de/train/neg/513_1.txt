Burt Reynolds came to a point in his career when he seemed to make only the moves. He would show up, celebrate with his friends in the movie, and take home a big paycheck. It did not seem to matter to him that the product he represented was pure crap. <br /> <br /> No movie embodied this more than "Stroker Ace", making "Cannonball Run" look like a classic and "Cannonball" Run II "Look Watchable." Except for a few racing scenes, there's NOTHING to do Lovely Loni Anderson makes it as bad as a stupid blonde, it's embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If the thought of Burt holding it together with Jim Nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny, this is your movie. Otherwise, choose almost every other movie comedy and it will not get any worse.
