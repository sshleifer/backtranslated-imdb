that 's one piece s - t !! this looks worse than one for t.v. Movie. and I exclude, to believe that a sequel was even experienced and the results ... the war is more beautiful than this. Jean Claude Van Shame has done it again and wonders why his career is where it is now. no script, no story and no time should be wasted. I mean that. 1 out of 10 is too high, way too high. Goldberg should have a jackhammer for this. Van Shame is not an actor.
