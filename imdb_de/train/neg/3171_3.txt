Was that the greatest movie I have ever seen? Was it the worst? <br /> <br /> As a mother of four, it is nice to see something that is light and amusing. It was great, but it was cute. <br /> <br /> I think there was definitely some room for improvement, but it tried. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this movie deserves the extreme abuse by the other reviewer. Obviously you are not interested in Eva Longoria. I think she was doing better than The Sentinel. I think films are a matter of opinion. The actors play a big role, whether it's a hit or a flop. <br /> <br /> Maybe the cast did not work out. Maybe there were too many things. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to speak for an average movie, not a horrible one. It could just be a chick movie. A bit like the movie The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband is still talking about it. :)
