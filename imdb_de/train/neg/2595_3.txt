Are you kidding, that was WUNDER !!! <br /> <br /> But still, I got this movie and three more, and they were all on DVD. The movie starts with a pretty good movie, but goes from about the middle down. <br /> <br /> And in the end, let's just say that it was one of the most anti-climatic ends of recent film history. In the final sequence a lot of Gore and if you like a dose of Schlock horror, then this is the movie for you ... <br /> <br /> 3/10
