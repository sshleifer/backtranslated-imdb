If the crew behind "Zombie Chronicles" ever read this, here are some tips: <br /> <br /> 1. In a "Twist Ending" movie, it's not a good idea to take close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE MOVIE insert the header. That tends to spoil the turns, you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know that you produced that at a low altitude and, to be fair, you did wonders with your budget, but hire people who can actually act. Or at least run, talk and gesture at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm looking at you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you're hiring a part of your movie in the past, you'll only do so if you have the props and costumes of the time. <br /> <br /> 4. Twists should be a surprise. Sure, we do not want twists that make no sense, but mark the "revelation" as soon as you introduce a character? This is not a great idea. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the boys to try, but honestly I would prefer that they do not ... <br /> <br /> Only for zombie completeists.
