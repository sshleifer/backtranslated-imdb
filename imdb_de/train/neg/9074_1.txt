Again a venture into the world of teenage big-out comedy, which is on a college campus looking for a nerd for coolness and deciding to blackmail a trio of popular jocks to get the girl. Everything has been done before and everything is much more satisfying. The rough out humor, which has made teen flicks such as "American Pie" and "Dude! Where's my Car" so popular, is completely taken out of context in this episode and seems so random that the viewer just frowns and can disapprove. The film is poorly written, and the actors never manage to make any of it bearable. I will not even make this horrible picture dignified by revealing it, as it is a waste of my and your time. At best, Slackers never manages to laugh or laugh, and in the worst case, it is painful and sometimes unsurpassable. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, impressed in his debut Rushmore, humbles himself by appearing in this picture, and one wonders how quickly a career in the bathroom can end. Please avoid, please avoid. Save your money.
