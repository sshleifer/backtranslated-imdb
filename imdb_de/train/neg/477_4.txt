I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to accept a pay cut, Warner Bros. retaliated by turning them into substandard projects for the rest of their contract. <br /> <br /> She decided to take the money. However, her career suffered accordingly. <br /> <br /> That might explain what she did in Comet Over Broadway. (Although it does not explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are there as well.) "Ludicrous" is the word others used for the plot of this movie, and that's just right. The murder process. Her seedy variety career. Your success in London. Her last scene with her daughter. No part leads logically to the next part. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes also looked like B-movie stuff. And her hair! Turner is showing a lot of movies this month. Look at others and you do yourself a favor.
