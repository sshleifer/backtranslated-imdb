Few films have troubled me with such discomfort, and that's not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (how it ended there, I can only wonder), I was exposed to 90 minutes of hateful, dumped garbage, the main impression was a bit like this other sick movie "Do not answer the phone". - but worse. The malice of everything, rape and all, is shown without distance (as opposed to strong stuff like "last house on the left") and utter contempt for the (perfect?) Victims and all those involved, leaving the viewer as a viewer is treated sadistic voyeur. In the end, I wanted to take a shower. No credits to the director
