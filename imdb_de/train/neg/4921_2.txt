Blame Executive Producer Wes Craven and the financiers the Weinsteins for this big budget debacle: a Thrash Metal update of "Dracula" with a condescending verbal jab by Bram Stoker (who probably does not want him to change his name to and not much for the rest of us, except Slasher bumps and blood. Christopher Plummer is churning up to the present day as Van Helsing - not just a descendant of Van Helsing, but the real thing; He continues to flee with leeches from Count Dracula's body being exhumed from his coffin after being stolen from Van Helsing's vault and flown to New Orleans. That's what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! The film, well produced, but without a single original idea (except for racial sacrifice), is both repulsive and lazy and begins to repeat itself after about an hour. * from ****
