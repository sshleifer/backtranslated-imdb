I went into this movie and thought it would be the next employees, but I felt relaxed. The humor was weak and the characters pretty flat. This is not all bad, the idea of ​​the matchmaking service in the supermarket seemed pretty fertile material, but the director focused on the cliché "save the mom-and-pop shop from the bad guy guy". I had the feeling that if he had just stayed with the dating service plot, he would have released a much more memorable film. To live up to the movie, I come from the Rochester area and loved the way he portrayed Webster. In fact, the best tribute from Kevin Smith (by Clerks) here gave his hometown props. Webster, New York is checking what Red Bank, New Jersey, is for the employees. The director was wisely a date with Nick Tahou. Believe me, as far as Rochester is concerned, a garbage can is at the top of the list. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at Little in Rochester, so everyone knew when the odes came to and appreciated the city.
