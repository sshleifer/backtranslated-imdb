When I saw this trailer on TV, I was surprised. In May 2008, I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this showed up in a 4-D attraction (you know the seats are moving). I suppose the version I saw was a shortened version (15 minutes) and was also rebuilt to add the motion effects. It was a sweet movie ... but that was it. It was instructive and told about the first mission, but the end of a CGI space walk seemed a bit ... well ... banal. I was not a big fan of the movie, but I would recommend this movie to all parents who want to inform their kids in a fun way about the first Moonwalk. I'll say the character actors were well chosen and the characters themselves were cute. So all in all, I would say, if you want to bring the younger kids ... go for it. But if you want to take your older children with you, take them to another movie ... you'll be grateful.
