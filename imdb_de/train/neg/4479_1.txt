I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies ever. If not, then it is very close. Ever seen a bad teen soap opera. Well, that's like one of those. Except worse. For example: (POSSIBLE SPOILER) Girl: I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Man: Everything we need is here. <br /> <br /> Girl: But I want to take me to another place. <br /> type: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> ... Continue with this line, they have sex. The music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you've read ANYONE's book, avoid this movie like the plague. They completely change the personality of the characters and events. Besides, they just get rid of things. In addition, the movie ends about the end of the book. It's a WONDER movie. So, if you have not read the book, do not look at it. If you have read the book, burn it (the movie). If you like dumb teen soap operas that are of lower quality than the average low-quality teen soap opera, you should do it. But should we expect anything other than MTV?
