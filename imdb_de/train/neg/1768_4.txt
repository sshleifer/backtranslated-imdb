This is another movie that could have been great. The basic requirement is good - immortal cat people who kill to live, etc. - a kind of variation of the vampire concept. <br /> <br /> The thing that breaks everything down is the utter ruthlessness of the main characters. Even sociopaths know that if you want to survive, you have to have an unremarkable profile. Look at how long it took for the Unibomber to be caught because a family member found out about it. Children (and to a lesser extent, the mother) behave as if they were untouchable. The child kills without any thought to leave no evidence or trace or living witness. How these people managed to live and stay undetected for a month is unbelievable, not to mention decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> It's a pity - that could have been much more if plausibly written. Give the main characters the common sense they needed so long. <br /> <br /> Besides that, not a bad idea. I loved the piece in the end, where every cat in the city converges on the house - every time I bring food on the porch and see our cats storm in from wherever they were before, I think this scene.
