Ram Gopal Verma has proven to be a very innovative and competent director. He had made a godfather remake / godfather with Sarkar and was hugely successful. The same applies to Lolita, whom he has made as Nishaabd. Sholay is the movie he always says has inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake. <br /> <br /> The acting ranged from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan as the villain Babban being appropriately dangerous. The songs were awful and unforgettable. The song Mehbooba Mehbooba was released as a second-class music video. <br /> <br /> Worst was the pace and dialogues that were forgotten. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie in a theater I waited for the break and then for the end. Some viewers were wise not to wait, and were seen throughout the movie. Ultimately, one of the worst movies by Ram Gopal Verma.
