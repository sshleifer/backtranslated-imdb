Here's an indie movie that I really wanted to like, but ultimately could not. The lack of scripts (boldly proclaimed in the main titles) really shows through the picture and kills it. History is a nonsensical mess that is not worth discovering. I quickly got bored within 10 minutes and then suffered through the remaining 40 minutes - hoping for the best - before the chapter stops (mercifully) came to an end ... even that was not worth the effort. OZARK SAVAGE is clearly too eager to be smart and get his best sequences out of EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, there is very little in OZARK SAVAGE that has not happened yet, and even better. This movie would have been much more fun than a 10 to 20 minute short film, but as a feature it just feels cushioned and forced. Of course there is no money for shorts, so I understand the financial reasons that I think are motivated to be over 75 minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows promising and I wish him good luck.
