Too bad - I rarely watch a movie and in the end I'm disappointed. I've seen some of Ira Levin's adaptations - "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Stepford Wives" - and they both liked it, but I just did not like it. <br /> <br /> When I read the Plot Outline - an award-winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to murder one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and steel his script for his own success - I was excited. I like thriller, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil it for anyone who has not seen it yet, but all of them I would say there are loads of twists and turns. It's so hard to explain the plot of the film in detail without betraying it. I enjoyed the first 45 minutes before the twists and turns started, and my interest and joy faded. Still, I must credit Lumet for the very amusing ending that made me laugh. The main actors - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles. Although Worth's obvious counterfeit Russian accent easily got on his nerves (not a personal Irene, I think the wrong accent of an actor would irritate me). I'm not sure Cannon's character should be annoyingly funny, but Dyan managed to annoy and amuse at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads this - I do not want you to look at that From my perspective, give me a chance, you may like it, you can not. It's about the opinion.
