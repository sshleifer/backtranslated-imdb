Very low-cost police film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body appears in a stolen car in Central Park, and her only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, it looks like an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution. Cast and crew, with a few exceptions - including a young and unidentified Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cinematographer William Steiner - consist of complete unknowns, and that shows. The performances are universally below average and would not pass in a high school education film, the direction is boring and choppy and as mentioned earlier, there is no chemistry between the main characters. Despite the many shortcomings of the film, however, he has some good points. Filming in New York City and the film's extremely low budget give it a gritty authenticity, much like the far superior "The Naked City", in which a shootout in a dark cellar is done decently, and some investigation procedures are smart. Otherwise it is not much to write. However, it's worth taking a look to see the denser sections of New York City in the early 1950s, and old-car fans will be thrilled to see the legions of the 1930s and 1940s cars on the streets , <Br /> <br />.
