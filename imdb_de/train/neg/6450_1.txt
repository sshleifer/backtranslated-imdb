Well, this movie is unbelievably awful. I was sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they did not write their lines. They were sometimes delivered with a slight sarcasm, which made me believe that they did not take this movie seriously, and nobody watching this disgusting monster slasher. While watching this "Creature Unknown" I could not help thinking that there was not much budget or a competent author for the crew. But if you think that's a laugh, you'll be happy, the movie is shameless to mock itself, because I can not see how anyone could look at it and be proud to put it directly on DVD clich√©s to be action thriller / horror movie shootfest.
