Well, I can and will be very short. This is a badly balanced, unconvincing movie that could have been a little better. The script does not seem to know which way to go ... from witty to clich√©d serious ... it's a bit stupid. The plus too many sentences we've heard before "the hacker is in Florida or no, he's in Madrid, no he's in ... he's screwing the signal". <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
