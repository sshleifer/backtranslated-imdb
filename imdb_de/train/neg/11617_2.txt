This movie "Joshua" is extremely disturbing and absolutely meaningless. It actually shudders me to believe that there are people who would enjoy seeing it. Without revealing the story, it's the reaction of a boy to his newborn sister, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout the movie, the viewer is exposed to one of the most unsettling behaviors imaginable. If you offend the injury, there is absolutely no real result at the end of this movie, except the realization of pure evil by a kid who outsmarted a whole bunch of stupid adults. There is no salvation, no justice and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them. Honestly, I did not like this movie. It was extremely disturbing. Even for those who like horror movies, this movie could be too much. Despite the fact that this movie was well-played, the story itself is so disconcerting that considering a 90-minute wait in a dentist's waiting room was equivalent to awaiting some painful dental procedures.
