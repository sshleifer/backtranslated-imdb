You must give it to Steven Seagal: Whatever his other mistakes may be, he has a good taste for women. If you choose a Seagal movie, there is a chance that one or more very beautiful women will be in it. And usually they do not work as mere eye candy; They are involved in the action and fight, shoot rifles, kill with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" features the duo of Ciera Payton (who has a very sexy face, with luscious lips that match Angelina Jolies) and Katie Jones and finds Time to engage her in a catfight AND a little lesbian petting! And when it seems like I spend a little too much time talking about her, it's because the rest of the film, though passable, is so unexciting that finding what he does about it is difficult can speak. Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who looks like he can not even bother to pretend to be worried. Being a military action player, there are hardly any fights, and he does not fit very well into his role (a stealth fighter pilot, of course, "the best in the world"), which can almost explain his offensive sleepwalking , (* 1/2)
