After years of being excited about this movie, I decided to rent it and watch it. Let me first say that I am glad that the rent in the local library was free. This step was slow, boring, unrealistic and the action made no sense. After two hours, I was ready to destroy the backwater city of Texas and free the group of these characters from their misery. I know that the taste is subjective, but trust me, I do not understand all the hype I've heard about this movie. Dallas delivered life in Texas as well as this movie. Rent it only if you want to know how film studios can pay the reviewers enough money to convince the public that a bad movie is good.
