Oh my God. That was awful. There is bad, then there was something else. This movie makes no sense at all. It runs everywhere on the map and is not clear what to say. The music seemed like she was trying to be like Batman. The fact that Edison is not a real city takes away. Since living in Vancouver, it has made this film and the recognition of all these places unbearable. Why did not they make it a real city? The only decent writing was "Tilman", in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor to play his role realistically, not over exaggerating and superior. It was really a shame to see John Heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time and the movie was a washout. Too bad. Hopefully it will see someone important and at least give credit to John Heard where the credit is due and reinstate him as the leading villain. on the A-list.
