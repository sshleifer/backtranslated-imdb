Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is a horrible movie. This is just a superposition of scenes without a clear link. The action is very bad despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El Allayli. But in this film, there is something really amazing when it comes to sexuality and the emancipation of women. Nude scenes are still very rare in Arab cinema today. I cordially congratulate the director and the actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons why I rated this film as terrible are not just the scenario and acting, but also the lack of professionalism. This movie looks like an amateur. We can see many errors on the screen. If you want a good Arab movie, Ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not recommended. But if you want to encourage the uncensored films in the whole Arab world, look at it and let your friends and family do the same.
