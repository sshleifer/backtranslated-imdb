I did not really like the first "Cube" movie. It was a good idea, but the annoying drama and characters always prevented me from liking it too much. I did not really feel the need to see its sequel, but when I heard that they were making a third film that served the original as a prelude. I was intrigued, thinking that perhaps they would solve some of the original's problems and provide us with memorable characters. Well, I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> "Cube Zero" starts off well by introducing us to the two characters who are responsible for watching and receiving the infinite labyrinth of traps that plagues people in the Cube. With the establishment of the everyday life of the two men, the filmmakers manage to create a mystery. This raises some questions about why people are sent there and about the true nature of those who perform the entire operation. All this is up to the viewer. The acting was a bit weak, but overall the first half of the film moved relatively well. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, one of the two "watchers" begins to doubt seriously what he is doing. And later decides to help a group of prisoners. Everything starts to dissolve quickly in dull cheese. <br /> <br /> The people who run the Cube program introduce us to the character "Jax". Together with his two subordinates, the main reason why this movie is a failure plays. Initially, "Jax" looks more like a third-rate villain straight out of a James Bond movie with the ever-popular "Glass Eye," which alone ruins any atmosphere created by the relatively pleasant tempo of the first half. What's more, it feels more like a comedy than a serious movie. With a few unbelievably hackneyed lines, the scriptwriter might get bored and do not care. The acting itself worsens to another low point when the former "observer" meets the group in the cube. The entire interaction is painful to watch as everything else follows afterwards. <br /> <br /> Even if it does not depend on faint characters, dialogue and acting, "Cube Zero" is a waste of time for those looking for a good horror movie.
