As a former teacher (!) I must confess to crawl through many scenes - "although I kept watching until the end. I wonder why ?! (Bored maybe?) :-) <br /> <br /> The first opening scenes seemed incredibly mixable and blurry. The plot, too, though there were some good ideas - the plight of an assistant teacher, for example - was not focused in one direction for 3D development. <br /> <br /> None of Mr Nolte's fine moments As for the young Macchio, does he speak like this in any * movie? <br /> <br /> Plot and drama aside, the hairstyles alone were a nostalgic (if disgusting) trip. <br /> <br />
