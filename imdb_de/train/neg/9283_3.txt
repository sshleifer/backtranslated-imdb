I do not know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site! I'm a big vonnegut fan and I'm very familiar with the story that made this original Showtime film unimaginably stubborn. But even if it were not me, the bad acting, VERY poor casting (Sean Astin as a brilliant, athletic and all-round human), Harrison? The guy is totally generic!) And the writing under the standard made this triple barely noticeable. Someone has pointed out how sweet this Maculay Culkin line is. If you're reading this and thinking that it's pure comic brilliance (unfortunately, it was probably the most funniest part of the movie), you might like this movie. But if you're a Vonnegut fanatic or not completely crazy, you will not see it. You're welcome.
