WE FAW DOWN <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Quiet <br /> <br /> (Black & White Short) <br /> <Stan 'n 'Ollie mingles with some floozies (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after attending a theater that burns down in his absence! Needless to say, their tyrannical wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) are having no fun ... <br /> <br /> Leo McCarey's OK comedy formed the narrative setting for William Seiter's masterpiece SONS OF THE DESERT with L & H (1934) to play brutal victims of the circumstances, forced to tell a monstrous lie that backfires in a spectacular way. Much is very funny, especially the scene where Stan is raised by Deslys, resulting in a violent push-and-push game. Part of the fun, however, is undercut by Oakland and Flowers, who play their roles in a straightforward manner, which makes the scenario with the "back-whipped husband" a bit uncomfortable. Originally released in the UK as WE SLIP UP.
