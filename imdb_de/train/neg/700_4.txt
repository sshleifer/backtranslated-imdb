I am not looking for quality. I'm just trying to get through the 74 famous UK-banned video bad guys. This was originally banned and was re-released in 2001 with a total length of 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Some college children spend their Christmas holidays preparing a dormitory for renovation. There are some scary characters hanging around with the four kids. Which of them is the Slasher? The actual murders are not very bloody, so this video fieze is not really evil. There is the necessary flashing of the boobies, but it has nothing to do with the college kids. <br /> <br /> I quickly had a suspect and turned out to be right. Maybe I have seen too many of them. The final twist was clever; I have to acknowledge the authors' appreciation for this piece of originality.
