A BDSM "subculture" from Los Angeles serves as the background for this low budget, which is shabbily built. It's just a vanity piece for its top-notch player Celia Xavier, who also produces screenplays while playing as twin sister Vanessa and Celia. The question soon arises as to whether a rather excessive camera, illumination and processing of pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that is not taken seriously by a sensitive observer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the County of Los Angeles, while her vicious twin has become an icon in her fetishistic world, mainly for erotic performances on CD-ROMs, but when the disaster "Mistress Vanessa" arrives, virtuously Celia resolutely To locate her sister's malicious assailant starts a new job as a "sex slave" in the private Castle Club, where the house specialty is a "dungeon party". Two FBI field workers (allegedly involved in the Vanessa case for their involvement in Internet BDSM websites) and a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective are charged with investigating the crime while Celia strives to ensure their safety Enthusiasm in her new vocation is eagerly considered by her clients to have created personal dangers for her. There are many mistakes in logic and continuity, for example, a murder of Operations South Bureau by L.A.P.D. awarded, a region of the metropolis, which is far removed from the location of the movie. The direction is blurred and is not supported by unpredictable post-processing and sound reproduction. The aforementioned photographic gymnastics culminates with a fierce montage near the end of the footage, which, however, relates tangentially to the scenario. A solid-looking twist appears under this cinder: Stan Abe as an avid FBI agent.
