Until this new season I was a big fan of the "Little Mosque". The new season, however, had absolutely ruined it. <br /> <br /> The new Christian Vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show. It was always about living together to overcome prejudice. The new Vicar is ruining these Christians in a very bad light. <br /> <br /> I'm neither Christian nor Muslim, but I loved seeing the show and seeing the camaraderie between Amar and the Reverend. No more. <br /> <br /> Just break off and be done. It is not worth looking at anymore. <br /> <br /> It could still be saved, but a lot of changes would have to be made. <br /> <br /> Return the old format.
