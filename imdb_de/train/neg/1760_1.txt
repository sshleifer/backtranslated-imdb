This movie makes some mistakes. a few American actors in Spain and the Spanish actors who speak English. Spanish-speaking English is fine, but the way acting is done makes it quite annoying. The dialogue through the entire script is very weak. It could have been a spanish script, but misinterpreted, who knows and who cares. I can only assume that these are famous Spanish actors who are pushed into the English language. They may be good, but not on this flop. You'll find out the movie within the first 5 minutes, as pathetic as it is. then the rest is just bad. Much wasted time, many UN-necessary parcels. Oh, I mentioned that one of the Baldwins is in it.
