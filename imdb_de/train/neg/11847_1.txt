I'm horrified how bad this movie is. As a pastiche of Hollywood artists of the early 20th century, it sets a new low - even behind The Moderns or Crople Will Rock & I never think I would see a worse movie than this one. Granted, it was a different kind of environment. Period. Nevertheless, the intentions and results were very similar. <br /> <br /> First of all the horrible casting: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, did you owe that guy something? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Holy Smoke, these people do not even start trying to capture the look or sound of the time they are supposed to represent. <br /> <br /> Well, the last picture show was a decent movie, but this thing is a disaster & the other pictures of Bogdonovitch were not much better. Probably Welles & Hitch & Ford has long since stopped. Still good for TCM hosts.
