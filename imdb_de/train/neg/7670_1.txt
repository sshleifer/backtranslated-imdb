Where do I start my story? I went to this movie with a few friends tonight and did not know more than the actors that were in it and that it was supposed to be a horror movie. What a bad decision I had made to watch this movie. The storyline was crap and the script too. The lines were awful to the point that people in the audience laughed hysterically. <br /> <br /> The cast could not have looked more plastic. Even some scenes seemed like they should have been made much faster ... as if they were moving on for no particular reason. Very bad editing. All in all, this movie was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
