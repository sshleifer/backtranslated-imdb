Awwww ... yeah, it's heartwarming and anything an unhappy family of ABC / Sears adopts has "renovated" their home. Here ends the humanist appeal. I liked it early in its run, but now this show is abhorrently exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Ten needy families could get relatively luxurious homes with many delicacies for every single family in which every episode of this show sprays. The people at Habitat For Humanity have to shake their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a healthy sixteen-year-old boy to have a whirlpool in his bedroom or to trick his bed with the Low Rider hydraulics? Does Mother really need her rundown, out-of-date and rusty old pick-up truck to be restored and "pimped" by some of the best customizers in California? A new one would have done the job quite well and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a 65 inch plasma screen in every room of the house? And then there is the question of who pays the increased property taxes and utility bills. Even after the Zaniacs have gone to makeover, someone still has a living. I doubt the friendly people of Social Services will see the humor in all these big rooms. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than a rating grabber for ABC and a silent commercial for its sponsors.
