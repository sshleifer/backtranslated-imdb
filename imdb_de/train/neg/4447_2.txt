Yes, there are worse films. Most of them made fun, with a budget for shoe strings or as t.v. Movie of the Week, but even if this was the "Movie of the Week," he would not be awarded more than two stars. It's a bad movie about a serious topic depicting a battered woman fleeing the King of the Schleimsschen into the protective arms of the King of Mad People. (If this is an attempt to show that she does not need a man to protect her, the Wussman is superfluous to the film and should not be there at all). It has no suspense, no character development and a heroine who could be outdone by a reddish onion. (I think she washes her wedding ring on a boat with a self-contained tank instead of throwing her overboard in the sea (where her body should be anyway) and after the man finds her, she shows she's an idiot is, and still makes, childlike assumptions that made her almost kill her.) I'm always amazed to see that a movie like this is generally rated highly. I understand that Dr. Seuss still has a huge, unused market with people being challenged by his work. After I finish laughing at humanity, I cry.
