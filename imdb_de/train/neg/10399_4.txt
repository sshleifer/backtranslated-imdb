One of the main flaws in this film is that while the mockery of overbearing yuppies is satisfying, it does not recognize that the filmmakers themselves are guilty of being one of the mockers. One of the characteristics of these types of yuppies is the imaginary misconception that they (the yuppies) are the only ones high enough to understand art. While the film ignores this trait and instead focuses on the misunderstandings of eating, I find it ironic that only people who like this movie have the same imaginary taste in movies as the characters in the choice of dinner. If these pompous characters in the movie had a video library at home, I'd bet American Psycho would be one of those movies.
