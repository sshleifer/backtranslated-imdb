Not only is this film badly scanned and staged, it's just uncomfortable. A beautiful novel is portrayed terribly wrong in this film. There have been many changes to the storyline, probably to optimize the timeframe. But what results is just confusing. The drama can not possibly overcome the script that removes the characters' motives for their behavior. In addition, the conversion to English does not work if everyone calls Esteban Patriarch Esteban. Dreadful. Please read the beautiful novel, if possible in Spanish. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. It will ruin for you what a wonderful experience could be.
