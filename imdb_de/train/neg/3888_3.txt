I started to melt, so I will make this review as short and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> There are these astronauts, and he's going into a spaceship with two other guys, you know? Except that something happens that exposes him to radiation and when they come back ... well, whatever happened to the other guys, but our astronaut started melting! No, do not just burn but melt! Like an ice cream cone in July! Well, maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. Anyway, it gets red and sticky and the fact that it melts makes it really angry. I guess he also looked at the manual for "Melting Man" because he suddenly knows he has to eat human flesh so he does not completely melt, and he begins to tear people apart. <br /> <br /> There are other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts (and melts), do you really need others? What's important, WHO will eat next and WHAT is left? How long does it take for him to disappear? WHY was this movie ever made? WHERE did you get the money? WHEN are you going to fall asleep while you look at him? <br /> <br /> I almost melted down, but I still have enough time to tell you that this movie is terribly boring, even though the idea is really cool and friendly from gross. The make-up is neat, but everything else is ... SPLAT
