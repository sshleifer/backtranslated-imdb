In 1967, a certain director had no idea of ​​a distant or near galaxy. He tried to complete a movie called THX and so on. This short story is a recast story of a certain George. I'm sorry, it's just cuteness to defend it. This is just a promotional presentation for the director, the actors, etc. al. It has little intrinsic artistic value. It is a booklet. The main role George plays is very good, as is the Leia character and the replacement Darth character. Everything else is normal commercial waste. What a waste. Nevertheless, it has done the job, I think. The rest of the movie is just water to kill time, I think. only a booklet.
