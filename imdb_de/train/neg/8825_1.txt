The only reason to even give this movie a single star is how much the end made me laugh. I had high hopes because I usually love bad campaign horror movies, but that just was not appropriate. It's really just a bad attempt to let a character slip slowly into insanity, which is not a bad conspiracy, but is done badly here. There are some scenes (like the end) that should not be funny, but have really made me laugh. There were a few times when I thought the movie was actually going in an interesting direction, but it never does what it could and should be. In my opinion, you should try Silent Night, Deadly Night, if you are looking for a Christmas Slasher movie.
