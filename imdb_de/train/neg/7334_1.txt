I think Stuart Bliss is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and the conspiracy ridiculous. I get the fact that the main character's wife leaving him caused a nervous breakdown, but it became so stupid and boring that after a while I became less interested in the characters. The movie kept going through the same ideas over and over again, adding nothing new or surprising to the plot. The whole thing with the Geiger counter became too much after a while, after Stuart had started to open the wall to see what was behind it after the counter had indicated there was something there. Then there were the repetitive scenes with the flyer and the confusing, where he meets. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed that this movie was a flop when I did not recognize any of the actors. Do yourself a favor when this movie appears, read a book! You will be better off.
