Carlito Way, the original, is a brilliant story about a former drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past behind and is therefore investing in a club and dealing with the difficulties involved. <br /> <br /> This movie was .... <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer and knew immediately that it would be bad. But after I released films from the past and found out they were great (Lucky Number Slevin, Tokyo Drift). ..I tried this and it failed within the first five minutes ... <br /> <br /> The script is something a teenager would think up if he gives himself five minutes to prepare. It was weak, with weaker dialogue. In a gangster movie, there immediately seems to be a need for romance. So Brigante decides to beat up a man for the girl ... and she says 'yes!' And if you have to behave badly, just throw racism around ... As we learn from the "Italian gangsters" ... <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, to say the least. I found Hollywood Nicky, hilarious. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hate all these musicians who turn to movies. Let's face it, the only reason P Diddy made this movie was that he was able to play gangsters ... The actress who plays Leticia was weak but beautiful. The sex scene was weak, but we were allowed to see her ... which was okay ... <br /> <br /> But overall, I expected that it shed light on the way Carito ended up in prison, and the Love of his life brought ... And in the end the assassin was completely added to the horror movie that is ... Carlito's Way: Rise to Power ..
