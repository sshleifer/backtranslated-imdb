OK, the depiction of the stereotypical "Indians" in this story is just WRONG. I agree that Elvis looks pretty good here, but yes, his complexion seems to change during the movie. I thought OK ... he was never so brown in real life. It's one of the most obvious brown "Indian" makeup I've ever seen. It's as bad as the "Indians" on "F-Troop" and the old Hollywood westerns played by Jewish and Italian American actors rather than real Native Americans! <br /> <br /> This movie is okay, but usually lame story and mediocre songs, as in all later Elvis movies. He only did it because Colonel Parker had tied him to long-term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of Elvis as possible! I keep thinking 'thank goodness' that Elvis did not stop making movies much longer after the film's release. It's cool, character actor Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie. <br/> <br/> Burgess Meredith's 'Indian' make-up is absolutely WONDER. It is certainly the worst. What did the filmmakers think? Did Mr. Meredith do this for the money or what? I love certain Elvis movies. For example: "Love Me Tender", "Jailhouse Rock", "Viva Las Vegas". I can even stand to watch his movie starring co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, 'Change Of Habit', in which Elvis plays a downtown doctor. Oh, at least Elvis made some good films, but the mediocre and the bad overburden the decent ones and the good ones. <br /> <br /> I will always love ELVIS! Thank you, thank you very much!
