There are so many false statements in this so-called "documentary" that I yelled at the TV. Bart Sibrel might be able to produce a flashy-looking DVD, but he lacks sadness when looking at the science behind his claims. <br /> <br /> He relies either to be inaccurate, not to tell the whole story, or the old favorite "government always lies to us" innuendos, and people believe what is being told them Not the correctness or the details are checked behind the claims. <br /> <br /> In addition, his "exclusive" or "unpublished" footage from various websites is freely available over the Internet. <br /> <br /> Next Reading the circumstances surrounding the filming of this production shows that he used false accusations to obtain interviews and creatively edited the answers to represent his own opinion. <br /> <br /> All allegations made by Mr. Sibrel about "inaccuracies", "errors" or "whistleblowing" in the Apollo program were thoroughly disproved. <br /> <br /> How do I get back the 40 minutes of my life?
