Director Todd Sheets has to be admired for his dedication, dedication and enthusiasm in filming: between 1985 and 2000, he shot a whopping 34 films. If his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is all they can afford, they're probably all shit (and a quick glance at their IMDb ratings seems to confirm my guess). Part 3 sees a group of disapproving people Students find the arrest a bit more eventful than usual after being attacked by hordes of living dead who fled a top secret army base just below their school. Director Sheets is working on a terrible screenplay by Brian Eklund (who relies heavily on the liberal use of the F-bomb) and what looks like the front of a huge cardboard ship (Space Shuttle) and his trademark grubby Gore (handful of innards that are under the clothes of his victims). <br /> <br /> Finally, it seems that an eternity is irritating Zombie Armageddon ends with a time-travel / paradox turning point, forcing viewers to re-watch some painful minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly ... was enough, Mr. Sheets. What have we done to earn it again?
