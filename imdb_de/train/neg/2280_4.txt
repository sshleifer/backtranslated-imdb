It is in the nature of business to try to profit from the success of others. Here we have a film that contains elements from the earlier "Dracula" (1931) and "Frankenstein" (1931) - in a Germanic town, the village leaders believe that vampires (in the form of bats) were the cause of death in recent years, bloodless Victim. Although shot on Universal (and in the Bronson Caves!), It's a Poverty Row feature. It's not fair to compare it to these earlier, more expensive and superior films. <br /> <br /> From the familiar and exciting entertaining music of the main titles (which must come from Mischa Bakalienikoff) and the Talky But well-done opening sequence, we await the arrival of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye around us to give a good 30 Mystery movie. Unfortunately, it does not happen. That's the disappointment. <br /> <br /> We get a little more than the formulaic elements of such films, but slowly, on a low budget, not enough from Dwight Frye, the exaggerated presence of Maude Eburne (Aunt Gussie) and the premise for Lionel Atwill ( Dr. von Niemann), to demand human blood or as he shows the mind control of his servant Emil (Robert Frazier) has never made it clear. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the technicolor 'Dr. X '(1932) - also with Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray, but as father and daughter - before I looked at it the way I did; it's an Oscar winner by comparison. So look at this first. Structurally, "The Vampire Bat" is still not so good. It fluctuates too much talking or unnecessary comic relief, without focusing heavily on the vampiric villainy. <br /> <br /> Next to 'Dr. X 'and' Mystery of the Wax Museum '(both 1932 with Fay Wray), Lionel Atwill's most famous appearances are the one-armed gendarme in' Son of Frankenstein '(1939) and as Moriarity in' Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon '(1943) , Dwight Frye steals all his manic scenes in 'Dracula' (1931). As "young lovers" Melvin Douglas and Fay Wray have a nice kissing scene, but that's about it. He appears in "The Old Dark House" (1932), and Fay is dragged around in "The Dangerous Game" (1930) by Joel McCrea. Then there is their classic 'Screamer' from 1933. Too bad that more time, money, and rewriting were not available for this film to bring out the talents and chemistry of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray, and Dwight Frye. Unfortunately, this bleakly disappointing movie receives only a 4.
