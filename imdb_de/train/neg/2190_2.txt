** Possible spoilers ahead ** <br /> <br /> Jason (also known as Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with his wife Virginia Leith, is involved in the quietest car accident on the screen that has ever experienced. Leith is beheaded and the doctor brings her severed noggin back to his mansion and rejuvenates his head in his lab. The exterior of the villa was reportedly shot on Tarrytown's Lyndhurst estate. The laboratory scenes were apparently filmed in the basement by someone. The bandaged head is kept alive with "lab equipment" that seems almost cheap to Ed Wood. Part of the library music - the culmination of the film - later appeared in Andy Milligan's THE BODY BENEATH. Leith's head has some fierce metaphysical discourses with another of Evers dropouts, a mutant chained in the closet. In the meantime, the good doctor strips his joints and looks for a body worthy of his wife's gabby noodle. The ending, in uncut prints, contains some splatters and splinters of time as the zucchini monster comes out of the closet to bring the movie to a close. It took three years for the thing to be released, and the audience gave it the bad reception it had amply earned. PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and a few others should have been declared the Year of Turkey in 1959.
