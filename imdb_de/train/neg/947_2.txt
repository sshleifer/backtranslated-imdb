As someone who has lived through the decade vividly and still remembers that decade, the real '70s would have been only half as funny and (half) normal that they would have been so much more fun. Actual children in this era did not behave in the vicinity as bright-eyed and normal as these children too. The country's youth was still under the influence of the hippies and drug culture - all the rebellion of the 1960s that spawned them, especially in the behavioral section, the irritability, the complacency, the self-just, the childhood, the irrationality of them - none of the characters has any of this. Someone compared to "Happy Days", and I can see why: It was both sitcoms that took place 20 years before the current time they were aired, and both offer only superficial, clichéd depictions of the actual epochs that do not even have that but they only show the obvious things - the fashion, the toys, the music, the appliances, etc. and that's it. For those who are too young to remember or were not born at that time, trust me The 70s were not like that, more than "happy days" were like the real 50s, because "M * A * S * H ​​*" was not exactly the life in a US Army medical base in the US Korean War, etc.
