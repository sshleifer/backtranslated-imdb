I actually have a liking for Christopher Lee, but that just was not his other performances ... and he was one of the better actors. <br /> <br /> The film does not match its premise. It's not that scary, it's overly melodramatic and draaaaaaags. Every time I thought, "Oh, here comes the good part," the good part never quite came up. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are anything but convincing. Most other characters also lacked depth. <br /> <br /> If I had been in the right condition, I might have enjoyed some MST-Fication at the expense of this movie, but .... Naaahhh ... really was not worth it. It was not really good, it was not really bad, it was just mediocre.
