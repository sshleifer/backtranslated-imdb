No doubt, Frank Sinatra was both a talented actor and a talented singer. After all, few actors these days can do a scene in a take just right, and that was pretty much Sinatra's modus operandi on set movies really started to fill up. The Tony Rome Detective series was nothing short of an attempt to compete with Dean Martin's at the same time released Matt Helm series. Maybe even a James Bond contest, but Frank has not really done anything in those years. His personal life in ruins, his music fading ... Sinatra seemed more like a relapse into the fifties. The last major Sinatra movie of that time was probably from Ryan's Express in 1965.
