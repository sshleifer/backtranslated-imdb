Considering the original movie version of "The Haunting", it's one of my top ten films of all time. I approached this change with shivers I was right to be careful as this movie is a poorly written and poorly executed load of old Toshs One should be ashamed The original was scary to me as a kid for one reason! You see nothing Robert Wise used an innovative camera and excellent lighting to create fear and that's why it works, the shame of the new version is that getting from A to B requires clever special effects and pyrotechnics, but sadder is the ingredients (Actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different, this film should only be seen as an example of a butcher shop in the studio!
