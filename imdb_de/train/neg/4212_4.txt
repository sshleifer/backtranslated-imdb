The beginning of this movie is awesome with a great sound and a bit of nice humor, but as soon as the movie turns into an animation, it quickly loses its appeal. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons that, at least for me, was that the colors in most animations are too quiet, too little contrast. It does not look good, at least on the VHS. Now and then it breaks out and looks good, but not often. The characters come and go too fast. For example, I would like to have seen more of Moby Dick. When the movie begins to pull, however, it pulls up with the entrance of the dragon again and the film then ends powerfully. <br /> <br /> All in all, simply not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last ten years.
