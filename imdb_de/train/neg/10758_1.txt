This is probably the most boring, worst and useless movie I've seen in the last year. The plot, which should have some philosophical aspects, seemed to me a very poor hollow copy of the matrix with many clich√©s: the lonely wolf cop, handsome, psychologically disturbed, sleeping with his weapon ... + nice, hard worker and shy, but handsome Scientist, you add a 2-cent plot and you have I, Robot! The obvious promotion for brands like FedEx, Audi, Converse, etc. has bothered me a lot. This movie stinks of commercialization and is more of a bad commercial, which unfortunately does not end after 30 seconds. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy if you have some time, instead watch a good TV show or rather read a nice book.
