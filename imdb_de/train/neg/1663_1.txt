First of all, this conspiracy is exaggerated - the girl wants to make it, everyone loves her, the snobby girl intervenes, everything looks lost, the girl gets carried away, everyone loves it again, etc. the heroine and the problems of single parents, and it is so predictable that you can practically sing along. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I hate the way they do classical music. You're sending the message that all those who engage in classical music are intrusive and snob and open-minded - I do not remember the quote exactly, but I remember one passage in the movie: Holly says, "Why did you the?" to be so tense ... so classic? "It's really insulting to label classical music this way. Third, I've reviewed it dozens of times, but the only reason I can make this movie is to use Britney Spears There's just no point. <br /> <br /> And oh yes, while the actress who portrayed Holly (I'm not sure if that was really her vocals or not) had a reasonably good voice not as great as they had planned - especially if she was on her belt - she was over-supplied all the time. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
