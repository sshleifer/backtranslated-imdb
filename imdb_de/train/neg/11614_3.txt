The Lady in Cement is a true course on social anthropology of the late 60s. The writing, not the acting, is the focus. Did I say - pure stock! Be prepared to be offended if you are female or gay. Broad and lady are standard terms, and gay pride and brawls are represented for what they were during the day (campers). Most lines are dropped, though some outstanding character actors show wonderful performances. The action scenes are banal, but it's fun to see Dan Blocker playing a tough guy who loves to beat hard. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the lush climax of their careers. Amazing that they were both 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53 years old. The music score, wait. , , was there a score? Well, you understand the point. Check it out with friends who want to have a good laugh. it is full of them.
