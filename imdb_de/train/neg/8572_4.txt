Thin Story is about two little city brothers and their arguments about the family honor. David Morse is the responsible, no-frills bull and "good" brother. Viggo Mortensen, the "bad" boy, is a former soldier and former convict. As an actor (especially in his earliest years), Sean Penn seems to modulate his performance under the method. He is the first writer and director of this artful, mixed drama. He works his script and his characters through the same methodical process and slows the pace to crawl (supposedly to capture every nuance and twist). This approach might be intriguing when dealing with three-dimensional characters that you should be interested in, but the photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not really convincing as siblings. Worse, we're expecting more from the veteran veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who have little chance of getting through anything interesting. The picture is confused with curvy sequences, a shaky narrative and confusing editing (always slanted to show the artistic excesses). Penn's tricks with the camera show a talented eye, but are usually an irritation. * 1/2 of ****
