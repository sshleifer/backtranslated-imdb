I saw this movie last night and I can barely remember it. The story is about a group of criminals fleeing a space penal colony. They fly in a dustbin from the space age to the moon; There they terrorize the trash can men working on the moonbase. <br /> <br /> I find it amazing that in garbage-low-budget sci-fi movies, it's often either desert planet or, as in this movie, criminals fleeing the penal colonies. Why that is, I have no idea. But I can say with some certainty that such films are always devilish. This is really no exception. It starts reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a reasonably good dance soundtrack. It degenerates into a boring sci-fi thriller. There is so little consequence in this film that I literally have trouble writing a helpful review. As you read this, I apologize that I can not familiarize you with the subtleties and subtleties of the movie. As a reminder, I remember a boring bunch of baddies, a boring bunch of goodies, a few nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman. Otherwise, I fight. <br /> <br /> If you think you might be interested in the activities of Lunar Littermen, I would not hesitate to recommend this movie. I would also recommend it to those who want to send their friends to sleep and steal their purses.
