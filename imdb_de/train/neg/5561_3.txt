I saw this movie titled "Tied Up". In general, I enjoyed Dolph's movies, so I tried it. It was not worth it. I read some of the previous comments about the box that seduced the audience. Do not be fooled. This is a bad movie at best. The action does not exist. The plot, how little of it has one, is very predictable. The movie seems to cut together in places. This simply stinks the place. Not even worth the price of a cheap night rental. As a little Dolph fan, I've always been waiting to see him in action. At the end of the movie you will still wait. It's best to avoid this movie and spend your time watching almost everything else.
