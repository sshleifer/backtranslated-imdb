I am so shocked that the average rating for this movie is 5.2 / 10. What influences me is definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I still wonder why I've seen it to the end. First of all, the plot is completely hopeless and the spectacle really terrible. I think a completely unknown actress would have been better for the role than Susan Lucci. With regard to Mr. Kamar Dels Reyes, I think it would have been a better choice for him to stay in his "Valley of the Dolls". In summary, it's a total waste of time (and I try to stay polite ...) at all costs. My rating is 1 and I still think it's well paid, but since we can not give O ....
