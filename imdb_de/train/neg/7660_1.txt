0 * s Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Director: Uwe Boll. Unfortunately, based on an attempt by video game director Uwe Boll to reconstruct the game into an action-packed nail-biter, he does not succeed. Instead, he makes one of the worst movies ever made! Although he gets a small celebrity like Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film lacks the necessary foundation for a movie to be good, such as a story, and some basic relativity of the processes of darkness and light. The movie jumps around and Uwe Boll has no creative control. Not to mention the bad CGI used in making the monsters. Although they looked cool and the feeds were good, they were a bit lame. Honestly, this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final rating 0/10.
