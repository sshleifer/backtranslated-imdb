A friend of mine was in the cast as FEDS agent (a non-talking part, as I recall). He brought it to DVD so I could see it. It was "interesting", but it felt like an amateur movie. A well made amateur movie. Really boring and badly written. It was probably fun to get involved and get involved, but it definitely did not deserve a lot of publicity. Maybe they would enjoy it in Omaha, but this Californian girl was bored and honestly embarrassed about my friend's involvement. <br /> <br /> If this filmmaker did or does make more films, he should really try. I have a really interesting story and good actors. I'm sure this was a great learning tool for her. I wish them good luck for the future and hope they can improve their film.
