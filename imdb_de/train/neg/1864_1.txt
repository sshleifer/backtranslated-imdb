I can not be a critic, but I think of this movie. Well, I watched the movie on Cinemax and above all, I just have to say how much I hate the plot I mean, come on, which scares the snowman next to the little kids. Second, it's pretty bloody, but I bet the movie is so low you probably used ketchup, so my critical vote is bomb !!! nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much.
