Dave goes through a divorce and his thoughts wander back to his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the word. I should say, he fixes the former girlfriend. He remembers the day the relationship ended. The dream sequences are missing only the hazy transitions. He lovingly remembers their favorite songs and places they went to. I'm not a consultant, but maybe that had something to do with the failed marriage ???? Dave goes to a support group and meets a half-old woman (also divorced), who, instead of "distracting himself from his horror," is interested in him. Did I mention how scary Dave is? He sometimes refers to the third person. He does not move his arms when he leaves. It's just funny. Too short, Dave plans to hunt down Mary (the old friend) and kill her ... um ... I mean, confront her. He does it that way. Which was really scary. He believes she is married, but STILL flies halfway across the country to meet her. He turns off her house to make sure she's alone before he enters. He has an awkward conversation with her, ending with sharing the gospel of Christ in about ten words or less, and flying back to the new young friend. We enjoyed the movie mainly from unintentional comedic value. I still entertain the woman with my Dave impressions ... "I've heard another Dave & Mary song!"
