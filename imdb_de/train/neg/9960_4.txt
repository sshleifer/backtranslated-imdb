MY BROTHER TOM <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> Following an Episode of Sexual Abuse by a Believer The Young Jessica (Jenna Harrison), a neighbor, makes a relationship with a strange boy (Ben Whishaw) whom she meets in the forest. Unfortunately, Whishaw has its own secrets that are no less disturbing and far more dangerous ... <br /> <br /> Dour drama, triggered by the courageous performances of Harrison and Whishaw, in which two kindred spirits dive into a mutual love of nature, having been traumatized by her experiences in the "real world". Unfortunately, their friendship flares up as the harsh reality invades and leads to an inevitable tragedy. Directed by Dom Rotheroe and photographed in digital video format, the film looks sporadic in some places (too many unwieldy close-ups and sloppy hand-held camera moves) and it takes awhile to find his feet, but the dramatic reward is rewarding.
