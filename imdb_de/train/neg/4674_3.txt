I do not know who's to blame, Miss Leigh or her director, but her performance as Catherine is almost impossible to see. Ben Chaplin, on the other hand, does an excellent job - in my view against all contradictions. His character is too charming and appealing. but certainly not as greedy enough to endure Leigh's stupidity. Chaplin seems confused about what can not possibly be understood as Leigh's shyness and lack of grace, but rather her orthopedic instability. There must be some credibility for his interest, but as it is played, it is incomprehensible. The performances are no joke. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney are wonderful, of course, despite their efforts to derail them. The side cast is also a pleasure to see. Too bad, the leads do not work together, because the production is nice to look at.
