I recently watched this movie on DVD and I have to say that I was not impressed. I know it's a taboo to beat independent films, but this movie was free of entertainment. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but the execution was unsuccessful. I thought, "Okay, they just start, the story will stop soon". Before I knew it, the movie was over and the story was never recorded. I can not say that I found the acting so impressive. It was pretty bad. The Star Wars pre-war trilogy is not bad, but it's still bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the term was, I expect two hours (because that's a safe guess). However, when the movie was done, I felt that I deserved some recognition for the willpower that I exercised, not to stop the film and go half way through. <br /> <br /> and finally bored out of my mind. I'm not one of those guys who need fast action and explosions in a movie. So do not start with me, because that's one reason you do not like it.
