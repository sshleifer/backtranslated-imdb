In short, this movie was boring. There was a lack of life and sparks. A big problem is the two connections. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry. He was bored and she was annoying. <br /> <br /> The visuals were interesting, but the scenes were not improved. If anything, the visuals tended to separate the audience from what was happening on the screen. None of the action sequences felt real, so the film did not produce any real drama or sense of danger from a better director. I kept thinking during the film, you know, this movie would have worked if Harrison Ford Sky had been Captain, Karen Allen Polly had been and Steven Spielberg had been the director. <br /> <br /> Ignore the critical reviews of this movie. The critics I think praise the film because they want it * and want it to succeed, even though it fails on so many different levels.
