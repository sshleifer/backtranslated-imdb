This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot is so full of holes, the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actor sounded like that they would read directly from the manuscript for the first time. Worst of all is Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character like in "Police Academy" - the same stupid womanizer - and that's not suitable for a leading man in a thriller. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that Hanson would do it "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague ...
