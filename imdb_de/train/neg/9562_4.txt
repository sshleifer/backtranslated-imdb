I think this could have been a decent movie and some parts are OK ... but overall it's a B-movie. The same goes for the plot, the parts are fine, but there are several holes and curiosities that do not quite fit together. Acting is mostly OK, I have seen worse. :) <br /> <br /> The beginning sets the standard, cars drive in the desert and make "cool", but completely unnecessary jumps through some small dunes (in slow motion! Cool!), as the drivers have never seen had sand before ... From there it will be a little better, but not much. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent it, get one more and use it as a warm-up. Keep expectations low and it might work for you.
