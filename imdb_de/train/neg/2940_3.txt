I saw this movie when I was really small. It's by far one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. I usually like strange movies, but that was just a little too much. <br /> <br /> There is not much conspiracy in the movie. If anything, it starts like Toy Story, where toys come to life, and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on adventures to save their new girlfriend Babette. From there follows craziness. There's the greedy ones, the Looneys, a sea monster named Gazooks, and some pirate singing shows that just make the movie more defensive. I can also feel that Babette is annoying and a bit too whiny. She definitely did not help the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, although I did not like this movie, there were some nice parts. I liked the camellia song. Although it was a song that was about being lonely, it had a friendly feeling. Then there was Sir Leonard. While most Looneys were just nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest. King Koo Koo was just a scumbag dr. Evil made to look like a serious villain. There was also Raggedy Andy's song, No Girl's Toy. It was definitely a good song for little boys who wanted to play hard. But honestly, these things did not improve the movie either. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) <br /> <br /> Although I would not recommend this film in person, I also have to admit that it has charming moments. See it if you're interested, but only if you're in the mood to take something "really" out of the ordinary.
