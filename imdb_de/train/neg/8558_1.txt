This movie was absolutely terrible, I even feel uncomfortable when I call it movie. It's the typical "Mumblecore" movie, with a zero plot and a bunch of random, vain twenty things that stumble around trying to "figure things out". I tried to give Mumblecore a chance, but let's face it, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> I'm not in sync with the cinema, I like Dogme95 movies, Idioterne is one of my favorite movies ever. So I do not mind if a movie is made cheap as long as there is an (ANY) substance. Everything in this movie is awful, the acting, the writing (or was it all improvised?), The direction, but MOST of all, especially the other, the camera work was just plain nonsense. The camera was nowhere logical, there was no consistency. I had to admit that I was a guy I'd heard nudity in this movie. So I thought well, even if it is terrible, at least there is nudity (yes, I know, I'm an idiot). Thanks to the extremely shitty camera work you never really see anything and the things you see, TRUST ME - YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE. This movie made me surrender on many levels. <br /> <br /> The dialogue made me vomit, the camera work made me vomit, but most of all the idea that this film was praised by some reputable critics. Well, that more than anything else, it makes me want to vomit ,
