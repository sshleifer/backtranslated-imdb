If you like movies that are spiced with little plot exposure and dirty sex, this movie is for you. On the plus side, the lead actor / actress (newcomer transsexual) has an interesting screen presence, but not enough to add up to little more than a slightly interesting movie. In essence, this film is three social outcasts (transsexual prostitutes, male hustlers and Russian homosexual immigrants) who have somehow bonded. Why is not clear. It is expected that these dropouts are essentially honest people who have the ability to love while jostling their bodies on the street. Law!! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with her ninety sugar dolls! The filmmaker shows a grisly, unpleasant side of life and wants us to believe that all of these seriously damaged people are normal to the extent that they have a trio that makes their lives easier. A fantasy, but unfortunately presented here as a real look of life on the wild side. All in all no conspiracy, no truth and no reason to spend a lot of time here. Unless, of course, that you just like to enjoy kinking !!!
