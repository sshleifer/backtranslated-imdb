I mean, I thought I heard that dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad and inappropriate that I can not really believe it. I laughed so hard at what was probably the worst writing and acting in human history, and I was seriously worried that I might have a heart attack and die directly in the theater. <br /> <br /> So that's the scene I'm talking about, the "hero" just watched as his brother collided and his brother's car just exploded there, just steps away from him (the hero) , The "hero" threw the expected "fit" when he saw something so tragic, and people tried to stop him from getting into the burning car. <br /> <br /> In the middle of his fit and his uncontrollable anger / emotional collapse he says "I'm so sad" - he said that correctly? Am I crazy?
