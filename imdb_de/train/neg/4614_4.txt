It is wrong how this film was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it's miserable, or because the collective abilities of the creative team behind it should really be earned, but because it was named prizzi in each category. Some would argue that old Hollywood pioneer John Huston lost it at this point in his career, but I do not buy it. Just last year, he signed the great UNDER THE VOLCANO study, a dark character study in Mexico that's one of the best he's ever done. Prizzi's Honor, on the other hand, a movie full of starpower, good intentions and a decent script, proves to be a big failure. <br /> <br /> The overall tone and action of a gangster who falls in love with a woman. Hitman introduces the bizarre thrillers that took Hollywood by storm in the early '90s, but the script is too cumbersome, the motives are out of and overall, the story seems to be unsure of what she's trying to be: a romantic comedy, a crime drama, a gangster saga, etc. Jack Nicholson (a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro, but not convincing sounds when he came from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the lead roles seem to be in paycheck mode sleepwalking through some parts. Anjelica Huston, on the other hand, is better, but her performance is sabotaged by her character's motivation: she begins the victim of contempt for her bigotry father, proves to be supportive of her ex-husband, and then becomes a vengeful slut wanting his head , <br /> <br /> The colors of the film have a flattened quality, as was done in the early 70's. Huston's direction is as uninteresting as anything else. There is a promise behind the story, and maybe in the hands of a director who seeks recognition, it could become something better, but what's left looks like a movie that nobody really cared about.
