This "crazy comedy" seems to be very forced. In fact, the actors are very keen to create an essentially inglorious script. And as a result, it's not really going anywhere. The idea of ​​a woman finding out she was pregnant after being divorced quickly is simply not so funny. And then, when Cooper sneaks away with the baby because he does not want it to be approved, it seems awfully insatiable and it's really hard to turn it into a comedy. This is really a shame, because the actors were more capable than the script and I just felt bored by the whole mess. Considering that Cooper made so many good comedies, I recommend seeing them instead.
