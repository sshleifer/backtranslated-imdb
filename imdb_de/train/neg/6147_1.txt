I really do not get all the worship this movie received. It is mawkish, unnecessarily manipulative, and avoids many of the big issues - Nash's affairs and his love of sex with men in public places. I suppose that's about bearable in the context of a commercial Hollywood movie, but what about all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to be moving, clutching his briefcase, wearing a hat and somehow this seems to be considered good acting? Anyone who has ever met a person with mental health issues will realize that Crowe's performance lacks a bit of caricature. It's also pretty offensive. And dare I say, on the right, to be really terrible
