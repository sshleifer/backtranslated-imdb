Oh man, I know what you think: "With such a title I can not go wrong!" Uh yes you can. I also loved the title, but I hated the stupid boy who played "Satan's little helper". I also hated the mother and the sister / daughter and her boyfriend - I hated all these people! Man, it was a torment that sometimes saw that! The ONLY reason why this is not 1/10 is because of the low budget. But oh man, I hated these actors, so stupid! I knew it would be bad, I think they saved a lot of money by using Halloween masks for the killer, and the Jesus costume in the end was really stupid. Oh the agony, do not look!
