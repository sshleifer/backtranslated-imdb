In THE FAN, Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? The problem with this type of role is that De Niro played very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, THE KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR, and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts. It was a bit hard to believe that as a frustrated obsessive sports fan, Renard would be an outspoken psycho. <br /> <br /> The character sheet is not the only problem with this script - it also lacks A Character Focus (a problem I had with The Untouchables, in which De Niro was supposed to have been great, but ended a bit flat). For some parts of the movie, I always thought that Bobby Rayburn was the main character, then the story changes to Renard. It also seems to have disappointed many sports fans who think this should have been more baseball focused. I'm not sure if this was originally meant for baseball fans, but again there are elements that indicate that the producers have decided who and what the story should focus on. <br /> <br /> I admit that I've been entertained by THE FAN (especially the soundtrack), but it's a very flawed movie, and it should be remembered that in the mid-1990s, characters from Spinner like SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, UNLAWFUL ENTRY, etc. were followed by steam a long time ago
