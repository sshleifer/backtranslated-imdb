What was the worst movie of 2003? "Cat in the hat?" "Gigli" Do not corn! I suggest it was this cruel little movie from earlier in the year. Badly written, badly edited and (if I can be so brave) poorly played, "The Order" is the film's black hole - a movie that is so dense that even the slightest entertainment can suck from its event horizon. It's not even funny by chance, like (for example) "showgirls". <br /> <br /> You know that the producers assume that their audience will not be very smart. They renamed the movie, originally titled "The Sin Eaters," because they felt that Americans were too stupid to understand what a sinner is, even though they do everything they can to explain what a sinful eater is Movie is. Instead, they are a completely generic title, and a picture of Heath Ledger, who looks grumpy, is more than enough to get you there. <br /> <br /> And, hey, what do you know, they were right! My ex-girlfriend saw the picture of Heath and got me involved. Congratulations, producers, you have hit your target market. She also liked Grease II, so you're in good company. <br /> <br /> Back to the topic, Heath plays a Catholic monk of a certain order (you guessed it) trying to investigate the murder of his mentor He has celibacy problems, possibly because no one who is in his right mind He would think he knew the slightest bit of religion, let alone a celibacy monk. The only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic. As much as I wanted to see the funny alcoholic's return to the big screen, his attempts at humor reminded me of all those jerks in my high school who made imitations of Monty Python, and meant, if they only liked the lines. The pythons were automatically funny , You know the kind of people I talk about. <br /> <br /> If I made more comments, I would be in danger of creating spoilers. Honestly, what spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created.
