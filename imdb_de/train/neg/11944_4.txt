I rented this movie and thought it was the sad 1959 version I saw as a kid. It was not. I was therefore very disappointed with what I perceived as a marginal spectacle, poor character development, and especially the failure of the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... the "Dog of Flanders" is just a cute "aside" to the movie. Get the version 1959!
