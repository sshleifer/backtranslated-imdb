It's a jewel if someone who has not watched a movie can not understand what is going on there. A phone call from Thakur for catching a big terrorist who is like God, and even the police do not know what's on his mind, but these people do. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of the movie is its speed the part is done. Actors are doing the best of the worst acting and actress is here for the time of songs. And what you can not forget is the cool Dialouge that seems to come in a very long time, but you can not easily understand it and try to find the last word I have not seen because of a brain roast
