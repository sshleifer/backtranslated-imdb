There are three types of bad movies - the cheap, the boring and the tasteless. The only really bad movies are boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> boring movies are just boring - if you do not go fast enough, you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> tasteless films actually have their defenders; The fact is that they are self-fulfilling for very sick people. <br /> <br /> Only the cheap, bad movies are really funny because the filmmakers wanted to make their films so desperate that they reach far beyond their abilities and available resources. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is just boring and tasteless; Fortunately, it redeems the fate and lack of money and skill by making it cheap. This movie is hilarious and it could be the last really funny-bad movie ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw this for the first time in a theater. May God forgive me; I laughed so hard that I rolled off my seat, and so did the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> It is clear that Derek and her husband-sponsor partly use this film as a satire; Unfortunately, the Dereks obviously lacked the resources to accomplish this. The "satirical" element comes as an impression of a student from a gay young man who gives the impression of Frank Gorshin of the puzzle player in Batman, who tries to claim that he is a robin - it does not fly over our heads, it has no idea where every human head could be. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some supposedly serious moments in this movie - it's supposed to be an action movie, remember - that are so cheesy, wondering if anyone is there spattering spoiled milk in the eyes. <br /> <br /> as for Derek's infamous tendency to reveal her breasts - I can not imagine any less erotic nudity than a photographic display, she looks so weird with those broad shoulders, I can 'I can not imagine what anyone saw in her. <br /> <br /> As for the plot - as it is - it is not; Derek hunts around in Africa and God alone knows why. then, her father - Harris - pretends to play in a crazy puppet show, and then, of course, there's the hunk'o'Tarzan, who seems to have wondered about advertising, unaware that the subject has changed - probably, because he has not seen any script - apparently nobody has. <br /> <br /> negligible camerawork, modest editing - if there were not the 3 way path with the chimpanzee, the movie would be unbearable - <br /> <br /> As it is, it's a real one Scream.
