Ridiculous-looking little boogers that produce foam and reproduce themselves. So far for the horror elements of this movie. The rest of MUNCHIES plays out like a comedy that's so stupid that it's not funny after about 15 minutes. I can imagine little kids cheering for these little boogers, but adults will only have the supposedly "smart" references to screen content like Capt. Kirk's log entries from STAR TREK, ET's most well-known scene, are being translated into a glaring statement by the filmmakers: "Look, we deserve the success of GREMLINS here!" and a cardboard cutout by Clint Eastwood telling us ... what about his western movies? The last one was totally lost to me ... Oh yes, and the disposal of chemical waste in caves seems to be a bad thing. I do not know where they got this idea from. <br /> <br /> Not to say that MUNCHIES is the most unbearable movie to hold on. It's just very, really stupid. And if you manage to crack a smile while you see it, you'll probably feel stupid after doing this after the movie is finished. <br /> <br /> Good Badness? Yes, but only if "stupid", "backward" and "ridiculous" criteria are what you are looking for. 3/10 and good, um, 6/10.
