This film is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people have been paid to make this piece of garbage shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talents in the entertainment business. The idea that the audience paid to watch this movie (and like an idiot I rented the movie) is also daunting. <br /> <br /> The obsessed teacher (3 years ago) kills a teenager's family because he wants them. For no reason does he kill mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you will see the bad acting and direction. Years later, the obsessive teacher breaks out of prison. HMM - usual bad writing - no one in the city he's terrorized knows until the last minute. The obsessive teacher somehow becomes like a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniff out people, and be a super killer with a knife. For sure!!! Now the obsessive teacher kills the hotel girl for no reason, fun with the buttonhole for fun and starts chasing the teenager's friends. Now there is the perfect way to make the girl love you. Obsessed teacher sneaks out of the hotel - again it's stupid, every cop would recognize his face - but he walks right past them. Now he kills two policemen in front of a teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is not a single positive thing about this dump. If another profession triggered work of this low quality, they would be dismissed. But these idiots earn hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and run this garbage.
