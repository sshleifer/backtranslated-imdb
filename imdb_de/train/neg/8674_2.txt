The first few minutes of "The Bodyguard" have a Campy charm: it starts with a crawling text from the Bible (the part that Samuel Jackson presents to his impending victims in "Pulp Fiction"), with two karate-school teachers in New York arguing about the eternal question of humanity (who is better, Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then Chiba appears and plays himself; He immediately stops a hijacking and breaks a bottle with his bare hand. Unfortunately, any intentional or unintentional entertainment value is soon destroyed by the disjointed story, the prolonged lack of action, and the poor quality of the present action. To keep it simple, here's why "The Bodyguard" is an unbearable movie: <br /> <br /> 1) You do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There are hardly any fights. <br /> <br /> 3) The fights that are there are short and terribly filmed. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is beautiful, her face is beautiful. Just for her I give "The Bodyguard" a second star of 10. This movie lasts 87 minutes like five hours.
