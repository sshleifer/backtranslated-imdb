"Kids Like thesis" could be a decent movie given the topic. Instead, it has become a substandard, everyday TV movie of the week that does not have much to offer. The action is stale, the action is predictable and the direction does not exist. To get a better movie on the same theme, try the award-winning "Le Huiti√®me Jour," a film that really cares about people with Down syndrome. In "Kids Like Thesis" they are used merely as an excuse for whining sentimentality. Pretty awful. 1.10
