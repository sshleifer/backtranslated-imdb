What has Ireland ever done to film distributors who try to represent the country in such a derogatory way? This film begins as a primer for film students on Irish film clichés: spicy priests, spitting before shaking hands, Viehmarts on the town square, cycling through rural meadows against the backdrop of a folk music. It quickly becomes clear, however, that the main theme of the film is the great Daddy-O of Irish Clichy - a religious dispute. It is a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her catholic born child is raised. This seems like a reasonable request, but not to the villagers of the 50s where Wexford lives. Instead of sending her to a Catholic school, she decides to go to Belfast and then to Scotland, where a few more clichés are revived. While she is there, her father (who looks eerie like George Lucas) and his family are being boycotted at home, which is very vicious. I'm not going to tell the end, not because I think people should watch this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we should sympathize with it, but instead end up pushing it to a life. The villagers are portrayed as fanatics whose prejudices should be combated, but traumatizing their children seems an inappropriate way. In addition, it bears charges that it cruelly entertains when attempting to draw analogies with the current Northern Irish peace process: the woman is told by her lawyer that she must set "preconditions for her return". The film is supposedly based on a true story, but its themes have been much more ingenious in the past, with less recourse to worn clichés.
