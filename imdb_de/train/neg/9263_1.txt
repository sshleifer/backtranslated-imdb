What was the deal with the clothes? They were all dressed like something from the late '70s of the early' 80s. The cars were even outdated. The school was outdated. The nuns' clothing was outdated, and the hospital looked like it was in the 1940s, with its sections and wooden staircases and other things. Nothing in the whole movie meant that it took place in 1991. My mother laughed and said, "Geeeee-od! WHEN was this movie MADE?" When we pressed the "INFO BUTTON" on our remote control, we were sure that 1991 had to be typo! Did anyone else notice? My favorite part, however, was when the woman told her haughty husband on the phone about the inverted cross in the mirror, and he just said, "Well, I have a convention meeting, I'll talk to you later." This line was just classic. AS A MAN! My mother's favorite area was when they gave their own Rottweiler to the "Spawn of the Devil Child". My mother said, "Exactly what the devil's spawn needs ... a Rottweiler". She also enjoyed all the people who collapsed in the churches and clung to their breasts. Their OTHER favorite part was the guy on the school parking lot driving 5 miles an hour and driving straight into the garbage truck / dump truck / front loader thing. He had about 20 seconds to just stop the car ... but he just kept going, with a really stupid blank expression on his face. I mean, how fast can you drive on a school parking lot?!?! What ever!
