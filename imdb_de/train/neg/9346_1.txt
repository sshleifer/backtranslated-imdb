This movie was a yawn from titles to credits, it's boring to boredom and the acting is wooden and stilted! Admittedly, this was director Richard Jobson's directorial debut, but who lit up a poorly-developed script like this one green? Looks like another money is coming out of the government project (Scottish Screen is surprised, surprised). I fell asleep almost three times and my review unfortunately has to be more restrained than this one. Please, please, Mr. Jobson, whatever you did before regulating this sedative for a movie, go back!
