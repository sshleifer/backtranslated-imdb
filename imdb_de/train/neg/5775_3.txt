They show this on an off-network. It's good crap. It's not as bad as the B-movies they show on Saturdays on the sci-fi network, but still a fair amount of crap. The acting is passable. The plot and the writing are pretty much below average and the pace is too slow. Every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where things are finished before the end credits - not the climax of the movie, the resolution. Also, large parts of the cast seem far too old for the age range they play. The whole thing is predictable, boring and not worth watching. Save Your Time It's not even worth the time to watch it for free.
