Tara Reid as intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) as a dollar shop Constantine and Stephen Dorff as well ... it's STEPHEN DORFF FOR CHRIST SAKE !!!! I just want to thank these brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort. Here's an idea, just my humble low opinion of how the movie goes public, but it follows right with your previous decisions. A film about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history inventing a pill to cure all the diseases that were ever known to man, and to come here In The Clincher they must be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you would love that. Seriously, though you owe me $ 7.50.
