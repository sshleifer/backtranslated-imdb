I begin to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how grumpy his films could become. This movie was a complete waste of time to see. My first complaint was the cover of the DVD where they treated his picture and made him look slimmer and younger looking like crap in the movie. He has his big pot belly and his double chin for him and the miserable and bored expression on his face. <br /> <br /> The whole plot At first it was ridiculous and dragged on for far too long. The entire film led to the finale, in which Seagal and his team, under the influence of a top-secret chemical adrenaline enhancer against the military, had to deal with a lot of useless dialogue, and not to mention the ridiculous and constant synchronization of Seagals voice, even in the middle of a statement. The dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was pretty weird fighting scenes in the movie were terrible. The time when Seagal Foug Man could not even see what was going on. There were close shots of him banging his arms in the camera and then the person who was flying through a wall or something. He recalled the old kung fu series on TV too much slow motion for the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> I think this is the worst movie of Seagals so far and I am glad that I did not buy this movie or I would have been very excited as I am a big fan of bin Seagal the Aikidoist. The action star disappears quickly and seems to get worse with every performance.
