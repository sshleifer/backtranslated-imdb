This is a really silly movie in this typical 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptually, it resembles Rush Hour, but it lacks all the action, laughter, and chemistry between the main characters in the film. You have to know that I like Jay Leno as a stand-up and talk show host, but he just can not act. He's terrible when he tries to act hard - he barely manages to smile at this trademark while saying his one-liners, which by the way are not very funny. And seeing him (even) running is not a pleasant sight. I also feel that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - does not give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese. Do not even let me start with the story. I give a 2 out of 10 points.
