This movie was like a bad train wreck, horrible as it was, but you had to keep watching. My friend and I rented it and wasted two hours of our day. Do not get me wrong, acting is good. But the movie as a whole has made us both angry. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After this movie, I had to rent something else, which was a bit easier. Jennifer Tilly is as always a very dramatic actress. Her character is manic and not all there. Darryl Hannah is overplayed, but she has done a wonderful job finding out the situation she is in. More than once I called the TV and told her to fight back or get violent. All in all a very violent movie ... not for the faint of heart.
