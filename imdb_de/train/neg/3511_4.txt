"I work for a weird company that is going into industrial espionage in the future, and start confusing myself who I really am, sh * # t! I have a headache and things are shaky, oh no, here comes another almost subliminal, loud montage of meaningful, but cryptic images ... '<br /> <br /> I've rented this movie because it's just a few reviews it was all cheap. Why? Cypher is a cheap, distracted, boring movie that plays in a poorly realized, bland future with wooden leads and a ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> An eerie feeling that something interesting might happen, lets you watch a series of more and more stupid and unconvincing events before the filmmakers slap you in the face, the worst of Bond a Duran Duran video connects. <br /> <br /> It's painfully obvious that they've heard the production. Who-Style improvised special effects to record some good (albeit a bit of Babylon 5) CGI set tunes. This submarine fight club, the future thriller of Philip K Dick, seeks far more scope than its modest budget allows. Cool Blue-Moody uses melancholy seriousness - disappointingly stupid. This is not an intelligent sci-fi, this is the plot of a computer game.
