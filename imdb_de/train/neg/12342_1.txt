Anyone familiar with my ratings in the Internet Movie Database knows that I can be a grumpy bastard from time to time. There are many films that I do not like, and for some inexplicable reason, I have felt the urge to review them. However, if someone is curious to know the name of the worst movie I've ever seen, then Transylvania 6-5000 is just what you need. Without question, this is the title of the all-time No. 1 terrible movie. I can not believe that I made it to the finish from the beginning! <br /> <br /> It's clearly meant to capture the taste of Mel Brooks Young Frankenstein, but the movie was a funny take on horror film traditions, it's a desperate and misguided attempt to laugh at embarrassingly weak material , Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr seem to be ashamed to be a few journalists in what is now Transylvania (maybe they realized early on that they were doomed to this guy). In their research they meet all the main monsters of former horror favorites such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. Anyone who defies this movie to the end can pray that it will be driven through their hearts at stake to free them from the tedium of boredom. It's a career jump for everyone involved and proves that if the comedy turns out great, it will lead to a terrible conversation.
