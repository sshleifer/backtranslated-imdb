The comeback looks promising, with a brutal death scene of a mask carrying a killer. The mask itself is also pretty cool and looks almost identical to the one from the Slasher movie "Granny" of the 1990s. From then on, the movie is usually boring. We get some more deaths, which are good, but there are not enough of them. The reason why the deaths are so good is because they are raging and bloody. The story behind the movie is actually very interesting and would have worked very well if it had not been so boring. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this if you are not a die-hard collector.
