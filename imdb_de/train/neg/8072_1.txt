(One or two possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is probably the worst movie ever released. Nothing makes sense, there is a conspiracy about a girl who has strange visions of people who may be dead or not. The entire movie is just a series of random shots of things that are not really connected at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is not there, the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing that the movie is just harder to see. <br /> <br /> I was always waiting for something to tie the film together, but nothing came. Definitely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
