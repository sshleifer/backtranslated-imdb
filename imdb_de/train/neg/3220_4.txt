I absolutely hate when a film breaks completely after spending an hour or so. and that's exactly what happened with this movie. I was fascinated by the actors and the fact that Malamud wrote his source story. I have not read this story, but I can not imagine it will end when this movie ends. Fortunately, I did not pay good money to see or rent them because my library had it. ohhhh, such a waste of excellent acting (especially the woman was so perfect). But milo o'shea as a Jew? !!!! that was funny now. I have not researched yet, but it was as if the director lost his marbles or died by the film to 3/4. Before that time, a story and characters developed, there were some nice plot points and there was not wasted too much time. but oh, the last half hour - if that was not the shabbiest, worthless solution I've ever seen, I do not know what is. I just hate it when faith is so destroyed. it feels like an act of violence.
