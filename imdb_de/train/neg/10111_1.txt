Terrible drama, bad plot, kitschy make-up, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. I have never seen a worse movie in my life. After five minutes, I decided to go forward to see if anything redeeming would happen ... It did not. (Except for a nice breast pick) The film was apparently filmed in a furniture store, and the same stock was used for at least 90% of the sets. You even see this same red chair in different "places". If you are filming a movie, rent at least one office building and one apartment, not a warehouse, where all of your actor's dialogues are played back. (Note to the producers) small office space and a month's home are much cheaper than a whole warehouse, and both are a bit more versatile and believable. If you spend your money on renting these people, I hope you get it with a return guarantee ... I'll reclaim your money ... I spent just $ 2.99 to rent this night, and me I feel cheated.
