What do you get when you mix a lump of stereotypes with a non-directional tempo and a bunch of characters you do not care about and a failed attempt to create an appealing visual style, and an even bigger clich√© of lumps and a weak sense of humor big budget? You get one of the most unbearable movies ever made! Of course I refer to Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that people might say while watching this movie: "Ooh, wow, the plot is off the episode, that was before one Millions of times not done, and much smarter than in this movie. "<br /> <br />" Wow, look at all the flashing lights and the grainy film texture and experience the thing transitions! The director is so eager to Making things artistic and creating a visual style It's too bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes it's in, and that's too bad that most of them do they are irritating! "<br /> <br />" I've heard this dialogue exchange in about twenty thousand movies! "<br /> <br />" I've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies! "< br /> <br /> "Again, this!" <br /> <br /> "Uh, they did not dice about half an hour ago revealed this "conspiracy"? that should be surprising? "<br /> <br />" If this movie is supposed to be a hard chick showing her kicking her ass ... when does she not do much of it? "<br /> <br />" I can not believe how unoriginal this dialogue is. "<br /> <br />" How long is this thing? I feel like I've been watching it for over four hours. "<br /> <br />" I have no idea what just happened, but I do not feel very motivated to find out. "<br /> <br />" Is this over? "<br /> <br />" I want my money back. "<br /> <br />" The songs in this soundtrack feel so abused here "<br /> <br />" It's ironic that all the cursing they use actually affects everyone's impact. "<br /> <br />" UGH. "Finally," I may have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this film to me. "<br /> <br /> In summary, this film is a failure in almost every respect. Avoid Watching It At Any Cost If your house is on fire and this film is in the only room that is not flammable, you should seriously consider getting burned alive. <br /> <br /> (If I am That's because I just spent it. I've watched this movie for over two hours, and I did not enjoy it very much.)
