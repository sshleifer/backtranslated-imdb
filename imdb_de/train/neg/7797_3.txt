This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but I'd like to say some of the reviews I've heard turned out to be unjustified. <br /> <br /> As for the pure film technique, this director is competent. The limited budget and the VHS camera hold him back, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements, and scene scenes are pretty professional. I've seen a lot of movies where "directing" was a lot worse. At least the scenes flow in a non-confusing way and he has some clever shots here and there. The forest scenes also had a decent atmosphere. With a VHS camera you can only do so much, and he does a good job in terms of technical aspects. As for artistic value, there is none. The scene where the camera moves down so we can see a man urinating in the woods for 15 seconds embodies the artistic style of the entire movie. This is pure garbage ... total garbage. <br /> <br /> For a movie in this budget class, the gore is decent. It's obviously a fake, but there's a lot of it and it's very fancy. <br /> <br /> I saw the American version with intentional camping sync. This was a good idea (and it was the only thing that allowed me to go through the movie) ... Unfortunately, it's overkill, especially towards the end. <br /> <br /> It's really a horrible movie, but I have to recommend it for its stock value. It's really hard to find a movie that's worse than this and put this kind of category in a unique category.
