The husband and wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley was a big star in the variety show, yet they shot only a few movies. As with some other interpreters of their time (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence), the most accessible footage for Fields and Seeley is the biopic ABOUT, in which they are portrayed by other actors: "Somebody Loves Me" with Betty Hutton and the Inimitable song and dance man Ralph Meeker. <br /> <br /> In their heyday, Fields and Seeley were so popular that another man and wife Variety act - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - gained almost as much fame that they acted almost identically, and became the "second team" Fields and Seeley. Behind the stage, however, there was a big difference in the couples' living arrangements. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites, paid room rates for each meal they ate, and eventually ran out of money. Block and Sully lived modestly and cleverly retired. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone Short are manned by two Patsists wearing the leggings. Apparently, these two men in 1930 had a small own name worth knowing, although I have never heard of them. Eventually Fields and Seely rush in and start playing. They both have a lot of pep and they are pretty attractive. <br /> <br /> I was upset that both performers are constantly moving as if they are about to dance, but until the third, they never do that of the three songs they play in this short form. When they finally start to hoof, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased to see this opportunity to see these two great performers doing their Vaude act. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never became stars in film musicals. My rating for this question: Only 4 out of 10, and I stay with Block and Sully.
