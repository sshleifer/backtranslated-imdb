I saw the original German version without synchronization and was surprised how bad this film actually is. I thought I had seen my bad movies, like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Granny, Zombie Lake and so on, nothing could have prepared me! It was really a pain to sit through this movie because there is no plot, no good acting and also the special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies, which are nothing more than white make-up and their old clothes are wearing your good set would not be ruined by ketchup and jam stains. <br /> <br /> If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, then watch out for everyone else, do not, because you'll regret it!
