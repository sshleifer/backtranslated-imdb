I was excited to discover this comedy of the late sixties, which featured some of my favorite characters - Maggie Smith, a very young Bob Newhart, and of course, Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was compounded by the fact that the film does not work either as a comedy or as a perfect robbery movie. Ustinov plays a little time-crook just outside the prison, who settles his sites with a large American corporation in London. Ustinov leafs past weak CEO Karl Malden and tech geek Newhart and pretends to be a computer expert. He plans immediately the "perfect attack" of the film. To do this, he has to go through a tamper-proof security system that protects the company's mainframe. And here is the problem one. His perfect plan works only because everyone else in the movie is remarkably trusting and stupid. His lame excuses are considered evil, and this must be the only data center that does not deal with video cameras. The second problem is the robbery (really cheating) that occurs within the first 30 minutes of the movie and robs the rest of the picture of dramatic tensions. Maggie Smith is a sad Miscast, as Ustinov's neighbor / secretary next door / secretary who just can not keep a job. I love Maggie Smith, but she also seems to be here too, and the part called for a crazy, physical comedian. Besides, Ustinov and Smith do not have chemistry together, maybe it's the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, which is almost no real romance, still looks a bit scary. Ustinov co-wrote the script, and it was considered well then, but I found it out-of-round, snaking and a sad waste of a great cast.
