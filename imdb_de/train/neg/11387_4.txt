Medellin is a fantastic place to live, work and study. I've been there twice and never heard of guerrilla activities, paramilitaries taking tourists hostage, or anything like that. There is "invisible police," but it's not a Big Brother system. There are just enough police to make them visible in everyday life, but they do not bother anyone without good reason. La Sierra is an interesting documentary, as the teenagers that he portrays in the movie essentially become his own characters. The directors of the film have carefully cut out lines of action between the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra, and when a "character" dies, there is real pathos. However, it is hard to imagine that the three youths are members of the Bloque Metro, a gang that terrorized La Sierra before the Colombian government began restructuring the country. <br /> <br /> La Sierra does not give a precise account of life in Colombia; There are, of course, things to be careful about, such as petty crime, but considering that pickpocketing takes place in "modern" cities like London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia does not seem to be that different. The Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show the world that the once war-torn country is flourishing more than ever.
