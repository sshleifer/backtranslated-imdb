It was very hard for me to see this after the first 5 minutes of the movie. I managed to get angry for 45-50 minutes before disarming myself in disgust and seeing Monster House instead (which is a lot of fun, by the way). <br /> <br /> The story has huge holes. The plot is hugely exaggerated and boring, the acting is terrible, especially by Justin TImberlake, who should really stick to what he does well (look stupid and sing like a castrato). Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable, especially when he danced to rock music for no apparent reason in half of the movie after he and Timberlake met. The characters of Freeman and Timberlake seem to have a kind of father-son relationship that resembles something or something that is simply not obvious at all, except that; Although Freeman's character seems to have nothing but contempt for Timberlake's ignorant and rather stupid nature, he still pulls out all the stops to help him find a completely ridiculous cover. <br /> <br /> It would take some incredible exposure of unbelief to give the story a credit that is simply absurd and blown out of all proportions. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this movie, it's a waste of time.
