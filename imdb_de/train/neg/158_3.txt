Warning spoiler follow. Excellent restoration of the base in the Antarctic, where the real events of the film took place. Apart from that offensive !, scandalous! Shot in Canada; probably from a largely Canadian occupation and occupation. I saw the last half of this movie recently in Global Television here in Canada. Not much to say except how deeply appalled I was, what a blatant piece of American revisionist propaganda it is; and with Susan Sarandon from all the people! I can only assume that Canadian-born director Roger Spottiswoode was forced to make the USAF the hero of the film, as the real savior of a small private airline in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
