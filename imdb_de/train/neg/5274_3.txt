If you like movies about creepy cities, hotels, homes, states (ala the Eagles "Hotel California"), etc. that have the people "going straight", read almost every Stephen King novel instead. If you like the setting of Disappearance, first read King's "Desperation", but also read "The Shining," "Salem's Go," and "Needful Things." <br /> <br /> The crow motif, the desert, The family desperately driving to flee or avoid possession is tired. Why did not you just make the movie from the novel "Desperation"? Maybe they approached King and he did not mix? Must be. <br /> <br /> Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin are pleased with the reunion, and both have performed well over the years, but they are still TV and direct-to-DVD actors.
