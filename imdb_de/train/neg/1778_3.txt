I have nothing against a quick fright movie, but this nonsense derived from Stephen King is too fresh, too bright and modern. The plot about a new teenager in a small town who is a "sleepwalker" - a sort of cross between a vampire and a werewolf - and who feeds on the blood of female virgins, asks for a mysterious, ambiguous treatment. This thriller receives an inappropriately colorful appearance with little atmosphere. The children are predictably pretty and energetic, but the big plus is Alice Kridge as the boy's mother; Kridge, from "Ghost Story", never broke out of the filler female, and it's a huge loss that she was no longer used. Their performance is scary and intense, suggesting that "Sleepwalkers" could have been a much better movie with a different focus and focus. It's too over-the-top and commercially driven, with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama. Stephen King appears in a cameo, as do the directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 of ****
