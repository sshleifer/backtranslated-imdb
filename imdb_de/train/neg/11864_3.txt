the characters in deep-free prints. You've seen all the characters in other films, I promise. the script tries to be nervous and annoying, but fails miserably. it does throw some hangover and super bath comedy with it, but the jokes are out of the left field, fully enforced and almost completely ignored after being cracked. The hot chick is old and has no personality. It's just a blond chick from the early thirties with a few smart butts who do not wear lingerie and wear jokes that are less adorable. The attraction between Molly (the hot chick) and Kirk (the dorky love interest) is barely communicated. The attraction in any area where you can find it is a completely platonic relationship until an awkward and predictable seat basket occurs. after that they are in a full relationship and it is just incredibly lame. The main focus of this film is not the relationship, but a failed attempt to make a slippery super badquest movie with a semi-responsive storyline. I could compare that to the hangover in his forced nature. I will not understand that. I could go on, but it's just useless. Just do not pay to see this movie.
