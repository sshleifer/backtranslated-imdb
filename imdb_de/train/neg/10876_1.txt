What was that D-Movie? Bad drama, bad special effects, and the worst dialogues / actions I've ever encountered. The only cool thing here was Coolio, who had a nice cameo as a freaky policeman. The rest of the movie, however, is dreadful and boring. It's not that bad, you can laugh about it. Just crap. And who compares that with the Evil Dead series, Tomb Raider could just as well compare with Indiana Jones (ok, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 out of 10
