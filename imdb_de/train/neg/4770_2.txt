I wanted to like this movie, yes it's a SAW, blah blah blah blah rip-off, but I like those movies. If done well, this had all the ingredients to be a good, not brilliant, but good movie ... unfortunately these ingredients were gone! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives with their conqueror were introduced one after the other (hood removed), the remarks and a liner are just awful, yes I know, bad writing .... but that's more as that, it was bad writing coupled with bad action. Two of the prisoners had been in a relationship with each other and realized this later in the film ... Sorry, I even wonder why I bother to review this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I'LL HIDE WITH PLOT, HIDE PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISAPPOINTING!
