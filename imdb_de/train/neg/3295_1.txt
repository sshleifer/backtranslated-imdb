... then do not look at this movie. They completely ruined the premise of the show. In the movie, the duke guys are idiots, Daisy is trampy, Roscoe is scary, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are faithful to the original characters. At least Enos is a bit close. <br /> <br /> At one point they open the doors to enter General Lee, Nuff said. <br /> <br /> The original show might not have been a great TV, but it was entertaining and the characters made sense. This movie is stupid and Dumber meets the simple life.
