I found the movie partly good. The beginning was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the movie were good. The camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and I did not like it when they did not fully cover the actors. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the movie were really not that great we expect a lot from such films. <br /> <br /> The dialoques made no sense and I do not think they were very funny. <br /> <br /> I had the feeling that they wanted to copy films like telephone sets in the form of dialogues, but failed miserably. It seemed like they saw a lot of scenes between the actors, and they did not make sense of the story. <br /> <br /> the entire film contains only the law. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was a waste the time it's an ok movie, but not gr8
