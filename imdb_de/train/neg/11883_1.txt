After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and unable to fall asleep, I decided that I could be entertained just as well while suffering from sleep deprivation. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake! <br /> <br /> Here's the plot (potential spoilers, if you even care about it): A neurotic man with a candy addiction (Josh Kornbluth) works as a slow motion for a ridiculous society. Suddenly, he gets the chance to do "perm", which seems to be the favorite phrase of this movie. But with a secure job and a steady income under control, Josh decides for some stupid reason that he does not want to do it. He hopelessly confuses some minor tasks, and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. His inability to send several "very important" letters within a certain period of time should be considered funny, but is just stupid. Josh meets and cheats a lawyer and they end up in bed together (obviously a fantasy of Josh in real life, as that would never happen). A few other things happen, but it is too banal and unsightly to address now. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is billed as a comedy, I only laughed twice; The first time was the first shot of Josh Kornbluth (my first reaction was a suppressive fear) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman (yes, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrible person I've ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight, bald-headed Jewish man whom I believe has sex with beautiful women. I have no sympathy for Josh's character at all. He is lazy and unmotivated and I just do not appreciate the failed attempts at humor. Skip it, even if your life depends on it.
