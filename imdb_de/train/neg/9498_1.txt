When I search for new cars, I expect that no boats will be shown. When I drink Cola fountain, I should expect that the drink contains cola. When I look at a movie that has the name of an excellent scientist, I expect it to be relevant to that person or their work in some way. It could be people discussing my grandmother's diary. The material treated is relevant only insofar as it easily defeats science. I fell asleep the first time I tried to look at it, and the second time I stopped to look at it. I'd rather watch over the latest blockbuster. However, this is far from being worth anything. Avoid at all costs.
