I did not expect much from this movie, but oh brother, what a stinker. <br /> <br /> I found this gem in a huge box of awful 5-dollar DVDs at Walmart (where else)? As cheap as this disc was, I feel demolished. The special effects had a high school look, the camera work was clouded by shaky tripods and sketchy lighting and the acting was a perfect example of the "Christian school". One can imagine the production company's long and tiring "prayer meetings" after the hurry came back - the people who funded this thing must have had serious antibiblical feelings towards the incompetent production company that triggered this thing. Think of their fear as they saw their $ 914.86 investment go up in smoke. Someone asked why Christian films are so bad - maybe the Xian filmmakers need to watch GOOD movies and try to copy some of the things they do so well. Credible stories and characters, less hysterical arm waving and fanaticism, oh, and a story that appeals to everyone, not just true believers. That Stop the sermon, save it for the church. Take, for example, the Omen or Prophesy series. Excellent films with captivating storylines, great cinematography and intense music. No hysterical arm waving. No sermon. <br /> <br /> If this movie had a laugh, it would have been MUCH better.
