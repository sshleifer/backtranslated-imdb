This movie was rented by a friend. Your choice is usually good. I read the cover first and expected a good movie. Although it was <br /> <br /> a horror movie. Which I do not prefer. But during the movie, I did not think of any horror. It was a boring, <br /> <br /> not very entertaining movie. The appearance of Denise Richards was again a pleasure for the eye. But that's it. We (the four of us) are a bit disappointed. However, feel free to see this movie and judge it yourself.
