In addition to the Slasher films of the 70s and 80s, the films about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror subgenre. While Slasher films had "Black Christmas" and "Halloween" to get it going, zombie movies had George Romero's "Dead" movies. And not surprisingly, soon after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted to bring in money. Especially many Italian directors were interested, such as Lucio Fulci, who brought us zombie a year after Romero's "Dawn of the Dead", in Italy and some other countries known as "Zombi", and there Fulcis movie was known as "Zombi 2" , Apart from the walking dead, it has no relation to Romero's film, but is a good movie in itself. It was a great success in Europe and 9 years later a sequel was born. <br /> <br /> Pros: Many beautiful, lush landscapes. Great score. The acting is not good, but the cast is game and seems to enjoy the experience. After a slow start, the tempo moves like an action strip. Lots of cheese and unintentional joy for bad movie lovers. Good job with the make-up effects. Lots of blood and some decent blood. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Virtually less plot. Nothing you have not seen before. Obviously, he tears some things from the first films of "Return of the Living Dead" from. Cardboard figures. Not aged too well due to the bad rock music of the 1980s (Not that I say that all rock music of this period is bad), the clothes and the overall look of the film. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: First of all, this is not a true continuation of the cult classic of Fulci. In fact, I do not know if it was ever intended to continue where the movie left off. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill during production and was eventually replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei's films are pretty ridiculous, but like this movie, many are good for camping. And that's all this movie really is, just something that you can watch for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (So-bad-is-good rating) 2/5 (Serious review)
