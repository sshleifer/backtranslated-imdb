Man, that gets a lot of good reviews in the review books. Honestly, I found it too slow and unappealing from the start. I've always waited for it to get some steam, but that never happened. This movie is greatly overrated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare, with King James English, never talked to me anyway. The latter can be heard in the first half of the film, since Ronald Colman plays the role of Othello. <br /> <br /> Among the good points of the film, thanks to a restored print, are some decent cinematography and a young, slender and attractive Shelly Winters. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's just too boring, too many repetitions in some scenes to watch it again. Besides, we all know that most actors are nuts cases anyway, but kudos to Hollywood for showing it here in this story.
