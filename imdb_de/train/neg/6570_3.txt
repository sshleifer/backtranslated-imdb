I've never found Charley Chase very funny, even though his screen character sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, whom I find very funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of Gowky Hen Broon from the Scottish comic book "Sunday Post.") In Chase's best films, I tend to admire his professionalism rather than laugh at him. I credit Chase that his best films - like "Mighty Like a Moose" and "His Wooden Wedding" - have inspired a fandom faithful to him ... but I'm convinced even the most die-hard Chase Fans will think that the very early and very raw "Married to Order" is not funny at all. Chase - eager, awkward, gormless, naff - is a young Swain hoping to court the beautiful rose. Oliver Hardy shows the best performance in this movie as her bloody father who despises Chase as "Mollycoddle". Leo White, who made a notable work as a film for Chaplin in Essanay, is here as a rival present. <br /> <br /> There are some actions with an Ingersoll clock. I was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the conversation titles: is this an early example of product placement? <br /> <br /> A big mistake in "Married to Order" is unfortunately the casting of Rosemary Theby as Rose: It's supposed to be a standard edition, but Theby - with a flat upper body, hawk face - - is physically wrong for the role. Theby (the wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as a film actress, but was never credible ingenuity. The film historian William K. Everson has dealt with it in one of his film books very repellent with her. <br /> <br /> I'll score 'Married to Order' with 3 out of 10, and I'm benevolent ... because I always suspect that Charley Chase has something everyone else gets, but I always miss again.
