In the first 17 minutes of director Bradford May's "Darkman III: The Darkman Die" we were already undergoing a stupid recap and an accompanying voice-over from the second film and easily imitated to work like new footage in the first two films, and a long ad watch the scarred and tortured title character observes that Universal Theme Parks - Universal is the company that drove this movie out. Yes, "Darkman III: The Darkman Die" is the handful when it comes to making cheap deposits on the success of a previous film. <br /> <br /> This time around, the disfigured antihero Peyton Westlake (aka "Darkman" (played by "Mummy" actor Arnold Vosloo) beats the evil criminal and the lousy husband Peter Rooker (played in a brilliant over-the -Top performance by Jeff Fahey) The horns and over the 87 minute movie is growing to develop a liking for Rooker's wife and daughter, who again learn to look after another person. <br /> <br /> Blah Blah Blah. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically just a stupid way for the studio to make some more money with Sam Raimi's original movie, which I think is a great action-suspense movie. <br /> <Oh yes, and there are also a number of stupid negotiations, including a villainy who was supposed to be one of the original doctors to rescue Darkman after his scar rescue, and she seduced our hero into believing she was an ally before he reveals it A shameful one Plan to help rookers create more super human thugs like Darkman. Apparently she can not perform the same procedure with the thugs she did at Darkman. Why? I can not really explain it, because the movie does not do it. <br /> <br /> There is also a murder-sub-conspiracy involving a district attorney who wants to start organizing rookers and some other stupid things. <br /> <br /> But that's not really true. This movie feels like two or three episodes of a TV show cut more than an actual movie. The direction changes between pretty good and downright sloppy (a scene in which Darkman drives his train-like vehicle and dodges a rocket launcher is just stupid), and editing is a mixed bag. The movie just moves too fast to really worry about what's going on. And without spoiling it, the last 15 minutes of this movie and the whole series is just kinda ... I do not know ... another 15 minutes mixed-bag footage. <br /> <br /> Actual In terms of the cut, in this movie I like to comment on reused material from the previous films and then footage in that movie, which repeats itself several times. Yes, that is so cheap. It's one thing to re-cap at the beginning of the movie and maybe repeat one or two shots, but in the sheer amount they do it (minutes of material that was repeated from previous films), it's just sloppy and amateurish , <Br /> <br /> Also, I have to say that Darkman's psychedelic montage freaks are a little over the top in this movie. They are so stylized and exaggerated that they work, but only in light cans and in the right context, as Raimi did in the original film. There are at least four or five here, and they feel very abrupt and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is not without good points. Some action scenes are well done. The clich√© story of Darkman, who longs for a real life, is suitable for a DVD remote. Some of the acting is nice, especially by Rooker's wife, portrayed by the beautiful Roxann Dawson. Although composer Randy Miller is not Danny Elfman, he composes some beautiful music based on Elfman's original themes. <br /> <br /> But overall, the movie is too fast, cheap and stupid to be taken seriously. Arnold Vosloo seems to be boring and exuberant from scene to scene, and Fahey, while it's a pleasure to see him as an exaggerated villain, just does not quite fit into the series. <br /> <br /> Darkman II, "I would recommend fans of the original, who will surely get a laugh, otherwise you will not have to apply." A four out of ten.
