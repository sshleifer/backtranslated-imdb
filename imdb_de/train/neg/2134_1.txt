With this cast and budget you will expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack has made a series of films that border on the weird and yet work. Neither he, his sister, nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this travesty of bad, badly written garbage. The action goes nowhere, the writing is meaningless and the characters thin. If you imagine a film as three-dimensional, in which the story and the characters give the pictures a depth, this stinker looks as flat as the steamboat Mickey. Dan Akroyd's performance brought back memories of another really horrible movie, 1991 Nothing but trouble. Honestly, this movie is the kind of project that kills careers and dismisses agents.
