Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water ... <br /> <br /> Another computer produced mutant crocodile in search of human lunchmeat released by another facility that did crazy science has been. Gereco Biotech is researching growth hormone research and inadvertently releases a baby crocodile that evolves with increasing speed. <br /> <br /> B-movie actors give this run of the mill "genetic mistakes" a lot of fun monster movie. "Costas Mandylor is reminiscent of Mick Dundee, Australian accent, hat, fat ass-knife, working as a crocodile specialist, who from Gereco's executive attorney Joanna Pacula has been set free from innocent people.) Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose city is in danger, and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter who works at the shelter, and soap opera star Matthew Borlenghi is Longenecker's love interest. a local artist who welds sculptures (his brother is a victim of crocodile), and this skill will of course be very useful if our heroes trap the crocodile trap and hope to poison them with carbon monoxide. <br /> <br /> The crocodile layer itself is never the least convincing in its use of a looking for food reserve the special effects an inferior variety. For Roger Corman productions dealing with renegade Dino monsters, I stay with Carnosaur. The monster here is essentially a crocodile that stands on its hind legs and often stands upright as it pursues potential victims. I felt Mandylor and the filmmakers spoof Crocodile Dundee with his crocodile hunter, and that imitation could be amusing where the monster itself fails. Borlenghi and Longenecker actually have a pretty good chemistry on screen. As expected, Pacula gets her talent in a funny way (.. sip).
