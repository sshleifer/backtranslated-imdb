I have now written reviews for some of the episodes of MoH, and this is one of the worst. An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned at the time the credits roll. If you people look at things that you would never enjoy in real life ("Let's see the basement!"), Then this is your show. Unless it's not amusing or entertaining - it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> The extent of the virus is never shown. I can overlook the fact that it affects only men, because the resulting situation is very, very scary. Then things get worse as the daughter leaves the OBVIOUSLY Dunge in the household and eventually dies on his hands. The woman flees north and gets into some ten situations. Then some kind of spirit or extraterrestrial or something appears and saves them (things that make you go HUH?). Or so. Then she cuddles for warmth. The end. <br /> <br /> Terrible. These directors are sending this trip.
