This early B entry in the patriotic category has hit a fancy young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you'll have to wait awhile before you see them in a Hollywood camel train. Previously, we set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as boys who barely get along but need to gather in the face of an attack. I've seen Sanders as so many funny cadres that it was fun to see a rare good. Bruce Cabot's fascination, however, is a mystery to me - he is inconspicuous and inconspicuous in comparison, but I always had the feeling that he just showed up smiling under a car, full of fat and a sixth grade. Some people like it just like Gene's Gypsy Queen. This is an action-adventure filler, and just as we were warned against the invaders of locals who are ready to sabotage and attack the British in their country, there is one final shootout in which we lose a major character for the country have to be good of them all. This feature requires nothing more than your slightest attention on a Saturday afternoon. A programmer who does everything else that fits. It was almost more interesting to identify Dorothy Dandridge's great side cast and a surprising performance in one of her first roles. Two or two and a half stars of five-MDM
