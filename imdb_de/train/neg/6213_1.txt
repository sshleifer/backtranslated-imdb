This movie has made it one of my ten most horrible movies. Dreadful. <br /> <br /> There was no uninterrupted minute when there was no fight with one or the other monster. There was no chance for a character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except on the big, bad machine she wanted to destroy). <br /> <br /> Scenes were obviously stolen from other films, such as LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br />> The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the last scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br />> The spider machine was initially just like Frodo, who was attacked by the spider in the return of the kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both movies) and wait ...... it hypnotizes (pricks) his victim and grabs her ..... er huh ???? <br /> <br />> And the whole machine vs. People topic was the matrix..or terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are more examples, but why waste time? And will someone tell me what happened to the Nazis?!?! Nazis ???? <br /> <br /> There was a youthful story that was brought to a young age. The film could not decide whether it was a children's movie or an adult movie, and that was not much of it either. <br /> <br /> Just awful. A real disappointment, to say the least. Save your money.
