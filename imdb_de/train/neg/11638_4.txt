Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned is the third episode of the Gabriel Knight Games, a series of adventure games about mischievous writer / paranormal detective Gabriel Knight. Gabriel and his companion Grace were asked by Prince James of Albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so-called "night visitors". When the son of Prince James is kidnapped, Gabriel follows the nocturnal visitors to Rennes le Ch창teau, where he composes a riddle about the Holy Grail. Despite the marketing, this game is not about vampires. Vampires have a distinctive presence in the game, but they are never the center of attention, like the Voodoo Hounfor in Sins of the Father or the werewolves in The Beast Within. Gabriel and Grace make no attempt to uncover the true nature of vampires or to learn about vampires. Although the vampires murder three people in the course of the game, their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main story. <br /> <br /> Much of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knight installments was in the relationship Gabriel made with the villains. Through these relationships, the player could not help but sympathize with the villain, and so the villain became more of a human and less of a monster. However, in "Blood of the Sacred," Gabriel's only interaction with the villain leads through a single, kitschy interview that the villain dislikes. <br /> <br /> The roles Gabriel and Grace are playing In this mystery are pretty pointless. Gabriel spends his time snooping into the identities of members of a treasure hunter group that stays at his hotel, but what he discovers is nothing more than a red herring. Grace spends her time exploring the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau, but all her research is made redundant by the presence of an amazing ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries. <br /> <br /> The actions of this confusion of the ally and his polar opposite - the vampire leader - are unbearable. The ally leaves clues to the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau in broad daylight and expects Grace (and not the group's other treasure hunters) to find her. He could have revealed the whole mystery to Grace on Day 1, instead of endangering the abducted child for another 48 hours. And in the end, he just tells Grace the mystery in its entirety. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the vampire leader can not achieve the goals of centuries of planning because two days later he refuses to do anything about kidnapping the child. The only reason for his decision to postpone the action is that he wants to enjoy his victory. <br /> <br /> The game would have been much better if it were only for the Holy Grail. The abduction and vampires should be omitted and replaced by a race against the Vatican to discover the secret of Rennes le Ch창teau. Since Gabriel is more than once portrayed as reluctant to Catholic, this conflict would have offered many opportunities for character development. All in all, despite an improved user interface and interface, the game was a disappointing part of the series Return of Tim Curry as the voice of Gabriel Knight.
