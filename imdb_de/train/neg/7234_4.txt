In a word: agonizing. I was later advised to read some articles about the philosophical meanings of this film, but after surviving the endless 115 minutes of the film and slowly being crushed under its bloated symbolism and its lava-flowing oppression, it seemed better to have my reactions to report the film. Who finally goes to a movie with a syllabus in hand? And this strip was dark. From the beginning to the end of the movie, lead actor Claude Laydu wears the same tiring and annoying mask of agony as if he were virtually indistinguishable from the film's eternal, bleak voice. Filming one movie over the other could have worked better than subduing an audience to both, because they basically say the same thing: the priest of Ambricourt is a pitiful person. The story of a persecuted priest trying to help a troubled, wealthy family does not bother to make his characters interesting or compassionate from a distance, as the family is a bunch of unwelcome spinners and the priest himself acts as a curious plague , The last 30 minutes point to a breathtaking message about the mercy and suffering of one man equal to the other. With all the indulgent close-ups of a suffering Laydu and the indefinite subtext in Robert Bresson's script, all I felt was: it's over, let's have some ice cream. Interesting for fans of Bresson fanatic Paul Schrader, just to see how many character elements and attitudes Schrader carried in his own scripts and films, notably "Taxidriver," "Raging Bull," and "Light Sleeper."
