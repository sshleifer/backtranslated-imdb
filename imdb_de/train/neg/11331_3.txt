Despite all due disrespect for this "epic" by George Stevens Sr. "Misadventures and Misreadings" I can only wonder that the "legend" of James Dean could survive this excursion harvesting his own "Gigantismos". Rock and Liz were not that much better. Let's just say that the televised "Dallas" was the authentic "heir", even though later "Texans" like Lay and DELay, not to mention our presumptive "president" of this Yewbenighted States of Amurrika, are a monotony of treacherous ones global dimensions. I've never read Edna Ferber's original, but I'm sure it's better around the head and shoulders than what's on the screen. I think all of these well-paid actors "support" actors and celebrities, even though "Giant" is at least a small merit for me, no matter what the promo campaigns are.
