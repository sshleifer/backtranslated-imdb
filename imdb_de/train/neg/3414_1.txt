That's just terrible, really terrible garbage. Yes, we have beautiful naked women who dance and have sex. But while that can work in the mechanism of a porn movie? maybe even a hit as a pornographic film? This tries to mask itself as a "movie" with actual things, with real feelings and efforts. It's not It's an excuse to get some girls naked and have fun. I'm sure all of these women (and men) in this movie could have been decent in the 70s porn movie business. , , but not in the actual movie business. <br /> <br /> The acting was choppy, so bad, I mean really awful. The writing was even worse. I can not blame these actors. They had nothing to work for. The very broad structure or plot of the film could possibly be made good with good authors and competent actors. The very sprawling structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from a distance as a sniper. These shootings were motivated by men who did not respect their wives enough. If there are more writings - better writing, much better writing - and less unintentional sexual images, we could work with something to work with. <br /> <br /> This film should be filmed, made and marketed all the time; It would have earned more money. It's practically a hardcore porn movie, and it remains the only non-porn movie I've ever seen showing a male penis.
