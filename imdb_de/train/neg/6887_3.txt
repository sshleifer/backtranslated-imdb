Yet another "son who will not grow up" and only the other recent entries. Heder in another bad wig that Napoleon channeled for the third time? Anna Faris is forgotten as always; Jeff Daniels called at least one from another state; and Diane Keaton ... how is one typed so late in a career? Do not bother. Nothing is said here, which was not often discussed. I will say that; It's about a hundred times better than "Failure To Launch." There are very few amusing parts in the movie, unless Eli Wallach scolds funny. Haha! He is old and dropped the bomb! Tea, hee, hee. Pathetic!
