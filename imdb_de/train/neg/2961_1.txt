I was babysitting a family of three small children for one night, and her mother gave it to me to show her after she bought it at Wal-Mart just a week ago. All three children actually became physically ill when they saw it. I'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate, or something that they all picked up from school, but in fact it could have been this movie. Absolutely disgusting. How anyone can produce garbage in this caliber is a mystery to me. Fortunately, I turned off the movie when I noticed that the children were unresponsive and strangely responding. For parents out there, I strongly recommend that no children watch this movie.
