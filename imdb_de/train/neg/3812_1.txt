Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Because all the characters are so irritating that it is impossible to endure. The best character is Joey, and even he is occasionally pretty irritating. A DJ girl who wrote his character? I want to kill myself every time she speaks to mention when Danny starts his philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: DJ won ten thousand dollars or more at the casino. However, she is not eighteen, so she should not play by the law. Anyway, the casino was willing to pay her, but then Danny, her father, took her and does not let her raise the money because she's not eighteen. Oh, come on, give me a break, will you? Since I have the stupid and childish seen I immediately turned off the TV. Some say that not even a child would buy anything in this series. Who in the world might think Full House is entertaining and funny? Every single word they say in this series seems to be Shakespeare except that Shakespere could write and only that he would not be so childish and stupid as to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for the Full House! <br /> <br /> For those who have a bad heart or poor health or who have a will for life or a sense of the real world, I strongly recommend: "Watch the Full House" not! Episode as an attempt. Avoid this series. Save yourself from stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst TV show I have ever seen. I'd rather see Teletubbies, then this one.
