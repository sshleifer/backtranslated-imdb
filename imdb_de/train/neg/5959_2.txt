A spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words guarantee a horrible movie? Cheap Canadian production. THE BRAIN fits in perfectly with these words. Terrible script, idiotic drama and funny special effects make this a must for every BAD movie fan. The horror is hilarious. The post production team looks like it gave up. What makes The BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be good! Can save a bit of ingenuity and consequence, which is a joke? <br /> <br /> It's Christmas. Mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest villains of all time. The next day, a rebellious teenager gets into trouble, so he is sent to a psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> When a cop's head is cut off and a stranger with blood and a bloody ax tells you Some children have done it, who would you believe? What starts as funny becomes boring and tiring in the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child can not be alarmed by the terrifying moments. THE BRAIN is too weird a concept to try to be tough. The Psychological Research Institute is bigger than big production sites! Our ugly villain and cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting I have ever seen. The discretion of the viewer was strongly recommended.
