Insane Shotgun incest revenge seeking revenge and looking for truck drivers. "Dad raped me when I was handcuffed 12". All latex-wearing prostitutes are just some of the characters you'll get to know in this complete shame of a movie. This can be viewed on Sunday evenings at 4am on any cable TV channel (IE: Skinemax). (And yes, I know, that was a whole sentence, but naked people, this is a lengthy review for a short, pointless movie). <br /> <br /> Filmed in "anywhere" in Canada, with almost no budget, the conspiracy to this crazy show is banal, the police obviously never heard of "state jurisdiction" because they ended up being both Miya (Hookers ) as well as Trent (idiotic, anal retentive, generic, unsure student) chasing the US (and I thought only the FBI could do that). The camera is shaky, the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad that it can possibly lead to unintentional acid flashbacks on films like "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> As far as the skin scenes are concerned (which is the only reason to rent this movie, do not think about buying it), there are two of them. The first is the only one worth to be seen. This is the domina sex scene with Kari Salin and ____ (inserting an unknown actor here, obviously he has done nothing else), dripping in a dodgy, disgusting motel room (the guy with the broken sink), and the vending machine outside has only blue tonic water). It's all S & M people (riding, handcuffs, hot wax and underwear licking) and in the end he's left in a motel room with no money and no policemen waiting at his door Let a whore do it in a motel room in nowhere ". Unfortunately, Kari does not show any skin worth recalling, and that alone can cause profound traumatic experiences in some gentlemen, so this is definitely a downer to this strip. <br /> <br /> As for the end, * Snicker * Giggle * I know you probably would not mind if I revealed it to you, but I will not, you should spend your hard earned money on it. All in all, I give him a 1/5 for Action, a 3/5 for Skin (see last paragraph), and a 0/0 for acting, character development, or complicated plot changes. <br /> <br /> - Laughing Man
