I stayed one night and was extremely bored at 2 in the morning. So I flipped through the channels aimlessly and came across H.B.O. where this "classic" played. At first I was glad that I had caught something in the beginning, but my luck faded after about two minutes in the movie. The whole movie revolved around an unattractive man who was afraid of women, four pretty but carefree women working as waitresses in his uncle's restaurant, and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin, who also works in the restaurant. There are some weird twists in this movie that make it a little more interesting, but definitely worth a look. Basically, if you have nothing to do or just can not sleep, the medication works much better. However, there is a lot of skin for guys, so it may be okay to watch without sound, but even that can be annoying
