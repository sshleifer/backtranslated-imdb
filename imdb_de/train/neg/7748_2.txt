This movie was pretty bad. Sci-Fi is usually my favorite channel, so I watch all the original movies that are played on it. I really do not know if this film can be called original. Starting the zoo / theme park on a remote island is pretty familiar. What was it, oh yes, Jurassic Park. However, this has Sabertooth Tiger instead. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt. One of them suffers a pretty cruel death with some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. The blood looked very much like ketchup. At the beginning is also a scientist who wants to produce as many saber tooth tigers for the people. Three of them have already fled and eat the tourists or people invited to the island to see the tigers first-hand. Again it sounds like Jurassic Park. The coolest thing was probably the 1000-pound saber tooth crawling on its forelegs, killing the mad scientist with a sort of tooth scene that somehow shrinks and goes through the man's neck. Funniest death I've seen on TV. <br /> <br /> The acting is extremely cheesy, the special effects are terrible. The CG tigers could almost go over for clay models, and even some of the sounds were off. For example, when one of the college students tries to escape, he uses an ax to break open a door, the ax enters the door, and about 2 seconds later, the sound is heard. This movie was pretty bad. The cheesy deaths were pretty funny though.
