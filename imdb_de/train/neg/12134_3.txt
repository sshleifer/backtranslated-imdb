At first glance, this should be a great movie, a great cast, a storyline full of possibilities and for the first time one of Hollywood's most beautiful behind the camera. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear why eight years ago, spacey decided to make another film. This movie fails on so many levels. In a movie that is not busy and most scenes are filmed in different locations, it is imperative that the director provides suspense and continuity. Not so here, the great cast is used terribly little, as is the great late late John Spencer. The plot is from the mill and nothing you have not seen in a hundred other television movies. There is so little character development that you are not interested in any of the protagonists. At least we know that spacey in the Hollywood studios has a lot of buddies and clout to get away with such a bad movie
