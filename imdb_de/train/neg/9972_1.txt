PROBLEM CHILD is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a wild boy adopted by two parents, but he gets into trouble later. This junior can drive grandpa's car. He can scare people with a bear. He can set a room on fire! It's just as bad a movie as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. A sequel is an even worse fate. Rent CHICKEN RUN instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out **** I give it.
