JESSICA: A GHOST STORY is how the name implies a ghost story. The theme is supposed to be horror, but comes closer to the comedy! <br /> <br /> A woman who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead. This is what this movie wants to do as an action. There is really nothing left. The film is a series of loosely connected scenes in which a man had an affair with this woman before her death. Immediately after the opening scenes, this film looks like a "direct hit" DVD "effort." Unlike gemstones like VACANCY 2, the film has no sense of direction or creativity, and certainly gives "direct DVD movies" a bad name! bad as it is, lacking tension, anxiety or tension, even the drama elements are handled hopelessly and are a bit more boring than the worst soap opera you've ever experienced. <br /> <br /> The acting up The whole line is utterly miserable, without a single actor manages to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career. <br /> <br /> Many of the individual scenes are unbelievably long, with very long breaks between the dialogue, I'm not exaggerating ! <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this movie a rating of 2 instead of 1 is that some of the bad acting combined with one even worse dialogue were made for a few unwanted laughs. I emphasize the word "few" in this sentence. This is not one of the "so bad-its-good" movies like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, have a look at these films. If you want to see a real horror movie about ghosts, check out THE LEGEND OF BRIGHT HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE EYE (Korean original version), THE GRUDGE, ONE MISSED CALL or PHONE. <br /> <br /> I advise you Anyone who was lucky not to see JESSICA: A SPIRIT HISTORY to continue the good work! Just forget that this movie exists. Do not give a thought to it!
