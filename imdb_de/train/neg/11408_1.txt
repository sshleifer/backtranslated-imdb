That was just terrible. I read this book for school, I did ace on all the tests and I saw it that way! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to look at it, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Hudson Hawk together. What made this movie so terrible was enough reason to kill itself. First it was done on Hallmark. Second, the spectacle was terrible. Third, it was very different from the book. It was literally so bad that I apologized. Basically, I would prefer Basic Instinct 2 to this. Take my advice, do not watch this movie. Nobody would want to see that. It was terrible. DREADFUL!
