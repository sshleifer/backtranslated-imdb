I was looking for a cute, simple comedy to pass the time, but choosing this movie turned out to be a huge mistake. First, the script is stupid and not funny at all, relying on tired, recycled jokes and a farting turtle. It's not funny in my book, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Low budget effects (if I can even call them effects) with terrible camera. In many places, it almost feels like an indie film being filmed without money. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I'm sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards so desperate that they have agreed to attend? (If you look at the current filmography, it would look like that.) Despite the outfits, Pamela shows her age and overall they do not even look sexy, let alone funny. <br /> <br /> Film is not even in the bad-this-fun-funny category. It's just awful, as if all parties were tired of it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
