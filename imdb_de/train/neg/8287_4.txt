This is a TV version of the story, the movie starts like a series of 'Xena ...', with little meaningful dialogues or character descriptions. After a while it gets a bit more substantial, but all the characters are still cartoonish. <br /> <br /> Salma is the exotic beauty. Richard Harris is a wicked and sexually oppressed frollo who goes crazy in Salma. The other characters, including Quasimodo, are pretty much forgotten. <br /> <br /> It is also a kind of liberal version of the story, Frollo is an oppressor of the ideals of the Enlightenment, as the abbot in 'Name of the Rose', and Quasimodo is an advocate of freedom. The shadow side of the quas character is ignored, even though it distributes the fluid to humans. He's really just an outsider because he looks different and plays more with bells than the average person. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie is for kids, but I doubt it, considering Frollo is getting bloody to beat his monkey. A mostly uninteresting and unforgettable, but not terrible and sometimes entertaining rendition of the story.
