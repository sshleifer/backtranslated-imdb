Really, really bad. How is such a bad movie done? I was always waiting for a redeeming plot point, interesting camera work or at least an unfounded nudity, but I got nothing. I had just seen Cabin Fever and thought it would be a train wreck (apart from the nudity and the pancakes), but it looks compared to this crap out and ingenious. The best script doctor in the world could not have saved this lazy bunch of stinking Poo. <br /> <br /> The only thing that speaks for this "movie" is that it ended. <br /> <br /> I have a headache when I just think about this movie and try to write something. Pooh! I'm glad I only paid $ 5 and will soon end up in a landfill.
