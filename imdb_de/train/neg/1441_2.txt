I chose this movie alone on the cover and thought that I would experience an adventure on the level of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Death". Unfortunately, I had a virtual yawn. Not like every yawn I had before. This yawn was so great that I could hardly find anything of quality in this movie. The cover described amazing special effects. There was none. The movie was so light that even the stereotypes were horribly portrayed. There is the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach this to your children. Not me. Keep away from this. If you're looking for family entertainment, you might find something inspiring elsewhere.
