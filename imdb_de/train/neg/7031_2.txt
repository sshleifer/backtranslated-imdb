What prompted me to find this movie was watching Vampyres. I thought I had to get the other movies this guy (Larroz) made. I'm sorry that I tracked this down with sex and only sex (with ugly actors and actresses this is an excuse for the mess.) The only redeeming factor was the environment and atmosphere, avoid them, too much hype surrounding it, It's not worth it to find it Welcome to the Grind House Edition, I hope it has a few other movies that follow Vampyres, and the goat scene was very boring, I understand that this is the hype.
