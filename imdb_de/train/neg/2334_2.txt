This had high intellectual demands. The lead role is intended to give a "deep" "meaningful" rendition (with voice over for his mental states, of course), and he was certainly influenced by the "fifties / sixties" method, in which the script was written and has the direction Worthwhile, has delivered amazing results (see Clift, Newman, Winters). But here the story is miserable. In addition to moving too slowly, you can work at least 20 minutes - including pointless flashbacks - and the plot line would not be. Sometimes it is very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his "uncle" character and often borders on his portrayal of parody , An interesting page is just flown over: the relationship young boy / hero - if we admit that the hero himself is a child - If he says to the young child, he would not be harmed by anyone, creates a welcome tenderness.

Here my hitchcockometer shows grumpily towards zero.
