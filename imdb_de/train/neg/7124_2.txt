A man brings his new wife to his home, where his former wife died of an "accident". His new wife has just been released from an asylum and is also VERY wealthy! Suddenly she hears sounds and sees skulls everywhere. Will she go crazy again or will the first woman come back from the dead? <br /> <br /> You probably guessed the end, so I will not spell it out. I often saw this as a child on Saturday afternoon. I liked it then, but I was young. When I see it now, I realize how bad it is. It's terribly played, badly written, very boring (even for an hour) and has a huge cast of FIVE people (one is the director)! Nevertheless, it does have some good things. <br /> <br /> The music is a bit scary and the surroundings, even with the huge empty house and the nearby pond, are very atmospheric. There are also some scary moments (I jumped a bit when she saw the first skull) and a somewhat effective ending. All in all, it's definitely not a good movie ... but it's not a total catastrophe. It has a small cult following. I give it a second. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid the Elite DVD Drive-In Edition. It's in terrible shape with cracks and scratches. It did not look so bad on TV!
