I've seen this movie twice recently, and I can not understand why the creators made that bunch of crap. I mean, yes, there is a great impression of Hitler's environment, and I mean how they reproduced Austria in the late 1890s, the First World War and the inter-war period. What I can not understand is why they introduced Hitler as a 100% evil, crazy, unreliable, mentally unstable freak. After all, he was a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man, of course, had his dark side, there is no doubt about it. But why in the name of heaven do you think so? All of his positive aspects were taken out of the scenario and left nothing but a very propagandistic portrait of a man who had the greatest impact on modern civilization. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating World War II. Yes, he was a racist and yes, especially at the end of the war, he was sometimes very unstable. Everything is true. But again; Why the hell did they LOVE the public? To warn us? <br /> <br /> I absolutely do not think this movie was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was the fact that they came to power in times of severe global weakness. The fact that this evil was so recognizable and yet embraced by almost all Germans (not to mention Austrians and many other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization, NOT the fact that Hitler is such a "nut "was. If it had been as if the makers were making me believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were lagging behind. A man like the one in this film would never have come near a party leader - not to mention the Reich Chancellor. <br /> <br /> 4/10
