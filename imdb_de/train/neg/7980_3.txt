This service comedy, for which Peter Marshall (the brother of Joanne Dru and later multi-year host of The Hollywood Squares) and Tommy Noonan were hyped as "the new Lewis and Martin", is just terribly shy. Fast and nothing works quite right - there is one Scene in which Noonan throws officers and politicians in rage with grenades; They are about five feet apart, Noonan throws them in between, and the total reaction is for everyone to flinch. <br /> <br /> In the midst of a horror that is only being replaced by the returning Julie Newmar, there are a few moments of brilliance: Marshall and Noonan occasionally have double conversations and quarrels, and their timing is almost perfect - clearly they were one pronounced comedy pair. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this turkey is not enough to save.
