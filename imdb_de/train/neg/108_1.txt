Pros: Nothing <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: All <br /> <br /> Summary of storyline: A reporter meets a hitchhiker telling her stories about the deaths of people killed by zombies. <Br/> <br /> Review: Never in my life have I come across a movie as bad as the zombie chronicles. TZC is a horrible horror film based on lame, forgetful actors who could not save their lives and that is more than scary. How is such a movie made? Simply put, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. <br /> <br /> My last two cents: Humorous enough, this film was made by a film company called Brain Damage Films. They are the brains that have really been damaged to make such a movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (If it was up to me, this movie would get the grade negative.) Bajillion)
