I saw this movie over the weekend, and while I was always impressed by the beauty and splendor of the films produced in the church, I was disappointed that this film was so short that I did not inform the members and the investigators with many left unanswered questions. > <br /> The film contains 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of Joseph Smith. It is not a real biopic because there is no really coherent narrative. Most episodes involve Joseph's good deeds, playing baseball, running races and laughing with children, often in slow motion. What a great, just guy who was Joseph, right? Look at him as he beats carpets for his wife Emma. Well, how should the rugs of his 33 plural women look like? There is no mention of polygamy. A blatant omission. <br /> <br /> And in such failures, the films are shaken. It provides too little information and leaves a critical audience wondering. WHY is Joseph tarred and feathered, WHY is he thrown in jail and why does the mob want to kill him? The highlight of the film, of course, is the migration of Joseph and Hyrum to Carthage Prison (past true United Nations of Faces looking out of Nauvoo's doors). But why is never mentioned? Not that Smith suppressed the Nauvoo Expositor newspaper and got his press to reveal the secret doctrine of polygamy. The audience must be surprised or assume that it is only a more groundless persecution of the church. It is not mentioned that Joseph was charged with treason for declaring martial law and the Nauvoo militia. <br /> <br /> Of course, I did not expect this church-produced film to feature Rough Stone's recent biography of Joseph of Richard Bushman Roles, but I was surprised and surprised at how little substance was actually presented. <br/> <br /> And what's worse, which substance was often inaccurate. Two examples jumped to me. First the translation of the Book of Mormon. The film shows Joseph reading directly from the golden plates in her two-ring folder, which were actually hidden far out of the place. It is well known that Joseph did his translation by burying his face in his hat and looking at the seer stone there. The second inaccuracy occurs in Carthage Prison, where the mob storms the cell. Church history reports that Joseph had a six-shooter and even fired a few rounds before leaping out the window and giving the Masonic signal of suffering (as reported in Times & Seasons). Possibly showing the reality of the shootout would have shattered the heartbreaking mood the filmmakers had created, but by being omitted, they were not faithful to the story and could not show Joseph the way he really was: practically with a weapon and able to defend themselves. In fact, the film has the impression that Joseph was a nice guy, but also something like a Mispoast, all beaten up, thrown in jail, and finally murdered in cold blood. He was far from it; Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who had a great deal of trouble and effort in achieving what he believed in. <br /> <br /> Look at the movie, but you know, it's cotton candy. Then get meat and potatoes by reading a copy of Bushman's biography of Smith, Rough Stone Rolling. <br /> <br /> PS: Films produced in the church do not have credits, but experienced eyes can recognize some familiar faces. Rick Macy is excellent, as Joseph Smith, Sr., and Bruce Newbold, loved as Thomas in Finding Faith in Christ, play the cranky Methodist preacher who has shown no Christian love to a young seeker of truth.
