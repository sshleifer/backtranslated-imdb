One of the most disgusting movies I have ever seen. I wanted to throw up after seeing it. I saw this film in my American history lesson, and the purpose was to see a fuss about a farmer's life in the late 19th century. What we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered, the birth of humans, branding. Oh, and in the end there was a living birth of a calf. Let me tell you that the birth itself was not that bad, but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the toilet. The story itself was fine. The premise of the story is a widow and her daughter, and they move to the West to be stewards of this cowboy. They live a life of misery and it's an interesting view of life in the West during the late 19th century. If you have the choice, you will not see this movie.
