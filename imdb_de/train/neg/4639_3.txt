Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. The premise was really good, but the whole execution was just awful. I wish the filmmakers had taken time for this project rather than throwing it into production. A blind guy gets new eyes, the bad thing is that he belongs to a bad old werewolf. Bad things happen to the guy as he turns into a cheesy-looking being. Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out about it? Who is this weird little troll helping him, and what's up with that policewoman? If you really want to find out, look at Eyes of the Werewolf! <br /> <br /> Not a bad idea for a movie. I just wish the filmmakers spent a lot of time in pre-production before they decided to shoot the film.
