My spouse and I found this movie very fluffy. It started well but quickly became unbelievable and ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor, except for the little girl Abbie, who was really great. In addition, the dialogue was predictable and lame - especially Gideon, the angel. Without betraying, when one of the characters has a tragedy, it seems almost nonchalant. At first we thought it was "shock", but then we realized that it was just a terrible screenplay. We love almost all Hallmark movies and their heartwarming stories, but this film does not give reason to be one. There are so many great - do not waste time with this horrible movie.
