I came to this film with high expectations. I was aware of Greenaway's work and 'The Tempest' and was interested in an adaptation. I did not want to turn off after ten minutes, but I felt it would be unfair. There was a portrayal of a storm, but where do you remember a little boy peeing over a toy boat? It is symbolic of what? I continued for another ten minutes, my finger twitching over the off button, something would catch my interest somewhere. This is not Shakespeare, it is not a cinema. There is a time and a place for it, but I will not waste my time and there is no room for it in my Shakespeare studies. After twenty-five minutes I gave up and that was the end. I then read all the comments on this site and the presumption of the film is only surpassed by the defendants. "It's a painting ... and then placed in a gallery", "it's a ballet ... then hold it on stage". Shakespeare can be made intelligent, and the pieces were performed in front of mass audiences, they were accessible, and this version helps to create a wedge between Shakespeare and the general public.
