There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to any of the stars or producers: Actress Nichole Hiltz. She is the show in this slow-moving and highly unlikely story of revenge. Under the direction of Simon Gornick, Joyce Hyser plays a betrayed wife who chooses to seek revenge on her betrayed spouse. Oh, but not by conventional means. She plans a total guerilla war and recruits the evil girl Nichole Hiltz as her preferred weapon. She wants Nichole (like Tuesday) to approach her ex (the handsome but boring Stephan Jenkins, who should follow the music) to embarrass him and ruin his life. David DeLuise is good in his few short moments and former "Crime Story" star Anthony Dennison has next to nothing to do but just scowl. Hiltz, on the other hand, looks sexy and playful at different times, then evil and deceitful. She is also vulnerable and "maybe a bit psychotic" good. It's also pretty hot (though there are no naughty bitshows) so you can understand how it can get to any guy it targets. But the performance is pretty much wasted in this movie, which is just not nervous or interesting enough to recommend.
