I do not know about you, but I have always been attracted to 'ART' cinema. The first "art" film I could win was Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Beloved," which blew my mind and my creative spirit. The movie was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque. This was what the 'Art Cinema' was about, it was about exploring intellectual ideas and deliberately bringing the visceral to the screen. Life, real life, can be like a madhouse, and the art expressed shows what it is. I love movies of all kinds, but most of all those who both entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with their attitude or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMEN" is a dry film. clinical "comedy" in which a father and a son collect a harem to fulfill their many sexual fantasies. There is only a very brief allusion to Fellini in the film, in contrast to the proposals. The main focus of the film is on the "close" relationship between father and son, which was brought together after the death of the mothers. In the early scenes of the film, the grief of the fathers is credible, you can feel his pain. What happens after that is clear from Greenaway's standards, collecting the harem, observations of love and death and flesh for the sake of the flesh ... You could argue that, but I think the film is flat and meaningless. And the idea that this might be a comedy is confusing to me. Acting, albeit well, is ... Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (although poor Mandy should dress again). What the film lacks is a compelling story and the usual greenaway accents that make it so wonderful to watch other films. <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 Women" is filled with moments of insight and occasional taboo, but it's too short to be considered art, too bland to be considered "funny" and just too boring worth it. <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this movie as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
