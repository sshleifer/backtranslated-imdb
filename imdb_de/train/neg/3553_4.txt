"The Incubus" is a mix of the good (an interesting murder mystery), evil (a separate script, a sloppy resolution, poorly made attack scenes) and the comic (strong incestuous overtones, a strangely tired and stiff performance by John Cassavetes ) - Was that character really as "wacko"?). Not nearly as offensive as it supposed to be, but not particularly successful. (* 1/2)
