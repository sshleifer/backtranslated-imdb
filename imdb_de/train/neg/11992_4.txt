I had never read Gary Paulsen's novel Hatchet, for which "A Scream in the Wild" is the adaptation of, so I can not compare it to the book. However, I would like to say that this film, as a standalone film, without adaptation or adaptation, is an underdeveloped adventure that does not provide much explanation for its few characters. Think of 'A Cry in the Wild' "As a less luxurious, youthful mountaineer (was Quincy, California the only place that was filmed?) Version of" Cast Away. "Jared Rushton is 13-year-old Brian Roebson, one Child who visits his father with a small plane until the vehicle crashes over an abandoned mountain country, the child remains stranded and has to defend himself for a while. <Br /> <br /> The movie basically consists of three parts: the obvious is the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters, namely Brian and his mother. <br /> <br /> The next third of the movie (which really consumes almost the entire movie) is Brian's, which makes him "gross." This one Scenes do not contain any particularly amazing action, nothing out of the ordinary except for many beautiful cinematographs of a beautiful Yukon landscape, nothing that could make you nervous, no real encounters (except a lively confrontation with a boy) and no major dilemmas to initiate some kind of fun or connection with the character on the screen. You may even feel bored for a moment when Brian witnesses how he manages to survive first by using primitive means and then with improved means (tools, etc.). It's more like the ordinary time that passes when you're actually in the situation, and that's about it. In other words, they do not add flesh to Paulsen's words when translated into a visual medium. <br /> <br /> And the third part of the movie is of course his salvation. <br /> <br /> However, there is a negotiation that seeks to constantly strive during this time. A conflict between Brian and his parents that created a rocky, embarrassing relationship between them. However, it is mostly explained in short, intermittent, minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a background story for a music video. Every minute, the singer of Jefferson Starship, was to sing "Sara". Aside from what the viewer can pull out of the implications, or because of his own need to fill in the gaps in the narrative, we get a very underdeveloped backstory that was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and a connection characters, whether it really had something to do with Brian's survival adventure in the third part of the movie or not. These are the mistakes in the narrative, which stuns the viewer as he tries to figure out what the hell the people are doing on the screen, and almost gotten close to yelling at the TV and saying something. Tell me more! <br /> <br /> It certainly was not a good adventure story for me. But for fans of Jared Rushton, it was one of the last films he shot. So pay attention to nostalgia, if not otherwise.
