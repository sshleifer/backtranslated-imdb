The only way to enjoy this movie is to hit your head against the wall, allow internal brain bleeding, kill a bunch of your brain cells, and once you're officially mentally retarded, you might enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> The only salvation was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of taxi driver and also the Briton. If they had done the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they would finally fall in love, the movie would have been much more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The only reason I rated him 3 is that of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were unnecessarily wasted. Besides, the reunion at Heathrow was just too much to digest. An international traveler in the post-September 11 world, Anil Kapoor would have been shot to death before he reached the Skybridge to prove his true love. But the film's purpose was to defy logic, gravity, and physics, and throw an egg at the face of the * GENERAL * audience. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. At least I know that I had scars for life :(
