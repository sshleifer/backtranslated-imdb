May I say in the beginning that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work very much. I wish he was in more movies showing his talent. Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I almost blame everything on the poor script. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley had an outstanding performance in American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did well, and Eliza Dushku is currently the It Girl in Hollywood. I do not think any of the actors really got into the script, and I understand why. To say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an exaggeration. It had the twists and turns you'd expect, but they just did not go anywhere ... except for more confusion. I found the ending to be very anti-climatic, simply because it made no sense or really seemed to answer the questions I had about the plot. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie a good rating, but I can not. To be honest, the only thing I find scary is that you paid for it.
