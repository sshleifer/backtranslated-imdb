Once again, a movie classic with predictable catastrophic results was uselessly restored. The title is wrong as everything about this movie. The period is not convincing and the tracks seem far too young and too weak to even be criminals. Arthur Penn's film had style, humor and perspective and was made by talented people. Although the 1967 version does not exist, it would still be an unnecessary movie. The 1967 version deviated from the facts and presented a glamorous version of Bonnie and Clyde, which was exciting and innovative for 1967. This 1992 remake seems to have been removed from the original film and not the truth, as you know it. In any case, skip this and hope the 2010 version gets better. Could it possibly be worse?
