Oh my god ... the worst I've ever seen - that's the main idea that came to mind right after watching the movie. And I really do not understand anyone with the opposite myth. Maybe the idea was good, but the effect is miserable. I especially like the role of H. Graham. What was that??? In my opinion, it has destroyed all the positive intentions of the producers. The character was played in an affected and annoying way. Each time it appears, it reminds you to watch a movie, destroying the spirit of the moment. Then the whole movie, because mostly what you can see there are their stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion. TERRIBLE, do not waste time.
