Evil Aliens owes Peter Jackson's early films Bad Taste and Braindead big debts. I have to admit that he can never really enjoy these films, and I say the same thing about them. Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration and prefers to steal those he looks up to. I have not counted how many times an important Hollywood movie was cited, especially James Cameron's Aliens. The amount of blood and blood shown here is also not funny, the last end of the movie gets tired and dragged. Maybe it would have worked better as a short film. The actors are poor, the direction is weak and the plot does not exist. I can see what the director was trying to do, the tribute he wanted to pay, but others have done the same way much better than pictured here. 4.10
