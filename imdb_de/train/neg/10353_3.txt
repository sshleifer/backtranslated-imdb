I have never read the book "A Fold in Time". To be completely honest, I really want to, after watching the movie? Well, I should not repeat this movie, I'll start with it. Next, I'll say that the TV movie is pretty much forgotten. Do you know why I say that? Because I forgot what happened in it. I told you it was forgotten. To be honest, no TV movie will be better than "Merlin". <br /> <br /> How do I describe a TV movie? I have never written a review for a person. Well, I'm just saying that they usually have some celebrities. A temporal wrinkling covers only one. Alfre Woodard (or Woodward, I'm not sure), the Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The film has cheesy special effects, a mildly interesting action, scenes that bring you to the "WTF". The movie is unbelievably bad and brings you to the "WTF". What did I expect? It is a TV movie. They are usually not good. How is this one here? Wrinkling in time is a waste of time and a great waste of time. To top it off, you'll most likely forget it the second it's over. Well, maybe it's not the second time over. But within a few minutes. <br /> <br /> A fold in time: * / ****
