Are you kidding me?! A show highlighting someone opening cans and envelopes for a meal? How talented do you have to be for this? She can cook, but it is NOT portrayed in this half-hour, painful production. I know she has a Martha Stewart empire. Warren Buffett, too, but I do not see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and alpo. She has a nephew named ... Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking about someone who is stupid. <br /> <br /> More time spent on "table landscapes" than on the actual cooking. Who has that kind of time ?! Silicone should be on your spatula, not on my TV. This show should be on Cartoon Network, NOT Food Network.
