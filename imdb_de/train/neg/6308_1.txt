Full score for the content of this movie. As a Briton I did not know that there was a segregation in the US Navy during World War II. A very courageous attempt to bring this fact into the world. The film is pathetic, however, the director is absent, the acting is wooden and the script is just one clich√© after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I sat and writhed from beginning to end in the very bad way this was put together. This could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside the US was new, unique and interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way it was put together. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, was lost in a movie with a bad budget and a bad director. I just hope that one of the big studios will accept this topic sometime in the future.
