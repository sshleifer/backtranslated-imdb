The problem with the book "Memoirs of a Geisha" is that it had Japanese surfaces, but below the surfaces it was all the mindset of an American. Reading the book is like a great ballet with great music, set designs and costumes still performed by animal costumes dressed in these costumes. So far from the Japanese mindset, the characters were not Japan or real geisha. It's a story about a few misconceptions of American men about Japan and Geisha, filtered through their own ignorance and misunderstandings. So, what's this movie about, if it's not about Japan or Geisha? Is it pure fantasy, as so many people have said? Yes, but why should it become an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture in which there is no puritanical hang-up, no sin in terms of sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex treated in this movie? Law. As if it was dirty. What comes closest to a sex scene in the movie is that Sayuri pulls up his nose for five seconds and warps in despair, as if the man trying to climb her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have sex in this movie? Nope. A character is considered promiscuous, but all we see is that she pushes her lover off because it looks like she does not want to get caught doing something dirty. Such a typical American Puritanism has no place in a movie about Japanese geisha. <br /> <br /> Did Sayuri enjoy it when she was first enchanted by an old Codger after the auction of her cherry? Nope. She lies there like a cold meat plate on a chopping block. Of course she should not enjoy it. And that's what I mean with this movie. Why could not you give her something good? Why does all sex have to be sinful and wrong? <br /> <br /> Behind Mameha was the chairman Sayuri's secret patron and as such stood behind the auction of her virginity. He could have manipulated the auction and won it himself. Nobu did not even bid. Why, then, was the chairman victorious over the old chap, stinking of his naked bodies after an old stench? Would a woman ever really forgive a man for it? <br /> <br /> Let us try to understand this. By being behind Mameha, the chairman became debt to Sayuri's geisha training. To repay his debts, Chairman Sayuri sent Dr. Sell ​​crab. Through Mameha, the chairman sold Sayuri's sexual favors to that old geezer so the chairman could make some money from her. The chairman was not her patron. He was her pimp! A romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is beautiful, but it's like the beauty of a very attractive, seductive transvestite whose voice, looks and touch are exciting. But beneath this very feminine surface lies a sinister mystery. Beneath the film's seemingly false Japanese surface lurks the ominous mystery that the heart, soul, mind, and core of this movie are all American and masculine. Not the best when trying to be other than lying, distortion and terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style? Sophisticated, elegant simplicity. MoAg style? Peking Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Hair swept up. MOAG Geisha? Lots of hair, all of which must have burned together in the thick paste of white make-up. <br /> <br /> Japanese shaving ice cream - Japanese are pretty strict in terms of seasonal influences. Shaved ice is a summer party. MOAG shaved ice - The chairman buys Chiyo, the young Sayuri, played by Suzuka Ohgo, a treat during the cherry blossom season. The thought made my whole body tremble with cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Trained and skilled animators. MoAg Geisha sluts. <br /> <br /> Japanese Wind Chime - Used in summer because of the breeze that makes the Japanese feel a little cooler. MOAG wind chime - a doorbell! If one person stood in front of someone else's house and heard noises with a wind chime, she would be considered a madman, not an entrance gate. <br /> <br /> Japan? Emphasis on human relationships, group-oriented. MOAG ?? "I want a life that belongs to me" American individualism. <br /> <br /> Traditional Japanese dance? Elegant elegance. An almost geometric and mechanical precision. MOAG dance? Martha Graham freaks out on LSD while wearing a not very promising white Japanese shroud. Run by a geisha along a ramp that looks like a strip club? Hahaha! Is there a strip club where they did most of the research on Geisha? <br /> <br /> Domestic fire in Japan? It is worse than murder to let a fire break out, or even to let it out, because it is such a great danger to the community. In these wooden villages, cities and towns, fires can happen that destroy hundreds or thousands of houses and kill as many people. MOAG Houseburn - A great addition to a combat scene, but there are no effects, and because the runaway fire is no longer needed, it miraculously triggers. Technically, the film ended here because Sayuri had at least been ostracized and joined her sister, who had never heard again. There, both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be banished. <br /> <br /> Enough. The movie stinks.
