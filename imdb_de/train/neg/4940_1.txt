This show proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of precious DVR disk space. I did not expect much and actually got less. Not only do I expect this show to be canceled in the second episode, I also can not believe Geico will ever try to reuse the Cavemen EVER ad campaign. I would have preferred to spend a night examining my daughter's hair for head lice rather than looking at this piece of rubbish. I wonder what ABC passed on to include this show in the fall of 2007, maybe a reality show from the Hospital / Crime / Mocumentary section with the AFLAC Duck? In the event that I have not expressed my opinion on this show, I would like to make it clear that it is not too good.
