I rented this movie just for the promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed this movie would be good if it saw RR's name on the cover (as an actor). It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez did. So if He's going to give his name, then it must be good, right? WRONG WRONG WRONG. By far the worst cut since "Manos Hands of Fate". The way it was edited made no sense and made it impossible to follow the movie. After the first 30 minutes, you do not want to try to follow him anymore. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez were involved in this film, maybe they owed someone, but they are way too good for that. Besides, they only had a few minutes in this movie and Rodriguez did not even speak. So, if you want to see a movie with bad editing, bad acting, and confusing action, be my guest, but do not say you were not warned.
