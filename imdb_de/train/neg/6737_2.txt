If Deborah Brass was not already cast as Grace, this could be a bearable movie. However, it is simply another story of a frustrated problematic spinner hiring a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney), which she reads in a Time magazine article to travel to London for her sister's London wedding. How new is this plot? <br /> <br /> Neither funny nor a bit romantic, the wedding date of the bride and the best man on the history of the fraudulent sex takes place and pays for the film to be held as Four Weddings without Hugh and definitely a dead-end deal for the naive groom who does not know the sexual history of his bride (Amy Adams). While Brass has perfected the repressed Princess, a woman with a failed relationship story, her neurotic and drunken move on yet another Faux Beau is simply the restatement of her television series. If this woman is an actress, you get a role that does not reuse what's already in prime time. <br /> <br /> Many drunk female ties, cricket jokes and Mulroney in a towel (nice!), but the movie is boring with the obvious happy ending. Expected brass continuation: divorce date.
