This movie could have been an interesting character study and could have given some insight into the subject, but the real problem with this movie is that it does not contain it. There are no insights or solutions to the problem. It's just the portrayal of the "old" male sex addict and the problems that come with it for his daily normal life and family. Why do you want to see this? It's all so pointless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> It does not really help that the main character is a wrinkled, over 50-year-old man. They will have a hard time identifying and pitying for themselves. He just seems to be a dirty old playboy who is a constant hunt for wife and sex. He has all kinds of intercourse about three times a day with another woman and not just with prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It does not have a bad visual style, even though everything feels a bit forced. But it still looks better than most other direct video productions. Who knows if the filmmakers had been provided with better material, the film would have earned a better faith. <br /> <br /> The story sometimes gets really ridiculous. There are really pointless storylines that are often more ridiculous than they should be. For example, I'm talking about the entire Ordell plotline. Things get worse as soon as the movie comes to an end. Also, the whole story telling the story that moves back and forth between the events and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and easy. <br /> <br /> But in terms of bad movies, that's just not one of them. It's not really better or worse than any other random direct-to-video movie with similar concepts. <br /> <br /> It still seems strange and quite amazing that they have managed to occupy Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. a simple little insignificant production like this one. Presumably they were really desperate for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
