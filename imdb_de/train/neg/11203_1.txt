The scriptwriter tried only badly to recreate the "exorcist". But added a bombastic love story that makes you sick instead of engaging you. There is no substance in this film. He has the potential to be special But there are a lot of people making fun of things that do not interest anyone. I was extremely bored and wanted to leave the theater when I saw that, but the stupid movie tickets were expensive, and I had to withstand the cruel tortures that lasted as if it would last forever. Nothing on screen connected to what the Characters spoke. <br /> <br /> You're using computer graphics that, rather than worrying me (I mean hate CGI), ruined the movie even more. Some people say that this movie was terrible in the cinemas because it "made you think" and "slowly - without action - because it is an intelligent movie". What was so intelligent or thought-provoking when the story is basically about the handsome boy Heath Ledger as a priest who has a love interest and does not obey his religion? Seems like an uninspired concept. Oh, and there's a bit of hocus-pocus on the "sin-eater" (the movie was originally supposed to be called "sin-eater"). Lame concept, but the film took the "sinful" thing too seriously, making the film pathetic and devious about how dark and intelligent it was. Yes, I know that there really were sin-eaters in the Middle Ages, but this movie just makes it cheesy. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie was done right and I forget why I ever watched this movie. If you want horror movies that really have depth, check out Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibal Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Omen, or one of the Romero "Dead Trilogy" movies. Nonsense dialogue is not synonymous with intelligence people, but mainstream movie fans believe that (same people who consider a ridiculous movie like Hulk a cinematic masterpiece). If you want a boring horror, look at the order. This movie makes the church seem like a roller coaster ride.
