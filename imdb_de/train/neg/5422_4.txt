What "noise" does not do is to understand its character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessed New Yorker who can not handle the intrusive sounds of the city, especially with car alarms. It's a strange idea for a movie that's about as creative as "Death Wish." It is wise at points; Especially a scene in which our hero tries to read through hail: "I'm too stupid to understand that." He reads and reads a paragraph in confusion, we read it and do not understand it either. Only then will a car alarm go off. Throughout the movie, alarms and city noise are constantly disturbed. All in all, it does not help us understand our hero, who allows everything to ruin his marriage, and is distracted by subplots rather than digging deeper into his person. <br /> <br /> Filmmaking itself is too reckless to notice its own sound problems, modest cut and visible boom microphones. No, "noise" is not all bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the end does not fall flat. All in all, it's a logistical point you probably did not think about. At least I did not. All in all, ninety minutes, it could not have ended sooner. The story continued and seemed to be lost when it started. <br /> <br /> This is another movie you might see at a film festival, but probably will not be selected for distribution. Watch the DVD if you really are facing someone involved in the project. Otherwise skip it.
