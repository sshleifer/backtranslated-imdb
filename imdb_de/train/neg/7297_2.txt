From the opening dialogue and the scenes I knew that I had a train accident. I did not want to look, but could not turn away. Had I not seen the movie, I would have forgiven a star. The fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behaviors got so far was added by bad direction and terrible story. This makes this movie a mere disaster. Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good movie. However, this film fails so badly that there was no chance to recover. <br /> <br /> If you got stuck in the woods, your best friend from your childhood would have died from an unknown illness. What would you do? <br /> <br /> A.) Run away from everyone and try your luck alone. B.) Have sex with your girlfriend. C.) Take a hot bath to relax your worries and shave your legs. D.) Beat your childhood buddy in your head and have a life-long crush on a shovel. E.) Everything above. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of these answers are that farfetched. In fact, everyone at Cabin Fever is plausible and well represented. The total lack of reality and the illogical attempt to explain what people would do in traumatic situations throws this movie in the garbage bin of your rental business. Stay away. Stay far away.
