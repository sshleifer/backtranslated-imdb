This is a flat hedonism and / or a social commentary wrapped in a tragic story about a jealous young woman's plan to disperse her father and fiancee. Is it incest or just a look through the eyes of a daughter with an Electra complex? Who cares? With the exception of Anne (Deborah Kerr), all characters are empty and mean. Seberg is poor (I agree with the comment "Boys with breasts" from a previous review). The story babbled. This predictable material was enough for about 30 minutes film, which unfortunately was stretched over one and a half hours! If you want to see great clothes and jewels on the Riviera, I recommend "To Catch a Thief" - where you get the added bonus of a fun story and personable characters. <br /> <br /> I like watching movies. I personally do not care where a movie takes place. No matter what time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some funny characters. It does not hurt if I can relate to them. Poor Deborah Kerr shows a typically good performance, and David Niven also a despicable role. <br /> <br /> The rating "2" applies exclusively to Kerr and Niven and to cinematography - the rich color scenes and the bleak, unsuspecting black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the great movies in the world can not save a bad story with unpleasant characters. The ear of a sow is still the ear of a sow. So it was a serious waste of time to watch this mess.
