If there was a scale below 1, it would appear in the footsteps of Godspell -10. Acting (if there was such a thing) was disgusting, the conspiracy confusing. And Rene Russo, in her role, was pathologically sweet enough to make someone choke. Ten thumbs down for a stupid movie. Save Grace: Kudos for the costumes of the era.
