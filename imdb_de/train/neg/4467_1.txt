<br /> <br /> I'm not sure who fits in which category a movie, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. The story was pretty interesting, but rather slow. I was especially disappointed with the end. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why she runs to earth on her uncle (?) Run home without at least calling the detective or the police first? She knows exactly what is going on at this point, and she has videotape as proof. Instead, she runs over and begins to go crazy and says, "I know everything, I have proof! You did not expect proof, did you?" Then she looks surprised when her uncle gets up and walks over to her, as if harming her. Now YOU! Of course he'll hurt you fool, you just told him that you know everything and have evidence to expose everything. What a stupid ending.
