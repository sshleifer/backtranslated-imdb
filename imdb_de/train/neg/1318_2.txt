"We Shall Overcome", a sentimental school drama in Denmark, 1969, offers a pathetic Danish attitude to US culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), an obsessed, naive 13-year-old flower power, leaves half an ear in front of the brutal master Lindum-Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Lindum-Svendsen, a headmaster portrayed as a fascist tyrant, has a grip on the local community. Lindum-Svendsen has gone too far this time and with his father he recovered from a nervous breakdown (sure there was not enough drama ...) and the overly stereotypical hippie music teacher Mr. Svale ("Hello, call me "Freddie"), Frits advocates for justice. <br /> <br /> Tell yourself something. It is so unconvincing, over-methoded and so full of misery that this grotesque - cliché-filled - excuse for a movie sounds like a 'family portrait' that does not convince Scandinavian audiences. I'm sorry, dear Danish readers, to fall into your sentimental travels like this. But it's definitely NOT a story about a boy becoming a man by fighting the system. The boy never becomes a man, but remains a naive, wide-eyed, screaming face. When you call a church of Kleinstädter Kleinstädter, which is called by a dictator like a cartoon character "system", I'm sorry if I miss something. <br /> <br /> If you see family pictures, see Happy Feet instead ..
