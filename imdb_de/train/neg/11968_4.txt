This is just a typical Bruce Willis action movie. Check it out with popcorn and your buddies. Rent it to save money. <br /> <br /> None of this is realistic. The battles are not realistic. The soldiers are not realistic. The victims are not realistic. And why did Tom talk to Willis of the DECK OF THE CARRIER? What about it? He can not do that from the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. gets a machete wound. There are a lot of average explosions. <br /> <br /> If this movie accurately portrays the Navy SEALS, do not get stuck in Africa and expect it to save you! <br /> <br /> The noble attack on the village bothered me the most. "First Row for an Ethnic Cleansing" ... as Bruce contemplates the carnage in the city. So what does he do? He crawls into the city with his belly. Yes. How many died when they were poking around? Well ... a body count was necessary, I think. <br /> <br /> And if this one African was so important, why did not he sit down with the elderly and children on the helicopter? Can he say "Duh"? <br /> <br /> Finally the movie was very dark. Not only in the plot, but so much happened at night, it was hard to understand what was going on. <br /> <br /> Rent it.
