I was totally disappointed with this movie. I read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with a more intense character development. That never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor but not as good as some critics believe. I said he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would rate his performance with 6 out of 10 points. Acting: 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10. Script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Me The movie was deleted from my DVR in 70 minutes. in the movie. Much better movies out there ...
