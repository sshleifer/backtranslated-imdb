Any movie that starts with a cow hat pushing a female calf can not promise much. As far as stereotyping the kibbutz is concerned, like 50 years ago, I was there and it just was not like that. OK, every kibbutz had shown only a small part of something in the movie (like young people attacking the kitchen at night), but you can not show that the whole kibbutz is full of all these - we say - naughty features. Every kibbutz had its own problems, but hardly any kibbutz had them all. The views of Israel were great. I still remember my youth in this garden of Eden, which was called Emek (valley). Yeah, and the drama was good too, so you can see that it was not all black - just a misrepresentation - probably intentionally too.
