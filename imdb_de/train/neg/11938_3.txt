The movie started well enough. A companion was hit by a glowing green meteorite and received superpowers (telekinesis, X-ray vision, invulnerability, escape, ability to talk to dogs, superspeed, thermal vision, and the ability to grow plants large and fast). and fighting crime. From there it goes downhill. <br /> <br /> Meteor You get a costume from your mother, fight with the local gangs and have many broken encounters with the gang leaders and a startling ending. <br /> <br /> It would not be remarkably bad if it were not for a boxing match where the two fighters beat each other while the crowd is looking forward while the fighters are still dancing. <br /> <br /> Despite this nonsense, the film has good points. It clearly states that if you try to stand alone against a gang, they will come to your home and hurt you. It states that gangs and communities must see their true enemies (the big bosses they use for their own purposes to crush honest people into ghetto existence). It also says that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community, destroying predators that harm them. The only message that really lacks is that voters should ensure that their elected representatives (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush) are not crooks. <br /> <br />
