While the original tickles the intellect, this cheap remake is only meant to shock the sensations. Instead of complicated plot changes, this so-called thriller has only sudden and seemingly random story changes that only serve to break it down with every bizarre development. Worst of all, the original spicy dialogue is replaced by a salt shaker that is filled with unnecessary four letters and leaves a crass but uninteresting taste. <br /> <br /> There was promise - unfulfilled promise. The prospect of Michael Caine doing a Patty Duke-like graduation from Keller to Sullivan is admittedly intriguing. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor has only tarnished his reputation by first accepting the role in this terribly rewritten nonsense and then delivering a performance that only looks competent compared to Jude Law's exaggerated over-function. > If you have not seen the classic original, overlook the outdated visuals and gimmicks. Hunt it, watch it and just enjoy one and a half stories. As for the remake, pass on this insult to the original.
