Spoilers ahead - proceed with your own caution. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this movie is that once Harry gets to know the identities of the three blackmailers, he gets into their demands relatively easily. And then, while the whole scene is kidnapped with his wife, he decides to wire up his vintage car to explode (with the money in it), which brings us a pretty big jump in logic. <br /> <br /> Okay, so he did not want to keep his affair with Cini out of the public eye because of his wife's involvement in the DA campaign. I can see that, but why not hire someone to beat or even kill this pork a little when he finds out there's no blackmail evidence (like Cini's body?). This was a pretty interesting movie for the first two / 3 of them. After that, it somehow falls apart.
