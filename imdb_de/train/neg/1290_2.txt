This movie had two and a half agonizing hours. Please tell me what it is? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical background. It's probably a group of compound Bushwhackers (terrorists?) On the Missouri-Kansas border, who take revenge on all the north sympathizers and abolitionists during the US Civil War. But apart from unfounded violence, there was no real meaning to this film. Maybe it was a political statement? This war is really nothing but an act of violence? If that was the point, it was done pretty well, but I do not think that was the point. I think the producers really thought that they would make a worthwhile movie here, but for me there were no complications. It seemed like I was bringing a paperback novel to life, with the characters looking the way they would appear on the covers of such novels. <br /> <br /> This film should be burned along with some cities of this gang burned
