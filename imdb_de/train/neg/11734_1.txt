Tasteless. I can not even write about the movie intelligently. I laughed the whole movie. It should not be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he is doing. It seems that his story was written without knowledge of the Iowa culture and the meth problem. I know that Farnsworth is from Iowa, which makes his film even more mysterious to me. Why do the two main characters have accents? It makes no sense. The drama was mediocre at best and sometimes hard to see. Burrs of violence and sex filled the film. I suspect that violence and sex should make the movie nervous, but that seemed unbelievable and offensive to me. The end of the movie is so awfully bad that I could only laugh and disbelieve the current credits. When I left the theater, everyone else who was walking laughed. The end of the movie was meant to bring tears, but it did the opposite. Do not waste your time on this horrible movie unless you want to see ignorant, juicy, over-reacted clich√©.
