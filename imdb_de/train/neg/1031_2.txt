This movie is a long chiche after another. First, even though they have done their part, there is an unjustified doping scene in which John sniffs like an idiot. The wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than the old Beatle cartoons. John is the evil, envious, hidden homosexual and slave of Yoko. He is depicted in the discredited Albert Goldman book. In regular conversations, they even constantly inject the title "it was only the two of us"! John would not have been so mean to his fans. As his death has shown us, he was too nice, if that. The one funny scene is where a stupid Beatle fan just recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Yesterday. An offended John says something in the direction of "Sure, and while I'm mad, why do not you kneel, put on your wife's wig, and lick my leash." That made me laugh for days. Really, this movie is funny, how serious it wants to be while it gets ridiculous. Also, John and Paul did not sit all day, they were funny, carefree guys, who even split up during the Beatles, where they were much friendlier than was shown here. Forget it.
