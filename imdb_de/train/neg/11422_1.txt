I saw it in the theater when it came out, and yesterday I saw it on the cable again. So I was able to get used to the feeling of how repulsive this film is. The whole bunch of characters are selfish, narcissistic cleaners. Worst of all, it underpins any negative 20 year dating stereotype, even though it claims to be celebrating people who "find themselves". The nice guys are finally finished, the jerky ones make it great, the jerkiest guys do it the best. The girls are all toy toys for boys. Only one character ("Wendy") does anything useful to the company from afar, and she renounces her long-saved virginity in a discarding one-night stand with filth, in a lavishly filmed scene of which we are believe that she is romantic. What this really is is Hollywood's concept of young America: liberal, detached, promiscuous, conceited.
