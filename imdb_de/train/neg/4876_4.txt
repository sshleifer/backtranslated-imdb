... when he redesigned Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). Reworking Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help with a script that was "obsolete" in 34, let alone 50 years. In this sad movie, entire scenes were removed from the original, with many of the cast actors replaying their roles, unless they were dead. Although older, the director did not seem to matter. Also, the cars and clothes in the background plates of 1934 do not seem to meet the standards of the 1950s. Not even the 'bingel' song can deliver that effort. <br /> <br /> We have reviewed both the original and the remake IMDb Four **** stars. Frank's touch was long gone and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. But that did not stop Mr. Capra. After making some educational documentary films in the 1950s, he ended his career making LADY FOR A DAY (1933) POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Again, a fine litter was rejected on this IMDb Six ****** star attempt compared to the original Eight ******* stars. Sometimes it's better to quit while still in front of STATE OF THE UNION (1948).
