This is the only movie I have seen and made by Uwe Boll. I knew he was probably the worst director ever to make video-based films and that "House of the Dead" was the best in the 100's. I wanted to see it anyway because I'm a big fan of the game and Wanted to see what kind of movie the movie has that makes it so bad. After watching, I agree that it is crap, the film had no history. For the first 15 to 20 minutes, there was nothing but topless teens without girls running around (for a moment I wondered if the zombies are brain dead or are the girls?). At night the zombies appeared out of nowhere and started attacking people, later a woman started to shoot them. I mean, you need one seat every 5 minutes and then the other. Is it supposed to be a comedy, or horror? or both? Before I knew it, I fell asleep in the second half and woke up during the credits, so I did not manage to see everything, which is a good thing! The film is a real insult to the classic, Uwe Boll please do not make any more movies. Many Thanks!
