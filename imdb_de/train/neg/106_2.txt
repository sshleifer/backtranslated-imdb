Aug 3, 2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about carnivorous zombies in a 3 story story in a movie chronicle. And yes, we see zombies eating human flesh in 3D !! Wow, not !! This has been done in 2D in a zombie movie over and over again, but what usually enhances a zombie movie is the underlying story, not the carnivorous one. This has done the original zombie classics well. The meat-eating meat was simply thrown as an extra. We are bored in most parts of this three-part chronicle because the lame (dawn-like) easy-to-understand and slow-moving finals are apparent. The last story is actually the story the movie started with (a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town), and of course we also see meat eating zombies. I think I said enough. Take a look at the classics, not this 3D party.
