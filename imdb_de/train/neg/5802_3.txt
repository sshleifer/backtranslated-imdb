Nikolai Gogol's story "Viy" was once again released as a home video about Faith Films in the US. The original story is about a priest who only has to watch over the body of a witch with his faith in order to protect him. Expanded and playing extensively in America, although clearly filmed in Russia (the houses, clothes and furnishings are all wrong despite English signs), this is a strange movie that does not really work It's hard to be America's backwoods but clearly not. There are also some weird, intentionally weird moments, as the main character is a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later. I'm not sure why they did that, even after seeing the piece on the DVD. The other problem is dubbing, which is beyond terrible. It's done so that everyone speaks when his lips are not in front of the camera - or when the voices do not even fit in the distance to the lip flaps. I do not know if it's due to Faith Films or to the producers who made the film and hoped to overthrow the West (as shown in the production of a play). As I said, it has all sorts of technical issues that make it a weird curiosity. Despite some really good-looking horror images, the movie never works as a horror movie. As a film to create faith, his confusion in this retelling is far too confusing to make anyone feel closer to God to anyone. My advice would be to find the 1960s version of the story called Viy, which brings some shuddering as well as some understanding of the belief in God.
