I'm sure Operations Dames was a favorite drive-ins back then. There is absolutely nothing in the way of a conspiracy that you might miss if you were otherwise busy. And if you want to tune in to other activities, you'll have some curvy cuties on the screen to put you in the right mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise there is not much that Operations Dames has in store for you. It's set in the Korean War, where a train of GIs along with a British Tommy gets a little too far forward and has to return to the UN lines. Bad enough, but these guys also meet a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same plight. <br /> <br /> You know what's sad about this movie, that it took generations of women to finally be accepted by the army and in combat situations. These Bimbos from the USO set the liberation of women in light years. In fact, not even the hard-bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant of these men can keep it in his pants. <br /> <br /> But that was probably the better way to remind people of what they were doing at the drive-in. This is not a better name, as I do not recognize any of them for individual effort. <br /> <br /> Operations Dames is definitely a teamflop.
