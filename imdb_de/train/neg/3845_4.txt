Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job as Mildred, I felt that the movie was not the best I had ever seen. At the end of the film, I felt that something was missing in the film. <br /> <br /> But Bette Davis did a perfect job, and she made me hate her and feel sorry for her all the time. Leslie Howard has done well as the loving Philip Carey and I have so much regretted him throughout the movie that I fell in love with such a dreadful lady. It is such a sad thing to fall in love with a bad seed. And especially when it comes to someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, albeit miserable. In the end the acting came through and not the plot. The final scene was especially good, but I can not tell her. Although others may find this movie good, I liked it so much. I should recommend this movie to those who prefer a bad seed so that they can see what can happen to them if they fall in love with this terrible person.
