In 1988 Paperhouse was celebrated as a "horror film of the thinking man". Wow, could you say, let me know. This thing is a mess. It shows a unique young actress with a range of 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad British (synchronized) accent and a story without chills, thrills or treats. <br /> <br /> Not even interesting psycho chatter. One will only laugh at its cheap effects and yearn for a show by Leprechaun 5. The story is about a girl with glandular fever fleeing in her dreams. What you get is not a good horror, a kind of house or even a decent afternoon special. I found myself after the two-hour point and said where my two hours went. <br /> <br /> The direction is not inspired and I wish it could even be overbearing ... something interesting was on lithium. <br /> <br /> Also in the dream world, things are boring. <br /> <br /> A short no to this topic.
