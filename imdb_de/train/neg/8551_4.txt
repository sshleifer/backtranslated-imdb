It is 1982, two years after the siege of the Iranian Embassy involving the dramatic SAS salvation in front of the Balconys, and a war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands, which is the best film that is better than a Gung-Ho Movie "SAS" -the Iranian hostage siege is created while Lewis Collins, the action-hero of the time number one, is used. Are you throwing Edward Woodward and a few other well-known actors and you have a winner in hand? ... well, maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, while acting is rather secondary. It's like a long episode of The Professionals, but without the formula. This movie is nowhere fast and quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli saw this movie and decided to give up Lewis Collins as James Bond's replacement for Roger Moore. Take a look at it, if you are generally a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS, if not, save yourself time.
