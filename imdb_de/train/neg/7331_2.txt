This movie was clearly bad and in a hurry. I realize that funding for such a film is hard to come by. However, if the plot had some kind of original substance, someone would have seen that he got the necessary funding, this was not the case, and films like this are themselves not necessary and have no purpose to exist. The plot for this movie was made and done better, I could add many times before. There is no reason to make a film that has no chance of competing with others. I was informed by my computer that I needed at least ten lines to submit my comment. The following lines are just bulls to fill space. In my opinion, nothing else has to be said about this film. What I have said is ample, and if you have spent enough time reading this report, do not waste any more time watching this movie. The only exception to this is if you're the kind of person who likes to see fucking movies being played on the women's entertainment network at 02:00. In that case you will see what interests me.
