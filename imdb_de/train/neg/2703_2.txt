MINOR SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Well, I was late and watched this movie, mainly because I rated and rated some of Singleton's earlier work as "Boyz n the hood". But I have to say that this was a big disappointment and everything I hate about fictional, clich√©, so-called "message" films. <br /> <br /> The acting is mostly bad (pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors ... note), the situations are hard to swallow (rape victims will be lesbian overnight ... please!)! ), but worst of all, it reinforces every supposed stereotype. In the second half of the film, as in its characterization, it has become a cartoon that causes you to lose the impression of empathy you might have for your one-dimensional gamblers the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual, and political ignorance. This will only make the results of these problems sensational. Their message is contradictory and leads to confusion and general lack of action. As for the film's conclusion, I found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and slightly offensive. For a movie called "Higher Learning," all I have to say is that I have to avoid seeing it again and again. <br /> <br /> If you want a real comment on some of the topics this movie does not do Then accept "American History X" ... unless you only saw it for Tyra Banks and then a life set.
