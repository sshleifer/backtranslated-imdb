This movie was so ridiculous that I never saw it finished. I actually thought someone had made his own version and dubbed it from the DVD store to the DVD. This movie made me sick, not because it was bloody, but because I was wasting 2 50 !!!! It looks like my brother and I went to a house, made the movie ourselves, and edited slaughterhouse footage! I'm so ticked off, even the BTK killer deserves more credit than it was not even right. I mean, the cow head was obviously made of play dough or BUBBLE GUM OMG DO NOT SEE THIS FILM !!!!!!!
