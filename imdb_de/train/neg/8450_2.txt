What happens to ITV drama? First, "Losing Gemma" is simply the worst TV drama I've seen in years, and now "Perfect Parents" is a complete mess from start to finish. Anyone responsible for commissioning this drive should receive P45 there by special delivery. <br /> <br /> Most drama / thrillers require a requirement to suspend certain levels of belief, but the plotline may evolve "Perfect Parents" has taken this to a new level. I had given up so much faith at the end of this nonsense that I felt I had been force-fed with a truckload of "magic mushrooms." A "drama by numbers" that contained some serious topics - religion, education, greed, Fear, Murder, Paedophillia. The only problem was, as the great Eric Morecambe once said when playing the piano: "I play all the right notes, just not necessarily in the right order." For your next script guys, I suggest you read a few more script development books than "Script Writing For Dummies." <br /> <br /> Due to the ridiculous script and the total lack of tension in the direction, the act was reasonably restrained, not the guilt of the actors, as the cast was top notch. However, I propose that all the actors involved in this sad piece of the drama instruct their agents when the postman next tries to submit a script from the ITV drama department that the mailbox is tightly closed.
