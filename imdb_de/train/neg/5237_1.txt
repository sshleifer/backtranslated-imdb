One of, if not the worst, movie from the UK in the 80's. <br /> <br /> This shabby story of a middle-aged Lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers babysitting for him and his faux-haired wife has nothing to solve. <br /> <br /> This puerile, skeptical and unrealistic film explores the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be witty, provocative, intellectual and controversial. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst part about this film is the way the strong cast of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes, and Siobhan Finneran are completely sutured by such a lame script. It's no surprise that this was the last work of Andrea Dunbar to make it to the screen. Complete and total garbage on every level.
