As a girl, Hinako moved from her small village to Tokyo, leaving behind her best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She returns as a young woman and is surprised to find that Sayori died as a teenager. She meets again with Fumiya and they are appalled to learn that Sayori is mysteriously revived on the island of Shikoku. Oh boy. I hired this because I like the Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is a posh actress. If I had to describe Shikoku in one word, that would be fruity. This film is stupid, boring, badly filmed, uninspired and most of all careless. Kuriyama, as resurrected Sayori, has minimal on-screen time, and her character has little work to do with it.
