This effort was like a dazzling TV movie ... I do not remember that this ever appeared in the cinemas ... If so, it must have died a quick death. When we saw the DVD in our bedroom, it was obvious that this movie was not meant for much ... Ed Lauter, an art critic with greed? What a funny turnaround that had been ... I have not seen Ed since "The Longest Yard" ... All the others have pretty much kept to the numbers run by Baldwin, with the exception of Pompeo ... She had no charisma and seemed to have to sleepwalk the greater part of the picture ... Pompeo's daughter had a dimension ... She played every scene like a lovable little puppy ... slowest line delivery of all 3-year-olds that I have not yet <br /> The chases have caused my wife and me a headache ... too much frills and snappy bashing ... If you are shooting a chase scene in Barcelona, ​​you may want to take some WIDE shots, to use the beauty of your scenery, right? The whole story was quite implausible and far-fetched, but hey, we liked it better than "The Life Aquatic ..."
