I had the pleasure to watch this movie early, and I have to say that I thought it would get boring and wondered how they could improve the 1984 version of the Bachelor Party with Tom Hanks, which I thought was pretty good ... I was right ... Honestly, I thought it could have been better ... Sure, there were some funny moments, but I just did not seem to like it ... The acting was fine and the Plot pretty well follows the original, but I think it could have been so much better ... This movie I would say is for teenagers and young people. full of female bodies, alcohol and sex ... It's just a typical part of the mill party movie that has been made over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for this.
