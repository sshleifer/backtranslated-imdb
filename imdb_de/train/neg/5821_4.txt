As others have noted, this should be an awesome Hammer-style movie, and it seems to me that most actors have been asked to play it ... but the script is so thin, badly moved, and full of many boring monologues (poor Timothy Dalton is saddled with most of them), that everything is too exaggerated and too important. This is an unusually weak performance by Dalton, though he neatly nails the climate scene in which Dr. Rock finally realizes what he has done. The only actor who really does well is Patrick Stewart, who is a very welcome sight. Freddie Francis was perhaps a great cameraman, but he was a lousy director.
