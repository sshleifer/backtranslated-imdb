Demi Moore's character in the film was chosen for her looks for the SEALs. That was a bad start and the movie went down from there. The story was absolutely incredible. The will to do it in a tough military unit is not enough. This movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the required tasks. Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to the intelligence of everyone. The differences between the sexes make life interesting.
