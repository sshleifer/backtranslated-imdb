I figured every horror movie with Orson Welles would be weird. Necromancy was safe, but it was a bit too funny for itself. The film does indeed feel scary when it comes to a convent of satanists / witches in a small town and the attempt of a young woman to escape them. However, the director seems to have deliberately tried to confuse the audience with flashbacks and dream sequences. There are too many unanswered questions until the final. Worse still, the story is so confusing that it's hard for the characters to find. It seems strange that Welles would agree to override this film, especially as he does not have much to do. Maybe someday they will take a band of outtakes and bloopers out of this movie. That would be really fun!
