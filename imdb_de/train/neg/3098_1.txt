How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five films is harder to believe than cold fusion. This movie is absolutely criminal. Before I looked at this movie, I thought Manos: Hands of Fate was the worst piece of crap I've ever seen, but at least Manos moves so slowly that you might fall asleep and save your eyes from the pain he's going to suffer , The biggest tragedy of this movie is that the old man who holds the hobgoblins "locked up" reaches the final scene. The time I looked at this movie was an absolute waste of my life.
