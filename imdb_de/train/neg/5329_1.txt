As a true Elvis fan, this movie is totally embarrassing and the script is a disaster. The film begins with the beautiful son "Stay Away" and the backdrop of the Grand Canyon lets the audience hope for something special. Elvis comes into the picture and his talent is wasted a lot of time, especially with the other featured songs. I ate this movie twice, just to make sure it's a piece of garbage !!! 1 out of 10 !!!
