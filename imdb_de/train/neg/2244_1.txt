There are two things I need to clarify right from the start. First of all, we all know what this year really was about. It was the way the academy used to show people that they are not racist and never have been. They wanted to clarify all preconceptions about themselves. Second, it's kind of pointless to comment on the show, because what's the difference? But it's fun to write about it. This year I was full of the Oscars! I will never see the show again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe wins for Gladaitor, Ralph Fiennes should be the real winner for Sunshine. If you have not seen this movie yet, look at it and you agree. "Eyes Wide Shut" at the release received no nominations. And as for this year, the bad decisions were omnipresent! Baz Lurhmann does not receive a "Best Director" nomination! Are you kidding!! "A Beautiful Mind" stands for "Best Makeup" ???? "Training Day" is nominated? The movie was awful, and it seemed Washington had not even made a performance. He won the prize for that! Take the language away and I bet he almost played himself! I really liked Gosford Park, but why 7 nominations? And how on earth could they not give it to Altman! I mean, if it's just about giving people the price to clear bad feelings, what about Altman? The man is in public for 32 years and no Oscar! There were many, many things that bothered me about this year's Oscar, but I'll live with it as long as I never have to see another show again! The highlight (and the ONLY) of the show was when Woody Allen appeared for the first time in the awards ceremony. This will be one of the biggest moments in the history of the show.
