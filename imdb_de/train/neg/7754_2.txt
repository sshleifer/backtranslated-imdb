Spoilers will be there. The movie could have been better if it had just had another script, a different director, and another CGI provider. Not much right? The movie has a man who opens his own theme park ... er ... zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs ... uh ... sabretooth's and it's called Jurra ... whoops ... Primal Park. I do not mind being ripped off because there are no original ideas for this type of film, but it just slaps you in the face, R e p a d d d y. There is even the shaded creature's head on the design. The Sabretooths, who are not sabretooths according to Mr. Primal Park (just killing old cats), are rather junky, but the coronation is what I call "Sloggy". Because a hero relaxes a bit after the withdrawal of a big cat because there is only one left. Enter the weird feeding man who says, "Nah, we did three, the third is a monster that wields its fore feet." Great, Groovy A group of college students are also on the island for a scavenger hunt, testing there to enter or sort their cliques (always thinking that a short nickname is needed). Of those who live, only one has done their job, so I got a kick. Oh yes, the compelling "Evil Capitalist Must Die" clique is not just for one, but for two of them! Mr. Primal Park's death is the most ridiculous thing you'll see in any of these films when the toothed glasses of a Sabretooth statue are loose (courtesy of Sloggy), shrinking a few sizes and flushing the man through the neck. If only I could have got away with it so easily. I like "Sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
