Interesting idea and action that did not quite work. <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie, you may feel as dissatisfied with the end as I am. I did not really know whom to prefer, Taye Diggs was boring as a detective, the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> If the victim Alicia (Mia Kirschner) was more of a nice girl, we would actually have enjoyed seeing the plot and bringing the perpetrator to justice. The problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls, turning from a sweet girl to a passionate opportunistic Cokehead. I can not understand the moral message of this movie and as a detective story and thriller it does not work.
