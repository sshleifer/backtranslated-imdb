FilmFour must be a lot better than this little frills of a movie if they get the right reputation for themselves. <br /> <br /> This film plays in Glasgow (though only a few secondary characters have something that approaches a Scottish accent). The premise that people live does not go anywhere, all in the early morning hours in the same caf√©, since they have night jobs. Instead, we have a group of selfish Saddos and a conspiracy that was done that way. I'm surprised she was not banned. X and Y are friends. X sleeps with Z. Y also sleeps with Z. Oh, you find out. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. Painful dialogue - it sounded like something a group of 16-year-olds wrote for a GCSE drama project. The female figure was completely superfluous - she was enrolled only as a female mark, in the hope that women would tend to see her. <br /> <br /> If you're a fat kid who laughs at beer ads You can usually find them in packs screaming on modest city centers on Saturday nights, then you'll love this movie and find "a real man". Everyone else is running, do not go away from that sad little fool. <br /> <br /> And a question, when the group left the "boring" coastal town (saltcoats, even though they changed the name in the movie). To return to Glasgow, WHY did they do that on the Forton highways of LANCASTER in England?
