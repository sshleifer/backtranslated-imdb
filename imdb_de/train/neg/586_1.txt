WHY was Kirk Douglas replaced in the sequel to Brian Dennehy, which in my opinion was a masterful feat of two roles in Man From Snowy River? It just was not the same thing without a trace and Harrison as depicted by Douglas. Maybe he realized how bad the conspiracy was - Jim returns after a long absence and finds Jessica pursued by another man. He could not expect a girl to wait so long without contact and find no competition. For a Disney movie, this one contains a bad language as well as the most unnecessary part when Jim and Jessica were crammed together without a wife - very LAME. A rather offensive consideration for the audience's intelligence, according to members of my family. I stay with the first one and try to forget that I've ever seen the sequel!
