The first question that comes to my mind after you look at this garbage is: Who on earth has given these idiots the right to use the name Omen in this film? It is a shambolic, embarrassing, pathetic attempt to continue the Omen franchise. When the movie starts, the background music sounds like it was taken directly from a Bugs Bunny cartoon, and from then on, the movie gets worse! I do not know who wrote the script, but I bet they got an E - when they took it back to show their teacher! After a while, it's hard to tell if this is a comedy because what happens is so funny and does not fit the original omen. The acting is ridiculous, especially by the main actress Faye Grant. She always draws stupid faces or is it hard not to laugh? It's difficult to say. The worst Sequal I ever had had to witness the disaster. 1 out of 10.
