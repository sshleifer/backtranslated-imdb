Now and then comes a movie that turns me on and reminds me that my taste for movies I watch is not always perfect. Normally, I would stay away from such things, but I was cheated on by some glowing reviews and the Rohmer family tree. <br /> <br /> There is an initial and intriguing novelty in production in which Rohmer essentially overlays the actors on painted (digital) relapses of the Revolution era France. This quickly diminishes and becomes about as interesting as drying the paint on a color by numbers. What remains is a boring and stuffy movie about aristocrats in the 18th century in France. None of the characters is appealing or sympathetic. The tempo is so boring, the dialogue so exhausting, and the tension is clearly a foreign word to Rohmer, so I did not care who the head was rolling, who was harboring, or what a hell the revolution was supposed to be. The film would have profited greatly from a certain emotional accumulation and a music score (at the very end fine classical music is used). Although he is so "talkative", the film plays a lot like a silent film and the worst movie about it, a boring and uninteresting movie about infinitely interesting topics. Only the sharpest French historians will be able to figure out something from this film because it seems to paint seemingly familiar events from a new angle (the lady is English and royalist). Otherwise avoid this greed at all costs, unless you suffer from insomnia (I fell asleep twice).
