I withdrew from Asian horror movies some time ago, because I was sick of seeing the same git from the ghost story. However, lately I have been more and more involved in exploitative movements and have therefore decided to give them another chance. My first stop was the highly rated visitor Q by director Takashi Miike. I've already seen Audition, and although I did not like it much, I rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror movies. So I agreed with reasonable expectations; and unfortunately only bored. I suppose this movie is really smart and I just dubbed my head, but it just seemed like a collection of violent and disgusting scenes with little or no coherence between them. All comparisons with the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch are in my view blasphemous. everything Miike did here is to make a movie; Every intelligence in the environment has been implemented by overbearing fans desperate for meaning. My headache set in after about 10 minutes (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it did not stop until the movie was finally over; At least 24 hours later, it seems. Do not get me wrong, I am not against violence in movies and actively select the most notorious films; But although this can be violent, it's also pointless and boring, and I have not enjoyed an ounce of it. Takashi Miike may have many fans, but I'm certainly not one of them. And I definitely hope that I get in touch with one of his films for the last time.
