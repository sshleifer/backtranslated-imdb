I have never seen anything as terrible as this movie. The movie was boring, long and terrible. The special effects are shit - it's like I'm watching a movie in 1999. That's a waste of an hour and a half of my time. The performance of Matthew Settle was pretty bad. I saw him in Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs, he was not that bad. Not bad at all. But in this movie his acting was not convincing enough, it was pretty bad and there was no chemistry between the rest of the crew. Besides, his eyes seem to be empty, as if he did not feel it. It really surprised me because he was good at Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, do not even bother to watch this movie. It's a big big waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, you should do something besides watching this movie. Trust me, you will regret it!
