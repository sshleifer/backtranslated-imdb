I like silent films, but that was a bit too feeble-minded. As much as I wish I could say it was worth the hour I got up in, I can not. I do not think a version of the movie even comes close to the book. And do not give kids a try, they might freak out. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know that the labor laws were different at that time ... BUT COMING WITH THE PEOPLE.
