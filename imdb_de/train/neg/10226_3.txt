"Do not mind this movie" would be better advice if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. This was a big disappointment given the great cast, not just Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was just nothing, certainly not as described on the VHS box. There was simply no tension, precious little excitement and too many boring places. Most tried to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so confused. This was not a good role for Monroe, though I did not have to see this character to know she could act. "Some Like It Hot" alone was a good proof for me. But that role simply did not suit her and it's no surprise that she was not among her more popular films. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that a movie wastes the talents of actors like Richard Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game.
