This movie is not worth the movie it was shot on. The dialogue is flat, filled with clich√©s of overused lines, and is delivered by amateur actors who sound like they are reading a script for the first time. The choppy, shaky film style is a cheap imitation of the visual effects of the "ring" style. The characters do not even behave like a normal person. The figure who is looking for her twin sister at home, for example, pushes through the front door, crawls around in the house, startled and sobbing, and does not even call her sister's name to see if she's home. What? You'd think she'd just bury her sister instead of looking for her. Far too many flashbacks to her childhood. Too many unnecessary flashbacks are a typical sign of an amateur director. It's funny to see the many shots of the woman driving her car down the street, up the driveway, around that corner, over here, oh, a side view, now a front view. Enough now. You would think you are watching a TV ad for Solaris! Terrible movie. 0 out of 100. I really pity anyone who has spent money on making or watching this movie.
