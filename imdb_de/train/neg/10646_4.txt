The last of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films and a good thing, as this is by far the worst of the 12 films he shot over a 16-year period. Again, there are no mermaids, as a beautiful island female tries to escape from the clutches of their people who worship a god and try to force her to the bride. She finds Tarzan and Jane trying to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially malignant High Priest but is not used to his full advantage. Also present and worth mentioning is an extremely annoying guitarist / singer who occasionally goes into the song. Even the "big" Robert Florey can not help this. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
