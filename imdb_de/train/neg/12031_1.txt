At first, this movie is not a comedy; If you do not really force yourself, you can hardly laugh. Second, the movie is slow and boring. Acting is not bad, but not special. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town. Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy, and this film only confirms this rule. There is a similar thematic comedy "The Home Teacher"; This had some good moments. My last comment is: Do not waste your time and money watching this uninspired and boring movie.
