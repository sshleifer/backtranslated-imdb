I do not know about you, but what I love about Tom and Jerry Cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan, Jerry sees him leaving Tom to go on an adventure in New York, and I think this one definitely suffers from a lack of cats! <br /> <br /> As magical as Jerry's exploration, the 'Big Apple' might be for the other T & J fans who have commented on IMDb here. I could not wait for that complacent junk to end, and I could watch the next cartoon on my DVD In fact, the only part of the entire episode I really enjoyed was the fact that Jerry almost "bought" the farm and hung precariously at the end of a broken candle, hundreds of feet above a busy street.
