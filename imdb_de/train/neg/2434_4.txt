Of course, more realistic film, apart from the fact that the characters do not look like fear. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he does not look that way. That's why I do not like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger is playing a soldier again. Not a good thrill, realistic sequences. Do not shoot always, that's a great thing. Well filmed I hate the helicopter sequence, because only one terrorist kills almost the whole ship ... I give him one and a half
