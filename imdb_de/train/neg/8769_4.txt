This was a movie that I hoped to recommend to my American friends. But after four attempts to finish the movie, I knew I could not even look at the damned thing when I closed it. They are almost convinced that the actual war did not take so long. Others will try to challenge my patriotism for criticizing a film like this one. But in vain, you can not look from Saving Private Ryan to LOC. Forget the difference between the movies or the audience - this does not stop a director from making an intelligent movie. The length of the film is not so bad and the fact that it repeats itself, they attack again and again the same hill, but give it other names. I thought the LOC was a terrible terrain - this hill looked like my backyard. The development sequences for the characters (Soilder's flashbacks, which look back on their last moments before they were used) should have been summed up throughout the movie, not just in a long memory. To this day, I still have to see the end. But there was a much better movie (Border).
