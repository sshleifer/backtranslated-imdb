.. Oh wait, I can! This movie is not intended for the typical movie novice, unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematographic definitions like "continuity editing" and "geographic coincidence". I could not say where I was in this movie. One second they are in the present, the next minute they are said to have driven in the 70s in a modern SUV, and they wore what I like as 80s clothing. In my opinion. I could not pay enough attention to this because the drama was just awful. I think it only got attention because it has a 3D that I did not see. If you are a b-movie fan, and with b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this movie is for you. It's a home video, and any silly style will make you laugh as long as you can stay awake. If your taste is more for Goddard and Antonioni, just skip it.
