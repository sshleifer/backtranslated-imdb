Drones, ethnic drumming, bad synthesizer whistles, children sing. The most patronizing "world music" imaginable. This is a tourist movie and a lousy one. What really kills it are the incoherent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc., etc. No transitions, no visual explanation of why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away, no ideas in pictures. Just a pile of third-party footage with "baskets on the head," another reviewer said. Go on endlessly, as if that had a deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a 3rd World music video, they only had to drive a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya were filmed and film in Mexico. That would be a much better framework for "living in transformation". <br /> <br /> But no. What they had decided on was an encrypted tourist itinerary that covered half the globe, and absent-mindedly overcrowded filter shots. The only thing to recommend is that the movie does not suck as much as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
