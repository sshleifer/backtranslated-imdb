I have seen all four films of this series. Everyone always deviates further from the books. This is the worst so far. My problem is that the book to which it is titled does not follow in any way! The directors and producers should have called anything but "Love's Abiding Joy". The only thing about this film that remotely resembles the book are the names of some characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie, and Cookie). The names / ages / genders of the children are wrong. The entire story is not in the book. <br /> <br /> I find it a big drawback for Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is in no way correct. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they lack emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, this might work. It's clean. But do not look at it if you hope for a condensed version of the book. I hope this will be the last movie in this series, but I doubt it. With more movies being produced, I wish Michael Landon, Jr, and others would stick to the original plot and storylines. The books are excellent and would, if you follow them closely, make excellent films!
