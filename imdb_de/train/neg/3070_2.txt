Oh, my lord ... They've turned a pretty thoughtful movie into a tingling testosterone feast. <br /> <br /> The original version of this movie from 1971 was very vague regarding our hero Kowalski. He was a man who tried to drive from Denver to San Francisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of top? We are not really sure. <br /> <br /> We had some flashbacks that gave us the idea that he was an adrenaline junkie, and he'd probably spent his whole life trying to make it to the vanishing point. You see this point in the distance, where the left and right shoulder of the road meet and the road itself disappears. He only lives to be free and does not make anyone ill. We saw several times when there were accidents that he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before he went on, even the police who were chasing him. Seeing the futility of his search, he took his own life instead of being arrested and living a life in captivity. He died as he lived and ran. <br /> <br /> In the remake Kowalski has a whole story (including a first name). He is trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications of her pregnancy. He is a devoted husband and more excited father. He decides to take his life after hearing that his wife died in childbirth, but they even question that if they suspect that he might have jumped out of the car before getting into the bulldozer could be advised. They even gave the part of "Super Soul," the blind DJ (brilliantly portrayed by Clevon Little in the original), to JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!?!? Give me a break.
