This is a movie about a movie. Such films may be entertaining, but they need some substance. It did not happen here, I'm afraid. Unfortunately, Mr. Coppola did not inherit the skills of his father (not even his sister, who does, however, make films that you look at). <br /> <br /> I wonder how this movie has led to such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: The lead actor, supposedly a director, is as expressive as a frozen squid, and his voice has the same pitch, whatever he says, the lead actress has a facial expression that's never enough change, the plot is completely segmented into bits with perhaps a single connector, the movie within the movie idea must be outdated as Paleolithic rocks ... would that be enough? <br /> <br /> I regretted every moment I saw this movie. A walk with the dog is a far superior entertainment for this incredibly lame movie. It's as if an action was directed by Fran√ßois Truffaut of Dick Cheney ... <br /> <br /> Brazil, some other classic SF films? You really have to make a joke ...
