A few children start a theater to make a horror movie for the whole night. During the night, however, there is someone who kills her bit by bit. Who is it ... and why? I already saw that in the theater in 1991. I was looking forward to it - but boy! It did not work at all. The premise is good, they have a very appealing young cast and some pros like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it does not work. The story does not make sense halfway (this could be due to some major edits before the movie was released), the killings are relatively bloodless (as is done with an R rating), and the killer's demasking was at the end boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's too bad - this movie had potential. With a better script, this could become a great horror movie. It looks like it's mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassing (I heard Stone would not talk about it). I give a 3 and that's just for the cast.
