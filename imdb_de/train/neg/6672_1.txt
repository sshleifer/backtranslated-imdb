I'm 47 years old and have spent as much of my life as I can remember, a fan of horror and sci-fi movies. Be it dumb, black and white, no budget or big budget. There are only a few of them where I can not find anything to look forward to. That said, I give this movie recognition for good gore and creature effects, but that's all. This is a case of effects over the story. The truth is that we live in a time when there is hardly anything left that was not seen in a horror movie. For a movie of any kind to really be entertained, it must have a good, original story. A good story can overcome bad effects and bad acting, but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie does not even have good acting, just good effects. So, if you can not just talk about the wound, just drop it here.
