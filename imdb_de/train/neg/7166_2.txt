This movie could have been very good, but it is too short. Cheesy special effects and so effective. I could have stopped by if the story was not so bad. If there were more background stories, it would have been better. The plot revolves around a wicked Druid witch associated with this woman who gets migraines. The film keeps on going and never explains anything clear, it just pushes on. Christopher Walken has a role, but, like most of the film, is completely pointless. This film has potential, but it looks like some have been made really bad for a TV movie. I would avoid this movie.
