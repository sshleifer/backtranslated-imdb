When I freed this film from my job along with three other similar films, I looked at it with very low expectations. Now this movie is not bad per se. You get what you pay for. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal and everything you want in a movie. Not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it's not that bad. I would probably never see this movie again. In short, this is the kind of movie that you would either see very late at night on a local TV station that just wants to take some time, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon at a local television station that tried it take some time. Despite the bad acting, clich√© lines and subparer camera work. I did not want to turn off the movie and pretend that it never jumped into my DVD player. The story has often been made in many films. This is no different, not better, not worse. <br /> <br /> Just an average movie.
