The animation in this new show by Peter & the Wolf is excellent, but with 29 minutes the film is terrifying. They should have called it "Peter & the Snails" because everything is moving at a snail's pace. I could not even watch the movie in one session - I had to watch it for 15 minutes, and it was agony. <br /> <br /> Save 30 minutes - do not watch this movie - and you I thank you. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the Oscar nomination committee saw only the first few minutes of the nominees. To vote for the winner in the Best Animated Short (short!) Category, voters unfortunately have to get away with it all. I'm so sorry - and I have to predict that this movie will not lead to winning in any case.
