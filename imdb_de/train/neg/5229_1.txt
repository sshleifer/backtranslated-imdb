We got boring stuff here. His 5-minute shorts are better than this. know why there are only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how long that is still. <br /> <br /> The plot is sort of ... eh ... the last half hour is fine, the rest is boring and not funny = (I had my hopes the trailer made it look funny, but that Tempo here The movie is pretty slow and sadly not funny, just boring klaymen running into each other trying to make us laugh ... does not work. <br /> <br /> Maybe next time knox <br / > <br /> Maybe re-cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing, but right now it's just not good.
