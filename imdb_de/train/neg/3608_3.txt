I have a nice collection of movies and this one has been added. Number 274 to be exact. <br /> <br /> The title brought me first. Splatter University. I thought that would be a great horror movie. Was I ever wrong? Do not get me wrong, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been a lot better. I love all the movies, but this movie was more of a laugh than a fear. <br /> <br /> Poor audio quality, poor drama and bad beat placement are some of the areas that could be improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The movie is perfect for a good laugh. If you are looking for one of these movies to make fun of, then this is one!
