Why do I watch such films? - Apart from some erroneously misguided masochistic beliefs, one day I will find a true gem among all these cinders. I can not find a good reason for it. This film was slag from beginning to end - but half as funny slag. Where else, except in a bad Italian dubbed movie, could there be a heated exchange of surreal, mutilated English like this, between a straightforward military type and the sinister boss of a secret X-Files organization dedicated to hiding "The Truth"? Dedicated to: <br /> <br /> Man in Black: Silence is best for us until we can prove that the UFOs have no martial motives. <br /> <br /> Military Type: In any case, I find your interference improper. <br /> <br /> Man in Black: Whoever has to impose his will is. <br /> I've rewound the DVD a good half a dozen times (you know what I mean), and I still can not make those lines mean something sensible. My other favorite line was: <br /> <br /> "We can be pretty tough on those who disagree with our interests." It's English Jim, but not as we know it. <br /> <br /> The other highlights of this boring Plonker of a film for me were the completely spaced acting of the photographer character. Saddled with the worst hair cut of all time in history, the man wandered around like a stunned fish in a bad wig until he was kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of perspex plexiglass. The aliens are most effectively not seen as a POV shot - hand-held camera with fisheye lens - the first time a little scary, but used over and over again, it lost its power (by chance, when it comes to a point-of-view shot that for some reason the aliens always go backwards out of the rooms). <br /> <br /> The film was filmed in England. This meant that the Spanish Italian set designers had a few English cars with British number plates and a Union Jack on the press card of our hero had set ... and that's it. No other attempt to make it look like in the UK. <br /> <br /> Favorite moment? When the Foley artists did not notice that characters were following them (is there such a word?), They stopped walking on gravel, now they were in the meadow, making their feet loud "Crunch! Crunch!" Other than that, another drop of 90 minutes of my life. I hope they prove that these UFOs will soon have no martial motives ...
