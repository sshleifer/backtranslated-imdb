To anticipate this review, I have to say that I was a bit curious about this movie. I probably would not have seen it if I had not twisted my arm easily In my opinion, this movie shows how corrupted a man can be. In my view, the worst part of this Springer phenomenon is not the kind of people acting in the "Jerry Springer Show" the way they do (which in itself is reproachful), but that many people are so curious and excited to see them and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose that includes me ... to whatever extent it is true). If we do not glorify this kind of behavior (as some might say), we could at least subtly spoil our minds and / or disturb ourselves for that kind of behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soapbox (sort of). Here's the skinny: The film has a rating of R, and although he may have just earned that (I've looked away some scenes, so I'm not sure), I feel that an NC-17 (tip of the hat on the other reviewer) could be a bit more appropriate for the immense sexual content (a cynic might say that the movie was just a great excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very bizarre and combines the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks who will be appearing on various jumper shows. In the end, the film remains with some determination and Springer rhetoric about the need to see the real world (obviously seen through its show). I agree with him there - it's important to know how the world really is, so we can look for positive change. Let me tell you that the world in a newpaper looks pretty bad or the news to see that, but do not spend good money to support the kind of sensationalistic and perhaps formula-based title education Springer wants to give us ,
