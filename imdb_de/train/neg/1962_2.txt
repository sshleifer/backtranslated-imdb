The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that the one who made it could make a sequel. <br /> <br /> "The Tooth Fairy" was terrible from start to finish. It seemed like a malfunctioning children's movie that got confused, with a "Wizard of Oz" melting and happy kids ending up being combined with bad blood effects and swearing, besides being comfortably there to be murdered in some way become. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise, the Aura reader and Mrs. McDonald, has no point in the movie - they could have included her in the main plot for some interesting side stories, but apparently could not bother. The people who watch the movie know the characters are there for a bloody death scene, but they come, at least TRY, and have a slight conspiracy for them. The story is generally weak with unpredictable behaviors of the characters that evoke the desire that they all be eaten up by the witch movie ends up being a complete failure.
