I have a question for those who have thought of this idea. Why? What made her make a second movie out of it? When memory serves, Cinderella did not end with "They all lived happily ever after"? I'm pretty sure it was, or it was implied. Wait a minute, if everyone lived happily after, how could there be a sequel? Unless they tried to make history's most boring history, there could be no sequel. I mean, they could let Cinderella sing about nonsense for two hours, but why? A movie that ends with "Happy Ever After" can not have a sequel. If so, then do not live happily afterwards! Something must go wrong, which causes problems with the first end! Why? That's not right, it's evil. This is my last word in this matter.
