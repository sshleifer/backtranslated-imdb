OK, so after watching this animated movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes of my life, here's the basic summary: Genius Comes from the Ghetto Boom Box, giving this kid with shaggy hair 3 wishes that wasted child his wishes, I forget what shaq sucks on rap and I think that's it. <br /> <br /> So I laughed mainly, I cried ...... but mostly I laughed about the scraper comedy, which came from the actor's wonderful acting skills nba player / rapper and boy with shaggy hair. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie for college kids who drink beer with their close friends and need a serious laugh. <br /> <br /> I will give him 3 out of 10, only b / c the movie is based on 3 magical wishes. <br /> <br /> If I had 3 wishes, it would be to erase that awful movie And for anyone pretending to be Hollywood, she wasnt wasting any money on it.
