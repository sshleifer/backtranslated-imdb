Pretty bad movie offers nothing new. The usual creaking and moaning tries to catch up with a jumbled yet slender story. Acting is barely above pathetic. Why Liam Neeson signed up for it can not be said. Owen Wilson really shows one of the worst performances in recent horror movie history. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun, and not much else, although Lili Tayor has done an above-average job. The special effects were quite memorable and the house itself was stunning and breathtakingly gorgeous. However, you can not make up for the bad acting and the plot that seems to be thrown together at the last minute. Do not bother.
