This is a typical belated universal horror film: it is technically conditional if it matches the numbers, with a cookie plotter plot and some serious overreactions. The most interesting part of this film is the stunt casting by Rondo Hatton, a man with a bone disease as the movie's "monster". It is sad to see how this man is exploited, but he probably took good advantage of the money they paid him. Hatton is less terrible than the studio hoped, as I often felt sorry for fear or even disgust. Martin Koslack is on board as a crazy artist of the film and he is very amusing in this part. I enjoy seeing Koslack in almost everything; for some reason, the man amuses me. The only other part of the film that entertained me is the film's absurd attitude to the art world. Here are shown us evil art critics who rave about their ability to break artists; This is next to the male "hero" of the movie, who is an "artist" who paints ... gets these ... pin-up girls. Somehow the work of our hero is checked side by side with the absurdist sculpture of the villager. Amusing is also the nasty critic of the film, who once claimed to despise the hero's pin-up art because "such women do not exist," to which our heroine responds with the assurance that the critic just does not come out enough. Finally, there is a small subplot about the domestication of the heroine (who is herself an art critic) by the leading man ... absolutely anti-feminist and ridiculous to testify. Overall, this movie is a rather mediocre picture with some amusing elements.
