And I mean ultralight. There are four big stars in this movie, about three and a half jokes and nothing more. <br /> <br /> There's really not much to say about this stinker, besides that, even though he does have some really good bits, most of it is not very funny. It also does not work as romance. How about a romantic comedy? Not in your life. Most dialogues are far too shallow to be sophisticated, and less amusing. This film could have been so much more, especially given the recent focus on some fake ways in which to promote movies, including false citation from critics. The film reveals the undeveloped territory of the press junket - all these paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews. But instead of exploring what a joke should be, it devotes itself to this area every three minutes, following the movie's lame romance. <br /> <br /> The same goes for Catherine Zeta-Jones. Character - the whinny, self-centered movie star. Zeta-Jones is doing a good job with what she has given, but she has given practically nothing. It's all homogenized garbage that looks very pale compared to some of the things we've heard about stars over the years. In the end, it's hard to understand what made Zeta-Jones and Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign on board this fate ship, which sinks like a repeat of "The Love Boat". As the old joke says, they forgot the script and filmed the deal. It would probably make a better story. So, tell us, filmmaker, what do you have about those stars who made them appear in this movie?
