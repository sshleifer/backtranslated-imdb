Who I No, I'm not kidding. So it is actually on the video case. <br /> <br /> plot; Abstract: Pretty woman stands around and smiles. For some reason, all men kill themselves. <br /> <br /> "Find Ariel ... Where's Ariel ... Can not find Ariel ..." She's right behind you, you idiot .... <br /> <br /> Most of what can be said about this dreadful little space opera has already been said, looks like. <br /> <br /> A bunch of crazy actors, who mainly play convicts, come after the first The selection of actors is knocked off very quickly. Then they are knocked off in the same way. Each scene is sent almost fifteen minutes in advance. Maybe it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most time and bigger paychecks. The alien virus / hologram / VR, the / Glitch seems to be physically powerless and does not do anything. Why can not she just stay in the computer instead of carrying out her "teleporting vampire" routine? (Actually, it would have been more interesting if she had been a vampire or done more than just looking around and looking at people, which is all she ever does, that's enough to make all men kill each other. .) <br /> <br /> This is not really a space strip. There are far more shots of the old Western Trail, the Easy Rider Trail of the 1950s, the movie nightclub scene of Film Noir, even a jog on the beach in Fantasyland, none of which is really deep or makes any sense at all. Of course the nightclub scene is black and white. Worked with "The Wizard of Oz". Does not work so well here. This is probably a good thing, as those few shots they show off the room are depressingly stupid. You'll probably cry during these moments, especially if you see the swirling "spaceship" that looks about three inches long. <br /> <br /> Nothing is felt for the characters, not because they are convicts or not because of their personality, but because they are serious about acting, with the exception of Billy Dee Williams, who looks really depressed and helpless that he is in this work ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that, when viewed with friends, will cause extremely "loud" silence, especially if the nerd is trying on a comic -Elserilers (including the line about kissing a meteor with French ...) out of the way ... Did I hear that? Right? Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The original virtual reality girls are "killed", which means nothing, since they are not even real. Well, the other "characters" are not, but that does not matter. Haha. <br /> <br /> What's weird is that the scene gracing the video case is a kind of skull horror alien thing (green filter added to give it more ... ..) green look), which is actually the Android, after it was killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else. <br /> <br /> Another weird deal I noticed. If there is an explosion (at least on my cheap DVD copy), everything will be very pixelated. I do not mean a bit pixelated, I mean HUGE blocks, which are about 1/16 of the size of the screen. Impressive.
