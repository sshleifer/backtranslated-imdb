I saw this movie and the others. Trinity is my name and I think it's worse than the first. I have no idea why they ever made another movie, it was stupid and pointless to say that I have them all. I have played through it several times and it still drives me to turn off the movie after 5 minutes. I like Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie just drove me to the wall. If it had another plot, or at least more plot and more comedy, it might have been funnier and worth the $ 5 I spent on buying all the movies. But you are making mistakes, so I would say that you should save your money and do not kill this movie or those that belong to it.
