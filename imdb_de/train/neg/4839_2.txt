... and be bigger than ever. I do not make any direct references or anything here, but to say the least, this movie is pathetic. If you are military trained, you should not watch. I put it on the DVD with two friends who want to see some interesting action / war movie. Why could not I read the reviews first? <br /> <br /> Already in the first "bomb" scene the movie has big mishaps, and they are showing more and more and getting bigger. My two friends, who were in no way affiliated with the military, discovered the mistakes of the filmmaker almost as fast as I did and wondered if some of the things were realistic. Well, as you may have guessed, they are not at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you can overlook these totally idiotic and repetitive mistakes. 2/10 for my interest first.
