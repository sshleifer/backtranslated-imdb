This series would have been much better if they had done just one simple thing: Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Tree. Diamond Head, the character needs someone who can take on the role of the lovable villain, which McShane has proved with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the actual Diamond Head, is actually just so-so in the role. McShane is not really as good as the evil tree. France Nuyen's character, Tso-Tsing, does not seem to be able to decide whether she is the unfortunate victim or the tough and combative woman. She really deserved her reward when she played the role of Diamond Head's lover. After watching one or two episodes, I did not care about what had happened to anyone. Tree gives us a lot to hate him, but Diamond Head gives us nothing to like him. Unfortunately, the espionage genre in the seventies was not quite as it was in the sixties.
