This film is a rather strange mix of musical, romantic, drama and crime with a hint of film noir. It's basically a messy bunch of different genres, none of which really works as it should. <br /> <br /> This movie is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to be taken more seriously as an actor. He is a former child star who used to play fun comic and music productions at the beginning of his career. In this film he chooses a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the film). But his role is actually pretty ridiculous in the movie. I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? He is an extremely small, boyish-looking man. He was already in his thirties at the time of this film, but he looks seriously more like a 16-year-old. To hear him say babe to women and to hear him talk hard with gangsters about three times his size does not look good and does not feel right. He simply does not convince in his role. <br /> <br /> Because the film mixes so many different genres, the story really feels chaotic. There's a crime in there, and somewhere in there is a romantic act and one of it, to live your dream, but none of it really works because of the messy approach and dealing with it all. It's just not an interesting or captivating movie. László Kardos is also a director who has made only 10 films in his life, although his career lasted from 1935 to 1957. He must have been a rigorous director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead was provided in a less script during one. His films are all unknown and usually not too high quality. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget that this is a 1950s movie, but it feels more like a 1940s film, or maybe even a 1930s movie. Of course, this is mainly due to the fact that this film was shot in black and white. In general, 1950s black and white films often have a cheap feel, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty weird sight when Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his band even perform together in an order. It was not the only movie in which Armstrong appeared, and he often appeared in such films, often as himself. I think jazz lovers can still enjoy this movie a bit because of his music, since he's pretty much in that movie is available. The film received an Oscar nomination for the best original song. <br /> <br /> A clumsy little movie and excursion by Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
