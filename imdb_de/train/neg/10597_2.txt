This movie was absolutely terrible. I can not imagine anything good. The action holes were so big that you could drive a lobster through them. The acting was so amazingly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and that says a lot !!! And dialogue, what dialogue? To think that I was a fan of the first one (I use this comment loosely, he is more of a guilty pleasure than anything else). This movie had Goldberg for loud crying !!!! Nothing good can come of this film. What makes the movie even worse is that it's so bad that you can not even look at it with a few friends it makes fun of !!! That must be in my top 5 worst movies ever. 2/10 because it's so hard for me to give a 1
