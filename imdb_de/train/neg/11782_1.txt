The Danish movie "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me as the worst movie I have seen so far. I did not think I would be able to beat my list of bad B movies, but he deserves the gold. It is not funny. It is badly played, it is filmed badly and the plot is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has three girls. I truly believe that this film has the potential to knock on the other Danish film "Stjerner uden hjerner" as the worst Danish movie ever made! And that's really something. Congratulations in advance!
