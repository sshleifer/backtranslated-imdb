Follow the same path as most sequels. The first one was great. Secondly, the average was average, and this movie was full of bad drama and some stupid dialogues and a lot of suspicion of disbelief. This movie was weak. Too predictable and I just could not stand this Henry Wrinkler - like the boss with that stupid eye, so much more could have been done with it. I really liked the first one. I wish they had gone more in that direction than what they had done here. <br /> <br /> There was too much inexplicable, what had to be explained, what time it was and why, why, why? old-fashioned phone in this room? <br /> <br /> I understand that there is another work in progress. <br /> <br /> Blah!
