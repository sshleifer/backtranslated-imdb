The movie opens with a fascinating scene, three people drinking and chatting in a bar. All make some outrageous stories. As the movie develops, it turns out that the most outrageous story is true. Apart from that, the movie is not very interesting, except for the scene in the bar and the scene where the main secret is revealed. This revelation is barely half the time in the movie and, frankly, not much to see. The rest of the time is the director in a godforsaken Russian village full of pathetic and scary old ladies. Sure, these are fascinating and a bit shocking pictures, but admiring the pictures takes far too long and sacrifices every possible plot or character development. I found this film another example of either lousy or lazy filmmaking, where filmmakers, instead of trying to make an interesting story, focus on strange, intriguing images and leave the audience in a few, almost incoherent stories (case study: Butcher's Tale), to find out all the circumstances. It looks artistically on the surface, but in this case it is nothing more than a lack of talent.
