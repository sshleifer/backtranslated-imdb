There is a scene in the beginning after a shooting in which horses are running. If you notice something red, it's because a white van is parked behind a bush on the trail. I thought I saw bad, but that's it. A white van in a western. Did not you understand that? Well, and I paid top dollar for the rental. It will make you grab your friends and put them all in 10 giants and make a better movie. The conversation was so slow, the acting was mostly OK, but could not be taken seriously because of the bad way of filming. The sheriffs have a door that looks like a door today, with the special trim. I say, watch this movie and bring Cabin Boy to # 2 of the worst of times.
