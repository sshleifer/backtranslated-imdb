I ordered this extremely rare and highly overvalued film on Ebay with very high expectations. I think I paid about $ 50 for this movie. As a perennial fan of horror, from cheesy American slashers from the '80s to European zombie movies, I told myself this would be great! I can not tell you how wrong I was. Most of all, I thought it would be a lot wilder than it actually is. After all that I had heard about this movie, I was almost afraid to look at it. The murders are boring. Acting ... forget it, there is no acting! The story is unbelievably bad, even if we do not care. It seems they've been trying to get your attention with a few weird sexual scenes and naked girls, but in that case, unfortunately, it does not help the movie. Why? There's no atmosphere, and that's the worst thing about this movie. It's just bad filmmaking from point A to point B. Although it's extremely funny and amusing to watch with friends and many beers, you should make every effort to get hold of it. There are so many movies in the world, do not waste your time looking at Necro files!
