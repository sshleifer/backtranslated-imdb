My boyfriend and I rented it because we thought it might be a good start to Halloween. A murderer terrorizing young people, a white mask ... you get my drift. We were absolutely wrong! No pun intended. Not only have we discovered one of the worst movies, but also that it is a cult classic! It is filled with potholes and makes no sense. The actress Maddy plays is pretty, but that's about it. I acknowledge that it was filmed on a VERY low budget - I always support such films. But not this particular one. <br /> <br /> This movie may be good to see if you are drunk or tall; Otherwise do not bother Unless you want to lose your movie privileges like me!
