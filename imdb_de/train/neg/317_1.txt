That had to be the worst movie I've ever seen. For the first 15 minutes, there was nothing that interested me about this movie. I was on holiday at that time and had plenty of time to choose a movie that was just for fun. The apartment we stayed in had this movie in stock - you must have bought it from the $ 1 store or something. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, it's not like any other movie he's made. It started with a bad premise and then only got worse. There is nothing funny even remotely. <br /> <br /> I watched a lot of movies, including some that I did not care about. But if you decide to waste your time on this film, do not say I did not warn you.
