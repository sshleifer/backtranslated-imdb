For the first time in years, I felt the need to log into IMDb today to cleanse myself of this film by writing a review because it was just a disappointment. The action sounded great as I read it, expecting a minimal mystery thriller, a claustrophobic phantom hunt. Unfortunately, everything is just so tortured by a boring, tedious love story and too many thoughtful and crisp stupid "nobody-says-things-like-this-except-bad-movies" dialogues. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief outline of the worst offenses of this movie: <br /> <br /> - The script is so much dependent on coincidences and the inexplicable and inexplicable stupidity of the movie's main characters that it's just ridiculous is. No, actually it is annoying. And lazy. <br /> <br /> - Related: Cheap thrill. A long parade "just in time" moments. <br /> <br /> - The main characters. It seems as if the scriptwriter has never seen people in real life, but has gained all his knowledge from bad movies. Therefore, his characters are boring, lifeless clich√©s of the second generation. They are mere guides, placeholders without the slightest bit of personality. They are "man and woman in separation, who still love each other". I have never seen it, except in 100,000 movies and it does not become more realistic or entertaining. Think of the boldest two-dimensional Hollywood dishes and you have it. There is not a single character in this film that is fresh, charming or interesting even remotely. <br /> <br /> - The far-fetched, vague resolution, which is very bad and just needed a momentum to break the word "resolution" could not fit here, because the movie is a swampy mess that's not going anywhere anyway goes. When you're done, it does not bother you anymore. The last third of the movie I just rewound, because it was just unbearable to see. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's it. Whatever the redemptive functions of this film have, everything is buried under incompetence. Do not look at this crap.
