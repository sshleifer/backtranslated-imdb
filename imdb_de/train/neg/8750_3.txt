Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring filmmaker, lives in a battered flat in New York City and relies on his mother for his rent. He has a nice neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals), who may be married or not, but Aldolpho would like to star in his movie. When Al unexpectedly receives a financial pledge for his film from a stranger named Joe, he thinks he made it. That is, until Joe takes Al on an adventure to steal a Porsche for part of the financial support. Will the movie be made before Aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone? And will Angelica star in the movie? This is a horrible movie in the eyes of the beholder. The script is miserable, with an action that wanders involuntarily. Beals growls almost all her lines and Buscemi is sympathetic, but inconspicuous. There is a lot of unpleasant material and unappetizing characters. Finally, the production values ​​are very bad, so that the film is secondary at any time. If you have time, it is still a good idea to take no risks with this film. But if you're the proverbial glutton of punishment, look at that damned thing. Beals looks nice.
