I rely on my observations of an episode I saw last night (27.9.06). I do not think I'll watch again. The acting was totally wooden, the plot totally predictable, the end completely unrealistic - I mean, who would believe a $ 30 million judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer? The lead actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable that he almost felt embarrassed in his role - maybe he realized how bad the writing was !! I am fully aware that the drama offered this season is pretty bad, but you can certainly find better writers. Maybe you outsource the letter to India or China !! I bet we will not see it again next season!
