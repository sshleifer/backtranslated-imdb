Having read the other comments on this film, I would like to share my own view that this is a difficult movie if you are not a total Brooksophile. I am not. <br /> <br /> When viewed by a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that offers us more indefinite neurosis than can be absorbed in a single session. It's pretty hard to look at. The Brooks character (Robert Cole) is so unsympathetic and uncomfortable that it is difficult to contact him. And he should NEVER make a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context. No man could have so much exposed foliage and should put on a baby like Kathryn Harrold - unless he is Albert Brooks in a staged production by Albert Brooks Romance "has its amusing moments ----- but they are fragmentary and rare.

I tell you ----- there is enough pain in the world without finding it in a movie intended for entertainment.
