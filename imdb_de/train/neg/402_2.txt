To call this film garbage is unfair. At least turning down rubbish can be an exciting hobby. This strip was neither exciting nor entertaining. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon can behave brilliantly in the face of the opportunity, so no doubt an IRS bill had to be taken when he agreed on this terrible screenplay. The crazy scientist story of 'Hollow Man' has been narrated earlier, better narrated and narrated, without having to resort to so many ridiculously expensive special effects. Most of these special effects seem to be the transparent anatomical dolls for men, women and dogs that you could buy in the early seventies. In the UK, they were marketed as "The Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)", where they may have been awarded the title for this film. Clever special effects, dark script, nonexistent plot. <br /> <br />
