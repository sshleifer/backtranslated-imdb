This movie was hard to come by and when I finally saw it, the disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man exploits the unsuspecting aviation industry and gets away with millions of ransom money without hurting anyone or beating up the attempt. With all this built-in interest, how could anyone in this real life make such a dull and talkative film. While Williams is always interesting, the scriptwriters assumed that the D.B. Cooper Persona was stereotypically heroic as a movie star, and we get a guy - with no captivating details or insights into the mind of a person who dare enough and clever enough to make it. Harrold practically steals the movie with her sperm and sheer beauty, but the real downer was the handling of the plot and the lame direction. Too bad that this movie even exists.
