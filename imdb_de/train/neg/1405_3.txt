"A Damsel in Distress" is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals. But even in Astaire's bad movies, there were always good moments. <br /> <br /> In "Damsel", Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal performance tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress who jumps into a taxi he takes to escape a mob of admirers. Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into marriage by her wealthy aunt. He tries to rescue her from her family's country home, but soon discovers that the house staff is placing bets with which the admirer marries Lady Alice. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), the baffling butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the daring house boy, take turns sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. <br /> <br /> This musical has many problems. First, there is the plot based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who wrote the script). The story is slow, painful and nerve-wracking. If Fred does not dance, we endure endless annoying scenes in which (a) Fred Joan connects Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert are kidding each other and each other. <br /> <br /> The butler and the house boy are particularly annoying. These are one-dimensional stick-villain characters, the kind of people you just want to put in your mouth. They wished they would leave the screen and let Fred dance. Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster actress in this movie and is miscast in a musical. Apart from her pretty face and her beautiful smile, she has little to offer for her. George Burns and Gracie Allen are there as Jerry's publicist and his sombre secretary. The duo adds some much-needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she's also sometimes annoying. <br /> <br /> The director of George Stevens' film is not well done. Sometimes the cinematography is terrible and out of focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes on extremely foggy streets to convince the audience of London, not Hollywood. (You must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) The songs of George and Ira Gershwin, who have become classics, are to be noted positively. And of course, the dancing in the film is extraordinary, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But the music and dance numbers are badly used and badly staged. Sometimes the performers seem to sing and dance, because it's time to start singing and dancing. The music numbers seem to be arbitrarily inserted into the intricate plot. (At one point, the butler steps out of the mansion and breaks into an operetta solo for no apparent reason.) The numbers include:  "I'm dancing and I can not disturb myself now" - Fred dances well on a busy, busy London street. With a rolled-up umbrella he makes a great "cane" - but the number ends too soon as Fred jumps into a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical "Crazy For You," Harry Groener has significantly improved this number with a group of choral girls.) <br /> <br />  "Put me to the test" - Fred, George and Gracie make a trio Dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie adapt to Fred step by step, but the number ends badly, and all come together for no reason. <br /> <br />  "Stiff Upper Lip" (Fun House Number) - In an amusement park house, Fred, George and Gracie dance on the spinning floor, spinning and turning with the mirrors of the house. It's the best number of the movie, but it is sometimes repeated a bit. <br /> <br />  "Things are looking up" - Fred and Joan Fontaine dance together in the movie and dance around the back woods of the manor house. Luckily, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer. <br /> <br />  "A foggy day in London Town" - Fred wanders through the misty manor house at night and sings about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. Sometimes it seems that he is not sure which direction he is going into the fog - similar to the musical number itself. <br /> <br /> "Nice Work If You Get It" - A great song gets abused in the movie. During a social event in the mansion, Fred is attracted to a chorus of sinister singers who sing this song at random. Every time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he was leaving. (Again, Harry Groener played a better dance number with "Crazy For You.")  "Drum Dance Number" - As Fred and Joan struggle, Fred has to make one last tap dance number while hitting a group of drums. As always, it's a great dance number. But it is absolutely not necessary, except to extend the movie. <br /> <br /> The most invented moment in the movie comes when Fred decides to jump from a high stone balcony in the manor to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. When he jumps up from the balcony, he finds a conveniently placed trapeze - that's right, a * trapeze * - hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or better a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the harness and swings to the ground. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth having on DVD just for the dance numbers, but you feel obligated to the guy who invented the fast-forward button on your remote. With the >> FF button you can jump through the other boring scenes in the movie to get to the dance numbers.
