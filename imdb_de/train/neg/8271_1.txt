"Pretty guys with bad haircuts !!" "Beautiful girls without hints !!" "Stupid gangsters who can not shoot directly !!" From the Dragon Dynasty comes the Hong Kong gangster drama "Dragon Heat". For reasons that will probably be completely hidden forever, the production and the casting call this film "criminals on steroids". Maggie Q and Michael Biehn had to somehow register as villains. But they do not have much to do in this terrible slug festival. <br /> <br /> They are two of the best contemporary actors, each with their own CV and list of accomplishments, and Biehn in particular had the courage to take some pretty challenging and non-heroic roles. Maggie Q was the evil "May" in "Live Free or Die Hard", so 'nuff. <br /> <br /> Of course, Biehn is known to be the soldier of the future, who made "The Terminator" of 1984 a credible science fiction / fantasy trump by overthrowing Big Arnold now the Governor of California !! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn is almost wasted in this terrible train accident of a police drama. There is absolutely no reason to do so because the incredibly confused conspiracy - which is mostly in Chinese as it is a Hong Kong story - could have been better crafted for non-Chinese viewers with a foreign spokesman. <br /> <br In other words, if Biehn had been used as an Interpol observer or coordinator or as an agent in deep secrecy and given some splashing every five or ten minutes, that would have been great. But no, he was hired as part of a strange group of special unit villains who seem to be making their own corrupt deal freelance in the midst of another corrupt deal by another involving the local king of corrupt business. <br /> <br /> Yes, I said everything. Confused? Me too. "Welcome to the party, buddy." <br /> <br /> In the truly outstanding Hong Kong Crime Drama, known as the Breaking News, some fascinating characters are just one action in the storyline. <br /> <br /> Bad guys against good policemen. In this wretched and overly violent foray into the world of a Hong Kong triad or gait, it seems that the sharp police are little more than a duck parade in a shooting gallery as the criminals mow them down. <So it is not surprising that there is an almost incomprehensible scene (actually several scenes) in which children want to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game to win stuffed animal prizes. And so the officers of the Hot Shot Good Guy group naturally use them for them, so the arcade owner has to give up the Kewpie dolls. <br /> <br /> There is also a halfhearted attempt to create a "love" interest between one of the "visiting policemen" and the only female "visiting policewoman". <br /> <br /> The visiting police are said to be essential witnesses against the Triad gangster leader being kidnapped on the way to his husband's court appearance, but not by his own team, but by the mercenaries (Biehn, Maggie Q, and some others) .Those killers all want something, but we can not do it until the It was a stupid mistake throughout the story. <br /> <br /> In a crime drama, you can not build tension without getting, getting or getting away very early It also features some cut-away scenes for purely artistic effects that show all the evil and bad guys of the past, and any movie fan can easily understand why this one barking Hun d is receiving a rating from this fan of all things cinematic with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong.
