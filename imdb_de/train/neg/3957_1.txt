The original Boogeyman was a stupid but entertaining supernatural Slasher movie. It was by no means a great movie, but fun in the right setting. The third part of this series, Return of the Boogeyman, is terrible. It consists of two things. First, cheap and lifeless new material. Second: LOADS of recycled bits from the first movie. The new material is incredibly amateurish, but not weirdly inappropriate, just unbelievably boring. This material was clearly beaten quickly and effortlessly. It serves as a frame for the endless clips of the first (and possibly second) films. And, boy, milk those clips from the earlier movies; Sometimes sequences are used over and over again. The only innovation in these parts is a voice that senselessly describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience of seeing this is truly mind-boggling. The return of Boogeyman is an example of the worst kind of exploitation film. the kind that exploits the audience in a most cynical way. I would like to keep this review short and to the point, because this movie deserves nothing more. There is nothing of value here at all. That is worthless.
