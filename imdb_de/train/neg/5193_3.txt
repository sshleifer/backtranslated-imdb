Another action movie / adventure movie from the Quinn Martin Productions factory. Roy Thinnes plays the undercover agent Diamond Head (Mr. Head, for you). He works for his G-Man dealer "Aunt Mary" and is looking for "Tree" who is on a mission ... well, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> This one earns and has received the full MST3K shipment. As the guys and several reviewers have pointed out, the movie "Fargo" had more Hawaiian locations than this movie. The film was apparently filmed on a modest budget and shows Hawaii's broken dive shops, gas stations and cheap hotels. Zulu - later to be seen as Kono in Hawaii-Five-O - appears as Thinnes' chunky, clumsy buddy, while France Nguyen portrays the Jenny Craig diet as a terrible mistake. Others who share the flickering screen are a drunken Richard Harris knockoff, a George Takai imitator, a not-so-smart hitman with sprayed saber-trousers and the villain "Tree" wearing a British veddy accent. You can find out the plot pretty well after half the biases, but relax - just enjoy the dizzying mediocrity of this 70s week movie. <br /> <br /> Whenever I think about this movie (and I often think of this movie), I catch myself humming the theme, written for flute and tuba ... no one knows why. Trivia - Diamond Head was led by Jeannot Szwarc, one of three contract directors at Universal, who would later shoot much larger films, in his case Jaws 2. The others were John Badham (War.) Games) and a young man named Steven Spielberg ...
