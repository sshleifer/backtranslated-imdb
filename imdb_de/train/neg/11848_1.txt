What is meant to be a simple generic mystery conspiracy with a dead philanthropist is indeed a headache that evokes the story of a number of characters (the only great actor is Ginger Rogers in a very early role) murderers under a small cast of Residents in a noble residential house. These characters range from completely stupid to downright mean. Since this is a cheap, low-budget production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and her captain (a guy who does not care who he is because he's really shitty) while constantly talking about his different ones Ways to solve the crime speaks of an absurd detective with his head cut off in the butt. Honestly, I've never had a worse time watching an old B-rate movie of this type, and I've seen some real head slappers. Oh, and the butler did not do it because there was no butler. But watch out for the man closest to a butler. Here we go. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
