The film had a lot of potential, unfortunately it was torn apart due to a weak / implausible plot, miscarriages and general content / content. One of the obvious mistakes was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab, did not know how to pronounce his own Arabic name! This seems to be a small mistake, but indicates that there is little effort to pay attention to details. The quality of action was consistently well below average. <br /> <br /> Movies only salvation was the twist in the plot at the very end; and a French song (I do not remember the title). Overall, it was a pretty bad movie in which Sean Connery visibly failed.
