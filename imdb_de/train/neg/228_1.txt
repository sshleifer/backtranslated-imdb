I thought it was a New York-based movie: wrong! It is a small British landscape. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama ... Well, until the last third, because according to history "abrakadabrantesque" is the symbolic word for a French presidential mandate. It almost nonsense, even if the motives want to convey a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What else do I have? Maybe a good duo of actress: Yes, I know, they're three friends, but the red-haired cop is a bit invisible to me. The tall doctor surprises by her stroke, and McDowell delivers as always a fine, gentle and almost mute behavior. This gentleness confuses me, because as other artists or directors the same pattern repeats itself over and over again. In her case it is like in any movie, it is always the same character, defined by her feelings, her values, that lives an infinite number of different stories. I still do not know how to set the limit (or merge) between the artists and the works. <br /> <br /> Another positive side of this film is the feminine touch and the interesting different perspectives. The women each have their own way of life, even if they are all alone. There is a lot of tolerance and willingness to learn to see how the same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as human beings. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie is pretty visible, but the big end leaves you wanting a next vision.
