I blindly bought this movie and am quite angry that I have paid as much as I have, but I would say it is worth it at least for cool deaths and laughable plays. It's not a good movie in any way, but I have to say I was damn entertaining. I think it might be called so-bad-it-good. <br /> <br /> As I said, acting is awful. I feel like I could have done a better job, at least showing emotions. The story is nothing new and has been made better. I guess I have only one weakness for any movie that is in demand by the carnival. I would say rent or download, but definitely not buy. It is not worth more than a clock.
