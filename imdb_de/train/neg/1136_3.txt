Any thirties movie is outdated, but if you were just watching John Ford movies, it would be outdated rather than seeing others. The Grand Hotel is a comparatively modern melodrama. At Ford, there is always the hard sell of a nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always the overemphasis of something heavy. Always the poorly designed, unwieldy and obvious scripts. This is no exception. It's just a pretty thoughtful device to convey feelings. And the feeling is everything that has it all. <br /> <br /> What Ford does here does not make me appreciative of Lincoln, I just wonder how the states were ever populated by idiots of the population pictured here. Ford went on to make decent movies. This is too old to be anything but bad. It feels completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre. And nobody from Illinois would pronounce the following "S" or "Shonuff!"
