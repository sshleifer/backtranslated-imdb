If you want to know what kind of music white people heard in 1974, this is the movie for you. But you also have to hear a lot of flutes and violins (see my comments on My Girl 1). <br/> <br /> Indulgent Approval: I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance. just seen his predecessor. But as an adoptive father, who was preparing to search for my birth mother, My Girl 2 asked me to search for mother. <br /> <br /> In other words, all I like about My Girl 2 had nothing to do with My Girl 2, but to do with a protagonist who, like so many adopters, asks, "who is my mom"? And if there are home videos of my mother in a drama group, I'll be sure that I make a movie about it. <br /> <br /> The people are listless. Films should not be listless. My Girl 2 (like My Girl 1) is just ... listless. <br /> <br /> Avoid, unless you are a complete juice that consoles with a series of small annoyances.
