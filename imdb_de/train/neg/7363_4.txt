The only reason I saw "shakedown" was that Erika Eleniak was in it. She is sexy as always, but she plays second fiddle behind Captain Wolf Larson. Too bad, because she has more action skills than she is allowed to show here. The movie consists mostly of endless shootouts that quickly become drab - especially if you see the bad guys who are armed with machine guns and have Larson constantly missing, and that he's only armed with a revolver (NEVER runs out of bullets) and they all get out pretty easily. The earthquake effects are decent, but there is also a lot of motion blur and bad CGI explosions. As a psychotic "spiritual leader," Ron Perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious hocus-pocus that he has to spit out is just boring. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (assuming he has some) might want to take a look at it, for others it's hardly worth a rent. (* 1/2)
