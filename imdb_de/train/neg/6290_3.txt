Summary: Ron marries Mel. They are profound and loving and sure they are perfect for each other even though they met only a few months ago. Todd, being Ron's brother-in-law, is not so happy. He is worried that marriage threatens threatening work in the family business and decides to organize Ron's bachelor party. But his real plan is to get Ron into an uncompromising situation, collect evidence, and break up Ron and Mel. <br /> <br /> Comments: Probably a continuation of a comedy classic, but not funny at all. It is mostly an adolescent show and a youthful excuse to show lightly clothed women. In a way, it's almost impressive that you can use many there because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, that's one of the signs of a movie that can not support itself. It just is not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, it has three points to redeem, or three actors worth a better script. It's the lead actor Josh Cooke who actually manages to convey an impression of common sense. Sara Foster, of whom I know, has more talent than such films, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have much more talent than this movie. What is suspiciously absent are good jokes. Actually, bad jokes are also rather rare. It's just not funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
