Wow ... what would you do with $ 33 million? Let me give you a choice; You can either: a) crush it and flush it down; or b) create a film based on Whoopi Goldberg, a stubborn futuristic policeman who works with a rubber dinosaur that uses terms like "I do not have a trumpet" and blows raspberries on the base that this is funny. That's right, you would choose the option that has more value - to flush the toilet down. <br /> <br /> This must be seen to be believed. I can not even find the words to describe how bad this movie is. It does not even fit in the category "so bad - it's good". I actually saw it on television on TV - and while I was looking, I felt the need to get on IMDb and register my disgust. <br /> <br /> Given that Jurassic Park was made a few years ago, how on earth do you think the public would tolerate a guy in a rubber suit for longer? WG should have just run and damn the consequences. All those affected will go to hell because of this criminal waste of money. <br /> <br /> I have to stop writing - I'm about to implode.
