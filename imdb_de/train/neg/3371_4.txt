An incredibly unlikely and stupid potboiler that at least has a redeeming, crisp location photography, but it's too unbelievable to create a lot of suspense. I had somehow hoped that Stanwyck would not make it on time, because she was really nailed together in more ways than anything, husband, and she also had an idiot child. Why not run away with Meeker? But the nagging question remains. What wood was this pillar support when a rotted piece of it did not float? Stanwyck, always impeccably professional, does the best he can with the material, but it's worn out.
