A novel by Remarque. A cast that looks good on paper. A leftist refugee who does not want to stay in Paris between the wars. NCO of a Gestapo officer. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that there are no synergies here. The little things never merge. <br /> <br /> Stories about left refugees in France do not have to be so boring. Read Arthur Koestler's memoir "Scum of the Earth" (if you can find it). Or his chilly "Dialogue With Death" (ditto). <br /> <br /> For me, the only interest in this movie is in some random details. <br /> <br /> Leads drink a lot from calvados, the Norman apple brandy. I welcome any request to drink even a sip of calvados. It certainly made this movie pass faster. According to the film, it is only sold in cheap, inferior sedans. Vive le tabac parisien! That's what I say. There are plenty of hints for intoxicating liquors; That seems to be a concern of the scenarists. <br /> <br /> I like movies being filmed in France because it can be amusing to wait for the inevitable full size alcohol display to appear on a wall in the background. I was not disappointed. This time it was a very unusual choice for Byrrh. This movie would get a rating of 10 if we judged it only by refining its murals. <br /> <br /> The film's indifferent score is by Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known for his opera "The Emperor Jones" based on the O'Neill piece. It premiered around the same time as the movie version with Paul Robeson. The opera survives today in one or two shots of Lawrence Tibbett. But it should reappear soon; There are no longer any potentially marketable operas to be revived. <br /> <br /> Opera seems to be an appropriate topic here, as Charles Boyer's character is among his "Czech" aliases. Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both outstanding roles in German opera. Is that just a coincidence? <br /> <br /> Losing names just seems to be part of this movie. Note that they call "heavenly shock" on the phone. Skystoss is one of the main characters in Remarque's earlier "Everything's quiet on the Western Front". <br /> <br /> Well, the jokes are all there. I think there was no time to develop a drama.
