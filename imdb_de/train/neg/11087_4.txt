American Captain Guy Madison plays a character whose fame precedes him in this spaghetti western. what has very modest references essentially appears to be routine (though there is a good score). The plot is of little interest: the title refers to the way a wounded man who was involved in the murderous raid of shooters on a ranch. the property of her pursuer's family, the cavalry agent Madison. The younger siblings of the latter are determined that the injured party, now under their care, leads them to the responsible gang boss. Ultimately, the identity of one of the two mysterious men a surprise? and both are ironically involved with one of Madison's sisters (another raped during the robbery). The Euro-Cult star Rosalba Neri appears inconspicuously as a saloon hostess and Madison's ex-flame.
