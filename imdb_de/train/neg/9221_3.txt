Everything you need to know about this movie happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid original soundtrack that reflects the late '60s, and unlike a few of its characters, they are unlikely. Once you have received this message, you can also switch to another movie. <br /> <br /> Davies protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who takes care of him. Then, as he follows her advice to accompany her in the real world - instead of living a fantasy film of which he is the imagined director - he does so by pushing her aside and joining an actress, which he idealizes for no reason. A couple laughs and a thoughtful art direction are the only things to be seen here. <br /> <br /> The film is also interesting as a documentation of Jason Schwartzman's fall from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's annoying roughness was something to overcome, but here it is the only quality of his character. Schwartzman's family connection clearly put him in this role. Here we hope that his decisions will improve.
