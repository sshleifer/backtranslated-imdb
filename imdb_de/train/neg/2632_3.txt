It makes me sad to rate a movie with many favorite actors, locations and genres, d. H. Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, DC and political thriller, but "The Sentinel" really hits deep. It was as if they had had a great idea, signed the right cast, made some great city shots, and then went on vacation, leaving the rest of the crew to improvise the rest. And I wish I could blame it for another modest appearance by Basinger (not only do I feel like she's one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I'm still more than a decade later convinced that she's the only one and was definitely the only bad actor in the film to win an acting Oscar for "LA Confidential" but she was not the only problem Sutherland, whom I love as Jack Bauer on "24", plays "Jack" again miss his old 'A Time to Kill' days or 'A Few Good Men' days, Douglas has certainly taken a break from acting and called them here Plot: Someone, a traitor to the secret service, wants to see the president dead and Douglas Will anyone believe him? Actually, no spoiler here: As fast as you have found the subplot halfway, it is over before you know it, and why did someone want the Pr see the president dead? Should this be revealed in the sequel? Too many action holes, too many doors open and never closed, and the "Sentinel" is too predictable. If you only see one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who is familiar with these movie types or has seen just a series of "Law & Order" that you know in the first pictures. Was it terrible? Not really, the camera was good, and although Sutherland played Jack again, he still has it.
