Let me first say that this does not look or feel like a movie. It seems that another television program about popular girls and boys with no real film language is going back up. <br /> <br /> The camera angles are so straightforward that the story is told in the simplest way, without the public getting away Connect with it. This film takes us to where never before has a film been made: to an empire where the movie theater becomes a warm medium conveying to the public all elements of interpretation. Too obvious. The big screen is used only as a magnified television, from which you can see every attribute of these women in a larger-than-life way. Lately, it seems that young directors are compromising the art of filmmaking. That is very scary. The industry spoils the art in the film. We need to inform ourselves and our children about what cinematography and their language really are about. Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to convey feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launch pad for young divas and jocks.
