That was awful god. The story was everywhere and most of the time I was confused about the awful editing. I had no sympathy for someone because their characters were not sufficiently developed. They were extremely superficial people without dimension. Cheesy, cheesy stereotypes with undergrounds that went nowhere. The stripper chick was just a distraction, even if she looked decent. I do not know what that is supposed to be, but how shocked was it when they showed this garbage on Sundance? I almost quit my subscription. One would think that such a channel would show more quality films. There are many, much better gay and lesbian films. "The Celluloid Closet" is an excellent documentary. I really liked "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others who have lost my mind right now, but I'm trying to say that it just was not worth it. If you catch it on TV, ok, but otherwise, do not worry about it. <br /> <br /> There were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice (sad, I can count them on one hand), otherwise the camera was pretty shitty too. The lighting was off in many places. I think some of the effects were used to try something that just has nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> I can not deny that Johnny Rebel is quite hot (of course without blonde hair). Too bad that his acting has done nothing for me. Stay with real porn, buddy. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
