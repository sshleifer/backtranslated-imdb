This movie is awful. Each line is stolen by 8MM (at least in the Italian version). If you like garbage ... real garbage, give it a try; But beware: this is not the "bad, good" strip. In its cheapness, it may really look like porn, but believe me, if you're looking for "snuff," S & M, hardcore, softcore, or even an ordinary erotic thriller, you'll find something else in the store! I'm telling you this because the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting, acting, action and dialogue (the only good lines I've said before, the ones they stole from Joel Schumacher's 8MM!) You in a moment Tears get boring for a few minutes and the "happy ending" is absolutely disgusting! I give a star: a half for the sudden setting in the back scene, for the monologue "The Eyes of the Victim" (also stolen from 8MM) and a half for the sexy bodies of mother and daughter (who did not make it) around me still keep awake while watching this turkey!)
