This movie is just awful. It's boring, the quality is low, the actors are just the worst actors I've ever seen, and the scenario is so bad it's weird All girls, but he's ugly, overweight and looks like he's from the early 90s. <br /> <br /> All characters are away on weekends to meet with friends, but they are not really friends! The couple has not seen the "main person" for more than 5 years, and even then they were not real friends. The "date" of the captain only knows him from work and then there is a girl they pick up in a bar. Now tell me that you could risk losing your job to spend a weekend in your cabin with people who are not even your real friends. Because that's what he does at the beginning of the film! <br /> <br /> Do not waste a minute of your time with this lemon. I made home movies more scary than that! <br /> <br />
