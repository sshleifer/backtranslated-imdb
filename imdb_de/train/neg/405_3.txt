This movie is worth it if you are amazed by special effects. There are some interesting visuals. Apart from that, it's the typical Nineties / Aughties Hollywood kitchen that blends without substance. Suitable for the title. <br /> <br /> It's not worth taking the story apart. It's like brain surgery on a dinosaur. There is not much at the beginning. It's not original and nothing special. So do not go down in history. Just look at the effects. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, it ended up being a bit flashy and diluted the purity of the big FX treatment of an invisible (and sometimes semi-invisible) man. However, ignoring the "standard" pyrotechnics is a sight (or not). All in all, it's a decent FX movie that's worth watching for just this purpose.
