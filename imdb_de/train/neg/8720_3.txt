Put a Dr. House Repeat aside, which I had missed, and a Desperate Housewives (new) to see this. I do not know exactly what has plagued this movie. I never thought I would say that, but I want my fifteen minutes of fame back. <br /> <br /> Script, directing, I can not say. I recognized the stable of actors (the usual suspects), but thought that Herbert Marshall would be a class extra, and put me down for a good cheese snippet. Boy, I was wrong. Dullsville. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: Where the "office girl" does with the 029 keypad and puts the cards in a 087 sorter. LOL @ "the computer". I want someone to identify the next device - a 477? It is even before the time of this dinosaur. <br /> <br /> And we dinosaurs do not have that much time to lose.
