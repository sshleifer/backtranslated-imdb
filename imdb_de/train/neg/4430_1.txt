Thanks to a boring, dimensionless screenplay by Neil Simon and a dull direction by Robert Moore, Chapter Two becomes a shrill showcase for Marsha Mason, who received her third of four Oscar nods for Chapter Two, and the same performance as in Cinnderella Liberty (73, The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only When I Laugh (81), but this time she does not have a kid to carry around. "Chapter 2 is the third and final feature film for Moore, previously Neil Simon's The Cheap Detective (78) and directed Murder By Death (76) Caan is futile, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is too analytical, and there are virtually no details, the first half is a less than captivating, cute, shy romance between a blinking caan and a chopping Mason, and the dull second half makes you long for the first half.The New York locations, as well as Joe Bologna and the painfully slender Valerie Harper are irrelevant relevant, but at least they provide a welcome distraction. And last but not least, there is a terrible song during the credits.
