The worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. I saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004, and I'm thrilled that this film was accepted into a festival. It was an interesting premise, and it seemed she could go somewhere, but every time she tried to do something she fell apart. If you want to play a musical, you will first find someone with musical talent. The music consisted of kitschy piano playing that sounded like they were playing in a stereo in the room where they were filming. The lyrics were terribly written, and if they were not obvious rhymes, they were moaning rhymes that showed how far they stretched out to try and make this movie a success. and you think you find people who could sing when you make a musical, right? not in this case. Fortunately, they talked only halfway half the time, but when they sang it irritated me. especially when they tried to sing in harmony. and that only appeals to the music. Part of the acting was pretty good, but many dialogues were as dreadful as most scenes. Obviously, they did not have enough coverage of the scenes, or they only had a bad editor, because they were constantly jumping the line and using awful choices when editing the movie. At least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until he hooked it up to make it into a musical. I hope investors make sure someone can write music before the same mistake is made again.
