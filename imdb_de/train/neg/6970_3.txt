Well, it would be a bit of a clich√© if I started with the title title, so I'm waiting for that. First of all, this movie surprised me, why children do stupid things, like wandering in laboratories and breaking bottles. Then I realized that this is a movie with a message that the message is beating kids and such things are not going to happen. Things like you ask? Things like a giant insect monster that grows up and causes a bit of chaos before dying on the typical "kill the monster indirect" method. Well, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... has neither blue nor any simian of any kind in it. Now it's red, like I was cheated or something. The picture on the cover had a huge bug / crab / idiot / thing on the front that was tracking some screaming nurses. That somehow happened, but I wanted monkeys! after enjoying MOST EXTREME PRIMATE a few nights ago (half-drunk by Cask and Creame's Brandy), I was in the mood for more monkey hijack style of the 80s. Not as much. If you like snowboarding or blue things, this movie is not for you. If you like bugs and good reasons to beat kids, rent this.
