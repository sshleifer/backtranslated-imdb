Director Ron Atkins is demonstrably crazy. This ultra-low-budget film chronicles a few days in the life of a Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a nut man who receives a Rubberneck doll from his bitch. He takes commands from the doll to take huge amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts out as a ball-to-the-wall commercial will stay that way, but it's going to be fast and very fast. I lean more towards the certifiable madman. It's hard to forget, once seen. A bit like Tom Green ever made a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My Note: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell gets completely naked; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush <br /> <br /> ANTI-Eye-Candy: John always completely naked
