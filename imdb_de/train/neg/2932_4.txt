Not that he does not care, but I'm not a friend of Simon Pegg. If it were me, there would be a good chance we would fail if it continued to make such slags. The trouble is, he's found a successful formula, like the hobbling, normal guy next door in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run, and so on, but it's starting to scale down. Here his character has no discernible qualities, he is rude and obnoxious and thinks he is weird if he honestly does not. When he was transferred from London to New York (and I'm assuming that connection should appeal to audiences on both sides of the Atlantic), he and his new colleagues are both out of place. Nevertheless, it is a miracle that he hires a transvestite stripper among his amusing japes, who is said to be an act of revenge on his boss at an editorial meeting. Somehow Kirsten Dunst starts to warm, although he has done nothing beautiful. Oh, and because he's a superficial man, he falls in love with Megan Fox at first, possibly because her character is as flat as his character. All this leads to a predictable film conclusion, though I do not see a viewer expressing how this reflects their lives. The shame is that on paper this is a cast that was supposed to be worth seeing. But Pegg plays herself, Kirsten Dunst just seems to go through the moves and not create chemistry on the screen, and Megan Fox is not stretched at all. The big plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York landlady - now, if she had been on the screen longer ...
