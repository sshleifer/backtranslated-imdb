Dane tries too hard and is too extreme with all his screaming and madness, spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor. Too much. Calm down, get together and make us laugh. I did not quite understand his comparison to comics and rock stars. Just because there's both on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield really cared when he was alive. He had some good jokes like the Burger King joke, where people roar through the ride. I also liked the joke of Reese's Pieces. If Dane just did not act that crazy, maybe he would be funnier and maybe I would have given a higher rating, maybe even an eight.
