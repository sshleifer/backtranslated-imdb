I've read all these reviews here, how this movie is so good. Jeez, this movie was predictable and rather boring. Acting was below average most of the time, especially McKenna. I have not seen a miserable attempt to make someone in a movie a "badass". Oh man, this movie was a flop. I also read somewhere that this could be a cult classic. I know there are supporters of the director, but this movie was just an average piece of film. <br /> <br /> The script was lame, the acting was mostly lame. > <br /> Oh and pray for the guy who used to be in Cheers. He looks really bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably the guy in Office Space, and he only had about 8 minutes in that movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
