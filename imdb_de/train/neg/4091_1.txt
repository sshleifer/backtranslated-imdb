Ah, Lucio Fulci, rest in peace. This infamous Italian is famous for "Zombie" and the absolutely unsurpassable "The <br /> Psychic" and "Manhattan Baby". Well, add this to the unsurpassed <br /> <br /> list. <br /> <br /> The plot is effectively a nekkid woman wearing a gold mask <br /> <br /> wearing a g-string. She wants the power of a young, named <br /> <br /> stallion, who has a set of magic arrows and a bow. They are magical <br /> <br /> because they shine. Arrow Boy works with a man in a bad wig, <br /> <br />, and they spend most of the movie trying to escape from shallow <br /> <br /> action sequences. In the end, the Nekkid chick was defeated, but not <br /> <br /> before removing the mask and reminding me why I had broken my <br /> girlfriend from my high school. <br /> <br /> Fulci bathes each shot in an orange shimmer and fills the screen with <br /> <br /> smoke. Nothing like a smoky orange action sequence that craves Sunny Delight and a cigarette. The special effects are laughable. In a sequence, our ambiguous gay duo are attacked by dozens of arrows that apparently scratch the film itself. Most of the effect budget must have been spent on the fulci-licious gore, which consists solely of splashing wounds. Hey, we can all use a good spurting wound once, but if you get into a splattering wound overkill, it'll be boring. <br /> <br /> I always had to play with the brightness setting on my TV anyway <br /> <br /> just to see what the hell happened. <br /> <br /> There is much talk about fulfilling omens and prophecies, so let me <br /> <br /> take a glimpse into the future ... if you find this movie and look at it , you will regret it. The scene on the video box (by Media) does not appear in the film in any context. "Conquest" is a con job. What could MST3K do with it! <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong blood, female nudity, short male nudity and mild sexual content. <br /> <br />
