Good performances can not save this dreadful script, peppered with every clich√© in the Chick-Flick book. Both characters are deeply unsympathetic, and the scene in which Laura Linney's character with her dead husband in front of her teenage son is reminiscent of sex, which I feel is poignant, is just terrible.
