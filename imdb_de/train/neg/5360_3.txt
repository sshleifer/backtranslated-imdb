"Nada" was the most flawed follow-up to "Les NOces Rouges", which in retrospect appears as the last good movie from Chabrol's Golden Age (1967-1973). "Nada" is Chabrol's first real attempt at a completely political film. His previous work "les Noces Rouges" also had political elements, but it was more of a psychological thriller with the usual view of society in French provinces. "Nada" includes terrorists, ambassadors, hostage-taking, lots of blood, not really Chabrols A heterogeneous cast gives the film the coup de grace: Only Duchaussoy, who had already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel are just around the corner. Viviane Romance, one of Duvivier's actresses ("la Belle Equipe" "Panique") is wasted as Madam (Gabrielle). Italian actors (Fabio Testi, Lou Castel) are terrible. <br /> <br /> With "Nada" this is a second period of infertile inspiration for Chabrol. It would be "Violette Nozi√®res". before he was back at the top of his game.
