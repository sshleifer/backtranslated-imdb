My title summarizes this heap of garbage. I should have taken a hint when I saw that it was a Fred Olen Ray movie. This is the worst movie ever directed at children. The drama was horrible, the humor was nonexistent, The Direction was the worst I've ever seen & The special effects would not be inappropriate in a Disney movie of the fifties DEE-WALLACE STONE! Who had such a promising career in the 80s? The movie veteran and former child actor Russ Tamblyn were a terrible villain and the budget was so low that even as a children's film it was absolutely incredible. I have not seen the sequel to 1999 I do not have <br /> <br /> If you want to have a good kids movie, check out 'HONEY I SHRUNK / BLEW UP THE KIDS / KID' or a DISNEY movie YO: - 2/10 <br /> <br /> RATING AS A CHILDREN'S FILM: - 3/10 BEST!
