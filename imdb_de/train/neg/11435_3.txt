I wish I had learned more about this film when I rented it. I had queued it based on Heather Graham and her strong belief in acting (IMHO). While parts of the film were charming, much of the film felt undeveloped or otherwise boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people that the siblings are a couple ... I do not care how big a part of the plot is, it still felt a bit, er, disgusting. And for a zoologist, Charlie certainly does not seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens. What was it about her (apart from her keenness and some common interests) that got Gray interested in her? The story could have been much more interesting with a bit more depth. Highlights - Molly Shannon (though I agree with the reviewer who occasionally annoys her), the driver on the train, and the dance sequences (if Sam and Gray were such great dancers, I wish we'd seen more of them because of the pieces In fact, they were actually better than most other films and could have been better.
