I saw this movie for the first time on a Saturday night around twelve o'clock. It's really the perfect time for this. I have never seen a movie that was more predictable and full of stereotypes. If you want to see a thrilling action movie, do not look at it because you may lose the will to live halfway. However, if you want a good laugh, please pay attention! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection, thanks to my lovely Saturday night. What I've noticed is that every scene that's costly to produce was copied from a Discovery documentary or an old US army TV special. In addition, I was very surprised that they did not make the slightest effort to make the production real. Afghanistan is, as far as I can remember, no sea nearby, yet Deke escapes with a terrorist sandcast jet pack and is taken away by a submarine (probably Discovery). Later in the film, Deke throws an Islam terrorist against the wall. In the slow-motion scene, you can see the Korean stuntman's long hair in the air when hit against the wall. I have to love it. I recommend you have a look at it with some friends and a good amount of beer. Only then will you understand why I was so angry that you spend 6.99 euros for the box.
