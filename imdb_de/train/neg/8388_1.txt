Come this heartwarming story of hope. Hope you never have to endure such a terrible thing again. * Cough * Razzie Price * Cough * <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie because it was not funny, predictable and insane. As I watched, it felt like a psychological experiment to see how low the film standards can become before people complain. When I asked for my money back at the end of the film, I was informed because I looked at the whole thing: "I was not entitled to a refund." The deputy manager told me that several people had already complained and received reimbursements. <br /> <br /> The movie summary is pretty simple. The dwarf thief steals a diamond and poses as a baby to escape the police. However, under this sophisticated outline is a repertoire of original, fresh and hilarious skits. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following: Would you like to see people being hit by pans? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see dwarves as babies who are threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired race jokes? Do you think babies say 'goo goo goo goo goa gaa'? Did you drool? <br /> <br /> If you answered "yes" to any of the above, this movie is definitely for you. Although referred to as "The Worst Movie of the Decade" in some places, there are probably one or two movies that are worse ... somewhere. I can not say for sure. I gave this movie 2 stars, because we all know that a review with only one star would indicate bias of the reviewer, and then the review would not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This lowbrow comedy is meant for a less intelligent audience, and I can not recommend it to a clear conscience. Save your money on something funny. <br /> <br /> Respect
