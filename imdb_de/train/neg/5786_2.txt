If you look at it now and hear the whole language here, it's amazing that this was rated "PG", but that's the 70s rating system for you. Peter Falk spits out the Lord's name six times in vain in the first ten minutes of this movie! Few people think that's offensive, let alone the fools who make films or the people who "rate" them. The cast is an indication of how profane this movie can be: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not exactly actors you would not find in "The Sound Of Music". <br /> <br /> I like Heistfilme and many movies after director William Friedkin, but this script does not deliver and it just has too much of the "Sleazy '70s", visually and audibly. For those who love Falk in TVs "Columbo" it must be a shock to hear how he uses so much obscenity as he did in movies. This is far from the only case.
