Was this film banned in England? Why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others had made it a lot worse and have been going on since then ... <br /> <br /> this movie has all the elements of a decent seventies or early eighties horrors movie. good-looking girls (who, by the way, can not act to save their lives), a terrible thunderstorm with a heavy downpour, a scythe, a crazy, family-owned brother, and a damn good turn at the end. but forbidden? serious. When the English parliament banned this film, the Italians probably laughed their collective asses about how reserved and prudish the British really were. <br /> <br /> There may have been two minutes total time to burn violence and blood (which was underestimated). There was nudity, but no sex, although apparently allusions to sex were made. but absolutely nothing that would be worth banning. <br /> <br /> I would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a reasonable budget. As it looks, the movie is entertaining, but the lack of image and sound quality takes away the end result. <br /> <br /> forbidden ... what a joke ...
