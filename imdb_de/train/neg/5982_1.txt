I am so sorry to have to say this, but "Thunderbirds" does not even have a loud pop, no matter what a thunder. At one point, I seriously thought about leaving the cinema. I stayed in the desperate hope that the film could improve. I should be disappointed, it did not get better, it got worse, if that's possible. Had I seen the movie thinking that it would be a "parody", I would still have been disappointed. They had an excellent opportunity to make a great movie franchise here, they totally squandered that chance. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to have attached names and Jonathan Frakes to this movie. What should I say, he should be ashamed and ashamed, would not be far from the truth. I have seen this film in a pre-release, which I have been waiting for very excited. I grew up with the original shows in the sixties. To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. Finally, I would like to say that the puppets in the TV programs were only a little bit more wood than the actors in the film.
