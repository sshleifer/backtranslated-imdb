I generally like to watch Burt Lancaster's films - especially if he has to go crazy with his stunning on-screen presence like Elmer Gantry. But his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally his greatest weakness, for he rarely, if ever, underestimated EVERYTHING. And it is this lack of subtlety that really hinders The Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character should be a kind of showman, but how Katherine Hepburn was cast in his spell is completely inexplicable. She's supposed to be smart, but does not seem that way when Lancaster's screams are thrown across the screen! In addition, the story may be one of the best-looking films I've ever seen, and it's far too obvious that this is a one-piece movie. It just looks like it was mostly filmed in a soundstage, rather than in the big, far west, as it should be.
