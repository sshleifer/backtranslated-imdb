Start with the good part: Swayze speaks to Zulu several times with his friends, or this language is heard among the tribes. This is a great advantage, as the US and British film audiences generally believe that all the people on this planet speak English (just in case you are one of them: No, they do not) 'tenth-gracious', as we say in the Netherlands (this will make your toes curl - not in a good way). I like Swayze, but he's terrible in that. The muscles in his jaws are working overtime and he frowns as if he's wrinkled the whole movie. No Patrick: It looks stupid and compensates for the missing character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) has opted for a style of acting that does not match the style of her colleagues. Her acting is so relaxed that this film could have been discontinued in the current days. And it is not like that. Your dress was a clue, Alison. <br /> <br /> The best show came from the people of the African continent and from Sided Onyulo, because Umbopa was my favorite. Clear, warm and full of character, his performance is a pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> General: It's mwah-entertaining on a rainy day. Pity. Could have been better. Sack the director.
