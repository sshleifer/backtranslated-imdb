*** SPOILER *** Do not read this, if you remember to watch the movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way: The plot is so predictable that it does not matter if you read it anyway or not). <br /> <br /> If you're wondering if you want to see "Coyote Ugly" or not, do not! It is not worth the money for the ticket nor the VHS / DVD. A typical "chick-feel-good-flick", you could say. The plot itself is as flat as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American dream. The young, handsome girl from a small town is a big hit in New York. The few desperate attempts to give the film any depth fail, like the "tragic" accident of the father, the "difficulties" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend and so on. McNally (director) tries to arouse the sympathy of the audience, and the sadness has no chance to reach this attempt because of the bad script and the flat drama. Above all, Piper Perabo is quite capable of "Jersey" fear of singing in front of an audience. The only good (and rather funny) thing about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents the small glimmer of hope in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this film. First "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now that ... what happened to great movies like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? THAT was true Bruckheimer stuff. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a superficial movie of good-looking women just for a laid-back evening, you should see "Charlie's Angels" (it's much funnier, more entertaining) and self-deprecating) instead of this strip. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).
