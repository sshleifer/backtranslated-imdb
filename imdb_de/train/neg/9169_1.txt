It's getting really bad. The only reasonably satisfying quality is the impact of the thousands of bullets used during the film. There are context errors everywhere. Acting is awful except Kirk. The story is as pervasive as the Grail, and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself simply kills the movie if it's not already a corpse. All in all, it's a waste of your life. I would have given it a zero if this had been an option on the rating scale.
