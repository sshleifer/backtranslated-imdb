I rented this movie because I was hoping it would be the whole family. Although the film is family friendly, my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false look to God. If you obey God and follow Him, success is not guaranteed. Your football team does not always win. You will not magically get better grades. Infertility is not always cured. You will not always get an increase. Sometimes you get stuck with the old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to fulfill all our wishes. Rather, we were created to glorify Him. Sometimes we glorify him the most when things seem to be going badly for us. To live is Christ; to die is profit.
