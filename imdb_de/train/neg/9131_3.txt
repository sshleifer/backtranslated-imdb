I can hardly believe that I looked at it again last night after more than 25 years ... <br /> <br /> Some time ago I saw 6 Fu films in a row ... Boris Karloff and all 5 Chris Lees. The last two lees, both of which were directed by Jess Franco (and I use the word casual), were disgusting. At the time I skipped this and remembered that it was even worse in some ways. <br /> <br /> Well, I saw it. Never again. Do you know what's worse than a vile movie? A really well made piece of S ***. And that's FIENDISH PLOT. It is a very good looking movie. Great production design, stage designs, costumes, music, photography, editing, mostly good cast, some decent acting ... <br /> <br /> ... and absolutely positive one of the most WONDER COURTS in film history !! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the movie is so deceptive ... you might think this a decent movie. And then they sing "Happy Birthday to Fu" ... and it goes downhill. Burt Kwouk (of whom his master says, "Her face is familiar.") Accidentally spills Fu's elixir to extinguish a fire, causing him to be tortured and buried, and one of his ears is cut off what came closest to them. It was as if someone had decided to make a "Campy" movie - so ridiculous that it would be funny. Ridiculous, it's ... funny ... it's not. Ever. <br /> <br /> It's sad, because in the first few minutes it's clear that someone has done a lot of research in the Fu Manchu series to do so much of it "right". With another script - either a really FUNNY or a dead SERIOUS - they could have - would have ... - SHOULD have had a classic in their hands. A movie that could make you forget the horror of this Jess Franco atrocity, rather than digging it out as masterpieces, by comparison. There was a phase in the late 70's. A whole lot of classic 30s characters were revived in films that were generally terrible. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan and even Doc Savage. I am not sure that this could be the worst. It took a lot of self-restraint not to spin whole sections of it, especially scenes that contained Sid Caesar (FBI boss, who was also Al Capone's cousin - see what I mean?). It's not just that the ideas in the movie are not funny, they often make NO SENSE. For example, when they "audition" police officers to embody the king and queen, and we see people doing "dance rehearsals," such as singing, dancing, and unicycling. How many drugs did the authors of this thing have to take for any of this to make sense to them? <br /> <br /> As I said, a shame ... and a real waste of all this talent, including that of Peter Sellers (who played both Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk (the one in Chris Lee Fu (film at the time), Helen Mirren (the cop who is shockingly in love with the villain and nearly steals the half-hour of the movie!) I wonder if anyone will ever make a "real" Fu Manchu movie or whether the fans have to accept that Karloff is almost the ONLY one.
