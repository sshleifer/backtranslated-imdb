The last movie by Johnny Weissmuller as "King of the Jungle", after 16 years in the role of "Tarzan And The Mermids", will surely disappoint all his fans. The 44-year-old ex-Olympian, one of Hollywood's most active "party animals", had long left the slender athleticism of his youth behind and looked tired (though he was in slightly better condition than in his previous post, Tarzan And THE HUNTRESS). , <br /> <br /> Not only that WeissmÃ¼ller had become too old for his role. Johnny Sheffield, the epitome of the "boy," had grown up (he was a stout 17-year-old). He was therefore written from the screenplay, under the pretext of being away at school. Brenda Joyce, 35, appeared in her fourth of five films as "Jane" (she would make the transition when Lex Barker became the new Tarzan, 1949 in TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN) and was still as sexy as ever. > <br /> Produced by Sol Lesser at RKO on a Tiny Budget, cast and crew used cheaper labor by shooting in Mexico. While the venue gave the supposedly darkest Africa a distinctly Hispanic flair, veteran director Robert Florey took full advantage of the country by incorporating cliff diving and an Aztec temple. As a Young Island Girl (Tyrone) Linda's future bride, Linda Christian, is rescued by Tarzan in a jungle river. He learns that a local high priest (George Zucco, one of the film's most ferocious villains) has virtually enslaved the local population, threatening the vengeance of a living "God." They are not doing his bidding. The girl had been chosen to become the bride of God, so she fled. Faster Than You Can Say "Is this a stupid act or WHAT?", The girl is kidnapped by the priest's henchmen and brought back to the island, and Tarzan followed by Jane, the colorful Spanish figure "Benjy" (charmingly played by John Laurenz, who sings several tunes), and a government commissioner is ready to face the deity and his priest (poor Cheeta remains behind). After a series of discoveries (the "god" is simply a swindler in an aztec mask working with the priest while milking the island's rich pearl beds), a bit of fighting and comic relief and Benjy songs suffice for all the expected happy ending. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS contains a music score by the brilliant film composer Dimitri Tiomkin and is far better than you would expect from this "B" movie! <br /> <br /> While the film Weissmuller's time in Tarzan's loincloth would bring a little promising ending (he would immediately play Jungle Jim, a more eloquent variant of ape-man, in khakis). The talent has raised the overall product a little over all the chaos that it could have been. <br /> <br /> Tarzan was doing make-up and becoming much sexier ...
