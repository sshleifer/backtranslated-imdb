Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why do we see this on the screen? Lots of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance, this could be your date movie. Otherwise, one and a half hours is just too long. If you want to see skilful dancing on the screen, it's better to watch the Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breathtaking dancing with long films. Director Carlos Saura knows from old experience how to dance. And from time to time it looks really good. But if the movie is an hour, it should be interesting at least most of the time. There are many types of art, not everything is bigger than life and this movie is not too big.
