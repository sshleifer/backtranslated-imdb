After reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems very restless, but I did not think it was that bad. I actually saw much worse. <br /> <br /> "The House Where Evil Dwells" is a ghost story about a husband and his wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who moves into a family old house in Japan. They do not know that a Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and lover and killed himself 100 years ago with a samurai sword. As strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the former residents begin to possess the bodies of the living and plan to reenact the bloody murder that took place 100 years ago. I saw that movie and decided to give it a try, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. It was routine and it was hackneyed, but I have seen worse in my time. The ghost sequences were a little over the top, we see the translucent, blue-toned characters appearing in the family and taking over their bodies by accident. To be honest, the ghosts in this movie somehow reminded me of the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion ride in Disneyland. I'm wrong, but after looking at it, the Japanese horror movie "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of the movie seemed to have torn me down a bit. The old Japanese house where a brutal murder took place, ghostly activities, curses on the house etc. But I can be wrong. <br /> <br /> To summarize, this is a pretty cheesy ghost story. Do not bother to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to be on TV, you can try it. 10.4.
