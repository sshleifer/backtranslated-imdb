I saw this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zapping channels. <br /> <br /> I guess we both were hoping for some kind of happy, family Christmas movie, but we were extremely disappointed. The actor who plays the soldier seems to have 0 emotions, his face looks the same, whether he has the Crushing Christmas tree, seeing the girl he has kissed by his friend, or being happily surprised by the girl he loves, he is terribly an actor, and at no pont one of us did anything but laugh at him. <br /> <br /> Then there's the cute blonde girl, blessed with the ability to score points and cheat on her boyfriend, what a catch! and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and score more points. So it's basically a story about a man with no emotions or feelings who falls in love with a man who scores points and scams on his friend. It's as predictable as it gets, and it's really a waste of time. You will not win anything if you look at it, except a few weird laughs, because it's all so cheesy. <br /> <br /> I love it when her father says that. He only eats French fries and no French wine, and everybody laughs, that's the hillbilly attitude this movie is about. Besides, my father, if he would cheer me on, would tell him something or not, but not our Army veteran, no, sir, he'll let us all lead. <br /> <br /> The film is what First Blood would have been if John Rambo had burned like the world's biggest weakling.
