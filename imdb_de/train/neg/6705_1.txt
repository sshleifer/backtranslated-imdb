This movie is just a shame. Orlando, Florida, seems to become a well-known movie space (like the rise from Vancouver to prominence). The brothers were shot in Central Florida and this short film is a small setback for the area (which made great progress with the indie film Walking Across Africa and the big HBO miniseries From Earth To The Moon). <br /> <br /> I will try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to shoot the brothers. It had the potential to give the boy band a new twist. After all, both N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys come from this area. But, The Brothers probably lacks a weak script. Both main characters are flat and almost devoid of development (part of it could be the actors, but part of it is certainly the way the script was written.) <br /> <br /> Another problem is the choice of jokes. Many of the jokes are repeated too often (they look funny the first time, but it gets a bit boring). Some of the "concert" scenes are poorly staged (and many of these scenes do not seem to shift the story in any way). <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for this scene, but unfortunately it's such a disappointing effort. I also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short description. But I think the best thing for filmmaker John Figg is to quickly switch to different genres. Comedy is not his strength. However, it is undeniable that he is definitely one of the more prominent filmmakers in the Orlando area (it's just a shame he's notorious and not famous). <br /> <br />
