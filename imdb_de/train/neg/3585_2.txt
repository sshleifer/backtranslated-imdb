As a big fan of gorilla movies in general, I expected it to be great - and as far as the gorilla effects are concerned, they were pretty good - that's the only thing I can write about this flop. The film claims to be based on a true story, but in fact it does not come close to what actually happened to "Buddy" - who in real life was the famous Gargantua, that of our supposedly "heroic" Ringling Bros. was sold. Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who, in the best interest, barely had the welfare of her animals. As far as Buddy was portrayed as aggressive, it was a fiction, and the gorilla never resorted to such behavior in real life. Buddy actually escaped his wooden box during a storm (not a plush cage room as shown in the movie) to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which terrified Gertrude Lintz of selling him. No, Buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was suspended for some time in a wooden box, deep in the back of a garage, with just a single bulb of comfort and then sold to the kiosk Circus - where he actually lived a better life and threw peanuts on him until he died before a show in Miami (historically the oldest living gorilla recorded by the way). Also, watch the movie as Buddy grows older, but the chimpanzees never age. (Incidentally, the chimpanzees were not raised at the same time as other animals, including Buddy, as shown in the movie.)
