I fully agree with the review by a Variety reviewer that the film is never as witty, vivid, or revealing about the creative process as it seems to justify its premise. Narrative is messy and the lighting is really problematic. If the movie is to be controlled by characters, the bad lighting does not improve the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors. Many non-South Africans will find it difficult to follow the spoken English in the film, and some of the local humor will be lost. I saw the movie last year at the Cape Town World Cinema Festival. Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unsurpassed and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid story will indeed be among our best in our 110-year film history. It's not surprising that the movie disappeared from cinemas in Cape Town just two weeks after its release, and in most cinemas in Durban and Gauteng. The South African audience has apparently found little favor.
