Almost everything in this film is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. He has reached a point where you realize that his shtick has not changed since his SNL days more than ten years ago. He makes the same vile jokes of the stream of consciousness and the same voices. His cat is not funny, painfully. He tries too hard. He's a weird guy-a-comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are incredibly ugly - and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (Cutouts of cardboard for the buildings in the background would have made more sense than building a whole neighborhood and a main street.) Alec Balwin tries to make a funny impression of Great Santini, but he seems to be incoherent. There is even an inappropriate cheesecake moment with the famous Paris Hilton - it will stay in your memory, just because it's a story by dr. Seuss acts. Avoid this movie at all costs, people. It's not even an interesting train accident. (I hope they will make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams, then we have the bad Seuss Movie Star Spasitc Comedian Trilogy.)
