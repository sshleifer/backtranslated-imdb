Stephen King Adaptation (directed by King himself), in which a young family, newcomers to rural Maine, discover the animal cemetery near their home. The father (Dale Midkiff) then learns of the Micmac burial ground beyond the animal cemetery, which has resurrection powers - of course, everything that is buried there, not quite RIGHT. <br /> <br /> Below average horror image starts awkward, abusive and incompetent and continues for a while, with the absolute worst element being the worthless performance of Midkiff. Towards the end it gets a little better, with a really disturbing final. In fact, the whole movie is really disturbing, so I can not completely dismiss it - at least it has something to make it memorable. Decent support from Fred Gwynne as a wise neighbor and Brad Greenquist as a disfigured ghost Victor Pascow are not enough to really save the movie. King has his usual cameo as a minister. <br /> <br /> Followed by a sequel directed by Mary Lambert (is it any wonder she has not had any mainstream movie work since then?). <br /> <br /> 4/10
