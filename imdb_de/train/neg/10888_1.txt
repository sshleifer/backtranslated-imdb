This movie is absolutely terrible. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story almost does not exist, the characters are full of clich√©s and the special FX just make you laugh. The only thing noteworthy about this film is the guest appearance of the rapper Coolio as a kind of police officer. <br /> <br /> If this movie was a comedy, I would not have understood the meaning. If you want to see this movie, please get drunk and prepare for some good laughs ... especially if the first special FX appear on screen cheap: this movie is a must for you.
