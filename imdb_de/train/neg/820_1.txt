What did producer / director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's highly enigmatic screenplay? Were there a few pieces that were deliberately omitted? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did you see in this very messed-up story? <br /> <br /> And why did Candice Bergen, who performed a terrible feat, accept such an ungrateful role? <br /> <br /> The domino principle wants to be on the same basis as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and misses the target with a very wide margin. A big dropout from Stanley Kramer.
