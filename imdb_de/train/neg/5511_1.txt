I have to agree with the very first comment: This film is very, very hard. Despite a very large cast in the B-list, the cover of this movie (for those who do not watch it on Comedy Central on a weekday, which is probably the only exposure this movie will ever get), blames Dangerfield In reality, it's just a paycheck for every 80's comedian. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Begley, Jr? Check. The voice of Lisa Simpson? She can now say that Maximum Overdrive was not her only terrible movie: a double check. And so many, many others. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this film is that it was written so lazily with jokes already told. Nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny. It is better if you see the paint dry. This is definitely direct video scraping-the-bottom-of-the-barrel stuff that still believes in the old video proverb: throw an old-time star on the cover and you get some money back from the rental , Keep in mind that the days of the video library are changing, consider this one of the last examples of laying out garbage. <br /> <br /> The only use of this film is if you have trouble falling asleep. It will take you there.
