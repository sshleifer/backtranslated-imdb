A shaky handheld camera was used to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I got motion sickness when I watched it. It looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera in his hand (no offense meant for CP sufferers, but I do not think you would expect a lot of work as a cameraman!) Mrs and I considered it unsurpassable and gave it torture after 10 minutes. Later I checked (it was shown on TV) and it did not get any better. I suggest you miss this, unless you need to get rid of bad sushi that you ate.
