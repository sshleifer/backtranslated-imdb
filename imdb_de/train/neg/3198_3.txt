In short, the film had a bit of a weak first act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and tempo, a certain decent second act that, despite the contradictory tempo and some inferior performances of the band, built some suspense and intrigue and the 3rd. Act ... there was practically no 3rd act! <br /> <br /> With regard to Act 3, the movie ends abruptly. There is no dissolution and no way from the climax of the second act, so there was no grand 3rd act. The bad ones die and that's it; the credits roll. There is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the subordinates, and so on. The audience would probably have left the theater after the movie and asked, "is that it?" A true flop. <br /> <br /> The music was composed by David Bell, who worked well enough to deliver the movie most of the time, but he is certainly nothing outstanding. It is only functional, but achieves this by being merely generic and derived. It is also obvious that the score is VERY dated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion. What impressed me the least about the score is that some moments of tension announce musical signals as if they had been torn from "48 HRS" by James Horner. and "Commando", especially the brass. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film had a potential, as the basic story itself is good, but the execution with mediocre direction, weak acting and somewhat unsteady tempo was not atmospheric. <br /> There was virtually no third act to properly end the story, and this omission is hard and unforgivable, as the film can not end satisfactorily. This could either be the script or maybe because of budget constraints, the production had to restrict the filming or editing of the 3rd act in the finished movie (but I speculate why there is no 3rd act). Whatever the reason, the abrupt end damages the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> This is good for a look if you are curious and you can get the movie for VERY cheap as well as the reason why you need the 3 files (beginning, middle, end). When you write screenplays and make films. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may not want to waste time, unless you can get the MST3K version to at least get some laughs.
