This movie certainly has one of the strangest themes in the story - topped with Ed Wood's passionate defense of cross-dressing in "Glen or Glenda?". <br /> <br /> The theme: playing bridge. The Park Avenue set plays it; The Bohemians are playing it. The Russians, who speak very questionably "Russian" and put the least convincing accents in English, play it in the restaurant in which they work. - despite the great cast - this bizarre film may not be particularly interested. Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well - Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghostwriter - since Luke is an unlikely Russian.) But all are engulfed in the fetishist script.
