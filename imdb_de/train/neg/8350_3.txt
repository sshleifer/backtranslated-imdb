I just returned from "El Otro" when I was playing here in Buenos Aires, and I have to say that I was very disappointed. The movie is very slow (do not get me wrong, I like slow movies!), Slow to maddening. All you hear is that Julio Chavez is breathing heavily throughout the movie. This is a bad movie, but more importantly, it's a non-inspired movie, I did not feel anything for the story, or make their characters do a movie ... make it forget. I would advise you to pass this on, if you want to see good argentinian movies, look for movies by Sorin.
