This movie is so bad that it is funny. There's Scott Backula as a coach, but that's not important, important is the big black guy playing the 1st base. First, he must be at least 75 years old, but still plays baseball in the lower league, second, he starts the film in the outfield, although he can not run, let alone run. Coach Backula gets him ingeniously to mention first that he stays in the same place too long in a running attempt. Backula shows a more brilliant coaching strategy at the end of the film (SPOILER). He tells his star player "Downtown" to do a home run. "Downtown" is a good step. He scored the home run and won the game for his team, a small league that played the Twins who were the class of the majors in the film. If only Tony Muser, the Royals' coach, was as smart a coach as Backula, commanding his players to go home in every fight, the Royals would never finish an inning or lose a game.
