In this movie, I felt that I had missed some important scenes from the beginning. There were continuity flaws and plots that just as abruptly heard as they began. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover. I also credited Danny Glover's taste in his role selection, for example Grand Canyon. I just could not finish this movie after an eternity, but it was probably just over an hour; We had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the characters to empathize or sympathize with, there were no emotions at all about this film, and the clips of their past were poorly edited, confusing and unnecessary. What could have been a great idea for a movie, even as a drama rather than a comedy (though I think a comedy would have been better in this situation because I love to see white people freaking out and how complete idiots act making me laugh) was wasting my $ 1 credit in the video store.
