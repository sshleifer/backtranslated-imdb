After the cataclysmic revolution, this film was pretty much the last nail in the casket of Goldcrest and thus the British film industry. The film is an absolute pair of pants, full of music from the mid-'80s attempted jazz revival and based on a book and an author that was briefly popular at the time and rightfully forgotten. Temple searched for a long time trying to find Suzette and came with 8th Wonders Patsy Kensett, another person who was popular for a short while. When the film came out of post-production, the jazz revival came to an end, as did Kensett's career and the film hit a completely carefree film audience. <br/> I'm most forgiving about gracing the British movie screen after having looked for nearly twenty years, and the movie is really curvy.
