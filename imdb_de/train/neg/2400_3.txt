No, this was not one of the ten worst movies of the eighties, but he pulls out somewhere around the 100 best. This movie looks like it landed on the shelf for two or three years and was released in 1981. How else would you explain the special effects before the release of "An American Werewolf in London"? The disco is still considered cool and Ronald Reagan not the 40th President of the United States? Let us not miss the hairstyles of the 70s in the 50s and 60s. I have seen more here than combined in "Happy Days" and "Laverne & Shirley". The only woman to elevate this movie to "so bad it's good" was late, great Elizabeth Hartman, but just barely. Biff plays as Miss Montgomery, the high school teacher of Mousey, which turns into a sexpot, a stereotype that was killed to death and is still whipped up by Hollywood, but even as a "hot chick" she retains her Mousey qualities. Her call for help is proof of that. She looks much better than Miss Wimp. "Seven dollars in the beauty salon, shot to hell." She was not kidding. <br /> <br /> That's not to say that there are no good parts elsewhere, there are only a few and far away, and I'm not just saying that because I like Hartman. By the way, "Teen Wolf" was better than this. "Teen Wolf Too" was better than that, and that was not all that good. <br /> <br />
