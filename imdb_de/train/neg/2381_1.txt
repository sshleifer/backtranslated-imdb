I'm not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie has something to offer. I expected something better from Uma Thurman, which is why I got through this experience at all. A horrible movie with only music as redeeming quality. It's just a shame we can not score 0 out of 10 in these ratings. This movie deserves it.
