I saw this movie recently and had bigger hopes. Not so much on the director, who had not previously released a film screening, but rather on his cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (starring in Body Double, a masterpiece by Brian De Palma) have all starred in great films. But not together, and this fact has not changed exactly by these. <br /> <br /> The movie is incredible, very predictable and clich√©d. The only thing that might make it appealing is the selection of places where it was filmed. In my humble opinion, do not waste your time with it.
