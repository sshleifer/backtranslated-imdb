"Paula, maybe I'm a bitch, but I'll never be a bitch!" <br /> <br /> A funny line in an otherwise rather tiring skin stripe, which has a nice honey in Stacey Walker, but that's all. This is a real eye-catcher that lures her friends, colleagues and even her lesbian roommate Paula into her bedroom, but then turns into a crazy job that cries "rape" and calls the police! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic personality of this certified C ** t may be interesting for a while, but this story eventually becomes a repetitive one-note affair. At least the end is worth the wait for those who will still be interested at this time.
