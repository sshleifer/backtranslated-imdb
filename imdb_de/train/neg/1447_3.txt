The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three big movies and really started to make a name for themselves. Unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the audience valued best here. Two of these things sang and danced. Another was a short, interesting movie that drew people's attention and distracted them from The Depression. You know the other keys to the successful films of Shirley. <br /> <br /> Despite the star presence of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard, and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway, this film did not score. There are also too many talkative parts that just get boring and too many arguments between a disgusting Lombard and Cooper. To top it off, you did not get the normal feel-good that the public wants. I think they learned after this movie.
