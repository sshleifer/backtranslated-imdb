Jane Gail (as Mary Barton), the boss of a joint New Yorker family, works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (as Loma Barton) in the "Smyrner's Candy Store" together. After Ms. Grandin was abducted by traders to buy and sell women prostituted slaves, Ms. Gail and her policewoman Matt Moore (as Larry Burke) must rescue the virtue-threatened young woman. <br /> <br /> "Traffic in Souls" has a reputation that's hard to underpin - it's not well done, and it does not show anything special when a young woman's "virtue" is endangered by sex traders , Maybe it can be supported as a film that deals with the subject in a greater length than usual (originally claimed to have been ten roles). After all these years, the scenes in New York City are the main attraction. The panning of prisoners behind bars is memorable, because nothing seems to move the cameras. <br /> <br /> **** Traffic in Souls (24/11/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
