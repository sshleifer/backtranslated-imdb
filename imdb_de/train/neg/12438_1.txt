The bad guys are beating ... Again, the slogan for this movie is, it reveals so much truth about it. <br /> <br /> Home Alone one and two, movie classics. Alone at home three and four, a good movie when you are three! As Sharkboy and Lavagirl, hard as it is to be funny, it is not so. Culkin will be replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. He's a very sober actor with threadbare performances, but it's not entirely his fault, the script called for a bland vocabulary and bland expressions. The pranks are simply copied from the first two with various crooks, and you have to be blind to believe that these chickenpox are real. A good choice if you are a preschool teacher, showing this movie on a rainy day. And if it gets worse, a completely different cast, see if you do not believe me, but you'll regret it.
