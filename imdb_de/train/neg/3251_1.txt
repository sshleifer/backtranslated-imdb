I filmed this movie at FX last night, and as I sat there looking at it, it occurred to me that it could possibly be the worst movie of all time. Bad drama, bad cinematography, bad sound, absolutely incredible fighting sequences, stupid characters. All this made it a ridiculously bad movie I've ever seen. It was so bad, I was fascinated that there was nothing lacking in semi-competence, that I had to keep watching ... and they made a sequel!
