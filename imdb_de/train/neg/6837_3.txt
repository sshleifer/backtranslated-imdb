Usually I do not like revenge movies ... PERIOD. Double Impact, however, has a little more than your typical premise for revenge plans. You see, DI has action, accuracy, exotic locations (ie Hong Kong), massive shootouts and enough martial arts to whet your appetite for an impressive, unarmed fight. Like all vengeance stories, there are bad guys you would like to throw out of a glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building. Double Impact, however, has no sensational crap that stifles the conspiracy and the elitist, racist and venomous social stereotypes that have invaded Eye for a Eye and Death Wish 2. <br /> Plot Division Double Impact is as transparent as Saran Wrap. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a mob-hit team associated with a close family member with money problems, or at least that's what I remembered. The explanation of why the boys spoke French accents is a lousy one. It was not the watery action that made this movie bad, but using clich√©d lines and movements from other films (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) really made it worse. Nevertheless, Double Impact is still visible. But why are there bad guys in those crappy movies (like that greedy British guy who killed Chad and Alex's parents, and that deadly lesbian redhead) that you would like to hate with your fiber?
