I saw this movie and the original Carlitos Way from back to back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know that people will say that the prequel was done on a small budget, but it never had anything to do with a bad script. Now it may only be me, but I always thought that a prequel was being made to set up the other film, mark the main characters, and perhaps tell something about the life we ​​did not know. Rise to Power is just a movie that carries Carlito's name. There should be at least a few characters from the original film, the ending is not useful in relation to the original. At the end of this movie, he retreats with his sweet heart, but how the hell do we get him out of jail in the next movie? And his wife is not even the same woman he talks about as his only love in the original. I would say that the movie is easy to entertain in itself, with a few decent pieces, but it turns pale when held against its big brother. Do not wake up at night and wait to see this. Look at the original again if you really need a hit.
