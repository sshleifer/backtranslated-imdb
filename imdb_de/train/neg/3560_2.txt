For me, this is a story that starts with a few funny jokes about Frank's fanatics, when he is on the way with a staircase and when he's in business meetings ... The problem is that you see the movie if you watch him for an hour have seen the same fantasies / funny situations over and over again. It is too predictable. It's more of a TV story where you can continue without missing out on anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Herngren as Frank, but that's not enough, even if it's a comedy that has more variations and some kind of message to the audience .... <br /> <br />
