Yes, in this movie children go to the space camp and it starts off well when the kids meet and learn the ropes. Then they introduce Jinx, a robot that was impossible impossible in 1986, since they no longer have anything with this kind of artificial intelligence. Kid becomes a friend of robots, and the robot repays the kindness of the child by shooting him and a group of other children in that camp into space with a very limited supply of oxygen and radios that do not have the signal to go into space reach. This camp is also not fun because these children are really trained and the teachers take care of them because they have failures or are not doing the right things. Take a break, they are just for fun, so as not to become an astronaut, give them the experience of space travel and no military camp. However, one sees Joaquin Phoenix in a relatively early role. So, in the end, a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors, you would have been able to fight the kids just as well with space aliens as anything else that would have happened in the movie than this the case would have been the film at least a little more pleasant for me. Probably for a few others who would like to see Kate Capshaw's face ripped apart by a strange alien creature.
