There is a DVD released in 2002 in the UK with the code HRGD002 on the cover, no ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disk, no IFPI code in the inside edge. <br /> <br /> It makes no sense to comment on an adult movie. But this one contains a minimal plot, and the characters are believable. It was shown in the United States in normal cinemas. <br /> <br /> I saw it in 1975 in Pensylvannia. <br /> <br /> As such, it deserves a place in an Encyclopedia of Movies. The DVD has no special features and no subtitles and was probably created with a VHS tape source
