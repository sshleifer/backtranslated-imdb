I expected much better from Battlestar Galactica. Very boring prequel to the main series. After the first 30 minutes, I waited for the end. The characters talk a lot about religion, computers, programming, retaliation, etc. There are gangsters, mafia types who hit. However, Caprica does not have the action of the original series to compensate for the slower parts. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some helpful advice when you watch movies: In general, if there's too much exploitative fraud, then you know the movie is going to be a guy. Caprica has a lot of it. The director tries to balance his bad skills with a few naked bodies. It never works and it's just about humiliating the (very) young actresses, and I'm sorry for them. Directors / authors who do this should be excluded from the business. <br /> <br /> If you want to be bored for an hour and a half, rent Caprica. There is (free) porn on the internet if you really want to see naked bodies. Otherwise continue to see nothing here.
