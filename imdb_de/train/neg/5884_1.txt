I'm a big movie fan. I like movies of all kinds. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I understand that the book follows closely, which raises the point that not everything should be made into a movie. Especially as the authenticity of the experiences in the book has been questioned more than once. These characters are not weird, they are mentally ill. The things that happen are not funny, they disturb; especially when you consider that they should be true. <br /> <br /> This movie had the feel of The Royal Tenenbaums, another movie I hated /> I'll never get those hours back. I wanted to wash my brain after I saw.
