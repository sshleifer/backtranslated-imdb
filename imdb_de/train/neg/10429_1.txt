The first half was fine, but the last half was really disappointed. It's weird that the producers even admitted that they had no idea what the end was, and that really showed. What's really sad, I have to write at least ten comment lines to publish this. I really did not want to use spoilers to qualify my comments because the show is not really worth the effort. When Battlestar Galatica first came out, I was really excited because there was probably a better remake. It was not the case that the first season was not considered as space photography. They finally cleaned it up a bit and actually had a pretty nice drama, so I started looking again. But at the end of the series with Kara as Cyclone God Angel, with Baltar and Six that was pretty stupid.
