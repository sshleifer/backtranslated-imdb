OK. I've seen LOTS and my LOTS of this kind of movies. Do you know those who just look so good and shabby on the DVD cover that you can not wait to see it? Well, I have GOT again. And I'm pretty tired of it. But I digress. It's pretty easy. It sucked (I know, rather teen), but it did. And so I agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing, why WHY did the lead actress have to be so unappealing? And the scowl she used brought unresolved pain over her daughter's death and helped little. I mean, Jesus .. Oh, but the demon creeping on his back was pretty neat ...
