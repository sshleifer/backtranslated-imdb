I often comment on the absolute grudge of truly scary movies on the market, and unfortunately, White Noise has only limited my belief that the film industry will be able to make such a venture. I was surprised to see that I became increasingly tired as the plot worsened and my static headaches increased. I found that White Noise was absurd, beyond our best efforts to expose unbelief. Even as I witnessed the torment experienced by Michael Keaton, I was completely untouched by his demise. Until the credits, I diligently expected something - anything - of substance to connect with the story of the characters, but such relief never came. Sure, there were occasional heart-stopping moments, but only because loud sounds tend to do the dozing viewer. <br /> <br /> While the drama was lame, Michael Keaton may have played his most recent role. Perhaps the only redeeming quality White Noise has to offer is the impressive archetyle in both Keaton residential areas. Overall, White Noise leaves behind the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three vicious shadows to make the living follow the dead and follow their own graves.
