Action: The thirty-four-hour film adequately deals with the events in the Kargil sector near the LOC in 1999, when the Pakistani infiltrators crossed the LOC and deeply penetrated Indian territory and retaliation. To learn more about the story, I would recommend that readers read the news about Kargil. Comment: If you are looking for a formula story in this film, you can be sure that you are absent. LOC is a story about pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and many, many bullets and blood. The movie theater where I saw this movie was full of whistling and cheering when the movie shows Indian Bravery. The audience seemed to be similar to the crowd as in a cricket match between India and Pak. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie as a tribute to the victim of the army and for the characterization of the real war heroes (4 PVC heroes). who have sacrificed their lives so we can see this day. The film has made a brilliant portrayal of the army, which has fought against adversity in adverse weather conditions. The negatives of the movie are that it is too long and the songs are extremely boring.
