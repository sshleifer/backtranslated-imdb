I've been a big Lynn Peterson fan since her breakthrough in the blockbuster movie "Far North" in 1988, and although I loved her in her other film "Slow" (2004), in which she plays "Francis," this is your strongest role is far and wide. <br /> <br /> Lynn, as you surely know (or should) all, plays the crucial role of "Driver". Unfortunately, others I'm afraid for this movie is not the amazing accomplishment of Lynn. There is not really much waiting for him. <br /> <br /> Oh, there was another thing - the amazing creativity of editing to take profanity away from the television viewers. Memorable lines like: "You bastard!", "You son of a bitch!", "Shooting!" And, well, forget yourself! <br /> <br /> O.K. Bye. <br /> <br /> P.: Does anyone know where I can get another Lynn Peterson poster?
