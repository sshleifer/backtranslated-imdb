** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. Serious. Absolutely terrible, the FX are awful and the plot is really awful. But hey, it's so bad that it's fun to watch! The script is so bad that it's fun! You just have to flinch and over lines like "I guess that's what you call CROCTEASING". as the women flash their breasts onto the crocodile. I mean COME ON that's funny because it's so bad! It has such terrible jokes that they are funny! But after a while, it just gets too much if the movie becomes crap. I really started to fall asleep. But trust me, the plastic crocodile foot on the leaves and the constant sweep of a jug's tail will make you laugh for a long time. Although I have to say that it had a cool part when the crocodile tore this guy in half and he just hung there for a while and figured out what to do. Heh heh mindless movie that had to be nominated for the MST3K line !!
