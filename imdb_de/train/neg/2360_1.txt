This will be the most useless comment I've ever made, but I have to do it to warn you of the cruelty of the movie that is Freddy's Dead. Not only is it the worst chapter of the Nightmare series, it's also the worst horror episode ever! It was boring, pointless and almost deathless. The terrible 3-D end and the exaggerated CORNY kills are enough to drive this "movie" into the ground. It does not stop, it just adds bad acting, a terrible script and a bunch of cheesy cameos, and you've got this bunch of guano! It is no wonder that Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, performed twice after death. I would do it, too, if I went out like this. This is a movie reserved for fans only. Do not stare at our shame.
