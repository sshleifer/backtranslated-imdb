I should love this movie. Acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great, but the movie always seemed trivial to me. The film makes workers of the working class look cheap and cheap. The fact that the daughter of her mother is ashamed and the daughter does not rise above it, has always made me a little restless. Barbara Stanwyck adores the mother as a daughter, but the daughter does not want mothers to be happy with their family. I wonder how many others who have seen this movie feel that way. Once again the acting was very good and worth it to see it. I really do not like the story. just a personal preference
