This is a story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. The parents got divorced and mother stays in the east to the east. His father, Murray Abromowitz, moves to California with his children and moves to Beverly Hills to give his children the best possible education. <br /> <br /> When Marisa Tomei, Murray's niece, arrives, it becomes really fun living with the group. <br /> <br /> The film is about the different adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the affluent neighborhood. Jessica Walter Costars as a woman who wants Murray To move in with her because she wants to have a companion. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno are coming to an end. They play Murray's brother and sister-in-law; They are also the parents of Tomei. In front of the kids, Reiner remembers reminding Murray that he's been paying the bills all the time. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a sour note as the embarrassed family takes off their fancy digs to drive Beverly Hills in their car. I think the movie promotes independence and a good old self-esteem.
