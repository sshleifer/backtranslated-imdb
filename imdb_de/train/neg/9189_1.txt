This movie has received a lot of bad press from people who do not understand what it should be. You have to understand that this movie should never be taken seriously. It's a camp, similar to Army of Darkness. AoD was stupid but funny and bad in a good way. "House of the Dead" is not good "bad". <br /> <br /> Good fighting films are endowed with qualities of which the most credible fantasies are most important. You have to believe what happens in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong. Without borders, the film becomes absurd. HotD has no credibility. Worse, HotD brings nothing new to the genre, repeating the same twists and turns of character that many horror films inevitably show. Too often, horror films fall into the trap, where the main characters find love between anger and destruction. I do not know about you, but if I'm being followed by zombies, I want to come out with a hot chick. Believe it? No? Then you probably will not believe it when the characters suck each other's faces. <br /> <br /> Besides the obvious problems that plague this movie like many other horror movies, Uwe Boll decided to add scenes from the zombies video game when a character shoots a zombie in the movie. Not only is there no clear justification for this artistic decision, it distracts from an already incredible conspiracy. In addition, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad drama and seemingly no attempts by the director to direct the reactions of the actors to events ... leave the film without redemptive qualities. Avoid...
