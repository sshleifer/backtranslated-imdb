All the naked women in the world could not stop me from pushing the stop button about a third of the way through this horrible garbage. With the mocking spectacle, equally horrible script plus the bad CGI FX to match; This movie is an insult to the werewolf genre. It should be serious, which in itself would be funny, if this film could even manage to be a bad joke. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies where the people behind the camera are obviously knowledgeable but too lazy to make another quarter decent. Avoid it and look at one of the classic werewolf movies instead. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
