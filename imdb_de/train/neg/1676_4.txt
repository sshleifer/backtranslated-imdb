Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very committed actors who give decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes He is notorious for his goodness, a drug addict and a man who continues to make adult films despite AIDS blackmail, but does not make a fascinating character. The story surrounds the events that led to it and the aftermath of a brutal mass murder that took place in Los Angelos in the late 1980s, with which Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder, and eventually acquitted. As in the case of OJ, the guilt factor was quite high, regardless of the outcome in the "He has it" zone. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there is no one to sympathize with is a selfish criminal. Here is simply nothing far interesting.
