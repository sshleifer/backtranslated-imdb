Do not bother. A bit of ham could go a long way, but we only get pure ham, especially from Dunaway. The plot is one of those bumper car episodes ... the vehicle jumps into another and everything changes its direction until we just scratch our heads and wonder if there's ever been an action. Gina Phillips is actually good, but it's hard to play against a mysterious Dunaway who lost Lady Macbeth to Marx's Brother's Duck Soup. Ah, the raven ... now there is an actor. And there is the relative who is lying and walking and looking ghostly. Or dr. Dread filled with darkness and no work equipment. I'm one of those who just have to watch a movie. Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore".
