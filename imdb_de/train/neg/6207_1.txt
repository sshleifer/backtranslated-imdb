This film commits what I would call an emotional rape of the viewer. The film was supposed to cause a stir among the critics in Cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to attract attention. Hardly anybody in the discussion about violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other topic). The metamorphosis of the main character from the good but restless boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent, while the rape scene (an exaggerated version of the rape scene from "A clockwork orange") is unbearable and I refuse to comment on her aesthetic values. There are some things an artist should not do to reach his goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Finally: shockingly brutal, seditious and not worth the time. See "Orange Movement" or "Le Pianiste" instead.
