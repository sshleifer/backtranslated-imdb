Strictly a routine, after the number Western (Director: Genre-Mainstay Andrew V. McLaglen, is this a miracle?). Colonel Brian Keith saves with the smarmy bandit Dean Martin, who has just kidnapped the colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who had never found his niche after playing Pussy Galore in Goldfinger). Fist fights, shootings, stagecoach raids and Denver Pyle in a supporting role ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Keith consistently speaks in a low monotony and has to indulge with a prostitute (a shock after running "Family Affair" on TV), but otherwise this low-rent material wastes Keith's loveable talents. It's also bad news for Dino, who does not seem to notice or interest it. Hack direction, bad writing and several listless attempts of lowball humor. * from ****
