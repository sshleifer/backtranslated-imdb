I do not buy kung fu films for an action. I buy them for fight scenes. A bad action can be awarded for excellent combat scenes, but not the other way around. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, but too slow for my liking. There were about 3 or 4 mediocre combat scenes, each lasting only a few minutes. The last fight was a bit longer, but at that point I was so bored that I did not even pay attention.
