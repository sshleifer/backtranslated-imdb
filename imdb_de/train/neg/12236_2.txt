That just should not have been done. It is predictable and clich√©d. The chemistry on screen that made the first "My Girl" so intriguing is nowhere to be found, and acting as a whole is stilted and forced. The writing also leaves something to be desired, some of the "memorable" lines such as "ear circles of a barbarous custom" are simply shocking. While "My Girl" evoked true feelings of sadness and some really funny moments, "My Girl 2", like so many sequels, tries to reconstruct these emotions generated by the audience and fails miserably. Maybe I feel heavy in this movie because the first one was great, but honestly, it offends the quality of the original with the type of eardrum that this edition offers. Certainly this must approach "Son of the Mask" as one of the worst episodes of all time. In both cases, the old adage sounds right; "If it is not broken, do not fix it".
