Spooks is a fun trash that includes some well-directed sequences, ridiculous acts and dialogues, as well as some third-rate plays. Many have described that it is a British version of "24", and you can see the similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version shares the faint stupid conspiracies, but the execution is so much slimmer, sexier and I suppose expensive. <br /> <br /> Some people describe weak comedy as a "gentle comedy". , <br /> <br /> This is a gentle espionage, the exact opposite of John Le Carre. <br /> <br /> Give me smiley face every day.
