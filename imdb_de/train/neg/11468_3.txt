I do not know who came up with the idea that orcas run around killing people and destroying and destroying things in revenge, but my god is absurd. Orcas are definitely not the cold-blooded killer this movie makes of them ... it's stupid. Orcas are extremely intelligent, do not get me wrong, but I very much doubt that they know and understand a concept like revenge. So I have to say, all I got from this movie was the conversation, how absurd it was. So at least I was a little bit amused. I would personally recommend visiting Jaws if you want to see a movie that is Animal Killing Humans. But if you're like me and want to laugh at something that's so far from realism, then I'd say go ahead. : D
