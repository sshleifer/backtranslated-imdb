The first part of the series was brilliant and certainly one of the best horror movies ever. That's the most annoying thing. When I sat down to look at it, I actually thought that the fourth and fifth should be bad. That would have to be good after the previous terrible ones. Boy, I was wrong. Incredibly wrong. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first ten minutes, I was really tempted to turn it off, but I thought no, maybe it will get better. That was not the case. <br /> <br /> This is not just a horrible movie in itself, it did not need another sequel, as the last two (fourth and fifth) were already terrible enough! How many times can you bring Freddy back? The drama was terrible, the story was predictable and crap and it had flaws too. The way they made Springwood was just totally wrong. Does not relate at all to the first. In addition, the whole thing seemed really over the top. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this movie is "funny". This movie is not "funny" at all. Since when should Freddy Krueger be "funny"? I would call it weird crap. This movie is supposed to be a horror movie, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, this information would not have come up like in the first one! The end was also just stupid and cheesy, just like the rest. This destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first completely. Just show yourself. Too bad that Wes Craven created something so good at first, but it has to be pulled down because of this garbage trash. They should not have bothered to make this movie. Neither of the other sequels except the third. The third is the only decent of all the sequels. <br /> <br /> If this was a DVD by itself and not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD set that I got, I would have ejected it while unpacking. I got it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A miserable and bad attempt to continue. <br /> <br /> - a complete MOCKERY of the first movie <br /> <br /> So please, do not waste your time with this worthless garbage.
