I did not expect much from a movie shot by Sidney J. Furie and Dolph Lundgren, but I certainly expected more than a good one. A one-line user commentary - action movie of the second choice - did not seem too disparaging for a Lundgren movie. On the other hand, I would not have watched this movie if the rating was below 5.0, but hey, the movie had a rating of 5.9 out of 10, which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this type of production. <br /> <br /> Well, I understand that the 37.5% of people who rated this movie 10 (excellent) were clearly a publicity stunt, because Detention is the regular Nu Image trash you do have seen again and again. <br /> <br /> Lundgren is not convinced when a former military turned a history teacher who was assigned to a rough school. His acting is just terrible, emotionless and invented. Lundgren's inability to act becomes clearer in the scenes with juvenile delinquents. Either they are great actors or, compared to Lundgren, they seem to be great actors just because they seem natural and believable. <br /> <br /> DETENTION has some elements that may have been interesting for this low-budget movie - a closed film - for the high-security high school on the weekend, four teenagers in detention with a war veteran teacher and one Group of ruthless criminals wanting to get in - but the story (something like THE BREAKFAST CLUB hits DIE HARD or is it a PANIKA ROOM?) Is full of incredible situations, many clichés and stereotypical characters. And not to forget that Dolph Lundgren is the lead actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dobó fall in love with each other in Bonnie and Clyde and they deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie, even though it looks like it looks bad. Budget version of Sam Rockwell and she, a Milla Jovovich wants to be. In a movie where everything fails, her craziness and style provided enough fresh air to keep my interest from sinking to zero.
