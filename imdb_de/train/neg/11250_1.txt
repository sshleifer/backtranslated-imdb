I like the time, I like the try, but watching a movie that looks like I'm looking at it through a Coke bottle makes me headache. If I played computer games that were so blurry and fuzzy, I would update my computer. Could be that this was the look the director was looking for, but not that it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I had not taken anyone, I would be out of it. Although it's a series and not a movie, Band of Brothers has done it. They made it look like World War II images, with a touch of graininess, but it was still a pleasure to see it. Movies need real people with real scenes and real places. If appropriate, do not use CGI for an entire movie.
