This movie is lousy for lack of a better term. Where do I start ...... <br /> <br /> Cinemaphotography - This was perhaps the worst I've seen this year. It looked like the camera was being thrown from cameraman to cameraman. Maybe they only had one camera. It gives you the feeling of being a volleyball. <br /> <br /> There are a number of scenes that happen to be dropped without continuity. When they did the "split screen", that was absurd. Everything was squeezed flat, it looked ridiculous. The shades were far away. These people need to learn how to balance a camera. This 'movie' is badly done and done badly. <br /> <br /> The plot - you have to joke. If I was an SS agent, I would sue the producers. looked like the Marks Brothers with radios and cannons. Sutherland was in his "24" mode - I can see it for free. Eva Longoria would have been better with a little less and much more show. As an action bimbo she was not much. <br /> <br /> I could not see any real conspiracy, except for Douglas, who muttered to the president's wife. Never said why the mercenaries tried to kill the presidents. I just do not see the President of the United States run into the tunnel of a building like a rat in a labyrinth for his life. p-l-e-s-a-e. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This movie is the proof. I like 'the big screen'. Have been since I was a kid. Many more "movies" like this and I will stop going. What's going on in Hollywood, where there were so many chick movies, how to make a real movie? If I own a theater, I would run the old movies. The one with real actors, good storylines - and good cinemaphotography. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' is a dog. Do not waste your time or your money. I rate this 'movie' as zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can see his age, but he's just too much of a pimp to take it.
