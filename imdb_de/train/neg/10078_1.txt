Boy Girl Love Affair / Continuation with songs, only this time she is the punkette and he is the straight dart. Film fans really like this movie? It has fans? I have to say, the mind is spinning ... "Grease 2" is a really lame company that does not even have the guts to have Moxy or pure gall to burn the memory of its predecessor (like "Jaws 2 "Or Exorcist II") No, it whimpers in slow motion and often just plays dead. It looks cheap and feels cheap, with a large cast lost in a messy direction and unfocused handling - this was the first time that a large audience saw Michelle Pfeiffer, and although she does not embarrass herself, it is a role to be forgotten, a dropout on the lowest levels, NO STARS OF ****
