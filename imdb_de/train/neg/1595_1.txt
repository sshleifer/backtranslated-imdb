The movie seemed to interest me because of the new style of Pokemon Celebi. But of course the plot was not as interesting as the other films. It was a waste of money and time. The strange humor and clich√©d villains. The movie was not useful if you wanted to make Pokemon famous. The movie should not be associated with anime like Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. The drawing and settings do not match any level of the original anime. It's a pity to even talk about this movie. I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up Pokemon. Digimon is more anime and not close to Pokemon. His second film will be released at the end of 2002.
