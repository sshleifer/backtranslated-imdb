There are a few elements that save this film from total catastrophe, but are overshadowed by bad drama, potholes, Deus ex machina, stupid dialogues, weak scripts, and predictable stereotypes. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a horror movie with an action that goes nowhere most of the time. A group of unlikely heroes, including a black man who makes it first (yes, the clich√© seems to be very much alive even in Finland), seems to have difficulty leaving a mysteriously empty hospital. There are screeching ghosts (very resourceful), zombies (at least I thought at least that they did not use zombies, but they did come) and Finnish glam rock band with demonic make-up that stand in their way. There are also some time-shifting doodles, but that does not contribute to the plot. An autistic girl and a hobo seem to have a deeper understanding of a situation, but they never explain it to the viewer or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of profound thoughts from life lessons like, "What happens, happens ..." or "Light can not live in the dark ..." or the ominous "I need a red crayon ... a red crayon. " All of these characters (including the worried father and the sweet doctor in emergency situations) end up walking around dark bottoms and running from or by mistake to the demons. Occasionally, a ghost or group of zombies pops up, and when it seems like a demon keyboardist can not see a group of six people approaching him, flipping a flashlight and talking, it just did so. And apparently, this demon can break through walls without much effort, but opening the elevator door is beyond its capabilities. <br /> <br /> In the end we even get a sequence "everything was a dream". Or maybe not. Oh, boy, I wish this movie was like that, and that kind of thing that seems to make time faster, it all goes down in about 10 minutes ...
