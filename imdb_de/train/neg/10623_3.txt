"Three Daring Daughters" is a pathologically sweet, pink-eyed look at divorce, remarriage and single parenthood. Obviously, social issues and economic difficulties have no place in the perfect life of a single mother who feels exhausted, cruises and meets and marries a band member. Even if the phrase "It's just a movie" excuses the script for dealing with real problems, "Daughters" suffers from too many incoherent high-note songs. Children whose personality is not based on real children and the band leader Pants Iturbi who plays himself. Is not it bizarre that a real person plays in a movie in which their supposed real self is married? <br /> <br /> Granted, the movie was released in the 1940's. Only the love of Hollywood romance and old-style comedy could make "Daughters" a bearable movie.
