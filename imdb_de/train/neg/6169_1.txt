As a big fan of horror movies, especially J-horror and Gore, I thought Nekeddo buraddo sounded pretty good. I researched the storyline, read the reviews, and even took a few photos to make sure it was a good bloody and scary movie before downloading. It was so excited that it was ready and was ready to be disappointed with the amazing smell I expected. The plot was ridiculous and did not even make sense and left too much unexplained, the gore was more funny than horrible and what about the cartoon-style sound effects? Acting was probably the only thing that was a bit scary. I both understood the idea of ​​the cactus and the way the mother's husband disappeared after a flashing light in the middle of the sea, both inexplicably, or perhaps I missed it because my mind did not understand what I actually saw. I appreciate how it should be. shocking and a few scenes (the strange cannibalism and the own mother kissing?) were certainly, I just believe that they have gone a bit far and not even in a terrible way that they could not convince, which made it believable to be a comedy rather than a horror in my opinion. However, it is a very entertaining movie and has laughed a lot of me and a few friends, but unfortunately we expected horror and no comedy. It's well worth the entertainment value, but do not expect a dark, deep scary and horrible movie; You will be disappointed. If it was a horror comedy / parody, I would probably rate it at nine. The climax was the strange scene when the husband climbed into his wife's stomach and closed her wounds, but unfortunately as a horror I saddled him one.
