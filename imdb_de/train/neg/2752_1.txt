Whatever his name is (the author and the director) should be blocked in the hope that garbage like this will never be restored. This is a fight with some of the most terrible movies of all time. Sometimes films are so bad that they are somehow good. Not this one. That was so bad that I got angry. Serious. A drunken 10-year-old could find a better script. What a waste. ALL the actors were not at all inspired to work, the CGI was barely acceptable, the scene sequences were completely left behind and hurt the little story that existed, but I do not care how we got there, just shoot it down and put it in there. Shame on you, whatever your name is. Shame on you.
