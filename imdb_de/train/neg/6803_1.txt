When I get on IMDb boards, I'm always fed up when I see a "worst movie ever" post. After seeing this * movie *, I think I will soon make my own contribution. <br /> <br /> The opening titles: great, a kind of lame zoom on a gas stove (yes, focus on the fire = explosions = great action-packed movie !!) <br /> <br /> The actors: I think Ice T is a cool rapper, even a nice actor (sometimes, I say, "sometimes"), but the Steven Seagal cop he plays is ... beyond words. The rest of the cast is ... Well, I do not know where these actors were hired, but my goodness! I bet my dog ​​was a much better actor than she. The plot: Hijacking.original is not it? <br /> <br /> The action sequences: The first shot of the movie is an explosion. I said, well, cool !! At least there will be some nice pyrotechnics. I was absolutely wrong. The remainder of the film is mostly filled with cheap stockpiled by the Luftwaffe. The dialogues are hilarious, the music is sheer crap, the end is happy (I mean, I was happy in the end, because the movie was over !!!) <br /> <br /> My cousin, who saw the movie, I was excited (I'm 22, she's 42 ... well) .I was about to record the movie and burn it down. Maybe next time I'll see ... (who never said ???)
