I never thought I would see a movie worse than "Lisa Picard Is Famous", but that came pretty close to me. As often repeated in the comments, it was predictable; Five minutes after the movie starts, you know it will be stranded at the result of the change. This film painfully refers to everything from "Something about Mary" to "Revenge of the Pink Panther". Writer Greg Glienna (Meet the Parents) needs new material. <br /> <br /> The only twist is the confused friend / policeman being persecuted by internal affairs, but even this opportunity is wasted. Many settings of the Seattle Space Needle are necessary to disguise the obvious Canadian target area. Some of the worst situations in which the car drives the worst, make almost no effort to disguise the fact that the car is pulled on a trailer through the city. Gosh, at least turn the wheel or brake every now and then. Selma Blair is lazy and the short haircut a crime. $ 3 million for Jason Lee, for what? Guess, it's about skateboarding! <br /> <br /> So here's who should watch this movie: Bee Gees fans who want to hear two actors "Islands in the Stream" listening badly; People who can not get enough of Julia Stiles. 1.10
