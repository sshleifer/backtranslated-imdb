The super sexy B-movie actress has another role as future "Goodfellas" star Ray Liotta's girlfriend at this box office. She plays Marion, has only one line dialogue, well, actually a word dialogue. She calls "Joe!" As Ray's character hurt poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This movie is so bad, though sometimes it gets funny. The guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love that! Look at the hysterical scene at the end, where Pia has a nervous breakdown, and all the cheesy edits and effects that they do to show how bad Pia's character is. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood scriptwriter. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yes exactly. Pia can hardly talk, let alone write! Pia is absolutely and absolutely wrong in this stupid role. But who cares? The real star is the hot and fresh Glory Annen in her role in the opinion of this cat! Rock on Glory!
