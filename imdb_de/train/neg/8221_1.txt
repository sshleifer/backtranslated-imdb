This "movie" tries to follow the genre of low-budget hand-held camera flicks that have proven to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This one fails and HOW. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how many so-called "awards" this piece of rubbish has been plastered on the cover ..... You wonder what these critics were when they actually submitted that .... <br /> <br /> words do not describe how absolutely awful this movie really is. Seriously, it's THE BAD. <br /> <br /> I saw it flat in 20 minutes with an almost uninterrupted fast-forward. <br /> <br /> From garbage lighting to terrible directing, grainy visuals to subdued sound and, of course, not to forget that the ABYSMAL acts, this was a completely and completely pathetic piece of so-called filmmaking. <br /> <br /> It really has no redeeming qualities - whatever. Save cash and see a decent horror strip on a low budget. There's a lot out there - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, just to name a few. <br /> <br /> AVOID this rubbish at all costs. Do not waste your money or your time with this junk pretending to be a real movie. <br /> <br /> Note all the other comments! You were warned!
