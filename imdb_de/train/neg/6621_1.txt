Somewhere something must have gone horribly wrong when the director realized this conspiracy. The film, which was supposed to be the remake of one of the most popular movies in the cinema, can not compete in all areas of filmmaking. The best artists could not pick up the mood either, it simply shows that the movie was a serious mistake in itself. <br /> <br /> The processing is bad. Direction is crap. Spectacle is not of this world (omg)! The characters, who are supposed to look weird, force people to laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes. <br /> <br /> I would not watch the movie, even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it.
