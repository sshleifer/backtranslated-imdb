Brokedown Palace is not the kind of movie I would ever like to see. I did not like the movie when an Aussie man smuggled drugs in Thailand and accused Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale of drug smuggling. I would not go to this country, no matter how I saw this movie. In fact, this film stinks. I prefer to travel to Germany to meet beautiful single women. I tolerate Germany. I also prefer to stay in the United States. After seeing some of the movies in the theater, including the false accusation of drug smuggling, I left the theater and had my money refunded because I could not tolerate this movie. If you go to Thailand to meet someone who could be a drug smuggler, forget that!
