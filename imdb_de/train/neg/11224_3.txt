... and even then they can live without seeing it. To be honest, this movie (if you want to call it that) is only interesting for bondage freaks. Bettie Page fans will absolutely not learn anything new (and I mean * nothing *), nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzys of experiencing something familiar, beloved or beloved. Nevermind the vile script, the wood, theater that does not function as a community theater, the total lack of direction, the lousy lighting or any other residual value of production. This is definitely "Hey, kids, let's do a movie!" Filmmaking the lowest order. I think you might be grateful that they at least knew how to operate the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that none of this is crucial, why this thing is so easy * wrong *. <br /> <br /> It's wrong because the young lady playing Bettie Page is a bit of a zaftiges girl, whose only resemblance to the queen of the curves is dark hair and the brand name Pony, it completely fails, something about the willingness to surrender, be bound and gagged. This seems to be a good thing for their film career before and since that wretched excess, but not for the miserable excess itself, which consists primarily of a series of lovingly re-enacted B & D set pieces ranging from awful to terrible faux-biographical Scenes are embedded that delineate Ms side falls out of grace (so to speak). There is probably more information per se about Page's life in the opening and closing credits than in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. This is not a worthy companion to "The Notorious Bettie Page". This is not a worthy movie at all. This is a fetish piece that takes on the appeal of one of the greatest pin-ups of all time, and does so without instruction, style or understanding of the character of Bettie Page. No real Bettie Page fan will find anything but a disappointment, I guarantee. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. When you are free, remember that time is money too. Yours may not be worth much, but I'll bet it's worth enough that you're sorry that you've wasted time with it. That's it, I'm done, you've been warned.
