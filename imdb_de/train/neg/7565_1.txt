This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars I've spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how many times I went to the movies, you would probably say that's hard to imagine, but still it's true! After watching the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it! If you are a fan of horror, mystery and tension, why not? The trailer is no less than fascinating and exciting. Unfortunately, the movie is none of this. <br /> <br /> From cinematography to screenplay to acting, this film is an absolute flop. If you're reading this, plan to go to the movie and expect some thrills, mysteries, action, horror or anything but a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes. I'm afraid you will be disappointed. > <br /> "Why is it so bad," you may ask yourself. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor exciting. Nothing about the film made me the least "marginalized", scared or curious. The script was ridiculous at best. There were many times during the film where the dialogue was so ridiculous that I wrote it off as comic relief, only to find out a few seconds later that this was not the case. The acting was absolutely terrible. I like Nicholas Cage, but that was a miss. Without exception, every performance in this film was unbelievably below average. The cinematography was terrible and there was no moment of tension or mysticism. After all, the story is completely transparent. You see the end of this movie a mile away. <br /> <br /> I am usually not a very sharp critic. Honestly, when I see a comedy, I want to laugh and when I see a mystery / suspense / horror, I just want to be surprised. This movie was boring, badly played, poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and look at something else.
