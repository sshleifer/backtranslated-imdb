Although the likelihood of anyone focusing on this comment is low among the other 80+ for this film, I feel like I need to say something to this film. I'm not a filmmaker who values ​​production value, thought-provoking dialogues, or brilliant acting and directing. I say, however, that this movie is shit. I do not know why I do not like it ... I mean, it has almost everything I want from a horror movie: blood, monstrosity, unintended humor, etc. According to this evidence, it should be my favorite. Still, Zombi 3 is a Baaad movie. <br /> <br /> There are just too many things that make you scream at the screen. Like when the girl leaves the army man, when her car breaks down to find water (this does not spoil anything, so do not worry). She goes into something I see as an abandoned hotel or something. Did not she see that there was a damn lake in the middle of the building? Yes, she is looking for water and walks past a lake. Why? Because she wants to know why the people (who are not there because the place is abandoned) do not answer her when she calls, "Is there anyone there?" Oh, that's just a small, insignificant piece of the big picture I paint. <br /> <br /> However, there's a reason why I've given this movie more than a star. It's one of those movies where, forgetting how bad it really is, as I've done it a few times, I'd like to revisit the movie because it's so exaggerated in every way. I called it blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, it has a sea of ​​blood. It also has pretty weird creatures in it: a zombie baby (with a hand for adults?) And a magically flying head, just to name two. <br /> <br /> You know when you try it when you think of the worst and the coolest movies ever made, and you come with science fiction films from the 50s? I think Zombi 3 and movies that like it should outperform it. It has all the elements: scientists arguing with the government, warnings about the apocalypse on the radio, armies fighting monsters, and so on. This is the plan 9 of the 80s! While I will not say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it, expect the worst. And if you find that the expectation that the worst is expected will be underestimated, Zombi 3 will not be that bad. You really like it, I'm not saying that's impossible. <br /> <br /> Do not think I hate this movie, I ... really do not. Oh, P.S. Killing Birds (also known as Zombie 5)! (Have I just injected my credibility?)
