Despite all the subtle charms this student film could contain, anyone bored to death was waiting too long at WENDINGO to showcase their papier mâché face to develop me. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm very interested in exploring the dark underworld of America, but this is a fucking flambé, just because of the fact that p. Clarkson looks hot and takes it sadly out of a guy's wings. <br /> <br /> the best 2 minutes the movie has to offer. <br /> <br /> If you feel like DELIVERANCE demolished, you could do better.
