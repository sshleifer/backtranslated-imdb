WARNING: I recommend anyone who has not watched the movie not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> Although I did not see them all, the Hamiltons certainly provided a delicious piece of entertainment, which they did not. I do not talk at all !!!! I thought, along with the half-bad drama, stupid plot scheme, and the turn at the end of the movie, which was very cautious, this movie was crappy !!! Okay, so presumably these are people who eat other people. Yes ...... I said, people are not humans, not because they are not human, or wait, I think they are, OH NO WAIT, YOU WANTED NOT !!!! Okay, are these people cannibals or are they Inbreds or what are YOU !!!! I mean, maybe it's just "things" that came here to see how people taste or are it cannibals that have eaten people for a long time, or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! WHAT IT WAS !!! So, if you think the Hamiltons are good, I ask you why, why, WHY, WHY, why was it so great, because for me it was just awful !!! A great BOOOOOOO for The Hamiltons !!! See The Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail or Borderland for a bit of entertainment !!!!!
