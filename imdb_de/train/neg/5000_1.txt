This is probably the worst excuse for TV programs because, oh, I do not know WHAT HAPPENS NOW? NOTHING happened on this ridiculous "series". Although shot mostly by Britney and Kevin himself, you do not get good details in their personal lives. It is usually only them who do stupid, funny small talk and behave like white trash. Look, I love Britney's music as well as the next baby, but this show is just a pure filler for a nation that makes Britney so addictive that she would see her clip off her toenails (yes, that could be a real episode ). Fortunately, the two separated because they were boring PAINFAL. This show is TOXIC!
