Well, I hate Hollywood, but I love cinema, so I have to watch those horrible movies in the movies. And I was hoping that Vanilla Sky would be good. I had hoped that they would either keep the original "Open Your Eyes" exactly the same or that they would make it their own. Well, it was a bit of both, and it was shit. <br /> <br /> It started well. I love Radiohead. I wish there were more. But in the end we hear Good Vibrations from The Beach Boys. Talk about a wide range of sucking between. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a few others, but why did they have to blow GV during the climax? It was more annoying than confusing or crass. Especially if it has nothing to do with the property. At least one meaning behind the songs. Child A = primary. What ever. <br /> <br /> He has also done a great job in the club scene. That was cool. Otherwise the movie was a big arrogance. As if the audience would get the movie. Those who would get it will read subtitles, and the rest will not. It's that simple. The motivations were all messed up. I did not understand the motives of Diaz (did not they make the chicken soup before?) And some others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay overboard. Tom Cruise can not act (especially in these movie types [ie H. Eyes Wide Shut]). And the elevator. I get it. Still, they've tried to improve the original with a crappy American rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and shiny workmanship, and it would have helped if Crowe had not messed it up.
