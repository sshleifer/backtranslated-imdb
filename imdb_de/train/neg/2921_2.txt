The story is about a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris) hired by her Estee Lauder-style beauty queen, Aunt. Her aunt (by marriage we have to assume that she has to assume) tries to track down her lost family in Europe. All you have to do is take a photo of a young girl standing next to an ornate music box. The researcher travels to Europe and conducts her research in places such as Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The scenery is right, and is actually filmed on-site (unlike a murder, She Wrote where Jessica was supposed to visit a distant scene and never left Lansbury Burbank). Anyway, she meets a young man who is also looking for a family secret and they work together to find clues and threaten villains. The dialogue, especially the romantic dialogue, is terrible. I saw it because of the scenery, but the script was so bad I just stayed to see if it got any worse. It did act was too. I can see why Mel Harris's career has never really started after thirty years, but it's fair (seems too old for her teammate). The supporting players are however directly from the community house. I have not even counted how often they say "Budapest" together. Yes, it is pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know, okay? Halfway through the movie, I realized that this had to be one of those harlequin movies, and that's really it. I think that says it all.
