Oh, just what I needed, another movie about 19th-century England. This is almost the same as in regular England, only the football stadiums are destroyed by anyone. In this picturesque setting of lords, dames, and other randomly chosen titles, Charlotte Gainsbourg wanders aimlessly as Jane Eyre into Mr. Rochester Nativity, where she tries to teach a French girl to keep looking at a blank slate. One day, Mr. Rochester (William Hurt of the autopilot) falls in love with Jane and all that, but there is still the matter with his wife, who is in the attic. That was not in the brochure. After some people were thrown around and some carefully burned fires (they probably rented the set), the movie finally comes to an end. Everything looked really authentic, that's something, I think. But then again, no.
