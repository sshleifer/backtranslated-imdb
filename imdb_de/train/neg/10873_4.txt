Many people thought that this is a good movie, but I disagree with them. At the beginning of the film, a spaceship crushed on Earth escaped, and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship. Then they killed some people on earth, but for no reason. Also, it is in a dark forest, I can not see anything on the screen, I can barely hear the sound. After a few days, the predator came to Earth, but no one had It sent signals to him beforehand, if he did not know what was happening on Earth, so there is a contradiction. Eventually, the robber found the headmaster of the aliens and killed him for no reason. He did not live on earth, it does not matter to him what happened here. After all, the duration of the film is only 90 minutes, the summary is too short and can not clearly inform the reviewers about the story. In conclusion, I do not think that this is a movie is good movie.
