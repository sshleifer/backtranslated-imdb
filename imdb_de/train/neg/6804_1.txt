This is one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot looked fascinating like that of Passenger 57. But with the last movie it worked a lot better. The plot was worked out in the worst way. Just a few of the film's awful moments: A flight attendant stands in the open door of a flying 747, trying to shut the door without being blown by the 250 miles per hour. After that, the plane lands at 8,000 feet from a distance of a few kilometers, which is impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. On the piste (of course completely straight) she is instructed to pull the flaps, HUH !! Upcoming flaps provide buoyancy at low speeds when you use thrust reversers on the runway and give maximum power! I can still talk about small and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my answer would be the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!
