I sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawned and still watched attentively. I waited for the next dreadful special effect or the next ridiculously stereotypical plot to show the full force so I could learn how to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It seems like they want to do that. The crew saw every other Action / Science Fiction / Shoot Em Up / Good Vs. Evil movie that was ever filmed, and saw cool things and said, "Hey, we can do that." For example, the only car parked within a mile on a one-way street with a shoulder that is not intended for parking is the car onto which the protagonist, an attractive bile-born brunette, is thrown. The car breaks up before it even lands on it. The special effects were obviously my biggest beef in this movie. But what really stood in my bad books was the implausibility and the lack of reasons for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to bizarre damage, encounters a single army transporter carrying an important VIP. Nameless security guards with guns get out of the car, you know they're already dead. Then the guy who protects the VIP says: "Do not leave this car, understand me?" He goes out to find the beast that killed his 3 friends. He is almost beaten like a cliche. Then, for no apparent reason, to defy logic, conventions and common sense, the dumb VIP comes out of the car !!! Much of what happened in the course of the film made no sense. Transparent plays distanced me from the movie as well as bad camera work and things you just let go: "Wow, that's unbelievably cheesy." Shiri Appleby saved the film from a 1 because it gave the film the element through which the audience can enjoy the experience, the sex appeal.
