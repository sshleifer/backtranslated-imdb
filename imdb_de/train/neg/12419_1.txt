Corrupted View of Kibbutz Life <br /> <br /> This film is less about a cultural story about a boy's life in a kibbutz than about the intentional demonization of kibbutz life in general. In the first two minutes of the film, the milkman responsible for the cows rapes one of his calves. From then on it goes downhill in terms of the characters that represent typical "kibbutznikim". Apart from the two main characters, a clinically depressed woman and her young son, every other person in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of evil. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around how the kibbutz slowly draws mother and son to despair and inevitably follows like a cult. There is no happiness, no joy, no laughter in this kibbutz. Each character / situation represents another terrible human vice such as misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, cultism, oppression etc. For example, while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European who is 12 years old? His older brother is a typical kibbutz teenager with his "Jewish" physical appearance and brutal personality. He is more concerned with shitting foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. He treats these volunteers like garbage. After his little brother has asked him to visit his dying mother, whom he has not seen for a long time due to his military service, he orders: Quote? "Linda, go take a shower and I'll be there in two minutes." <br /> <br /> There is another "good" character in this movie? a European foreigner playing the mother's friend. When the rapist tries to beat the mother's son, the friend defends him by breaking the rapist's arm. He is briefly thrown out of the kibbutz, then because of "violent" behavior against one of the kibbutz members. Even more hypocrisy: The indescribably annoying Frenchwoman who plays the teacher, preaches that sex can not happen before the age of 18 or without love, and reports on the actual act, which should be humorous for the audience, but really is just stupid , Of course, she screws the head of the kibbutz in the fields, which then tears the mother of the little boy, when her mental health deteriorates. <br /> <br /> The film shows the kibbutz as a kind of cult. Children are ripped from their beds in the middle of the night and led to a ritual in which they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders. The mother apparently can not "escape" the kibbutz, although in reality everyone was / was free and comes whenever he wants. It's a mystery how the boy's father died, but you can be sure the kibbutz "made him do it" and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless, wretched characters who burden the mother and her son. <br /> <br /> That's the core of this movie. One-dimensional characters, about dramatization, dry performances and a treacherous message that is constantly hammering into the mind of the audience? This kibbutz life was for those who did not "fit in", humiliating, miserable and even deadly. I'm sorry for the guy who made this movie? Obviously he had bad experiences in the kibbutz. But I feel as if he has taken some key points of the truth about kibbutz life and turned it into huge atomic bombs.
