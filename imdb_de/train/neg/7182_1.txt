I can not recommend a Christmas movie any more than this worthless jerk (trust me, double negatives are needed - so bad). This film had difficulty opening credit when it became known that the writer was the same person as the songwriter. The musical numbers are all too long and none of them is good ("Thank You Very Much" has a decent melody, but the lyrics are indescribably stupid). I would like to wear the chains that Scrooge wore in the bizarre hell sequence of the movie, to move me again to musicals through this insult. <br /> <br /> The only entertaining part of this film (by the way, unintentionally) concerns Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Dressed in a stupid, powder-white costume, Guinness dances through his scenes, which would either seem like he's floating like a ghost, or show his utter contempt for having to be in that awful movie. In the meantime, Albert Finney blends the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his hopelessly offensive character of Quasimodo / Scrooge. Finney's Scrooge is so abominable that it is impossible to believe in his transformation. <br /> <br /> Avoid filmmaking at this price.
