Why, why do blockbuster movies just not stick to their selling point? Everyone in the cinema, young and old, was there to see how talking animals made jokes, and although they did, we were all happy ... And then, as with Lost In Space, the two killer hits - action and Feeling. Who really cares what happened to the tiger or whether Eddie Murphy made up with his daughter? Not me, that's for sure.
