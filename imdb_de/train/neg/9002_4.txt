OK .... I have only 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and CHEESE! The only salvation feature of this film is Dean Cain. Other than that - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! <br /> <br /> The movie has something promising in mind - an underground lab creates a real live fire breathing dragon - which basically hits us more from "Jurassic Park" "Reign of Fire" ..... It There are some great options, but they just do not follow ... The special effects are decent - though you know the dragon is CGI, it does not look terrible out of CGI .... <br /> <br /> I would not dean Blaming Cain (though he's one of the producers), I blame Phillip Roth, the director and author. It's HIS job to shoot this movie ... and unfortunately it failed.
