The story: Young-Goon is a girl whose family is mentally ill. She ends up in a psychiatric hospital after she thinks she's actually a cyborg. In the asylum she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a connection to her. If you're reading this, you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But "I'm A Cyborg ..." is a big departure from the known and (unfortunately) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of movies or stories trying to do something different. God knows, we are all exposed to enough crap in our local cinemas. The most important point about the movie I have to say is that it does not say anything about mental illness or create characters that interest you. <br /> <br /> This story has to be one of the funniest things I've seen in years ... but funny is not enough. The film has no heart ... just surrealism and confusion. Confusion seems to be the main theme of the movie. All the characters try to understand their own problems, but it's Chan-wook Park that turns out to be the most confusing of all.
