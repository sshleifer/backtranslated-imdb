If someone simulates a classic movie, the remake is always less favorable than the original. There's also a chance that the remake is so radically different that it's just too unknown to the audience. <br /> <br /> Well, the 1973 version of Double Indemnity has almost identical scenes and dialogues as the 1944 original. The main difference is that the remake just does not seem to have any energy. Fred MacMurray was great as the lecherous, laughing insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna looks just tired and tired. Edward G. Robinson has given his role as MacMurray boss Barton Keys great manic energy; Lee J. Cobb, a good actor, seems almost bored. Samantha Eggar is anything but the engaging, recoiling Phyllis Dietrichson; While Barbara Stanwyck was just great in this evil role, Eggar is too polite and accommodating and just seems inappropriate. Robert Webber, in the old role of Richard Gaines as Robinson boss Norton and John Fiedler If you take on the role of Porter Hall as a key witness, bring some life to the film. In particular, Webber does a good job at the role of Norton in a 1970s context. <br /> <br /> But after the movie starts, the whole thing is just there, without life or electricity. This is a movie that should never have been redone.
