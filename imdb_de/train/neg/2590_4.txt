American Pie has been far from the first. At first, I think the actors have no idea what they're doing, and instead it's just a remake of a college party that's gone crazy. The story begins with two college boys (with the young stalker) showing the dreams of a college visit to experience the late-night parties, sex and, of course, alcohol. The plot is stupid and comes a long way from the original cake. In fact, there was no apple pie in the film. <br /> <br /> Luckily I work in a video library and can rent it for free. But remember, it's a waste of time, unless you enjoy mindless sex movies with absolute nudity and crazy drinking. I am a teenager myself and I believe that even Evan Almighty would have been the better choice.
