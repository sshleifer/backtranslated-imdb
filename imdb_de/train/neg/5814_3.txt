The film did exactly what it set out to do: show how a young girl copes with poverty and matures. However, for most of us, this topic has been researched appropriately and in most cases with more sophistication than here. The film was fixed on breasts, which soon became boring and I lost interest. If this was on TV, I would have switched to the latest news in the Starr report. I found this movie so boring.
