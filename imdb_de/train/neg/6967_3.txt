Oh god, what an idiotic movie! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects (the creature is played by a man in lame costumes) and stupid plot. All dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... they are just ridiculous. For example, I have never seen such annoying characters as this garbage (those stupid kids or the pregnant wife with his husband and many more). All in all, this is great entertainment when you are drunk. Avoid it like the plague. Am I drunk? I do not think so ...
