All hype! How can you describe a movie better when people are upset because they can not release their movie through a mainstream distributor? Consequently, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the hype of the film does not justify the content of the movie. The story is missing and could easily be short. Acting is bad, but the animation and music is pretty good. Otherwise, do not waste time - do not believe the hype! However, if you have the opportunity to watch the movie for free, do so. Then you do not have to waste money. Nevertheless, the filmmakers are doing a good job shaping their story and creating Cliffhanger with their smug mini-series. Otherwise, they are a hit that never had a hit.
