All I have to say about this film is the scene in which Shaq stands in a musical number with Francis Capra's character because he wants to be a genius; Never see this movie The story is awful, the acting is awful (come on, it's Shaq!) and I would see Capra twice in Free Willy (equally terrible) before he ever saw this movie.
