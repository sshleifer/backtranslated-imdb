As a film critic for several Dutch websites I have to watch a lot of movies and not all very good ones. Some films are so bad that you will not be surprised that they are released directly on video. With taboo I'm surprised that it even appears on video. This is really bad, badly written stuff. <br /> <br /> A group of teenagers is playing taboos. They write down their most disgusting wish or act, and later people are murdered for their taboos. The question is, should we believe what we see? <br /> <br /> The film has a potentially interesting turning point and I will not reveal it here. But what might have been interesting would be stupid, badly played and without reason. Some of the actors have previously played in larger titles, so why did they sign up for it? If you see it everywhere, try to avoid it. There is no logic in this film, no human sense of quality.
