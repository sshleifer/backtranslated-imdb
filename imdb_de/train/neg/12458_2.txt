The premise of this film is so simple and obvious that only a Texas millionaire with oil fumes and whiskey could have a problem with someone shouting over the proverbial parking lot. In summary, the oil business is in close contact with the government (or rubber, if you prefer), the rubber is in contact with Middle Eastern despots, and the CIA is a unique, captivating pool of double deal sons (insert word) every line that gets in their way. The only people getting ready are the good ones, like Mr. Clooney ("Bob"). Terrorism is the result of poverty, which causes globalization when evil multinationals pursue the world and seek a tasty takeover. This really fits the profiles of the well-heeled 9/11 offenders. <br /> <br /> In Syriana, this slick web of political half-truths and Hollywood holograms is whirled up in revolting thread noodles by revolving story-lines. Turn and twirl through the gloopy orbits of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that: <br /> <br /> 1. The "director" (good joke) should never be near a camera again to be left. <br /> <br /> 2. People like Clooney and Hurt may know how to behave, but they do not know how to select a script. <br /> <br /> 3. If you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big companies and the state, visit Claude Chabrol's L'ivresse du pouvoir, which is enlightening, witty and brilliant. <br /> <br /> Empty, damn loaded, sentimental whistle turned on evening ruining length.
