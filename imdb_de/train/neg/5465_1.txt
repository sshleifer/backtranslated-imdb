This movie has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen. It's about as much fun as hard manual labor for stomach cramps. The movie starts badly (I would rate the first minutes of the film at 1/10) and then it gets worse and worse by the minute. The only way to evaluate it would be a kind of abyssal, spiral negative number that grows for ninety minutes. Unfunny is not a real word, but it describes the humor best in this video. Somehow the video manages to make cute, slightly dressed women and sex look grotesque and unpleasant. This movie is unbelievably bad. I would say it would be better if the TITANIC theme is played over and over again and Buscemi's character from ESCAPE FROM LA is pounding in your ear than watching this movie. The sequels are not nearly so bad. If you need to rent a Troma movie, get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I'd rather see 5 Tony Little infomercials back to back than see NUKEM HIGH's CLASS. Do not get me wrong, it took a criminal genius to make a movie so horrible, and if a movie has ever earned a prize for being terrible, that's it.
