The worst DCOM I've seen. Ever. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. That was just bad. The drama and the story were fine, but the impact SUCKED! <br /> <br /> They were so unreal! The only good fight scene was between the brother and Shen. That was probably the only scene I was excited about. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this movie very boring and the movie ended suddenly. <br /> <br /> I will give four to Brenda Song, who is a very funny actress and a fight scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
