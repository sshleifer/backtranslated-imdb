Have you ever heard the saying that people "telegraph" their intentions? In this film, the actions of the characters are not just about the telegraph's future plans - they're drunk in your house, turning you upside down. This could be forgiven if the attitude was better used or the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. Embeth Davidtz's character is not mysterious, only made of wood, and Kenneth Branagh fails to convey the bold charm his character has probably written. <br /> <br /> unlikely characters and grotesque "southern" accents of British actors.
