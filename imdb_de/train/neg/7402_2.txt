This is a typical example of high-tech directors of video clips / commercials trying to shoot their first full-length movie. On the one hand, images, camera, lighting, CGI and even the sound are highly polished and really "expensive". Even the actors show some potential - to the point where even the best actor can not hide a bad action. <br /> <br /> In this case it is not a bad act, but hardly an act. So the dialogue is 50% "What the hell was that?", "What was that?" and "what the hell was that?". In either case, however, one of the characters or the audience will receive the slightest indication of an answer. In most other dialogues, one has the feeling that there was never any form of dialogue book, and the actors had to freely improvise to an action that was never explained to them. <br /> <br /> The only reason for Skye Bennet's performance could be so good that her character as an autistic girl did not allow for those tragically horrible lines of dialogue that the other actors had to deal with. In this way, she could show her acting talent, to which the rest of the cast could not approach. I mean, there is no actor in the world who could make up for such a dialogue: Ben: Is that really true, right? Emily: Stop that. Ben: A mass psychosis, right? Jon: Someone has to get a handle on this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. Not from you, from anyone. Emily: Not even from you. Ben: No <br /> <br /> I got goosebumps. But not to horror, but to the terrible attempt. In a few moments, I was ashamed of the fact that the actors to their Vita. 2 stars for the excellent technical work added.
