Not as bad as some do, although they are obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh. Try not to compare Gabbar in the original, as they obviously do not have the same effect. However, apart from a few mediocre action scenes, the rest of the film is flawed. The character development was bad and the story was hopeless, with many gaps and missing information that I would not have known if I had not read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the movie was the supporting role of Nisha Kothari and especially this new guy named Prashant Raj. Nisha is just annoying since her lips open for the first time. Prashant Raj - who is this guy? Where does he come from and why in the world was he in the film studio for anything other than drinking drinks? His acting skills are virtually nil and he has the same tone, the willingness to dialogue and the firm expression in every scene, be it action, comedy or even a scene in which someone just died. Ajay Devgan was average, his remarks changed at least, which I can say more for his mistake of a companion. Overall, RGV's Aag is worthy of Amitabh's solid performance, as well as a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special performance.
