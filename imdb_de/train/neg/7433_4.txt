I have to be honest, first of all, that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle. Therefore, I can not give a full opinion about the movie until I fully see it. In essence, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), are planning a fortune to steal a shipment of contraceptive pills from the Finisham maternity home. Here the title character Matron (Hattie Jacques) works together with the coworkers Sir Bernard cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Ing. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Patients and their visitors are also nearby, including pregnant woman Tidey (Joan Sims) and her nervous father, Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). With Bill Maynard as Freddy and Wendy Richard from EastEnders as Miss Willing. Incidentally, this plan does not work because all employees are in the way. That's pretty much all I can say about the movie until I fully see it again. OK!
