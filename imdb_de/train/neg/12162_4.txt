This is not a horror, as the first part read: This is ("campy") light and humorous entertainment. As in so many sequels, the action begins without explanations. But there are breasts, so I'm not complaining. And real breasts that is. If I understand that correctly, it's pretty rare among A.'s teenage girls in America today. It reminds me that actress Pamela is "Bruce's sister" Springsteen. That can not be thought without the first movie, so I compare that to it. Again, there are too small clothes (mainly pants) and funny hair. It is not difficult to say in which decade this film is produced. Again, there are really strange characters, this time even more visible "pathological". Especially the staff of the camp. It's like a summer camp for mental rehabilitation. People are older: Most actors must be at least 25 years old, but I think they should be 16 or so. Some "methods" used by Evil Dyke are quite uncomfortable. Actually, this movie does not have much in common with the first part, and that's worse in every way.
