When I first heard about "Solar Crisis" and then got a lot of cast, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a large cast. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> For a film that encompasses space, the sun, vast deserts, and sprawling cities, this is an extremely cramped and claustrophobic feature; It feels like they are all huddled together, so the camera does not have to pull back too far. <br /> <br /> And the effects are good, but pretty oppressive; We talk about the impending destruction of planet Earth when a team of scientists and soldiers can not divert a deadly solar flare. But apart from screaming, sweating and red glowing at all, there is no real sense of emergency. <br /> <br /> Do not let me start casting. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, and others do in this film without worrying about the feel for the material, you can only guess. Wondering who the other condos in Hollywood are not paying for ... <br /> <br /> And to the end ... Well, let's say it's tense and intriguing, but it's too late in an effort like this. If it had kept the whole movie at this rate, I might have heard of Solar Crisis earlier. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly for lost chances and bad career steps. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Alan Smithee gets his job done so much rubbish?
