Who did the research for this film? It is located in Baghdad in 2004, but all soldiers wear ACUs and all have universal camouflage patterns. In 04 nobody wore this stuff. <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie when it was used abroad, and I can say that the overwhelming audience feeling was WTF? This movie made no sense, the characters came and went without explanation, and the people did ridiculous things that NEVER would happen in real life. I realize that this is a movie, but obviously he's trying to portray something real. It fails miserably, but it tries. <br /> <br /> It's as if someone had a bunch of random ideas, they chewed and swallowed and then put out a movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm still not sure why I've eaten the whole thing. GI Joe has really made you think about it. STAY AWAY!
