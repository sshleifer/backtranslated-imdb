A question for all the girls out there: If a man you've never met before accidentally called you on purpose and did so in the most indiscreet moments, you would be intrigued or freaked out by calling the police ? Yeah, that's what I was thinking, so I could not swallow the idea that Marti Gerrard was taking the undamaged attention of Connor Hill. <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> That's a really stupid story. Connor Hill's wife is murdered and the plot revolves around the question of Connor calling Marti so he can have an alibi? But there is a huge gap in logic here. Would not Connor have hired a batsman? something the prosecution apparently ignored. And was there no forensics at the scene? Why is the whole process resting on Connor calling Marti at the time of the murder? Stupid . Stupid . Stupid . And it is as predictable as it is brainless. <br /> <br /> I have a lasting memory of this movie that Marti Gerrard is a really crappy skier for someone who did the Winter Olympics
