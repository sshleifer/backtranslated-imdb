Flaming saddles! It's a fight between two estranged brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard) who can both kindle fire spiritually; They balance out childhood differences, while Debra Winger feels in love and in the midst of it. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the television presenter behind "Moonlighting") smothers the darkly textured comedy in Vince Gilligan's screenplay with such a smooth presentation. The film resembles a contribution from an overjoyed film student with a grant of $ 15 million. It has the prickly energy of a great commercial feature, but a formless style that does not highlight the characters beyond their crazy eccentricities. These are not even characters, but plot functions. Barely released in the theaters, the film is a disaster, though it looks strictly like an example of style and substance, it looks good. Winger is the only challenger in a cast who really looks baffled. * 1/2 of ****
