How much better would the renaissance have been with all their visual pleasures in live action. The animation is generally fantastic, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, much like the story and style of this movie. For real actors, the world of film might not have felt so lifeless. There is much to admire, but in the end, I realized that I could only admire. I did not like the movie so much, and it does make something clear that I have not seen before: that the visual elements can be the deciding positive aspect of a movie, but without a good story and strong characters everything can be in vain. I'm not going to go so far as to say that this movie does not work, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I love dark sci-fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two films that I thought were wonderful. But Blade Runner had his tragic villain and Dark City had a thoughtful story arc. Renaissance has shade and light, but little else. I wish I could have liked this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters got in the way. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic outburst of color and life. How ironic that one of the most bleak and lifeless films I've seen this year has its Renaissance title.
