With a film by Bo Derek, viewers get exactly what they expect. A thin paper shop and a few settings of Mrs. Derek in no clothes. "Ghosts can not" is just that. The first fifteen minutes is normal television dramas, while Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with extensive experience in many different roles, but it seems that even a famous actor sometimes has to work just for money. Bo Derek is the opposite, he always plays a strikingly pretty young woman with or without clothes. The movie is a waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence from Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see naked women or bad plays, borrow a porno movie.
