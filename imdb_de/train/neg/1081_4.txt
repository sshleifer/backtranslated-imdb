There is not a single sympathetic figure in this movie. Is it the lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh we should go for? Well, let's see - we learn that he is a defense lawyer who challenges criminals for technical reasons. He treats his staff like cattle, implicating them in his personal crisis (killing one of them), endangering his children's safety, threatening his ex-wife's new boyfriend, trying to arm the police - and all that for what? Because he thinks with his little head! I really tugged for the father and his gang to beat the lawyer's charge and drown him in the swamp ... that would have brought a satisfying end.
