Honestly, who in God's name gave this movie a rating of 8.1? I think the people who actually shot or played in the movie were the ones who voted. Otherwise, this movie is shit! This movie is nothing more than an amateur or possibly student movie. I'm a film fanatic and have seen horrible movies, but there was literally nothing redeeming here. The story and acting were the worst I've ever seen. The props, including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects, were just as bad as anything. I'm all for bad language in movies, but the F-bomb was dropped on every third word, and I think we may have a winner for most use of the F-bomb in a movie that has ever been. The film also seems to have been shot on cheap video cameras and not on films. I would expect this to get awards for an amateur movie that will only be shown at public stations across the country, but it does not belong on a DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not borrow this movie. I can only say that this was a terrible waste of a free loan voucher. This is a valuable time that you NEVER get back. Unfortunately, this time is lost for me, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this as my warning.
