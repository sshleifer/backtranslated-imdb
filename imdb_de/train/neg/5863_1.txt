I really can not believe that this movie is not the worst in the IMDB 250, he is absolutely terrible. When I first saw it, I remembered talking about it in a college class and two other people had seen it too. We told everyone else not to see it because it was so awful. When we were done, some others wanted to see it, just because they could not believe that something was as bad as we said. Do not be like her, just pass by. I am sure that anyone involved in this film would prefer never to see them in this film.
