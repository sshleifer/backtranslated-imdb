I was looking forward to watching this movie and seeing these great actors. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the script and the plot of the story. David Duchovny, "Connie & Carla", '04, was the doctor in history who uses drugs and loses his license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands visited a nightclub and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded client. Angelina Jolie (Claire), "Taking Lives" (04), who immediately turns to Dr. David Sands is attracted and supported. Timothy Hutton (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", '04, plays the Big Shot gangster and a man with all sorts of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems exaggerated in most scenes and is completely crazy as he tries to prevent his gang members from being killed. Gary Dourdan, (Yates), CSI-Vegas TV Series, plays a great supporting role and portrays a real COOL DUDE, a bodyguard for Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy, with her ruby ​​red lips, which draw a lot of attention from all men. This movie is not the best, but he entertains.
