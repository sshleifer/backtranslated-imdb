Since the little mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies in my childhood, I was curious about her sequel. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid (one) is a classic animated film with top quality and great music scores and is aimed at a general public. In contrast, the Little Mermaid 2 is primarily aimed at small children, as it is spontaneous, reflecting the child's self-perspective, the music is carefree and less dramatic, and the end acts as a break. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid 2 starts when Baby Melody is presented to the family of Ariel. Abruptly without visual cues to help the drama, a giant tentacle grabs the baby. I laughed, wait a minute, it's not funny, the baby is attacked! Okay, I stop laughing. Morgana's crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity takes on potential drama because it happened so quickly. Throughout the film, Melody seems to be superhuman, which I defend, as most children imagine. This quality in Melody's character is ultimately highlighted when she battles Morgana without fear of her face. <br /> <br /> Like the first movie, Melody has a lot of problems with Ariel, except on the back. Queen Ariel proves to be her father by restraining her from the sea, while King Triton restricted Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody are leaning against their parents. <br /> <br /> The music moves emotionally at first. This sequel contains a number of songs, but not so much orchestral work has been put into it. It's great for the little ones, because it does not take an orchestra to impress them. <br /> <br /> The end of the first movie was strong and uplifting. The sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone who plays in the water. It's definitely more about kids, because instead of being solemn and having you blown away, this end makes you think, "It's time for a break!" After all, this movie is fun for kids, so let's make it fun.
