Valentine is a terrible movie. I thought about it: <br /> <br /> Acting: Very bad. Katherine Heigl can not act. The others were not much better. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was fine, but could have been developed further. This film had the potential to be a great movie, but failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some music was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Originality: Not very original. The name "Paige Prescott" recognizes Prescott? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Do not look at Valentine. It's a really stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
