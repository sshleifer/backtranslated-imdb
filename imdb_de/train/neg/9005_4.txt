If Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other sci-fi horror movies are your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar and you get this. The movie begins in happy old England around 1100 AD and then jumps into today's California. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new chief of security and military advisor for a 400 meter underground science lab. He arrives with the senior scientist (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) and we quickly realize that it's a clone lab, and they've found something new that can be cloned. Is it a dinosaur or what? Like the movies above, hell breaks loose and our characters start to get picked up. The monster's special effects are pretty good for a "Direct to Video" movie and Dean Cain does what he's paid for. But forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before. Do not go there with high expectations and you will be fine.
