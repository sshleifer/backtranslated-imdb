I like many of the actors / actresses involved in this project. Therefore, it felt offended, as if the film was using unknown people. The main problem was that this movie was clearly just a concept designed for baby boomers for 30 years, Nbc is likely to make a film about the early 90s. I can now see a black family in which the children deal with the La Riot's, and the white family lets the kids rebel and hear grunge rock music. The soundtrack includes bands like Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden, etc. The Movie So this is as cheesy as the 60s and I guarantee you NBC will. The biggest problem with time pieces, when you buy networks, is that if you live in a certain amount of time, you do not think I live in it. The 1960s, or whatever the decade is, is trendy at the time. If someone does something like that, he should put more weight into his project
