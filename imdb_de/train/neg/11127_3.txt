I'm not sure what Diane Silver was thinking when she made this film, but it obviously had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel on which the movie is based. <br /> <br /> We've read the novel in the past summer for AP English 12, and have just watched the movie. During the periodic recording and checking of the clock, I thought about the chances of striking a bolt. Of course, the sky was clear, and I had to watch the rest of the movie ... and then write a five-paragraph essay about it. Wright's novel dealt with very real topics of a murderer's mind and the psychology behind it. Silvers Film made a victim of a murderer, which Wright did NOT want (see: "How Bigger was born" 454). <br /> <br /> I'll make it short and sweet: If you want to leave your consciousness in the words of Raphael Lambert, unoccupied, skip the movie and read the book. The 1986 amendment is not material to think about. <br /> <br /> ... :: sigh :: Now I have to write the essay.
