Terrible drama, lame plot, stupid story and just the horrible movie summarizes this piece of garbage. It was painful to sit through. Just awful. Do not waste a dime on it. Cinemas should feel bad if they actually make this film available to viewers. This "horror movie" was not the least bit scary, scary or disturbing. It was in no way visually appealing. Acting was so terrible to all the actors that any attempt to get you into the movie through dialogue is completely destroyed within moments of the actor / actress. Plus the whole story, I do not know why someone with this story would make a movie AGAIN. Do not waste your time or your money. Even if it's a free ticket, do not waste a moment watching this movie. You will feel stupid when you see it.
