Adapting games to the cinema is often a bad idea as it involves two different media. Do you think it's a great idea to make ZULU a stage play? Imagine two brave red coats sitting in a tent gasping for air. "Blimey, there are thousands of them." Great movie and a bad stage play br /> <br /> 1) A fine cast created on screen chemistry <br /> <br /> 2) Great dialogue <br /> <br /> Cher would be on paper and Chazz Palminterri is not a good choice in these roles. The story revolves around a batsman in which Palminterri broke into a house to kill a woman played by Cher, with most of the action taking place inside the house. I could not take these two characters seriously, though it was perhaps the fault of the script that could not decide whether it was serious or funny. Since the story is very static, it is of utmost importance that the dialogue shines. Due to the bizarre screenplay of the script, it is more than anything else embarrassed, with the conversation is mainly about sex acts. If you would like to see a great translation of a play transmitted to the screen, give FAITHFUL a mistake and see 12 ANGRY MEN instead
