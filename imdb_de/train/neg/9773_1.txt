When this was released, I thought this was one of the most mundane movies ever made. But thanks to Martin Scorcese and some other filmmakers like him, there were major linguistic films that were worse than this ... but this is a pretty brutal attack on the ears. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but that got ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard in vain half a dozen uses of the Lord's name plus countless F-words. I wonder how many people left the theater in 1990 and looked at it. I could not be the only one. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake were not the ones to be surprised. Since this movie Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image and at least played the Godly "Stonewall" Jackson in "Gods and Generals". Lang's role here is just the opposite: the perhaps worst person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Depressing, gloomy, semi-pornographic, repulsive These are just a few of the adjectives used by people, including some liberal critics, to describe this story, which is even worse portrayed in the novel. Of course, some of the better known critics, all extreme Libs, praised the movie. But they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted, as were almost all paying citizens. It is hard to believe that someone could praise dirt and garbage. <br /> <br /> Trust me: There are no good, sympathetic characters in this movie. This is a mean, sick movie: one of the worst of the "modern". That is, unless you enjoy seeing child abuse, drug abuse, teenage prostitutes, and so on - two hours in a row, nothing but atrocities and only bad people. No thanks.
