Terrible, just awful. It proves my theory about "star power". This is supposed to be a great television because the man who directed Titanica (Battle Star) is the same guy who has this shlop-shock over a chick. B O R I N G. <br /> <br /> Find something a thousand times more interesting - such as: B. your TV without picture and without sound. 1/10 (I rated it so highly b / c that there are no negative reviews in the IMDb.com rating system.) <br /> <br /> zaphoid <br /> <br /> PS: My theory "Star Power" is: The more "Star Power" is used in a show, the weaker the show is. (It's called an indirect proportionality: quality 1 / "star power", less "sp" provides better quality, etc. Another view is "more is less.") <br /> <br /> - Z
