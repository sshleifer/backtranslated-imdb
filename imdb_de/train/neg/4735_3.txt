It can not be denied that the first Azumi film was a commercial product. It was an adaptation of a popular manga and had actors of young, attractive actors, and certainly they were not lacking in the budget department. But it was more than entertaining for what it was, and I can not deny that I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> "Azumi 2" simply lacks everything that makes the original so wonderful. The first thing that should sound the alarm bells is the lack of the outstanding Ryuhei Kitamura at the wheel. With him, he seemed to have not only his own visual flair and kinetics, but also the original style, the beauty and above all the heart. While the first one had a simple "hitlist" plan, this one has a corkscrew mess of a story, and too many boring characters stand in the back so often that the potential for sympathy or pathos is wiped out. Way is the effective interaction of the main characters; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a group of hopeless teenagers arguing in a forest. Characterization is absent; When someone watches who lives and who dies, I am shocked. Same goes for the bad guys here. The final battle - indeed all battles - is completely tension-free. The fact that they are badly choreographed and disgustingly directed - not to mention a few and far from each other - is rendered a minor matter by their mere futility. The baddies themselves are far too anxious to be campy, and even if they were all combined, they are not within a mile of the original Pete Burnsian antics of Jo Odagiri. <br /> <br /> ## ## Major spoilers at the end of the paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Ueto tries her best, it has to be said, and she has also managed to keep her hair in good condition between films. Azumi is now a full-blown assassin, which means she can move her sword in slow motion. Unfortunately, the character is now afflicted with a kind of unclassified style in the style of the mystery. The model of Ueto becomes even more inappropriate. I know this should be the point, but along with the inefficiency of everyone else in the movie, the stupidity of the plot, and the general inability of the movie in general, it means that it's absolutely impossible to get past their character this time. The Less About Chiaki: "Remember Kill Kill" Kuriyama's performance the better; Suffice it to say that their "turn" from good to evil is as subtle as napalm. All in all, this was a huge disappointment. Every merit is ten times better in the first movie. A lazy, unsatisfactory and usually boring mess.
