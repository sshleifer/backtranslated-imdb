Like I said, the book was pretty good and this movie might have been a good movie if Melissa Gilbert in the lead role was not so terrible and unbelievable. What kind of accent should that be? It sounded just like her terrible Russian accent in another movie I saw her in. Every time she opened her mouth, I jerked. It took me three tries to see the whole movie. Brad Johnson was good as the other leader. <br /> <br /> I really liked the scenes on the beach. They added some much needed brightness to distract your thoughts from Melissa Gilbert's depressing portrayal. I think they could have better used the views of San Francisco to their advantage. It looked like the night scenes were actually SF, but I could be wrong. I can not remember that the character in the book is so depressing. <br /> <br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert from future films that require an accent!
