When I borrowed this movie from a friend (luckily I did not buy it) on the package (which looked really bad and ugly), "The Ultimate Vampire Horror" was printed. After watching, I thought the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie. The "story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is chased by vampire / zombie creatures. <br /> <br /> Light, sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a vacation video with a ten year old VHS system if not worse. I gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and only because the promo T-shirts looked kinda cool. I do not want to do movie students or splatter movies in general, but I saw Braindead and saw a $ 20 movie by students ten times better than that crap.
