I should point out everywhere that the movie should not be seen. It fails to pay homage in such a grand way that it is almost an insult to the memory of these brave men. The special effect was terrible, I did not expect the director to have misjudged military technology at all. How can a machine gun, which normally fires at 600 rounds per minute, fire at 1/10 the speed? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can humans survive when artillery shells fall down to 20 feet? How come that the artillery shells only fall on both sides of the street and not on the street itself? <br /> <br /> This disrespect of weapons not only surprised me, it was the cliché situations and the discrepancy of the dialogues made me scream. There were the standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan ​​me hai and LOC cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai. Stupid, to say the least. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De wrote is true. The director worked without a script and that shows. There is no flow to the movie. There is no gradual progress from one battle to another. It's just one shootout after another without any connection to the overall concept of the war. The explanatory scenes are terrible. The chief of the army staff does not look convincing. To make matters worse, the theater people had indiscriminately cut film footage to fit the four-hour movie in three hours.
