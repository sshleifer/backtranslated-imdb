Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow me to rate judges under 1. What a shame. This scary movie is so bad that I really turned off the damn thing before the end. The script had a few bright moments, but the direction, editing, acting, audio quality and, most importantly, the timing of the online broadcast were so disgusting that judges became utterly unbearable. Judges were referred to as modern day comic style westerns, but in fact nothing was the like. What it likes most is a dog feces on the bottom of your shoe. You can try to pretend it's okay, but it stinks again and again. <br /> <br /> Why video stores think it is okay to carry this kind of crap with constant gaps in sound reproduction and worse than the high school drama lessons acting goes beyond me. We rent films to see something better than on TV. But the judges are worse than the most pitiful original of the SciFi channel. I will reclaim my money from Hollywood Video.
