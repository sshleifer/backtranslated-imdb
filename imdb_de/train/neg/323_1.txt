This movie was so bad that I could not go through it without doing anything else. There was no action and no sense. I was totally bored and for a movie about a comedian I could not remember a joke or comic line worthy of the description. Politicians without charisma who speak technical jargon could not be less entertaining. <br /> <br /> How was this done? Is there no quality control in the film? Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this terrible experience. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who has become popular and appeared in fine comedies, could survive on this kind of contact. He was not funny at all in this movie and proves that writing is so important for an effective comedy.
