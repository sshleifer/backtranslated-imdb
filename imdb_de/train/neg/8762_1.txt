A scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately) finds out how to bring the dead back to life. But they come back with marble faces. Ultimately, this leads to a disaster. <br /> <br /> Boring, totally predictable trip of the 1940s. That made me stupid when I was a kid, but it just bores me now. I had to fight to stay awake! With one exception, the spectacle is terrible. Such expressionless boring actor! Hopeless. <br /> <br /> There are some good things to say about this: Carradine actually does a very good job despite the script. And there are a few mild spooky moments when a ghost of a Great Dane walks through walls. There is also one of the worst-looking excretions in cinema history. Still, none of that makes it fun enough to get through this. Avoid.
