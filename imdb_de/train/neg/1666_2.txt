Can a movie become more naive than this? You can not believe a piece of this script. and it is predictable that you can read off the storyline and the end of the first 10 minutes. the lead actress seems to be Barbie (but she can not do it, the puppet has more acting skills). <br /> <br /> The ease of the character going through and staying in a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography. I will not even comment on the superficiality of the characters, but the best thing about this film is Madsen's performance, which manages to bring to life a melody-like one-dimensional figure. <br /> <br /> The film is so cheesy it sticks to the teeth. I can imagine some 13-year-old Britney-obsessed girls shouting, "Oh, give us a break! If we want fairy tales, the Brothers Grimm book is hidden somewhere in the attic." I only gave it to Virginia Madsen.
