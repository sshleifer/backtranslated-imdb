I think they really let go of the quality of DVD production. I borrowed this DVD in 2 movie stores and the second time I finally played it on the 3rd DVD player I tried. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else have this problem? It's really hard to give the film an impartial review after playing through it so painstakingly. For one, I've never seen a Finnish horror movie before, so I was kind of upset that the movie was shot in English. Since it never became clear what was going on with Sarah, she only came out as backward and so I really hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrible events disappear.
