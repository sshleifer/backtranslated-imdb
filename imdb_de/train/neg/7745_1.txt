Where should I start? The special effects should be referred to as special defects. When the director called "action," he implied that the actors should do the worst they could imagine. Maybe he was annoyed with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not get back a single penny of their investment and that the work would be a case study of how not to make a movie. Or he hated the art school and wanted to become an accountant, but his family did not let him. <br /> <br /> The only thing that's for sure is that the one who hires him in the future is because he loves him (so his objectivity jumped through the window) or because he changed his name and all the previous ones Deleted references.
