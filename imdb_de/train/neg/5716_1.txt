This movie is not deserving of the next few minutes I'm going to criticize it, but I know that many people like me rely on IMDb.com to help decide on movies. For that reason alone, I write this here. <br /> <br /> "Live Feed" is like an Asian version of the 1976 "The Incredible Torture Show" (aka "Blood Sucking Freaks") http://www.imdb.com/support/tt0077247/. Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism ... sure, it's all here along with a third-grade script, miserable action, and a perverse failure of an attempt at black comedy. The film is set in China, but everyone speaks English. There are a plethora of girls in the movie who are appalled by slaughtering dogs in a market but are sexually excited to go to a porn salon. A woman who has disgusted the dirt in a toilet room moments later is still there and has had a friend with her boyfriend (as he got inside, there might be the only incentive for this whole movie.) The movie is absolutely terrible for a B-movie. Even if you download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
