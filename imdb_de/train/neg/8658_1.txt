A large part of the scenes should be cut off. There are many scenes that should have been cut off. For example, the scene in which the hunters mention "I have spiders on my tail," "I like tail," plays in the mud scene, or a bar scene in which a professional dinocroc hunter works as a snake charmer. <br /> <br /> How about other horribly incoherent scenes in which a woman, Diane, who wants to lose her virginity to a friend, walks as if he wears women's panties, the three sizes are too small. Did not they realize that they can make it next to the little boy who will soon run away and lose his head? Why did you work in a living room? I mean, his head really turned. How about the beach scene reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene on Grant Lake? All these strange scenes could easily be called comedy. <br /> <br /> Here in my city, the Cineplex theaters had been campaigning for Dinocroc for months, and I am glad that I did not see them because I later found out that it was shown only 1 or 2 days before the demolition has been. The movie was so bad. I suspected that Dinocroc is not a good movie when you look at the preview. It shows the leg of Dinocroc that looks like a kid wearing green pajamas and slippers with claws and pacing up and down like a 2 year old. It could easily go over as a baby genius. <br /> <br /> If filmmaking students want to learn what not to do, this is a true classic. Diane's friend, who walks like an advanced case of syphilis, lets you ask what the poor woman looks like in this guy who looks drunk even before he can drink beer. If this happens, who cares about Dinocroc? The panty man looked more interesting than the whole movie of Dinocroc. His acting was so bad that he was a better substitute for Mr. Bean. MOVE ROWAN ATKINSON, here is a man with a better comedic talent in a horror sci-fi movie. Maybe the worse casting in the history of Hollywood.
