We went into this movie because my husband had enjoyed the original version of "My favorite Martian". We had our 6 year old daughter with us. She wanted to go halfway through the movie, which was fine with both parents! The parts we saw were occasionally funny, usually too stupid or crude. I would expect this film to appeal to children between the ages of 9 and 12, if that's the case. It is definitely not suitable for younger children. From what I heard, the original series was far superior and if you "re-experience the past" you will probably be disappointed.
