Do not waste your time with it! If you do not want to study it for all the wrong things, you should not make a good movie. I'm not one who usually discusses a movie, but this one is personal. I wasted precious time they can not give back. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time with this crap. If it's a student project, I have to say, not bad, but only for the first 15 minutes ... then it gets annoying. the screaming, the bad sound, the bad video (a good cameraman could have done a lot better). and yes, what about the Blair-Witch effect? no budget? I was hoping it would get better, but it does not. How the hell did it make a 4? 2 is fairer, but 1 for my waste of time! I said my peace.
