I do not think a movie of Van Damme's Universal Soldier will ever be defeated, but you never know. This movie was good, but not as good as the first one. VD returns a Luc and has to fight again. He tries 2 b funny, but maybe it's worth a smile. VD has a kid this time from Ally W., well, it showed a picture of them 2. Goldberg was cool, he's doing his famous move - forgot what it means because I do not see wrestling sucks. VD & Goldberg had some good fights. It was the end like the first, but just not so good. VD do their best in their career, as always - the HELICOPTER KICK. The final end should have taken longer. It's definitely worth it, but it will never surpass the original.
