Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered when she went to Italy, tired of the glamor treatment in Hollywood. First, it suffered the agony of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI, a malpractice that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress. And now it's EUROPA 51, another boring exercise with a soaked mood. <br /> <br /> The story also does nothing for Alexander KNOX, in another ungrateful role as her boring husband trying to comfort her after the suicide death of her little son. At least this one has better production values ​​and a more coherent script than STROMBOLI. Bergman is still attractive here, but moves to a more matronly appearance than rich socialite. She is never able to cope with the sudden loss of her son despite attempts by a friendly male friend. "Sometimes I think I lose my mind," she tells her husband. A striking statement in a movie that is completely devoid of humor and grace, but it gives us a sense of where the story is going. Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome. However, being a social worker with poor children does not improve her emotional health, and from there on, the conspiracy declines. <br /> <br /> The movie makes it not interesting enough to turn into a project for a big star like Bergman. The film loses momentum in the middle of the story as Bergman becomes increasingly disturbed and her husband suspects she has hit him twice. The story goes down from there after caring for a street runner through her deadly illness. At the end of the conspiracy, her husband must take her to a lunatic asylum for observation. Ingrid suffers from all of this (she compensates for the loss of her son), but it does not help. Not one of her best films, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Note: If she wanted neo-realism with a mental illness, she would have accepted the leadership in THE SNAKE PIT better than she was offered to her by director Anatole Litvak !! It would have done more for her career than for EUROPA 51. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Another bleak indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman.
