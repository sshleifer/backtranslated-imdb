I enjoyed this movie until the editions of Ed Norton's facial hair. Without disclosing details of the plot - he wore a light beard one afternoon, but the beard was gone that same evening and a very lush mustache was appropriate. It was much busier than the mustache that belonged to the beard. Later, during a dark night outside, the mustache had disappeared and it seemed to be a pure harbor. This was an opportunity where a shaving break would not be an option. These continuity deviations distracted me completely from the rest of the film, destroying any credibility he had before. I also found that the long scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was far too reminiscent of De Niro in taxi drivers. Although it should be a tribute, it was too thick for this viewer.
