Do you want to know a secret? This movie is shit. Well, I do not know, because if you let yourself be pampered by plagiarized versions of original films, this movie might be amazing (this movie is a plagiarized copy of I know what you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the movie are based on a typical story setting. a group of cool teenagers who enjoy their Florida vacation and behave themselves behaving like the teenagers they are. The only insight we get at this point is the extent to which the director managed to demonstrate a presumptuous sense of youthful decadence within the characters. The second half hour of the film gains momentum and begins to illustrate the beginning of unprecedented murders. The third half hour of the movie will definitely be a mystery to me, because I turned it off before I could continue to fool myself that the movie has something interesting and original left over. The story can easily be explained in a few lines. A few teenagers go to Florida on vacation. While they are busy celebrating, they are slowly (and I mean slowly) killed because they know a stupid secret. The only impetus to the killings is that all the victims were at a joint high school. One thing that astonished me about this movie, however, was how much Betty (I'm not sure about her name ... the blond character) looks like Reese witherspoon. Another thing that intrigued me about the movie was that I had to jump off my seat a few times. Is this a work of art? Not at all because my 12-year-old niece made me drop a glass of orange juice because she "booed" me as I walked straight through the guest room door. What's the difference between the director and my 12-year-old niece ???? <br /> <br /> Want to know a secret ??? I'm not sure about you, but I do not know ..
