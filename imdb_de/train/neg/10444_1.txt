the only great thing about the movie is the title. In this case, "Snake On A Plane" is an example of how the book is not judged by its title. The title says nothing about the movie. When I went to the theater, I did not expect Citizen Kane. I was expecting Independence Day, a movie that is pure popcorn pleasure. Instead, I got this horrible Roy Liotta movie titled "Turbulence." The only thing that makes SOAP better is the title. And it's not even the title for the movie, it was not even a look at "snake" or "plane" in 40 minutes! What a false advertisement! If the title were not, SOAP would just be another memorable, cheap B summer movie. And the R-rating? It must be the most undeserved R-movie of all time! The makers of the film just add a few words to make this an R. The violence is kept at pg-13 level. You know what was really rated R? The R-Superstar Edge! See him at Summerslam instead of wasting your money on a snake!
