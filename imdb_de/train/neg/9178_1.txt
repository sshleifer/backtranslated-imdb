If you call "House of the Dead" the worst movie ever, then that's not really the case. There are worse films out there. I watch a lot of Hong Kong Ninja films that are essentially the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama that ends with recordings of ninjas to create something that can technically be described as "The Movie." The Dead, however, is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in the cinemas. When I came out halfway, I actually felt a bit stupider because I had pulled through 45 minutes of this garbage.
