Just a crazy rip-off of the infinitely better "Murder, She Wrote", it's absolutely amazing that this poorly written rubbish lasted a full eight years. I'm sure that most of the people watching this insecure crap were in their sixties and seventies and just quit because they had nothing better to do or just remember their star from the old Dick Van Dyke Show , Van Dyke, who had only a decent career in the 1960s, was by no means a great actor at all, and he was far too old to be a doctor when the series began in 1993, the result of years of chain smoking and stinging Drink. His talentless real-life son Barry, a wood actor who was rarely involved in anything his father was not involved in, plays his son in the series.
