Schlocky's 70's horror movies ... you have to love her. Unlike the boring slasher films of today, these K-tel specials do something weird and do not rely on a tired formula. <br /> <br /> This is a B-movie about the genesis of a B-movie ... that went terribly wrong. Faith Domergue (This Isle of the Earth) stars as an over-the-top movie queen making a movie about a series of gruesome murders that hit a family in her home. Your friend / director, who looks and acts with an attitude like Gordon Jump, films on-site and on a tight schedule. The Ken doll co-star discovers a book of Tibetan chants, which they incorporate into the script to add "realism." "Realism" is unfortunately something that they could do without. John Carradine, who has long since given up on the search for the 17th gland (The Unearthly), now promises estate as a modest existence of the caretaker. He goes about his daily work, but always seems to be running from the director. <br /> <br /> The horror is slowly building up; a dead cat here, John Carradine entered there a grave and finally culminated in seven, even seven murders. (At least there's a truth in the ad.) It's just sad that the ghoul did not understand that a movie was made about him. How could the poor faith know that these damn Tibetan chants would actually work? Be honest, you just can not get around Satan's coat and expect him to lie down lying down. Sterno says he did an autopsy on the House of Seven Corpses.
