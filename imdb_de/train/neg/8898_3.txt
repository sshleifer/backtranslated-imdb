Can a wrong landscape ruin a picture? You would not think that way, but actually for me here. Listen, I have a lot of films from the classic epoch and I know pretty well what to do, such as when the drivers control immobile cars in front of a screen, etc. To shoot false landscapes, false mountains and flowers, as in "Brigadoon" can be seen offending after a while. <br /> <br /> As for music entertainment, this is always subjective. What songs one person likes, another may not be that it is not important to judge a movie (if someone likes the songs). I was able to break this movie because of its stupid 1950s songs, dances, romances, and characters, but those were the 50s and many people liked those kinds of things. Musicals did very well in the 50s. I liked the 30s and 40s with the great faucets. There was no faucet back in the '50s and this new stuff - which I can endure - was. Is this a lousy movie? No. It just makes one who I'm not particularly interested in <br /> <br /> Despite the good cast, the good director and the high expectations, this film was bombarded at the box office and with me. I should have loved to be a dreamer herself and that's a nice part of this story. I'm not the cynical type and a nice city and nice people that make me feel good. Why could not I connect with this movie? Part of that was dancing too. I'm not interested in the stuff that has replaced tap dancing on the screen. But - no - that thing really stopped me from staging. There was no Scotland, no highlands, just a wild background to make it look that way and it turned me on almost from the start. Get a point for today's realism when you're mostly "on-site".
