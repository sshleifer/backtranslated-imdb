I just watched this movie and WOW was so bad. Actually, the only thing that watched me was that it was SO MONUMENTALLY bad, it was kind of entertaining. The action of the characters is hilarious, from the hyperdramatic way they fall over shots, to their unbelievably bad acting (were the bad guys all pulled off the streets or were they really actors?), To unbelievably bad lines, to their inexplicable actions (if you try to shoot somebody through a door while they are entering, it is obviously directly sticking to the doorknob !!). This movie has to break a record for the worst written and delivered lines. <br /> <br /> The camera work was really bad too - you can barely see what's going on in the fight scenes because the camera angles and shaking are changed /> <br /> I would have voted for "1" except that I like Chiba and Sidekick Sue Shihomi and I was entertained with a few scenes: 1) broken a villain's arm so that the bone pops out of the skin (that must hurt) 2) a drug king who is a brown-haired animal ( eating a monkey?) by chopping the carcass with a meat cleaver. 3) Sonny Chiba performs an improvised eye operation on a guy with his fingers. <br /> <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but this one really is not worth the time. I've seen about 7 or 8 of his films, and I've come to the conclusion that the only ones worth seeing are (and they're great!), The Street Fighter series and The Killing Machine. I also heard that the hangman and Golgo 13 are good. I recommend staying with them.
