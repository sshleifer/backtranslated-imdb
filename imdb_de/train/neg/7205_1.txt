If you'd like to see what started as a 2-hour movie in unrelated, unsurpassed situations, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, you will only wonder how they could translate such a movie from something so simple as an Inspector Gadget to the big screen not in the movie and within the movie some scenes just make no sense. While the movie lasts a little less than an hour and a half, I just remember a really memorable moment, and that's just before or during the credits! <br /> <br />
