I have read some comments on this film and can only assume that some people will be entertained easily. This movie is nothing. It is so poorly written, conducted and acted that it hardly makes an impression. The characters speak in dialogue with clich√©s and the situations are completely implausible. That makes the Campy fun and does not because everything is so lifeless that the film is boring. It's as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality, but then the studio managers were not allowed to give the story a real lifestyle, or she had no cojones. This movie could be considered the standard edition of the Lifetime TV movie in the Encyclopedia.
