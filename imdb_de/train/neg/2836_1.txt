I saw this obvious slapfest in a video library shelf. And before I got my first VCR, I thought I would baptize him with this little gem, and it's bad filmmaking at its best! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is unintentionally funny. And it contains a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is inexplicable. And as Christopher Walken wanted to play in every bad movie in his later years. This movie is Mr. Quinn's Country Bears. <br /> <br /> It contains lines like, "Shut up and let me fight !!!" <br /> <br /> And "You say a lot of shit!" <br /> <br /> And the priceless comeback: "Unfortunately it's sh_it, strong angry sh_it!" <br /> <br /> You'll be impressed by a fight scene while Bo makes a SUMMER SUITE over a pool table! And make a nice kung fu kick when it comes off the roll! Chop socky action and T and A inspire !!! <br /> <br /> Which fanatic fan could ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and comes back to persecute Bo as a ghost, she asks him why he killed himself rather than deal with his serious illness? He says, "Real men do not eat quiches." <br /> <br /> Uh, aaa, yes. If Bo was a smart cookie, she'd call an exorcist right now!
