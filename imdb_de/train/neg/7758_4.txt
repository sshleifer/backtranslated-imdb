this movie had a lot of blood when the sabretooth attack loved it too, and i loved it when the guy and the women were having a good time talking, and then the sabretooth attacked the women and ate their bellies and took out the liver. That was the best, and the one-tone Sabretooth that runs on its front legs is funny to make this movie better and less talk, if you know what I mean and also please, the people who made this movie It's awful that 1 Sabretooth was alive and was killed, that the women finally remind me of the trouble that ends, there's only one enemy left! OK, damn it, this movie is shit. I can not believe it. I loved it when my little brother was freaked out by belly attacks and blood ya
