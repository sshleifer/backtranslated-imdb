I almost fooled myself when I wanted to start the review, "This movie reminded me of BILLY ELLIOT," but then I looked at screenwriter Lee Hall's CV just to find out he was the guy, BILLY ELLIOT wrote so it's Mr. Hall who makes a fool of himself, not me <br /> <br /> Am I a bit cruel with him? No, because Lee has something most other aspiring screenwriters in the UK do not have - he has his foot in the door, he's written a successful British movie before, won prizes and money at the box office, and what does he do next? He gives the audience more of the same <br /> <br /> young Jimmy Spud who lives on a kitchen sink. He is bullied at school and nobody loves him. The only thing that keeps him alive is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer. No, actually he wants to be an angel, but considering his household he can also be a ballet dancer. He has a macho-spendthrift of a father who thinks, "Ballet dancers are a bunch of puff, while his grandfather says," Ballet dancers are as tough as any man you can meet. I remember seeing the Bolshoi Ballet ... "Yup Ballet is a major topic of conversation on a rundown British property these days - NOT, think about it, not even the politics of the left, the only means The middle class seems to be clerks who live in beautiful big houses, so everything feels instantly ridiculously wrong about this setup. <br /> <br /> Another main criticism is that this is a movie that has no idea who he's trying to turn to Channel 4 has criticized Channel 4 for broadcasting films at completely inopportune times (THE LAND THAT TIME TOGOT, for example, at 6am), but they showed that at 2am and for once they are The story involves politics, ballet dancing (Gawd I hate it) Lung cancer and poverty There is no way that this is suitable for a family audience, but since the main actor is a 11-year-old is and shows angels and ballet dancers (do not blame me if I'm obsessed with the subject - there was no need to refer to t o them) There is not much here for a smart adult audience either. <br /> <br /> Of course, when Lee Hall was told by the screenwriting development stage producers to write a story featuring a student and an angel, he had punctually refused to say I'll apologize for wanting to write about other topics and stories, but throughout the movie you feel that once the movie is finished, it will be sold to exactly the same audience that inspired BILLY ELLIOT
