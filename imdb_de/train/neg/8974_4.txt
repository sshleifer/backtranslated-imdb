This film, I will not call it a "movie", was essentially about nothing and worked mainly for the popular acts of the time. Yes, the war was in full swing (pun intended), and this movie was good for the troops and our viewers. <br /> <br /> but we have something with a little more substance loved to see a young buddy rich on the drums. The music was consistently good. <br /> <br /> but one cameo after another quickly gets old. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Zero Mostel! So if you belong to the "biggest generation", as they say, you will definitely enjoy this ... <br /> <br /> movie.
