This (extremely) low-budget movie is compared to the great classic "Silent Night Deadly Night" because it's called the Slasher Flick. Let me first say that I think even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than that (more than half of the movie was filled with original flashbacks). "Christmas Evil" tries to become psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes crazy (a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is irritated by people who do not have the true meaning of Christmas, and at work he can not stand how the fabricated toys are made with so little quality and love. Disguised as Santa Claus, he finally goes on a killer spree. Also a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the need for special effects. No tension, no thrill, no streaks, no litter. One exception is: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing alongside Tom Hanks as one of the guardians of the classic "The Green Mile." He still has to step himself in order to always accept the role. He is really the only one who can really act, his supporting role is better than the main leadership. (Who is not so bad, but if you are overshadowed by a small supporting character, you are not great either.). And what about this strange ending? (You have to see it to believe it). "Christmas Evil" is downright boring, nothing happens and the artwork is simply misleading. This is not a slasher. You want to see a real Christmas party, look at the greatest time of all time: "Silent night, deadly night".
