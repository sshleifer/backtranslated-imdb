I still can not believe this movie. They have so many incredible things in them that it's hard to believe someone wanted to do it. <br /> <br /> The story is a joke, but in the sense of being funny, but more like no story. How to mix a slapstick comedy with a robbery, prison movie, city conspiracies, sex jokes and an FBI agent? That will not do. <br /> <br /> In addition to the terrifying direction, the actors are especially noticeable. I saw this movie and thought: Is this really Marlon Brando? No this can not be. (5 minutes later) Is that Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) That can not be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This movie is too bad for everyone. (At the end). No, no, no, that can not be absolutely Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds of such a movie. 'Then it was over and I was nervous. So many good, Oscar-winning, mostly convincing actors in such a stupid, stupid, terrible movie. I rarely wanted to know as much as they came to it. They could not get that much money. <br /> <br /> Just an incredibly stupid idiotic movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 (1+ - 6-)
