No spoilers here, but I've been a fan since the beginning of Waking the Dead, but the last series, of which only three were on the market, is terrible. The stories are not similar to the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 in the last series pine falling down ridiculously. As a BBC licensor, I called BBC complaints after the show to share my disappointment. I am amazed that actors of the caliber of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone have nothing against the plot. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, they can certainly see that they've lost all directions. It's a good job, it's the last series, or the next series can start with the team investigating Santa's death. Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
