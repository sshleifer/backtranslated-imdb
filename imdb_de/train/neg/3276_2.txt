The television program of the 1980s, updated with fresh female flesh and slippery language. "The Dukes of Hazzard" passed me by; it was not repeated when I was in front of the TV in New York or California; or I would probably have seen. Even so, I knew from somewhere (like the clips attached to this 2005 updated movie) that it was a fast, orange Dodge Charger - and the "General Lee" is still going well. <br /> <br /> The Hunky cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the new riders of the Orange Sage. Pretty Jessica Simpson (as Daisy) fills her tight short - but even her exciting pink bikini can not beat the competition from a dormitory full of bouncing, topless students. The stupid conspiracy includes a batty Burt Reynolds (as "boss" Hogg), who threatened to turn Hazzard County into a strip mine. <br /> <br /> ** The Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson and Burt Reynolds
