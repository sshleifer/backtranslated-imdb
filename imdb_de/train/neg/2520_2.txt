OK, this movie had a terrible premise. Be serious about the movie you've just had through an apocalyptic war, but they have money to buy huge robots and play them off against each other. Instead of investing in the reconstruction of their country, each country chooses to fight robots that nobody can afford. Here's a better idea, let's go back to our most incapable resources, jocks, to fight our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone says something about the director and what about him. He makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. There is no reason to appreciate this movie just because of the director, maybe he was sleeping? I really enjoyed this movie because it was so cheesy and ridiculous that I had to laugh. I actually had a good time watching it, except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be the assassin (believe me, no one would see this guy as an assassin, so it's a surprise, how lame) a jungle Jim anyway. I was sad to see that Mst3k had not done this. However, I give a two star rating because nothing could be as bad as "Manos the Hands of Fate". <br /> <br /> The budget does not matter, I've seen a lot of reasonable films that did not have the budget like a dice. The plot was not even plausible, and I've seen better acting in school games. Surely they could have afforded an eleven-year-old from any middle school game. Anyway, take it with you, it's a funny movie.
