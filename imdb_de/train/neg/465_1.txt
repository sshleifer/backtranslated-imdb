When I was in the movie shop the other day, I gave up blonde and blonde, but something just seemed like a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people beat Romy and Michelle before they saw it. Blond and blonde were just another secret treasure that was passed over. But when I started to see it: executive producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I had something weird in mind. Not only that, but also what was considered the pinnacle of sharpness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, so as not to offend them, but they did not get old at all and they play roles I think were more for women Those who are in their 20s should not be in their 40s. The story was just awful and disgusting. <br /> <br /> Dee and Dawn are your stupid stereotypical blondes. You really have no idea what's going on in the world is sad. But if the girls are somehow confused with murder bombers, the cops are in their history, calling the girls "geniuses" because of their "ignorance as bliss" attitude. They are set to "beat" a guy, and they think they are just showing him "a good time," but the real assassin is ticked and wants to kill the case and the girls. <Br /> <br /> Denise and Pam look very awkward on the screen and almost as if they read the script the day before. I know that this should be the stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it was intrusive and was simply unnecessary. Would I ever recommend this? Not in a million years, the girls are just trying to maintain their status as a "sex kitten," it's more a sign of despair, and Blonde and Blonde is a huge blonde BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
