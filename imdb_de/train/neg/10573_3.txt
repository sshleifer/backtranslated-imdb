I was exposed to this movie for a relationship class in my school. As I said, it was nothing fascinating and nothing new. Although it tries to be original by focusing on the teenage father, rather than the mother who shows the problems that the father would go through. It had an interesting side, but it does not match its originality, since nothing else was original in this film. We have the main character who has the older sister, who, like in any other movie, has something against him, we have the mother at home, who is expecting too much, and when he gives more, she feels insulted and leaves him in the dust , then we have the father who is always gone. Then on the girls' side, we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect in everything she does. To the story, as I said it, it was interesting, but the lack of good acting of the entire cast and the lack of good writing or storytelling. Everything about it fell into a clich√©. The little nerd kid in school starts learning with the girl, they come together, they have sex, and then we have a little kid on the go. Maybe it could have been better if the writing had been better and the acting had been improved. I've taken seriously more emotion from Leatherface and his chainsaw than any actor in this movie. Movies are crap and terrible. So far, Juno has been the only interesting teenage pregnancy movie I've seen. So far, the comic side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining, though it radiates the same message. As I said, the idea was original. Most of these films focus on the teenage mother, but this one focuses instead on the drama of the father, but the originality does not save this film from mediocrity. I really hope somebody decides to rebuild this movie either with a better cast and a better author, or just another similar movie because it's potentially wasted.
