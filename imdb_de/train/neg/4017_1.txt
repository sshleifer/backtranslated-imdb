Yes, this movie gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in adult film. Nevertheless, I did not like it at all. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more akin to a horror movie, she has the opportunity to return briefly to Earth to live the life of lust that she has never experienced in her earthly life. Fucking sex scenes follow. Why are they shitty, on the one hand they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sexual act. I mean, we do not watch porn for sex. Little Girls Blue also does things artistically, but it's still very erotic and beautiful to look at. Of course, the girls in this one are very cute. Here we have a pretty unattractive actress and that does not help. If you find the main role in your adult film unsightly, there is no artistic vision that will make me enjoy the movie. The sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre ... I mean, there's a snake in one of those guys. So for me this film simply fails because it does not upset me at all, but rather deters me.
