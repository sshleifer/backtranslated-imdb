When this movie was released, he spawned one of the omnipresent great movie reports: Sphinx Stinks. It does, but in a fascinating way. The casting is stupid and starts at the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? Not enough make-up in Cairo for that, at least not while the movie was being filmed. But it's pretty amusing to see how they try. The performances range from mummy-like (sorry, the obvious observation) to over-the-top with very few stops. The Lesley Anne Down character does not seem to find Egypt on a map, let alone its archaeological treasures. This is at least partly due to really bad writing, one of the curses that every viewer of this movie will visit. I believe that movies that contain a curse or a curse based on a somewhat esoteric theme, such as Egyptology, are ripe for stupid, over-written dialogues. It does not disappoint, and the convergence proves to be a double strike. The plot has a driving source of dramatic tensions: can this become duller and less credible? The answer is usually YES. The location shots are beautiful and the set design is generally very good. The only reminder that this is not a low-budget production. That and the fact that there are so many familiar faces that serve in such unwanted laughter. Cheap, no; cheesy yes.
