When I was a kid in the '50s and' 60s, everything that had to do with Disney was great by definition. What happened? They are able to get all the actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. But somehow, despite its abundant resources, Disney manages to screw things up. Disney can afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but still ... they mess things up! This movie is crap. The sad part is that I suspect that in its arrogance, Disney does not even know when a movie is good or bad. <br /> <br /> I can even give him a 3 only because of the talents of the actors 10
