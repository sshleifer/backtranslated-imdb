Carly Pope plays JJ, a newly promoted food critic whose extravagant, overbearing mother pulls her. JJ, appalled by this turn of events, Alex blackmails the restaurant owner to entertain his mother to "maybe" check on his dying restaurant. Alex foresightfully falls in love with the daughter as he warms to his mother. There are many problems with this movie, the characters are universally 2-dimensional. JJ is a selfish, hateful character, her mother superficial and shallow. JJ's colleagues in the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic. The underlying message of an over-50-year-old woman who can not make it on her own without male support is bad, bad, BAD. The drama is equally boring, the screenplay uninspired. The only salvation of the films is the backdrop of New York City. I would NOT recommend this movie.
