This movie is the worst I've ever seen. The plot is weak - I could not even track it. Acting is scholastic. The soundtrack is irritating. The attempts of humor are not. The editing is terrible. The credits are even slow - I would be embarrassed to associate my name with this movie waste. Do not waste your time thinking about this attempt at acting.
