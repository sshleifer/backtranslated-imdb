I read about this movie in a magazine and was fascinated. A woman who sees herself passing by in her own car one day. Well, I thought that might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but that's not it. First the title. The broken one? The Broken ... what? What is broken? That ... oh, wait ... I understand, the title itself is "broken"! WOW, smart! Unfortunately, this is practically the only thing it has to offer. <br /> <br /> The premise is not so bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better in 'Mirrors'. A cross between invasion of body snatchers and mirrors and a rather mediocre. A more appropriate title would be "The Boring," as it highlights each scene for bloody eras. Or perhaps "The Confusing," since it does not explain anything, either in the narrative or in the story itself, just a vague idea of ​​evil copies and something that is endowed with cheap, dying, frightening, and unbridgeable scenes , It's just messed up. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the drama and the special effects are pretty good, but on the other hand, it is not difficult to act. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie twice, I still feel dissatisfied, maybe a little confused and not in the manner of EA Poe or Stephen King. Do yourself a favor and do not look at it. Simply put, there are better thrillers.
