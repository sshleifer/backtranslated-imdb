In addition to his "Tarzan" series, the prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote many other books, although only a few of these books were shot alongside the popular "At the Earth Core." One exception is the novel entitled "The Boy and the Lion," which was brought to the screen as "The Lionman" (1936), a over-talkative, static, old hat, a slow-moving and rather boring film, although he was filmed on real desert locations. Actually, "movie" is the wrong word. The narrative does not move, but runs abruptly at a snail's pace. For example, at least five characters are provided with detailed opening scenes and then disappear easily. Even more frustrating for the avid movie fanatic are the characters that leave an impression (like the girl who injects drugs with Hall) but are played by players who are not credited! The credited theses are usually worse than the unknowns. One exception is Australian actress Finis Barton, who describes well the hijacked harem girl who rescues the young master fairy. Granted, most of the cast is saddled with the cruel dialogue of King James, who must be heard to be believed! But the way you can play this garbage is ironic, a ruse that does not seem to have occurred to a single cadre of the movie without talented players. Maybe the director J. P. McCarthy messed up this idea. However, it is sad to see pretty Kathleen Burke being forced to trade lines with Richard Carlyle (her father) and Jon Hall (her admirer). Although Mr. Hall gives his lines with a little more conviction than Mr. Carlyle, this is not a recommendation.
