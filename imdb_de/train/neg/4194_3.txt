The film started off very promisingly with the story of a director losing his eyesight and a blind woman who has to help him. Somewhere in the middle, however, it seemed that the scriptwriters did not know where to go. <br /> <br /> An unbelievable event (Russia must be very small because they all clash) was followed by the motivation of the main female character (why is she following him after getting off the train? Why is not she trying to get up lending a mobile phone to the ship to call someone?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (should the story be funny with the mother and the friend, and what was the story with the younger sister?). Despite all this apparent arbitrariness of the plot, the film managed to be completely predictable. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing is that there was a lot of potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, the optics and the score were very nice and the actors of the main characters were also good. That could have been a really good movie, but it was not.
