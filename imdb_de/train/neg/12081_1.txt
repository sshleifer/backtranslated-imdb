Note to George Litman and others: The Mystery Science Theater 3000 reef is "I do not think breeder *". <br /> <br /> My favorite riff is, "Why did you look like it?", simply for utter absurdity. that and "not really good!" All in all, I would say that we want to give the MST3K crew the recognition that they have tried to ridicule this TV movie. You can not really make fun of the dialogue; Bill S was a good playwright. On the other hand, this production is so bad that even he would reject it. A junior high school drama club could do better. <br /> <br /> I would recommend you to buy a book and read "Hamlet".
