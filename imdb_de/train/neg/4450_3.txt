Julia Roberts is obviously trying hard to shake off her pretty Waddler wife with this spooky spanking abuse thriller, but it's hard to imagine that she'll end up with such a powerful and compelling performance (and an Oscar win) as she has Erin Brokovich Back of this garbage. And do not mind, it's nothing more than a vehicle from Julia Roberts, but unfortunately her performance is not the most lackluster thing. <br /> <br /> The plot has all the markings of a late night. for-cable, and do not get the impression that you are getting insight into the dark world of domestic abuse, as none of the characters are outlined so you can really take care of them. <br /> <br /> Finally disappointing and unsatisfactory, with no Roberts' name over the title, I'm sure it would have been completely deserved.
