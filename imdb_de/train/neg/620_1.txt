I saw that not so long ago and I have to say this movie is awful. I watch shabby movies for fun. Scarecrow is no fun. Scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredibly insane villain who likes to scream horrible puns when killing his victims (actually worse than the one in this sentence). He has a hard history justifying his killings. "Everybody is attacking me, the only girl who thinks I'm not a trailer trash - likes one of the guys who use me, I want to kill everyone, wah." OK, I exaggerate. But the premise for this movie alone is enough to put him at the bottom of the list of crappy movies. <br /> <br /> In addition to what I just said, the child's mother is promiscuous, he talks about his mother. Her current boyfriend, who treats it, tells Mama's friend to go, the boy refuses and insists that he will not leave his own house. Friend chases child in corn field. He kills the child right in front of his mother, the mother screams in fright, his friend is like, "OMG!" Then he tells Mama not to tell the police, but Kid is killed under a scarecrow Scarecrow is murdered, he comes back with a vengeance as a killer scarecrow, his victims "have never been so haunted ..." (Scarecrow's official tagline) <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this movie was released in That's right, 8 days, I would give this movie a 2 because it has one or two redeeming moments in its own right (you're spoiler, so I will not spoil it if you really see that crap I would have forgiven the bad show, the horrible special effects, the abysmal script and the bad camera work, but I just have no respect for the lack of effort at this level. <br /> <br /> This movie is by farnot as good as I imagine. If you want to see an example of how you do not make a movie or if you like watching bad movies like me, then look at it at your own risk. Everyone else should always be at a safe distance from this movie.
