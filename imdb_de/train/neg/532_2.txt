Just PPV. I do not want to waste too much time with it, because most posters put it better than I ever could, but I wanted to say a few things. <br /> <br /> I did not know which one was funnier: Redgrave chased tiny moths and tripped over her sister; Growling that her "precious" boy (whom she and the Lord had chosen as a drunken loser) was turned into a roadkill; that the soundless Ann pouted with Peggy Lee; or the awful CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie looking at her younger self! <br /> <br /> I never bought Danes as a younger Redgrave. I also did not buy Richardson and Collette as sisters. If Meryl Streep's daughter wants to become an actress, Mama should learn a few more hours. I had no idea why any girl (or buddy) would fool about the seedy stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughters are as whiny and thoughtless as she is, Luc is a slow slacker at Crack, and I've not gone crazy with any of them! Evening gives Chick Flicks a bad name!
