Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) sneaked through college. When the creepy Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers his secret, he blackmails her with the beautiful, kindhearted student Angela (James King). <br /> <br /> Stupid and incompetent "comedy" - much more groaning - inducing laughter. Movie tries to address his target group with his disgusting gags - but NONE OF THEM WORK. Also, it's full of worthless, unappetizing characters - and Schwartzman's character is so repulsive that he's a big dislike. The movie even tries to use the sex pot / actress Mamie Van Doren of the 50s / 60s in the film's most awful scene. YUCK !!! <br /> <br /> Another downer is his absolute predictability and the (further) waste of comedic actor Joe Flaherty, whose talent - when this guy stops accepting any role that comes along, is worth doing ? All in all, the only thing I liked was James (aka Jaime) King, who was very appealing - and deserved better. <br /> <br /> That will not get more than one in ten of me.
