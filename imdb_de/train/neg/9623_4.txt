Ben Stiller does not react as much as he does. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy around him. In "Crazy for Mary," the stand-up hair scene only works because Stiller tries to keep a straight face. If he faces Mary's other two candidates, he's the least fit man in the room, but the scene is hilarious. <br /> <br /> In Along Came Polly, the formula collapses for reasons that are hard to fathom. Stiller is surrounded by a series of comic talents. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman receive the best lines, of which there are too few. Hoffman, however, relies a little too much on physical humor - you know, we're in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to make a laugh. A basketball scene in which Hoffman plays it is completely overplayed (though it poses a predicament in the form of a shirtless adversary raising a smile - felt by Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to be in a bubble, there is little reaction. The figures of Hoffman and Stiller could have played much, much more. Aniston repeats her Rachael role again, but Stiller is not a Ross. It's more of a "Joey with a falling in love with Rachael" scenario. <br /> <br /> Polly is a descendant Rom Com and that's the failure - her heart is missing. You were not for the characters. With a little more work, we could have had a deeper story, but in the end, the film's flaw is due to bad writing. It's worth watching if it shows up on a slow night on TV.
