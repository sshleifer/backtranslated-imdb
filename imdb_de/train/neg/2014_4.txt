I remember loving this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I've ever seen. It was ultra high tech for the time. It could fend off enemy fire, perform all sorts of acrobatics in the air, and do almost everything in its own way. Now I go back and look at it today and am surprised how bad this show really is. The members of the cast are hardly captivating, there are many cheesy moments and the fight scenes are unbelievably spurious. And almost every end has the same helicopter combat with the obvious reuse of low-grade granular stocks. Many of the tracks seem to have come from the time of the Vietnam War. Airwolf basically has the same theme as Knight Rider, except that the criminal vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car. After watching a few episodes, I was totally bored. However, I love the theme music.
