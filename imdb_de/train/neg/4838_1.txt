I decided to watch this movie because it was nominated for Oscar this year. I think so many people here I really wanted to, but in the end bored and disappointed. The first scene was fine, but the rest of the movie in "shaky hands" camera mode is really annoying. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason for making such a film and his nomination for Oscar is the following: /> <br /> The American "military machine" (the people who make money in the war) urgently needs an apology or justification for the war in Iraq by pulling something (somehow) patriotic. <br /> <br /> Why these? "heroic" efforts of the director and the main character, _inspire_ to inspire the audience with an idea of ​​"loving-like a drug"? ... Oh, please, come on! how boring! <br /> <br /> Look at this to get an idea of ​​how deep the film academy can fall ...
