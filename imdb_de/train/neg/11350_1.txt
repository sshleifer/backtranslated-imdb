As long as there was 3D technology (in 1950 I think), there were animations for it. I especially remember a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale. I can not remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that Donald was working in a circus, feeding elephant peanuts, and stealing Chip and Dale's peanuts. This was done to probably see 1960 in 3D. If you saw "Meet the Robinsons in 3d" in theaters, they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the origin of the movie. There are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons created specifically for 3D glasses. This claim was a bad move because it is not difficult to prove it wrong. It also looks like a bad movie.
