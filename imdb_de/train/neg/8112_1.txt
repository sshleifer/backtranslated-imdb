Hanna-Barbera sucks the life of another famous estate. The violence is diluted, the stories are formulated, the animation is bad, the music is abominable and repetitive, and frankly, the show is just not funny. <br /> <br /> At that time, HB has put each one of his series through the same clich√© situations, whether or not they fit into the cartoon world. So Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring section as cavemen ("Hey! Popeye is popular, and the Flinstones are popular. Put them together and you must not miss them!"). In an obvious rip-off of "Private Benjamin," Olive Oyl and the Goon have a regular segment in which they are listed as new army recruits. Serious! Why? <br /> <br /> Adding to the nuisance factor are the public service announcements in each episode (currently common practice for cartoons, but still annoying). Popeye tells his nephew how he safely crosses the road, recycles and - are you ready for it? - the dangers of smoking! (I swear I do not think so.) <br /> <br /> The only charm left over from the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, Popeye's voice from the beginning, continues the role here , <Br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look around to reevaluate the old butcher shorts. Otherwise avoid it at all costs.
