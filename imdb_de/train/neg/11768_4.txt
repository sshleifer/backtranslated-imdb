This restart is like a processed McDonalds meal compared to Ang Lee's very good but 2003 underrated "The Incredible Hulk". Ang Lee's "The Hulk" is a comic film for the thinking man. The Hulk takes some time (about 40 minutes), but when he sees it, we see the conflict at the center of our protagonist. He does his best not to lose control, but if he admits to surrendering to his anger, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Compare this to Edward Norton's move, where there is no conflict in his personality, and he becomes a hulk when he gets excited and his pulse reaches 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). For this reviewer, this felt like the introduction of Midi-Chlorians in The Phantom Menace, which say how strong the "power" is with one, as if mystical abilities could be assessed by a blood test. In the 2008 film, Bruce Banner of Ed Norton simply has to keep his pulse below 200, as monitored by a device attached to his wrist. And for the protocol, it's extremely difficult to increase the pulse rate to 200, even if it's a very exciting run, especially for physically healthy people. <br /> <br /> Emotions drive Eric Bana's Hulk. He has repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life. He is calm on the surface, but down there is great anger, enough anger to fuel the hulk when unleashed. But the hulk never intentionally kills its attackers. Mostly he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He disempowers his shooters and saves in a critical scene a fighter jet from a collision. <br /> <br /> In the movie of 2003, the visual effects are present, but when needed. The action scenes (and there are many of them) are necessary for the storyline, unlike the movie from 2008, which includes action action action. <br /> <br /> In search of a "fugitive" In the story, Ed Norton loses focus on what Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk. For him, the hulk is a dangerous side effect when an experiment went awry. And Louis Leterrier, the director who picks up the catchphrase of Ed Norton, does not give the Banner-Hulk relationship any emotional dimension. The story can be summarized as follows: Banner is tracked and Hulk kicks in the butt, Banner is tracked and Hulk kicks in the butt. Repeat as needed. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against the movie in 2003 is that it may not be as fair to comic books as it was in the 2008 version. Even though I'm a fan of comics, I'd prefer a movie that's not as faithful to comics as a fanboys dream, but it has a heart every day for the comic-loyal, yet crafted and soulless version. <br /> <br /> Maybe Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that stays true to its comic roots and has a heart.
