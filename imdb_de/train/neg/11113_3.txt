I often feel like a Scrooge slamming movies that others rave about - or I write the review to make up for unjustified raves. I found this film almost unsurpassable, and unusual to me was the foreplay not just through boring, clichéd dialogues, but even through boring, clichéd music numbers. Whatever originality in this film is - unusual domestic environment for a musical, many fantasies, some animations - is offset by a script that does not develop a joke or a thought-provoking storyline. In particular, June Haver and Dan Dailey are nice, but they can not wear a film as a team. Neither is really charismatic or has a lot of sex appeal. They are both bland. I like Billy Gray, but his character is pretty monotonous. The best part of the movie for me is June Havers beautiful costumes and a great figure.
