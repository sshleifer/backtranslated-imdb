Granted, I'm not the connoisseur that is my partner, but a well-composed, smart movie is worth the time. My problems, in short: <br /> <br /> - Dialogue is often weak and sometimes incredible because it comes from the given character. <br /> <br /> - Unconvincing spectacle. <br /> <br /> - Storyline never really caught fire. <br /> <br /> The authors plucked selections from a half-dozen mainstream movies, thrown them into a kettle, cooked them not nearly enough and tried to feed us from the resulting mess, al'dente /> <br /> Long and short, though not terribly dreadful, it was definitely not worth it to use one of my NetFlix rentals.
