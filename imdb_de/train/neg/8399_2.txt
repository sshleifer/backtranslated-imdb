I'm a big Stooges fan, but the only and redeeming quality of this movie is that Curley is there. Long before he starts drinking, he is his classic self (and Larry is not bad either). Moe's character is (mostly) a pure part and this movie should better be called "The Curley and Larry Movie". Not that one of the Stooges films was (in my opinion) very good, but as a commentator here said, how sad it is that this movie had real potential. The casting was good, it was well staged, filmed and edited, but the story tried something serious with just a few stooges antics and musical numbers (which, I think, were good at the time). The Best You Can If you really believe that it must be better than mowing the lawn and removing the garbage (which is debated), you'll have to wait and sleep on Curley / Larry scenes or something in the kitchen find food during the rest.
