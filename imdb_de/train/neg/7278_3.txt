This little-to-see movie was a bit difficult to prevail. None of the segments is good, but at least the first was slightly amusing and the middle segment was a bit inventive. The last one was just brutal, and after pulling on two faint comedy shorts, the third one was really painful to look at. Even at the low standards of a National Lampoon movie, this movie was particularly boring and joyless.
