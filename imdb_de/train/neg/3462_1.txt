Slash flicks are very rare in recent days, and when I heard about Cut, I had high hopes and heard good things. The good things I heard were all wrong ... very wrong! This strip is bad and I mean bad. It's just stupid. Everything about it, especially the origin of the murderer and how he stays alive and how he will be cared for in the end. There is nothing original or unusual about this film. Just another Slasher wannabe with these "hips," "self-esteem." "Film savvy" characters. I'm so tired of this crap. Someone else is doing something because the slash genre literally needs new blood.
