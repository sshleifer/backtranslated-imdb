The property offers no new excitement, it even starts like in Cube I. This time there are no further improvements to the cube machinery except that there is an extra exit that is not guarded, very ingenious. The characters are also not as well crafted as in the first episode, they just became "flat" like in a soap opera. <br /> <br /> When someone reaches the normal exit, the person is asked some questions, such as "Do you believe in God?", it is not really creative or original and in my opinion, does not fit into the mystery of the cube on. There really is not much to say about it.
