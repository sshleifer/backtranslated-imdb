When a movie like "The Dukes of Hazzard" brings in over $ 75 million, it makes some very sad statements about the state of our own society. Either we are collectively too stupid to avoid such waste, or I do not know how many people will address this type of waste without effort. Hollywood had no incentive to do anything good movies, because if it brings out garbage, people will see it anyway, because nothing else is on the screen. That's the I went out, even though I got a free movie pass. The dialogue could not be more stupid. The stunts could not be over the top and outrageous. Maybe this "bigger, bigger" picture is interesting for Texans, but neither I nor others liked it in the theater. None of the "big names" was in this career-ending movie, except for Burt Reynolds, who says you need to hear everything you need. Jessica Simpson - do not make me laugh. <br /> <br /> I would not even recommend this movie for videos, even if you were desperate. It was about fooling the public into earning enough money after the opening day to be equal or better than marketing costs. They did, although the public was forewarned. Stupidity abounds.
