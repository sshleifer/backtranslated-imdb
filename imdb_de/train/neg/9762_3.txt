Alan Alda plays the realistic "Sports Illustrated" writer George Plimpton, who was once an honorary member of the Detroit Lions football team. Rather wan, an uncomplicated drama that is curiously tempered with imagination. Director Alex March attacks this material in an interesting way, by making it almost documentary (with macho commentary) and yet the story is given a touch of capraesque humor. By highlighting the cinematic conspicuousness in this set-up, he turns the main narrative into a mess. Alma's smug, uncharismatic performance is another handicap, though the side squad is filled with real professional athletes (and Lauren Hutton shimmers as Ala's girlfriend - what kind of fantasy is that?). * 1/2 of ****
