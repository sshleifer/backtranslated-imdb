There were more interesting Polish documentaries about worm breeding in Brazil !! The competition (worm breeding) had a better plot and more interesting characters. I was physically ill after seeing this movie. The fraudulent husband (I believe dougray_scott_) was a joke in every way. Poor Jennifer really needs the work, and what about the accent !! The venues and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank and showed the humility of a ten-year cooking class. It was so bad that I think I'll write the sequel titled "This is not a laxative". Thank you for listening to me. It was a big burden of my consciousness.
