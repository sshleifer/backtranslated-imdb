Immediately after borrowing and watching this movie a few years ago, a friend and I decided that he defined the absolute zero on the film scale. There was nothing about the film that could have gone worse than it was. To date, we rate films, even very bad ones, as much better than "The Lonely Lady". <br /> <br /> A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the screenplays including "Last Summer" and "Diary of a Mad Housewife," and she told that she was asked to write a screenplay for to write the book "The Lonely Lady" by Harold Robbins. She said that she had sent a treatment and was denied because she did not think she understood the difficulties of a Hollywood scriptwriter. She then said, "I think they got someone else to write it." The interview was filmed before the movie was released. She died in 1981 and I bet the first thing she did when she arrived in heaven was God personally for saving her from involvement in the outcome.
