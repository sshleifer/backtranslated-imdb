I was thrilled with this movie, because of this plot and the desire to see a horror. To my disappointment, this became more of a comedy than a horror. The drama, the dialogue and the flow of the film was all very bad. Much did not make sense. For example, there is a group of about 30 people, and they are all afraid of one person even though they are in a secret place. I kept thinking, maybe it was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie, but they were trying too hard to make it look cruel - emphasis on trying. I've seen Halloween costumes look more believable. A guy whose head had been cut off ... looked clean-missing signs of bones, flesh, blood and even the head. A strong downstroke with an ax on a corpse should interfere with something ... The guy swung a bat instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Finding out who the main rogue should actually be contradicted but other parts of the story. What would the guy imagine? If there is a turn, you should at least be prepared to add puzzles and tension.
