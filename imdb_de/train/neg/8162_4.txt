Your attitude to Prom Night II will determine how much pleasure you take in the movie. If you expect a horror masterpiece, look elsewhere. If you like Campy films that are fun to develop, then you like it. Lisa Schrage played the part of her life when Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd were exaggerated. Schrage's anger was perfectly "obsessed" during her time. <br /> <br /> No classic cinema, but a fun way to kill a few hours with a nasty end. <br /> <br />
