I want to clarify a few things. I'm not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai films, and I'm very familiar with art cinema. I grew up in the seventies from Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. <br /> <br /> Art films were really ART at that time; like colors. People did it to express their inner feelings, not really worried when other people understood something. They were beyond commercial values. Look at some old Antonioni (or early Picasso) and you will understand. <br /> <br /> Tian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with it. It's an opportunistic movie designed to fool festival judges and critics and play many things without saying anything. <br /> <br /> History does not make sense. Due to the lack of water, the government encourages the use of watermelons for hydration. A girl in despair steals water from the public baths toilet. There's also a porn star (Neighbor) trying to make a film with an actress he does not feel comfortable with. There is a romantic awakening between the girl and the pornstar. The chaos ends with a sexual scene (not pornographic) that makes many people feel shocked, but I think it's less provocative than American Pie or History of Violence. The two main characters are never called conversing. Sometimes a music style of number 60 appears and explains (through a song) what happens in the heads of the characters. These video clips are very much to be welcomed, as the previous scene without dialogue or music, which only looks at each other, sometimes takes 4, 5 or even more minutes, which is too much in film times. <br /> <br /> There are also some comments on "the hard to make sex without love", the "egoism of the porn industry". <br /> <br /> It's obvious that this movie was meant to fool festival jury and critics. There are a few pseudo-shocking scenes (as part of censorship in Taiwan) and many topics are open, but nothing is complete or is going anywhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks have given the film some (controversial) major awards at film festivals and brought the film to an undeserved commercial success (I watch the movie in France and the theater was full). <br /> <br /> But please, do not be fooled. There is nothing new or original or even original told or filmed in this film. It is boring and empty. really a scam for the public. Boogie Nights (which I did not really like), Intimacy and 9 songs are far better movies.
