Okay, I really wanted to see this movie. It's a joke about the "Who's Who" in horrorland that's in the movie. Well, my friend rented it, brought it over and we started to look at it. It's supposed to be a comedy ... I did not even smirk up to the 40-minute mark. <br /> <br /> Does it have anything to do with the budget? Not at all, in fact, there are films that cost ONLY INTENTIONALLY NOTHING, and they are amazing (to me). While watching this movie, I could not help recognizing the similarities (ie STEALING) to a low budget indie movie titled ACTRESS APOCALYPSE. > <br /> This movie ... had potential that was really possible. It had the "Starpower" stolen story (filming a movie behind the scenes ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" ... seriously, that annoys me the more I think about it), ... it could have been really funny. A lot, many of the jokes fall flat. The play is fine for what it is. But it got through, was not funny and the conspiracy was totally stolen. <br /> <br /> I give this a two because it was not that great, but that's the ONLY reason.
