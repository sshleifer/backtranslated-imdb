I'm a big, big fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I like Stephen King a little less, but I like some of his work. <br /> <br /> I said I should have loved 1408. <br /> <br /> *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT **** <br /> <br /> I ran eagerly. I left disappointed. <br /> <br /> That's not the fault of the actors. Shalhoub and Jackson both play very small roles, as Cusack is put into the scenario "Man in a locked room" by the premise of the film. <br /> <br /> This was not a bad movie, but I can not call it a good one either. It was a jumbled mess, the moments of "Ouch, that's just WRONG," combined with moments of "Ouch, that's just painful," and moments of "Oh, now that's just unhappy," with very little continuity between them , Eislin's father appears once, and there seems to be no connection to the rest of Mike's private life we ​​see while trying to survive the room. <br /> <br /> An earlier commentator considered the Olin / Enslin argument worth seeing, and I agree with that. But aside from some clever musical clues (the room is almost playfully teasing Enslin and gives him a chance to come out before he raises the stake ... at which point the one-hour countdown clock and the title line of the Carpenters' We have him It's mostly "stuff jumps on you when you least expect it!" guy horror that was fun when I was fourteen years old and surrounded by friends my age who clung together in the summer As Jason joined Camp Crystal Lake, he clung to his most painful "Mindgaming" with "Let's anorize the paintings", cliché dairy. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ** *** <br /> <br /> I expected something better from this movie with Stephen King's name and the actors I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> We never experience the origin of evil. We can never see that evil e is defeated, although we can assume that it may have been defeated. <br /> <br /> And the end was just a terrible "what ?!" Moment. <br /> <br /> Wait until it comes on cable. I would not have minded paying Matinee for it, but I feel somewhat alienated for paying the prices for the opening night.
