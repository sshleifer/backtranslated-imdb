I've just seen the third week of Stephen King's Nightmares and Dreamscapes mini series; That means I have seen 6 episodes so far. I have to say that the stories are really weak. I read Stephen King's Skeleton Crew, a collection of his short stories published a long time ago. I remember that most of the stories were average to bad, but there was one that was really excellent, if not extraordinary. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to say is just because this miniseries stems from a collection of stories by Stephen King does not mean that it will be good. In fact, if his previous collection of short stories is an indication, most of these mini-series will be average to bad. <br /> <br /> In defense of Stephen King, I have not read these new short stories. Maybe they are well suited as stories in a book and can not easily be adapted to television, or it may have been the scriptwriters' fault when they tried to write an interesting script. Who knows. These short stories may have been created solely for this miniseries and are not intended for printing. Maybe that was the problem. If Stephen King had submitted these crap stories to an editor, the editor would have told him right away he should make it more interesting because it's just boring. <br /> <br /> What's clear The problem lies in the stories / scripts and not in the actors and actresses, as this miniseries are influenced by some great people. <br /> <br /> This mini-series really makes me appreciate the old "Twilight Zone" series.Each series lasted only half an hour, but it was captivating and intriguing, I do not understand why this miniseries perform similarly I'm sure this miniseries had a lot of money to make a good mini-series, but unfortunately something did not have to click. <br /> <br /> For example, two episodes were shown this week It was a horror story writer who bought a picture of an artist who committed suicide, and the writer begins to see changes in the picture as he drives home, feeling uncomfortable and throwing the painting away, but it always appears The portrait of a person in this picture also kills people and wants to kill them (I will not mention the second episode of this week involving criminals and their prey d because it was even more boring than this episode!) <br /> <br /> This premise is interesting and therefore the story should be good after seeing I was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story and it It turned out that foreign materials were shown that do not help history. After the last scene I had more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> I've been trying to get interested in this miniseries for 3 weeks, but it was just too annoying due to bad stories / screenplays. If it was a movie, I would have recommended that people wait until the movie comes out on cable or something similar. I would not even recommend renting it in your video library. However, since this is on TNT, a cable channel, I would say, if you have not seen it yet, then try it for a week. If you do not like it this week, you will not like the past series or the future series because they all have the same boring trait.
