This is probably one of the worst "wants a low budget hit" to honor the dinosaur genre. The movie is so predictable that you can go away, cook yourself, answer the phone or whatever and when you get back you know exactly what happened. The special effects are so bad that you thought Lego bricks were used and the "super fast" dinosaurs were so tame that a dog looks like a robber. The acting is overcooked. They try so hard, but there are not enough characters behind them to get into the characters, and for the scientist ... Yeah, okay, we know exactly what's going to happen to the blond chick in glasses. For such films stereotype was created. If you want to watch this movie, suggest you are not as serious as the cast and crew. And if you really love dinosaurs and know everything in the world about them, do not pay attention, you could break the screen - the facts are so far away.
