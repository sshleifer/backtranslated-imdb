Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. Wes Anderson conducts and brings the short eponymous book to the big screen in a feature film. Although I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man, did, the film seemed to have lost in its own clever mind. Anderson seems to have left the story behind, knowing that he is a talented man, and if this was a bad movie, it would be his first bad movie. Just as if you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in filmmaking, so I'll let him go. I admit that it had a cleverness and a nice mind, and the animation is nice, but it's getting harder and harder to get into the movie, leave the story behind and take random shots of random things. The characters are good too. Jason Schwartzman comments on Mr. Fox (George Clooney) 's clever donkey son Ash and is particularly dedicated. The movie does not make it a terrible situation, but it's definitely getting closer and closer. I'm sure Wes Anderson will be back on track with another amazing movie if and where he decides to shoot another movie, but for the moment I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this movie was a big disappointment.
