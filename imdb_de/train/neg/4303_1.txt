The previous comment made me write this. It is said that Muslims are blond and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment only says that this opinion can be made by racists. Looks, race is nothing. I am color blind. I look like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not an Irishman. I can add that I am not 100% Serb, that I have some Austrian and Croatian blood in me, but what is the point. I am dark, mixed race? Is that so? Anyone who uses racial prejudice with such bad intentions as Lantos (producer and director is racist to me, Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman) They are all monsters and I blame them for living my life, my family, my country, Yuggoslavia have destroyed everything in hell, but that does not bring back our dead relatives. I'm proud to be a Serb, and I'm proud of my cousins, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians and Arabs (yes, I'm from Serbia and I have a multi-ethnic family). This movie I show: I kneel and pray for all the innocent sisters and brothers killed in this war. This film is a manipulation of our misery, false humanitarianism that does not help at all. It helps Lantos to fill his pockets with more doe, all right!
