This movie could have been so much better, especially considering the talent. Larenz Tate's portrayal of Frankie Lymon was not good, especially on musical performances. He's not good at lip synching, and his stage mania is Larenz Tate if he was to be Frankie Lymon. The portrayal of women as a bunch of gold diggers has been written by Hollywood. However, the forces, which seemed to be crowded, only made it more unrealistic. The positive results of the film were the portrayal of Little Richard by Miguel Nunez and the cameo of Little Richard. As always, Lela Rochon is a feast for the eyes, also in a conservative role. Too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox were wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was intriguing in real life. Too bad that this movie was a wasted opportunity.
