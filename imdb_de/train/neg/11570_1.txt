The intention of the directors for these films is very honorable, but his story of his productions has made me aware that this may not be as much at the heart of things as other filmmakers would be. With his great 30-day TV series in mind, he also counts in his MTV production "I Bet You Want", which contradicts his seriousness in all matters he documents, and also in his rather disappointing production "Excessive me" hopes. Unfortunately, this movie disappointed me anyway. like "supersize me", after a while I wondered what exactly that is all about. After half an hour, the main message is clear enough, but the rest of the season is filled with pretty pointless material that has already been shown in this or another way in the movie, so it gets worn out and the end gets extremely boring.
