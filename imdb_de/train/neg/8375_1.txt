America. A land of freedom, hope and dreams. This is the nation that, since independence, has sought to bring democracy, prosperity and peace to the whole world for the benefit of all humanity. However, there are times when one can not help but wish that the Americans would stay on their side of the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This 'film' (and I use that word with some reservations) evokes these feelings with an intense purity. This vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin, a crazy jewel thief who was created by sticking the severed head of Marlon Wayan to the body of a two-foot dwarf. After Calvin unintentionally threw a large diamond into Vanessa's handbag, a career woman unwilling to have children, it becomes clear that he has to ingratiate herself with her to win back the diamond. Like any normal man, Calvin disguises himself as a 2-year-old and parks on the doorstep of the poor woman, where Darryl, Vanessa's husband, discovers him. <br /> <br /> Darryl is inconsistent with Calvin's disguise, though the "baby" has full teeth, stubble, a tattoo, a knife mark, and the sex drive of a 16-year-old man. old. Even more absurd, Vanessa does not look past Calvin's baby clothes and actually tries to quench the little pervert. This miserable attack on the soul of humanity attempts and fails to find humor in rape, skatology, sexual assault and pedophilia, but in a dishonest attempt to turn into a piece of "family entertainment" in which the Wayan brothers mingle a disgusting amount of feeling and faulty morals. <br /> <br /> The brothers are making an attempt at Freudian rehabilitation of their theft stalwart by revealing that he had "a bad father". By repeatedly beating Darryl in stride, Calvin can develop the loving father-son relationship he and Darryl have always desired. As if this were not ridiculous enough, Calvin's attempts to sexually offend Vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to indulge in a successful career, and that she should spend her life instead, the role of the housebound little woman who spends her time taking turns squeezing babies and cooking for her husband. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the Wayan brothers have blended their stark and twisted humor with the clich√©d sentimentality that has infected much of Hollywood's recent work. Also, they are endemic to the current generation of black comedians responsible for turning African-American humor into a poor and miserable shadow that makes fart joke and gross sexual gags cocky. By law, these two people should be prevented from resuming anything that resembles a camera even remotely. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of American cinema means that they will undoubtedly have filmed two sequels next month and earn millions of dollars in heavy merchandising offerings.
