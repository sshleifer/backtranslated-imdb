This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Bad drama, bad special effects, bad plot, all bad. In the last 15 minutes, a cat with a matching cyborg is introduced, which confuses everything. Malcom MacDowell had to make a house payment, otherwise he would have to sell on the Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just do not know how you can get from Clockwork Orange to this crap and look every morning in the mirror. I could have done better special effects in my bathtub. There is no continuity As for drugs, it is so bad. Act. Do you need to smoke to be bad? The gun shoots either blue flames or bullets, decides What's the name of 2013 Seadly Wake, it has nothing to do with the movie
