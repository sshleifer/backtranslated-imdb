Oh, that's really true. I've seen movies that I did not like for some reason, but I've never seen a movie that fails in every aspect of filmmaking. Even filmmaking does not fail, in a way that can be said to be true of Hercules in New York. It's not the movie that I like the least, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting is the first thing you notice. I've never seen a worse movie outside of pornography. In fact, I have a lot of pornographic films that are a damn good site. It is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's awful. The camera work is amateurish. The processing is nonsensical. I suppose that they could not afford proper sound equipment, and that meant every scene in a car (and many of them) at a speed of about three miles an hour and every scene in front of the same forest (and there are many of them) them too), which are actually dubbed from a studio, which in turn gives the bad porn atmosphere more favor. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy is nonsensical, as many have said. I will defend vampires who walk in the daylight by the fact that although it was popularized by Nosferatu, it was never originally an integral part of the vampire myth. <br /> <br /> Speaking of vampire myth, the author had apparently read Carmilla, or at least The Vampire Lovers. I'm not sure how I feel about it because I'm impressed that a movie that is so bad has at least a claim to a gothic novel that I like very much; or annoyed by his best sledgehammer references, and in the worst case the total desecration of the source material. At least "General" is an insult to Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> However, it does get two stars just because I can not bring myself to choose a star for a movie that has or at least claims to have both vampires and zombies in it. By the way, the same day I saw Lifeforce (another movie stuffed with tough vampires and zombies), and even though it's a pretty flawed movie itself, it's really a masterpiece by comparison. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, this is not a movie that is so bad that it is good, or so bad that it is somehow fun, even drunk. It's just a mess and it's worth watching.
