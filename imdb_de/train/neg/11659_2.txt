I loved * the * original Scary Movie *. I'm a big fan of parody - it's my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes considered the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to perfectly understand this concept in the original film, forgetting it temporarily as they made the sequel. I think the Wayans are a family of weird geniuses. Unfortunately, geniuses make mistakes as well. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with promises. I liked the "The Exorcist" parody, especially the "come-out-out-ma" gag. Well, that's Wayans quality material. Besides, I can only think of two other times I've laughed: 1) When Tori Spelling is seduced by a ghost in the middle of the night, he becomes attached and starts talking to him about marriage. Meanwhile, he says, "It was just a loot call!" That was funny. 2) The parody "Save the Last Dance," in which the Cindy character accidentally beats a girl while training her new moves. But even the short-lived giggling is no match for the snappy laughter of the first Scary Movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pure garbage filled with cheap gags. Jokes from the first film that were subtle or implied are magnified and exaggerated. In Scary Movie I, for example, several innuendos are made to indicate that the character Ray is gay. That was weird. But in Scary Movie II, the whole penis strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was stunning and unbelievably unstable. This is the pattern of the entire movie. Shock Humor * Alone * does not bring a movie very far. Unfortunately, this was a trend in the years 2000 and 2001. <br /> <br /> As much as it hurts me to rate a Wayans movie so low, I have to give this one 2 out of 10 points.
