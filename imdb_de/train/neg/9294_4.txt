As someone who was impressed by the incredible pictures of "Hero", I really wanted to see this movie, which was calculated in the same direction, but better. It also featured an actress that I like: Ziyi Zhang. I was disappointed on both counts. I bought the DVD of this movie invisible, and that was a mistake. It was not better. <br /> <br /> I recognize that these martial arts films are pure fantasy, but this story goes so far beyond anything credible and shook my head in disappointing disbelief. A blind woman who defeats hundreds of enemies? Sorry, that goes a bit far. Also the male main character "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialogue, his stupid facial expression and his stupid laugh that he also ruined the film. Despite the wonderful colors and colors of amazing action scenes, this story - to me - simply had no incentive to turn it into a movie worth owning. This movie is not a "hero" of me!
