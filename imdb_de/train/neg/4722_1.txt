Do not watch as this Serbian documentary and its Serbian propaganda look for this documentary, and you will see facts and truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> <br /> The Documentation of Death of Yugoslavia (of five episodes) is a carefully compiled and researched account of the vast mass blood that marked the end of the old Federal Yugoslavia and encompassed most of the first half of the nineties. It contains a wealth of news films and interviews with parties involved, both "Yugoslavian" and otherwise. The only real "improvement" that could be made from this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of later developments in the Balkans since the program was implemented. Although this was done in the late 1990s for a replay on BBC television, adding some more recent events would help complete this amazingly detailed and cumbersome work. Maybe another whole episode could be justified? The very brief title of this documentary became all the more appropriate as the now named state of Serbia and Montenegro had abandoned the term "Yugoslavia" - a much belated and formal recognition of what had happened years ago /> <br /> no fiction as in " Yugoslavia: The Preventable War (1999) "
