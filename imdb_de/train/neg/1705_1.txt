A terrible amateur director (no, not Todd Sheets), his new girlfriend and sister explore a cave. The friend and sister fall in and are saved. In the meantime, a gang of terribly named girls is defending their "turf." Whatever that means. This movie and I use the term VERY casually, is so bad that it's ... well, bad. The humor is painless, the "action" only sad. Now, in my time, I have seen some terribly horrible horror movies and have not gotten out of hand in my approach to watching low-budget movies, yet I still cry for anyone who chooses to. ONLY for the die-hardest Maschocists among you. but the rest is running FAST !! <br /> <br /> My grade: F
