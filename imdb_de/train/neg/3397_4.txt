The trailer of this movie interested me enough to lend the DVD. The resulting film is absolutely filthy! Granted, this is not the worst movie ever made, or the worst movie of the year, but it came damn close! <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the movie does not know what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen porn? The story is interesting because it deals with the pitfalls of bridal couples, but the movie is a mess. What begins as a mildly interesting "comedy" (a word I use in the loosest terms) is completely reversed and degenerates into a very dark and obnoxious misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better and Ben Chaplin is wasted! Like Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, of whom I can only assume that they did it for the money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie in almost every way. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could forgive Benny Hill almost everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just uncomfortable. A movie that should be avoided unless you absolutely must see Kidman or Chaplin in each of their films!
