If you're not mentally ill or the most die-hard Segal fanatic, you'll get tired of this terrible apology for a movie in less than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot - Even for a Seagal movie, the plot is just stupid. I mean, it's not just bad, it's hardly coherent. <br /> <br /> The Acting - Incredibly wooden. Literally that one behaves better with porn. Ironically, this film tries to make money from this audience, which is a "lesbian love scene" that is absolutely scary worthy. <br /> <br /> Special effects - would not appear out of place in a '60s Sword and Magic Ship. <br /> <br /> If you do not suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other remedies, do not make the same mistake as me and buy this DVD as you will ask for an hour and a half of your life.
