It looks as if the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced the writing somewhere off the coast, perhaps to MediocreLand? "PP" reminds me of one of the many boring, initially promising but predictable David Kelly-Flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases that they get are so fancy that they hardly cause pity or sadness. And that's what makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations that you're afraid of "this could be me" feeling. You are not funny either. <br /> <br /> The actors are pretty good, but the storylines are dead and can not be brought back to life. I'm a therapist, and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the incredibly incompetent, immoral, untrained therapist. Those who write their stuff have ignored the ethics and the transfer / countertransference courses at Stanford. Someone should give them a code of ethics (the episode with the woman who is bleeding and the therapist's involvement). No therapist is that bad. <br /> <br /> Women who yearn for men who moved on - had died, we all had the title of "Sex and the City". Addison, in her adolescent aggression to the guy she likes - very inappropriate in her age, looks so unnatural to a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actress does not believe it herself and does not do it very well. The only successful / tasty developments are Addison, who struggles with her decision to move to LA, and the "Voodoo Dr" and dealing with widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept could work together with a completely new writing team.
