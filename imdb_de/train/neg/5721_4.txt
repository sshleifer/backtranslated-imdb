I was not a fan of the 2005 Gore Festhit "Hostel", and most of those lame assholes are just as bad or worse - but "Live Feed" was able to entertain me a bit for the first 30 minutes. Starting with a lot of sex and dodgy settings, followed by some good death scenes involving the Chinese Organized Crime Squad and a 7 foot leather-covered butcher ... What got me out of the movie was the tough "hero" with Weapons and a grudge that save the day ... I would call this film mediocre at best, since a premise that slaughters mainly unsavory young people in a dodgy adult movie theater and doubles as a hiding place for the mafia is appealing to me , If the torture had lasted so long that it was really effective, my assessment would have changed a lot. Unfortunately, most of the atrocities are put together in one scene, so the rest of the movie can be completed as a vengeful scenario. Basically, it's just a cheap hostel "hostel" with the redemptive use of free sex, which is almost constant in the first half of the movie ... Overall, I would say you should not engage in this movie.
