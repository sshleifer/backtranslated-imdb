WOW, this movie was so awful. I am so glad that I did not have to pay any money to see this horrible movie. It was like a story nut was going on a cola intoxication! The previews made it decent, but it was really bad. I'll say the idea sounded decent, but come on. it was really bad. If you sat down and thought about it, you would also realize that it was UNREALISTIC. Come back the day you think you have all the stuff to work on. It was not as if Ben Franklin had sat down one day and made a damned riddle. It was completely ridiculous, and if you want to see a bad movie, then you will definitely see it. All and ALL HORRIBLE movie could be in my top 10 worst movies I've ever seen.
