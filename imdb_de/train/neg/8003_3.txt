Do not be fooled, as I was from the "glowing" reviews on the DVD box. "Wildly entertaining", "a really scary freakout" and the worst of all: "ON PAR WITH JAWS". This movie is none of the above. <br /> <br /> Usually I do not care to write bad reviews for movies, but I can not believe that movie will rest on a comfortable 7 at IMDb. It did not deserve it. <br /> <br /> After such a blatant attack on the daylight of a monster created by other chemicals that have been dumped by lazy scientists, this movie is absolutely going nowhere and it's going slowly. Basically and unlikely, a girl gets caught by the monster (I give them points for a good creature design, but that's not a WETA creation) and her half-funny family spends an hour and a half spotting them ... in the sewers around the han. Your search has no reason - again, someone called this on par with Jaws? - and when you find her, you realize that everything was pretty pointless. Apart from that, much of the film is committed to a state quarantine that ends in a fun scene in which a guy spits in a rain gutter in front of a crowded bus stop. <br /> <br /> sheet metal. That was bad. I'm not joking. You want to see a lazy monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. At least you save 30 minutes of your life.
