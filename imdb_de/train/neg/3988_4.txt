In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee clearly has a lot in his head. He thinks about racism-colorism, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, 'hetero-sexism', politics of drug warfare etc. and so on. This level of consciousness is own is great. I think it's a blessing that more and more people are critically investigating basic aspects of our daily lives. the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. Just because Lee makes contentious movies, he does not make him a good filmmaker. <br /> <br /> What appears in "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is essentially the result of two main mistakes: First, Lee just tries too much. He seems desperate to try to integrate any political / social message he can imagine into the 90 minutes. And so the end result seems confused and indecisive, as he does not waste time developing characters that can fully embody the ideas he wants to present. And so he exhausted clich√©s, and we stay behind with glittering testimonies and very charged dialogues. The end result is very staged and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Secondly, by trying to make statements about such a variety of social functions, he seems to have no concrete or original interpretation of the social / political issues presented. What comes up is a puddle of reveled folly. They feel he bought a basic sociology textbook and spit out all 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are extremely problematic features as the artistry of the movie is sacrificed and the work is converted into a speaker for the voice of the filmmaker's voice. He can not distance himself from work and let it speak for himself. <br /> <br /> It works neither as a work of art nor as a solid political argument. <br /> <br /> Although I still value Lee for addressing these important issues, I have to say: <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
