If you lose a lot of time, that's fine. It moves at a good pace, but to be able to pull off this film, it would have to be a little longer, with a little more background to the sitter. <br /> <br /> The action is okay. Mariana Klaveno as a sitter does the best job and is the most credible. William R. Moses played a pretty good role as a husband. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, as The woman had a weak role and the reasons for her return to work were not developed. <br /> <br /> The end is kind of stupid. Like most of these sitter movies ... there are interesting parts ... but overall, you wonder why you spent the time.
