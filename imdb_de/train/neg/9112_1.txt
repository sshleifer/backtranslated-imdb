Basically, Cruel Intentions 2 Cruel Intentions 1 is again only badly done. With a few exceptions, the story is exactly the same as the first one (including some of the lines). The cast is more unknown and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and looking at me, I felt dirty because it compares to a softcore porn. I am not sure if I should reproach the actors or the writers with some of the idiotic lines. Waste of my life. I'm literally surprised to see some movies made, and this is no exception ... I can not believe they would do a third.
