Terrible movie. About an old, crunchy painter hanging out with a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil goes through the movements in her part and has some of the craziest lines in film history. Richard Burton sees death in this movie and we believe he looks "Good for sixty". Acting is bad, just like the plot. The characters are terrible, as is the story. It's really hard for anyone to feel in this movie, except for Larry Ewashen, who plays a man in a porn cinema performing on Tatum, he's kind of funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you're a Tatum fanatic like me - that's why I hired him at all - please do not watch this movie. She's really bad at it, and you're wondering if PAPER MOON was a coincidence. It was not like that because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS it is known that she can behave well, but does not lend this movie. And if you're a fan of Burton, rent something if it looks good, not fossil.
