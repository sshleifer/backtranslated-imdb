Can A-Pix ever do something right? This film should be shown in letterbox format on television. Since A-Pix does not even believe in Pan & Scan, we see scenes in which one shoulder on the left side of the screen speaks with a shoulder on the right. Of course not that you miss a lot. This movie is unbelievably bad. It's very hard to enjoy a movie in which the characters scream 80% of the movie for no reason.
