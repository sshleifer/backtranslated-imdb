This is one of the worst movies I have seen in years. Apart from Cuba and Angie, acting is actually embarrassing. Was not Archer even a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent, but completely implausible. The make-up is so bad that it is worth mentioning. I mean, who thinks about make-up in a contemporary movie? Someone should tell the make-up artist and the DOP that you should not actually see it. The end is a massive disappointment - in the sense of "and then they realized that everything was a dream". You're better off staring into space for only 2 hours.
