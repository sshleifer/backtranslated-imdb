This film is a portrait of the half-spastic teenage boy Benjamin, who has to attend a boarding school because of his bad grades in Math. He did not make the best experiences in life before and got serious self-esteem issues. After a rough start in his new school, he starts to befriend, falls in love with a girl and does some American Pieish teenage stuff. <br /> <br /> In addition to some comedy elements, the film is told in a very serious way that focuses on Benjamin and his problems. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this story, save yourself time and look at something else. If you do so, please consider the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Benjamin is a total loser. Whatever he does, he does it terribly wrong and then he goes all the time for self-pity. For me he was not such a charming loser, for whom one has pity and with whom one can laugh. Instead, he and his behavior really annoyed me, and with my own teenage years not so far behind, I could barely watch. <br /> <br /> 2) The movie is hardly trying to be realistic and the story seems to be mine. The characters just do not experience it (except Janosch maybe). And yes, I know that this film is based on a car biography written by a 17-year-old - but I have some experience with German schools and German teenagers myself and do not believe him. <br /> <br /> 3) Showing sexual awakening is really important for a movie with this theme. However, I doubt that teenage boys make an "ejaculate on the biscuit" contest, where everyone in mass-masturbation in the woods has to hit a cookie with his sperm and the loser then has to eat the sperm-safe biscuit. Although it somehow amused me contemptuously, it is neither funny nor does it underline the serious attempts of this film. <br /> <br /> 4) There is a subplot about Benjamin's family and his father, who betray his wife - still I do not know why it is there and where it is put. It just bored me. <br /> <br /> Well, personally, I hated this movie because it had the character of Benjamin, with no message, concept, scheme, whatever and failed to make dramatic and serious attempts. However, I can imagine that some people find it useful and touching. If you liked "The Other Sister," you probably like them too. I hated both. <br /> <br /> 17-year-old boys should not write an autobiography, and when they do, it does not seem like the best idea to turn it into a movie. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points.
