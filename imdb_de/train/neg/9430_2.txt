I too was deceived by the packaging. I too fell in love with the bloody packaging and the DVD case, claiming "saddened fans because every copy was pulled off the shelves". Although it was cheap ($ 6.99), it's not really worth it - no fear and very limited blood pressure. The end was very cheesy and did not deliver the punch it should have. I do not know how it became a "Video Nasty", how tame it is. The story continues, the characters are obvious amateur actors ... they do not keep the promise. The DVD bonus feature (the "interview") is very strange as the director is very incoherent and not all there. The leading actress speaks like in a Shakespeare production. It's a great laugh.
