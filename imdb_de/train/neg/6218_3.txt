My thoughts on the movie, 9 <br /> <br /> It was not good, not good at all. Visually, it was great. I was happy with the tempo, the camera angles, etc. But the characters? eh, somehow bland. Plot? It was shit. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to be more of an era than anything else. Organized religion is depicted cowardly and anxious. Science is not better represented. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but "souls" have the power to destroy monsters and bring them to life? Really? <br /> <br /> This is something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI movie ... created with science ... and they use it to teach us that science is going to destroy the world, while promoting the idea that spirituality is saving us becomes. At least they had the decency to ask one of the characters. <br /> <br /> "Okay, what now?" (or something similar). I could not hear it well because the crowd immediately got up and paused for the exit. It was an "okay ... it was just entertaining enough to sit here for the whole movie, but now we'll get out of here as soon as possible!" Type of exit. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you can not imagine if you want to enjoy it. Look at the visuals and nod pretty. Any thought, "what's the point of it?" They suck you out of unbelief and let you watch the exit sign with longing. <br /> <br /> Okay ... follow SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Well, basically a scientist creates "the machine". that is able to create a different, intelligent robot life. Bad people use it as a weapon. However, the scientist also realizes that he is to blame. He gave the machine his mind, but not his heart. <br /> <br /> The Machine puts Skynet on the collective ass of humanity and eradicates all life on earth. However, the scientist succeeds in surviving and creating running sock puppets. Anyone who contains a piece of the scientist's soul. <br /> <br /> The last one, No. 9, wakes up and knows nothing about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets another like himself, # 2. <br /> <br /> Well, # 2 is being captured by a machine's last robot. # 9 finds more like himself and sets out to save # 2. <br /> <br /> You are successful. <br /> <br /> # 9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits perfectly with the device. He inserts it and the machine comes to life again ... taking out the soul of # 2. <br /> <br /> The film then continues with action scenes with # 9 trying to save his soul-drawn compatriots. <br /> <br /> You are finally successful and destroy the machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who ascend into the clouds. Then it rains and we see that life returns to the planet. That makes no sense. ! Hunh? <br /> <br /> That does not make sense. None at all. Why did the scientist want to split his soul into 9 Homunculi? What has it achieved? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!? <br /> <br /> Why did he expect nine small creatures, if nothing else works? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a "soul" to fight the first ... At least that would have been like having a reasonable chance of success. <br /> <br /> Why did you have to do it? Did you suck your souls from the machine into the machine and then destroy the machine and then free the souls to bring life to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to shut down and bring life back to life without all the insane steps?
