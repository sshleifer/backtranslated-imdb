This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Again, I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool (after buying this movie and the movie "Malevolence", which I also reviewed here, I mean mine Lesson learned). I love horror movies that play in the woods, in the desert or on a farm. This supposedly takes place in the woods of Texas, but was probably filmed in the backyard of the director. The production was probably the worst I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely the worst. The story had nothing to do with what was on the back. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and another "mom and pop" shop that buys used DVDs and none. So terrible was this poor, miserable apology for a movie. I've seen some bad movies (Troll 2 for example), but that definitely takes the cake. I do not think there was a worse movie than "Troll 2". Boy, I was wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone gives it to you for free, but even if you're stuck with it, unless you throw it out, which I'm doing !!!!
