Looking at Josh Kornbluth as an "act" in this film reminds me of my freshman TV production class, where the "non-wits" had the opportunity to prove how little fun they really had! When I try to summarize this would-be comedy. The jokes are sophomoric and telegraphic. The delivery is painfully bad. OUCH!!!!!!! The writing is simply dorkish. It's similar to a Bob Saget show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is just as painful as watching an hour and a half hour Saturday Night Live sketch (post Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hated this movie and want my money back !!!
