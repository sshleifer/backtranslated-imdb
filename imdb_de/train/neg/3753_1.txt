Because of the strike of the Writers Guild of America in 1988, they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty much a crap, consisting of Season 2 Repeat Cut + clips and was described by its author Maurice Hurley as "terrible, just terrible". <br /> <br /> Why the producers could not wait to do something decent, who knows. I suspect that because of the strike, the production ran out of money and she was only able to release a flashback episode, or Roddenberry was too ill at the time to refuse this halfhearted gathering. This episode also marks the last appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) in the series.
