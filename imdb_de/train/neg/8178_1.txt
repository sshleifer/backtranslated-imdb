Have you ever watched a movie when 20 or 30 minutes passed and suddenly you realize that you've actually seen the movie before? That happened to me with "The Young Graduates". The cover of the video box is deceptive when you find the video. I would swear that the two women on the cover are not even in the movie. Anyway, I was either born a decade too late to appreciate the intricacies of this movie, or ... it's just pointless junk. I have a strong tendency for the latter, but I think some have developed a connection to this film out there. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... plot. An action. Let's see ... here must be a plot somewhere. No, I can not find it. Essentially, some senior high school seniors look stupid, take drugs, and speak a language that was outdated decades ago. A student has a crush on her teacher. The teacher has a cold wife (which he actually refers to as an iceberg), so he is open-minded about the girl's progress. Our cat, BooBoo, was handcuffed by the dancing high school students. She watched with astonishing intensity as the dancers circled and droned on the dance floor. It's nice to see that at least one species found something interesting in this relic. 1.10
