THE IMMORTALIZER was interesting. It certainly did not kill me in the hour and a half, but it did not really impress me either. A group of children are kidnapped in an alleyway by Musclehead mutants (in a scene with the least convincing sound effect of the cinema) and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs. Here lead Dr. Divine and his team do brain transplants for their rich old patients so they can have young bodies again. Hey, this was quietly redone a few years later as FREEJACK with a big budget! Who knew that if you transplant an old person's brain into another body, the new voice will sound exactly like her old voice? With all the talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum, you can almost see the visions of FROM BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the minds of the producers. But production literally does not have the guts to do it. I never understood why, when someone makes a horror film on a low budget, he does not put it with gussets on the edge of the frame. The acting is uniformly terrible, the only good performance was Clarke Lindsley as Assistant Dr. Price scored. He has a nice bad laugh. The only aspect of THE IMMORTALIZER is that there are many old people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast has a few serious bumps for old people.
