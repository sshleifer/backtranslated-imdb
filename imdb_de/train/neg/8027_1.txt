I saw this movie. Until the end. And that was not easy. It's so boring, badly played and stolen in almost every detail of "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can not believe the makers are taking it seriously. Even more difficult to believe is how this "product" made it on VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you want to watch a horror movie, just watch "Scream", but if you want to laugh Loud and have fun watching, how some kids run through the woods, how they yell at each other and show their inability to observe dark areas.
