A true blasting of the film in the truest sense of the word. This British movie is boring. <br /> <br /> What an exciting action! A terrorist puts bombs on a train. How could the writers and producers of this stinker make this story a boring story? Glenn Ford, as the expert wanted to defuse the bomb, gets terrible writing material to work with. Of course, as he is called, his wife Anne Vernon leaves him. No wonder we have never heard of Miss Vernon. After such a movie it would be enough to end her career. <br /> <br /> This older man who loved trains and gets involved is our 1953 version of senile dementia. I found it very insulting to show this man in the end too.
