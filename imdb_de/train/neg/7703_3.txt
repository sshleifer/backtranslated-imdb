A famous showmaster enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack. The name of the assassin is Sawa. She still goes to school and works for a vicious criminal, Akai, who sleeps with her. One day, Sawa learns that he killed her parents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is a disappointing Gore Fest. "Kite" has style, but it's still garbage. The strange conspiracy about a teenage girl killing people as assassins tried to be scary and touching at the same time, and only dropped the story on his face. One of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good / bad heroine Sawa falls out of a building with a bodyguard. However, the dramatic structure is far from well orchestrated and the director Yasoumi Umetsu's whimsical and grotesque animations of the character's faces is terrible. Not only that, the intercourse sequences are just scary. <br /> <br /> Note: 3/10
