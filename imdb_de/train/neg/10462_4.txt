What was it? You can not change the future in front of the destination, as it has already been written. <br /> <br /> I give it that much. I wanted to see what happened next and that's why I saw the whole movie. This film has taken a concept and made it visible. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a recommendation, you will see it at the matinee prices. No thrill, but an interesting concept. You should have omitted the Y2K reference ....
