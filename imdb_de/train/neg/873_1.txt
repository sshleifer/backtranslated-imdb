A senior executive who is very successful in his career, but is unable in his famous life, meets a boy with Down syndrome who escaped from a residence. Both characters feel very alone, and apparently less intelligent will show the executive the beauty of the little things in life ... With this argument that somehow Amelie-like atmosphere and sentimental music I did not expect moralistic disgusting film. There were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite violent) and the interpretation of the two actors, Daniel Auteuil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to continue watching the movie. in general French cinema has the ability to show what appears to life in contrast to the more stereotypical American cinema quite a lot. For this reason it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd end, with the impossible death of the boy, the charming sound, the happiness of the family of the executive, cheap morality, the unbearable laughter of the daughters of the man as Michael Landon from heaven waved ... Really uncomfortable, in my humble opinion.
