Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons who dubiously expressed "relatively good track records" for predictions. <br /> <br /> In his widely reported comments from The 700 Club, January 2, Christian Broadcasting Network In the United States, "very serious terrorist attacks" and "mass killings" were in the "second half" of 2007 been listed. Host Robertson boasted he had "a relatively good record" according to earlier predictions. But a review of Robertson's forecasts for the new year of 2006 undermines this claim. He predicted, for example, that: "President Bush will step up." WRONG <br /> <br /> * "The autumn elections will not be conclusive, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will bring the Republicans to power." WRONG <br /> <br /> * "The war in Iraq will come to a successful conclusion and we will begin withdrawing troops before the end of this year." WAY FRONG <br /> <br /> As reported in an Associated Press article dated January 3, Robertson has made dubious predictions in the past: <br /> <br /> The broadcaster predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would easily win re-election. Bush won 51% of the vote in this case and beat Democratic Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. WRONG <br /> <br /> In 2005 Robertson predicted that Bush would win one victory after another in his second term. He said that the proposals for social security reform would be approved. FOLD AGAIN! <br /> <br /> He claims to speak directly with God ... If so, God has a sense of humor and watches Pat fooling himself again and again.
