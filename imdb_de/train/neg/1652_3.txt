I'm getting dull and to the point. This movie is not good at all. The movie freak part of me hated the acting, the script, the story, the director, and almost the entire cut. Amanda Peet has proven that she can act as she was the highlight of The Whole Nine Yards. So she should have avoided this movie with a three meter long pole. The infantile part of me, however, found this movie very funny. If you can forget how substandard the quality of production is, and if you find jokes funny, you should be fine. And for those of you who can not leave your podium, the choice is yours. My inner child did not die and I laughed a lot. Even then only a third of ten, because as a movie, he really stinks.
