Blue monkey is actually mentioned in the movie, but not in a meaningful way. At some point, some children wander through the lower levels and explore. <br /> <br /> They begin to discuss what they will find down there, and one of them (a girl) says she would bet she would find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's it. Completely irrelevant to the story, the only sad connection to the title, and no idea why she would think she would find a blue monkey in the basement of a hospital someone had to remember, I think!
