I saw this movie yesterday and although I had no big hopes for this movie, I was still very disappointed! I can not believe that I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was so bad !!! The plot was a shame and the acting was terrible (though she had big names like Uma Thurman). This movie relied heavily on his special effects ... but he personally had no influence on me. I honestly wish I had never seen it and urged everyone not to watch this movie. It is a total waste of money and you will be disappointed afterwards. My advice is to save money, go shopping, treat yourself, just not watch this movie ... you'll live it, lol!
