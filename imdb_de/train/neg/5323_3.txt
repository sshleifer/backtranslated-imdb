I can not believe that in the 34 previous comments, nobody mentioned that this movie is a blatant rip-off from Born Yesterday. A man is hired to adapt a supposedly stupid blonde to the needs of a gangster. Employees gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. Gangster is let down. Born Yesterday, however, was an intelligent treatment, while this is just so much fluff. Technicolor transmission on DVD is regrettable. Natalie Kalmus would turn in her grave. Look at the paperboy. Recognize him? However, it is historically interesting to see the roots of rock 'n roll. Also interesting is Ewell's introduction to CinemaScope, a new format at the time.
