The first movie of an actor is usually something you can not miss. It's often the first job to really see the lack of a movie experience of all involved, and this movie is no exception. That's so bad even for 1982 that it's hilariously funny. The film was completely filmed in the Chicago area with an apparently small budget. Most cast members in the cast are stiff, wooden and cartoonish - a mixture of a high school theater and a poor community theater. Noise from traffic nearby often drowns out the dialogue, and the dialogue is really bad, very declarative, in a way that seems more compulsive and purposeful than natural and organic. The scenes are thoughtful and hackneyed, and though the characters run over a period of years, neither the children nor the adults age large, secular audiences, but all too often the makers of such films focus on "The Message" or, in this case, theirs own autobiographical ties to the project, so that good movie production values ​​are eliminated. (I am sure it is no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and actor.) Fortunately, Michael Madsen was much more interesting and believable in his subsequent films. Careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one.
