Edward Montagne's Tattooed Stranger is set to be played like a thriller with a little movie Noir. Instead, it is a poorly played, witless look at the budget and the unimaginative filmmaker. The plot is absurd and the plot unbearably stiff and amateurish. John Miles, who has had a rather thin CV in the industry, smiles and laughs, and everyone else behaves like characters in a government-made film strip about the driver's safety. The film features shows like "Leave it to Beaver" and "Father Knows Best" in his unnaturally wholesome view of New York in 1950. Why? in a flopouse halfway through the movie. The only thing that can be offered for the film (other than its brevity) are the excellent film locations co-ordinated by William Steiner. The low budget of the film benefits the cameraman, as the viewer is spoiled with well-framed shots of New York City's interiors and expansive outdoor spaces. If you do not want to enjoy the movie for the selection of settings and camera angles, I recommend you to watch virtually every other movie.
