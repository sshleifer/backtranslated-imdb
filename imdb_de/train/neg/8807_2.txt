I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a zombie movie like "28 Days" or something ... but not at all. It's not even a horror movie. Nothing happens except for a group of women who appear to have been infected by a strange virus that makes them eat human flesh to survive. <br /> <br /> This plot leads to a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism ... <br /> <br /> Very VERY BAD FILM. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> - -------------- ---
