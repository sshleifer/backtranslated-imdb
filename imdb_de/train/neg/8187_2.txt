I went into this movie and expect it to be really awful. And it was. I really felt sorry for the star-studded cast. Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress ... Before turning this movie, Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual, but Miranda Richardson could not bring in and love any of the fabulous performances I know. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (including Vicar of Dibley), had about one line. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and everywhere and the humor was lacking. (However, there was a part of the movie where Santa enters the house of a Jewish family ... which made me laugh just because their expressions were classic.) Do not watch this movie unless you only have one Alternative collision with a train (actually - maybe the train would be better ...)
