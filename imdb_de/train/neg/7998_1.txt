He was not only annoying to hear, he was also joking. I swear, an Asian guy who says your mom jokes are funnier than Leary's crap. (Well, maybe funny for a few minutes, but at least I can at least laugh once!) Leary claimed he stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes" ... apparently he was still on something; He was just a nutcase, mostly drugged. One of his jokes was something like 'I would not use crack, especially with the same name as between my butt' - oh man, how did he get that ?! I swear, the only guy who has to silence the tail is Denis Leary. Thank God I did not have to see him live. This guy is totally crappy. <br /> <br /> If you're having a good time, cursing, and making "jokes" that make you think of yourself, then you're wasting your time on this garbage.
