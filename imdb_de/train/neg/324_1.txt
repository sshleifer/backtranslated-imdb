Worst mistake of my life. <br /> <br /> I recorded this movie on Target for $ 5 because I thought, "Hey, it's Sandler, I can get some cheap laughs." I was wrong, completely wrong. In the middle of the movie, all three of my friends slept and I was still suffering. Worst action, bad script, worst movie I've ever seen. I wanted to hit my head against a wall for an hour, then I would stop and you know why? Because it felt damn good. After banging my head in, I put that damned movie in the microwave and watched it burn ... and that felt better than anything else I've ever done. American Psycho, Army of Darkness and Kill Bill needed it to get over this crap. I hate you, SANDLER, because you are really through with that and spend a whole day of my life !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
