1st seen 24.12.2009 ?? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas fluff not really specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this fact-based incident of a man who was wrongfully jailed and looking for a job for his family to help them celebrate Christmas. The three children of the family then run away from home on a trek to Washington DC to win the then President of the United States, Herbert Hoover. This hike offers some side stories such as positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer, which makes the story like a Disney movie "Animals on the Run" and does not quite fit here. In the end, there are no details about how the president helped the family, and this, in my opinion, is another drawback of the movie. The film eventually brings tears, but it takes too long to achieve this. The movie should not have been an original TV movie (according to IMDb), but it has the obvious fades that make it look like this? I'm not sure if her information is correct. All in all, this is a simple movie (which could have been more complex) with a happy, Christmassy story, but played mildly and without much content.
