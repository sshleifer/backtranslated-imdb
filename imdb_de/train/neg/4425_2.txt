A film about the Harlem Renaissance and especially an author. It contrasts with a modern story about a young, gay, black artist. <br /> <br /> If that sounds vague, it's up to the movie itself. It's well-directed, pretty well written and (for the most part) well-played. Even the scenes of the past are recorded in atmospheric black and white. This is also one of the few films dealing with gay men who DO NOT shy away from sex scenes (not so explicit and not frontal). Nevertheless I hated that for the most part. <br /> <br /> The film winds its way everywhere, is full of unusual characters (including the main character) and (this is the murderer), moves at a snail's pace. I thought about leaving the theater three times because I was so bored. But the director was there, so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His talk shows that this was a love job and took 6 years to get done. I really wish I could like this more (there are very few films that honestly deal with gay blacks), but I can not. If you are not very interested in the Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason to see it.
