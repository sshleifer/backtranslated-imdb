I'm not really sure how I'll even begin to describe how bad this movie is. I like bad movies because they are often the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music and inappropriate directing. With the exception of the music (which was better than I expected), this movie had all these features. <br /> <br /> The special effects were amazingly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes to watch out for are the Thunder Child, the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the train wreck ... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the positive side, however, some Alien Walker scenes are well done. <br /> <br /> The acting was as bad as it could have been because it was based directly on H. G. Wells's book. It's almost as if the actors tried to be so exaggerated that they are so funny. And then there's the mustache ... the only distracting facial hair I've seen in a long time. Of course, only half of the movie contains acting. The rest is that characters walk around aimlessly and poorly rendered effect shots. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is an incompetent director would be wrong for inappropriate directors. By using different color filters between shots for no particular reason, using poorly rendered backgrounds even in scenes, the bad green screening, it's amazing to me how this man ever got permission to make a movie. I could not imagine that it would be possible to make such a bad movie out of a brilliant book. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone wanting to watch this movie is to do what I did: having friends who like bad movies, drinking, playing poker, watching, drinking, and doing maybe you too will go all the way through. It makes an excellent bad movie, so have fun and laugh at this disaster stupid.
