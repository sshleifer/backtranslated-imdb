I admit that my review came from a 2006 perspective, almost 30 years after the film was made, and at the time of its conception, it may have been a brilliant horror / thriller movie. <br /> <br /> From the night of Halloween in 1968, 6-year-old Michael commits the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael gets involved in a psychiatric institution and 15 years later he flees and returns to his hometown to assassinate again. From this point on, it is clear that the film will follow a fundamental and rudimentary path that is highly predictable. The beginning of each scene is easy to predict, depending on how it will end, while the music for each scene in which Michael (the killer) is located is the same throughout the movie. The viewer is made aware of the likely events that will follow. <br /> <The horror / thriller enthusiast has a severe blood / blood deficiency compared to modern movies, although I'm not similar to the crowd shown today. A happier medium could have been found. <br /> <br /> Half an hour into the movie, not a single scene is unexpected. The acting for a horror / thriller movie is pretty typical of the era and therefore has no hit for the modern enthusiast. <br /> <br /> Positive for the film are the long camera shots and the dark lighting, which has a frightening atmosphere. A second positive aspect would be the character of Michael's doctor, who gives clues as to the likelihood of where the story might lead. <br /> <br /> It's clear, however, that the star in Jamie-Lee Curtis is not a truly scared central victim in the childhood stages of her acting career. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to rate this movie as it was in its day, but from other horror / thriller movies of the act. It's in the 80s and, to a lesser extent, in the 90s Away from a really great horror / thriller movie. <br /> <br /> I suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s. Bottom up!
