Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (due to class films such as "Sling Blade," "A Simple Plan," and "The Man Who Was Not There,"), it was inevitable that it was there The weird turkey would be in there. What I did not know was that there could be THIS evil. I'll give you an idea of ​​how incredibly poor this movie is - the funniest dialogue in this movie is as follows: "Knock Knock", "Who's There?", "The Big Smelly Man", "The Big Smelly Man Who?" "The big stinking man - you are!" Yeah guys, it's really that bad. Billy Bob is only about two minutes in there (I think he needed the work in his career then), and the rest of the film is painful. For some reason, though it is undeniably terrible, I do not hate it. This is probably because I save my anger for every budget, for special effects like "The Fast and the Furious" and not for a "no-budget" -pip like this one. 2/10 on a push.
