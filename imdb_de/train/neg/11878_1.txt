Really, when it comes down to it, this movie is just not funny. Josh Kornbluth is the opposite of funny and yet he thinks he is weird. The conspiracy of sending the 17 letters was initially okay, until Josch's "Look at me, I'm crazy" approach began to infect every single scene. The Judas Priest joke was perhaps the least fun thing I've ever met, and that says a lot because he's been hard-fought by all the other jokes in the movie. And as for the unbelievable overuse of the "debaser" of the pixies, all I have to do is say: what did the Pixies ever do to deserve such a fate? What did somebody do with Josh Kornbluth to make him write, produce, produce in such a terrible movie?
