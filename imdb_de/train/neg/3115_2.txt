I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time I felt myself respected. Night Listener is without doubt one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Nothing happened in this movie - I was not interested in the characters, did not hire myself. For the whole mysterious story, it did not matter how it ended .... nothing. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no action, no thrill, no suspense, nothing. Highlights include (no spoilers - there is nothing to ruin): a man climbing through a window, a dog barking in front of a hotel room, a car driving over a rough floor and a truck giving a signal I have "One Hour Photo "really enjoyed and hoped for a similar scary role of Williams, but unfortunately I was very disappointed. What's even more disappointing is that I'm sure there's a good movie somewhere - the idea was interesting and I felt sympathy for the characters, but it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> I might have even given 1/10, but this score is reserved for the remake of The Producers
