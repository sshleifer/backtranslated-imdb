One of the films that "grows up", which have nostalgia for adults and should promise for the children. This movie has no. It's a bad excuse to let Sylvia Kristel's body romp with a dorky Eric Brown. To make matters worse, the movie is either stupid or stupid when trying to be funny, sexy or dramatic. Laugh awkwardly as we believe that a teenager would be buried alone with a dead woman in his front yard. Think hard about why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a double body. As the movie went on and on, I began to imagine a mix of private lessons and Little Miss Millions, in which Sylvia Kristel had seduced Jennifer Love Hewitt, as Howard Hesseman makes us nostalgic for WKRP. Take a look at it to laugh at other people's stupidity, the dedicated work of Ed Begley Jr., or the question of what Sylvia Kristel would look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, stay away from movies with Sylvia Kristel, who are not Emmanuelle.
