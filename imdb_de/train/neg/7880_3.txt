Animal Farm (1954) was a very good read on the dangers of totalitarianism. How can good ideals be changed and distorted by those who do not know or rule with an iron fist and an empty head? Unfortunately, this film does not represent any of these representations. What is shown to us is a propaganda piece with a lot of finger waving and pointing. The animation and direction were good given the budget and the time frame, but the very essence of George Orwell's novel is painfully novel or simply interested in seeing an adaptation of this ingenious novel, then be sure to check it out on. I thought that was a bit mediocre. Only the opinion of a man. <br /> <br /> The remake is one level lower, but not much.
