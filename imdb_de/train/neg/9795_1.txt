Come on, what's the deal with this show, Power Rangers anyway? I always felt that the show, which was originally brought from Japan to a better shape, turned what was great in Japan into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history! There is absolutely no point in this show. <br /> <br /> The bad haircuts, bad costumes, earrings etc. show everything that was ridiculous in the 1990's. From the idiots Bulk and Skull to the "duhs", the main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: GIVE ME A PAUSE! Saban brought this from Japan and then Disney bought the rights to this show about five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now the audience has to endure reruns of this show on the Disney Channel and the like. <br /> <br /> All I can say again give me a break!
