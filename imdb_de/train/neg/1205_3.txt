What's this? A Canadian produced a zombie movie that I've never heard of. A mortician is working on the corpse of a recently deceased young man. This allows for an extended flashback showing how the guy got there. Basically, he and his friends went to a cemetery on Friday, the 13th, and woke the dead thanks to his stupid singing. Back to the morgue where our body is brought back to life and kills the mortician and owner (who opens his eyes). The final WTF? Shot shot the funeral director in a straight jacket and shouted: "I'm not crazy!" Amazingly, he has his eyeballs back. <br /> <br /> Running barely 58 minutes, this is certainly a curiosity in zombie cinema. It feels like a lot longer but I was in a kind of trance where I could not stop watching. The movie also has one of these "if you see this picture, turn away from the screen" gags. It is the image of an old man getting sick in the theater (prophetic?), And when he appears (only twice), the blood starts to flow. The scenes are pretty damn beautiful for the time. There is a great thing about a zombie chopping off a girl's right hand with a shovel, but if he pulls the fake hand into the frame to torment it, it's a left hand.
