It really is not necessary to start this little review with a plot overview. I mean, it's Shakespeare's Hamlet, for God's sake? probably one of the most famous pieces ever written. I'm not embarrassed to admit that I've come to this version of Hamlet like most people on IMDb have? through Mystery Science Theater 3000. Although the show may not be the best place to judge a movie, in that case I can not imagine watching it without the comedic jokes. The German television version of Hamlet is bleak. 152 minutes No way! It's too dark and depressing to be something that I want to spend nearly three hours doing. I've said it before, but entertainment is for me. And this hand cutter is anything but entertaining. However, I will mention it a few points because I felt that I was reasonably good at acting. A 3/10 sounds right to me. <br /> <br /> As much as I like MST3K, their comments do not help make Hamlet more palatable. There are some good riffs here and there, but overall Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is far too talkative to allow the comedy a rhythm or flow. As much as it hurts me, I have to give Hamlet a 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
