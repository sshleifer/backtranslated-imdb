(Spoiler) <br /> <br /> I should have thought. The DVD did not even show the time or how long it was. I thought Wild Cardz was the worst anime movie I've ever seen. This one is much worse. Makes no sense. Thrown together plot. So we can see oversized breasts on a figure that does not support them. <br /> <br /> It had to be a student movie. That must have gotten a C grade. <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I found out it would not end.) End made no sense. <br /> <br /> Replayable: 0/10
