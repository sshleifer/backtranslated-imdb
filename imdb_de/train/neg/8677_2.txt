I liked Chiba in Street Fighter and thought, hey, no matter how stupid this movie is going to be, I'll at least see him kicking in the ass, right? Not correct. This is a boring, bleak jumble of meaningless talking, half-hearted script writing and pointless schemes. There are only a few action scenes, even fewer martial arts scenes, and the few that have been so poorly recorded and edited that you can not even tell what's going on in the world. The dub is also cruel, and perhaps the idiocy that this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it allegedly shows the Italian mafia ... Avoid like the plague - you would see better martial arts if you were for five View through the window of your local karate preschool for a few minutes.
