Horrible, Horrible, Horrible Do not waste your money to rent this movie. It's like a low budget for Canadian TV movies. Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen and there were many others out there. This movie is not worth the time needed to put it in the DVD player or VCR. : ~ (Can ten lines be written? Acting was awful, she had absolutely no flow, I saw the killer made for the TV movie on the BTK killer and was a lot better (compared to this one) it was not you were sure what they were aiming for in producing this film, but when it came to enlightening us or telling a story about the BTK killer that they had missed by a mile, this seemed more like an infomercial for animal rights to be.
