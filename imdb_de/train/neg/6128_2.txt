This movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some funny moments and jokes, but you can not base that on a whole movie! <br /> <br /> The characters are too stereotypical, there is no real story - but short episodes with freaky minor characters who are not freak enough to make the story real. Since most actors are recognized in Hungary, it is a mystery why they have taken the roles. <br /> <br /> This is * no * hope for the Hungarian movie. It was boring, though it was supposed to be real or unique. You could have tried harder than this ... 2 out of 10
