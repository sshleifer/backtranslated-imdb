!!!! POSSIBLE MILDER SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> When I saw the first half of GUILTY AS SIN, I could not believe that it was made in 1993 because it played from the middle like a JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone 80s It starts with a murder and it is left to the public to think about "Is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his lawyer?", but throughout the film the film shows its early 90s by turning into a "lawyer" Transforms Manipulated and Stolen "Art" film that ends in a ridiculous way, and GUILTY AS SIN has an even more ridiculous ending in this regard. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad thriller, but the most unforgivable thing It was that Sidney Lumet was the same man who brought us the classic classic courtroom drama 12 ANGRY MEN
