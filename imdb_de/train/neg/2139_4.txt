I really wanted to have that, but in the end it's a bad movie with too little laugh. <br /> <br /> The policy is just right, it will push the Republicans to hell, but that's what it's meant to be. That alone gives me reason to giggle. <br /> <br /> The problem is, it looks like it was done in REAL hurry (like a week ago). And it contains a stupid subplot about a bimbo singer, who seems to go completely out of line. Turiqistan is obviously Iraq or Afghanistan or any other number of countries the US has been dealing with since the 50s. The humor is a little dark (amputees dancing with prosthetic legs of the Tamerlane Corporation), but is fine, especially if The Corporations Commit to Reconstruction ("Democracy Lite") A lot of satire criticizing the US seems to be awfully cumbersome and tedious. I think it's against so much propaganda, so it has to knock people over the head to make a point. Who knows. I prefer a push, a wink - a bit of subtlety. But that's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could take a look at it again, maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> I hope "W" is more on the test.
