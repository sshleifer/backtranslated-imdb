It was 01:00 in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Do not judge me ... please. <br /> <br /> We are back in time in the Spanish settlements. A group came to an island. It does not take long for them to find a big "reptile" devouring their horse. Soon they will be captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they will have to kill the "reptilian gods". The CG sucks; It reminds me of the CG of earlier console games. The encounters were lame. The only positive thing I have to say was the hot Native, who was running around in a tight outfit. Otherwise, it's just a mediocre effort.
