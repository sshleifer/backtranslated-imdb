My mother keeps a cassette of this film as a general threat to any movie-loving person who annoys her. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> As such, it's a true classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave him 10/10? Did you accidentally watch a good movie and accidentally vote for it? <br /> <br /> Everyone involved in the film-making process should at least see a small part of this film. It should be an indelible stain on the minds of all who consider the film sacred and revered as a curse of cinematic disaster.
