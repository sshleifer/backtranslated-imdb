No conspiracy, stupid acting and senseless blood .... <br /> <br /> That's supposed to be a horror movie? There is no fear or tension, just BOOM BANG GORE and then you're done. Some Marines are in the desert for strange, crappy reasons, and they're being chased by the mutated beasts of the first movie, which was good and should have stayed. This is another excuse for money and the use of senseless violence, just like the Saw appeals. You know how pointless the conspiracy is, and the more you can add, the more people see you. I miss good exciting horror movies. Come on, Hollywood, you can do much, much better.
