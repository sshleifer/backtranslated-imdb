This totally boring, pointless, pointless, mindless and stupid movie is not the ultimate proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and his post-trainspotting films: "The Beach" has already taken care of that. This low-budget curiosity is merely to secure a place among those who have started off very well, but completely into drugs, alcohol, ego, self-deception, bad management or whatever the rapid death of this once-promising director Had led . <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and some Bimbo Jenna G - probably a rapper) - meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with zeal that resembles more insane asylum seekers than potential hit-making duo - they will be. A friend of hers - an even greater loser without illiterate - becomes her manager by shattering a shop window and stealing a video camera, filming it in "Action", and then showing the tape to some music people who are interested in garbage , Well, I know that the United Kingdom has produced incredible garbage in recent years, but that's ridiculous. The music makes Oasis appear like the Beatles. During studio recordings, the duo - strumpet - changes the lyrics in each setting, and Ecclestone arrogantly encourages musicians in the music business to take or leave them, and they take it quite absurdly. The music is not only total garbage, but also "performers" are anti-social. These NEWCOMERS should have the say. It's just too stupid. It's just awful. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is not disturbing and goes nowhere, and this story of rags to bitches makes no sense and makes no sense. It often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a total idiot. This little piece of trash is so bad that it's embarrassing to watch. Ecclestone's I.Q. must also be questioned if one has agreed to be part of this nonsense. Anyone who has financed this 1000-euro joke, should leave the film business, before he sells his own underwear on street corners.
