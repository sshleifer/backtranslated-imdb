Everyone involved (and the audience) should search "The Candidate" to see how good this movie could have been. What happened to South American history? What did Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw think to interpret their roles as cardboard showers? So far I've liked every Gene Hackman performance and / or movie. He was either disinterested (which I can hardly believe) or terribly failed. I also liked and defended Richard Gere (and scolded it). But here he had no "power". He was never intimidating and only occasionally convincing. All in all, I was very disappointed. I really expected a lot more from this director and the cast. If you do not find "The Candidate", you will see "Wag the dog" or "Bulworth" again.
