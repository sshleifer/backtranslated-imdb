David Mamet is a very interesting and very uneven director. His first movie "House of Games" was the one I liked the most. He began a series of films with characters whose life perspective changes in complicated situations, as well as the perspective of the viewer. <br /> <br /> So, 'Homicide' is the title that tries to put the mind of the beholder on the usual crime drama. The main characters are two policemen, one Jewish and one Irish, who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shopkeeper who has proven to be an old veteran of the Israeli War of Independence triggers Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. These were the shortcomings of the film are the obvious ones. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operational, and the way the detective finally transitions to final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the movie itself is Mamet-wise smart, but disappointed from a human emotional perspective. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the shortcomings of the story are too obvious to be easily compensated.
