This movie should have been fun. A young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In space. However, it dragged on, had disagreeable characters and had no target audience. <br /> <br /> Some children go to a space camp and are accidentally put into space by a robot friend (called Jinx). The space scenes are then long and repeat themselves (the same accident happens twice) and either cheesy or scary depending on the viewpoint. Adults will get bored and confused, children might be scared, because the way these shots were taken really leaves uncanny feelings. <br /> <br /> There is a burgeoning romance, but unlike the shuttle - this never goes away. Why it's contained in the first place is unclear, except perhaps to add extra tension between characters - but it failed if that was the idea. A young Lea Thompson should be quirky and attractive, right? I mean, "Back to the Future" is great. But no, she was irritating and average-looking. Not someone you meet, as a friend or even as a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He's really lucky he ever showed this performance in movies again. Maybe he can behave like Mikey in the Life Cereal commercials, but he does not seem to know how he is a normal boy. He does not fit on the screen and I do not think we can identify with him at home. I would have been happier if he had never returned to Earth. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
