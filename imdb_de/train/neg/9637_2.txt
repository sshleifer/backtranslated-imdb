Boy, that was a lousy movie! Although I have not seen all the Burton / Taylor collaborations, I can say with certainty that this is the worst. This wealthy but sick woman (of course Taylor) owns this beautiful Mediterranean island, which rules over a staff staff when she is suddenly visited by this traveling poet, who whispers platitudes. In fact, the whole movie is just a party where many conversations make no sense. Even in 1968, no one could make heads or tails out of this presumptuous nonsense, and the passage of time makes that even clearer. Without the beautiful camera and backdrop, this would be worth a negative rating. The only thing this film is good for is the unintended laugh at the expense of the stars.
