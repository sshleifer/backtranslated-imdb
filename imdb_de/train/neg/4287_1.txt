I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave this one. <br/> <br /> The story is very boring and has little to do with the original Timecop. Many things from Timecop have been scrapped and new stupid stuff added instead. This story takes place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason the time travel is more dangerous now: confused: <br /> <br /> And the action scenes are nothing to look forward to .. . only the first one is great ... and there are not many action scenes, and they are all pretty short. <br /> <br /> At one point in the story, the main thing The character travels about five times within a few minutes the time ... do not wait, do it twice ... <br /> <br /> In short, do not waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it
