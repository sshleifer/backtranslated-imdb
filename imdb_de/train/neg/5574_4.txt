"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how a great idea can be destroyed by pathetic themes like pseudo-patriotism. Here travelers from the future try to ruin Japan and replace local hero Godzilla with their puppy monster, the three-headed golden dragon King Ghidorah. However, they fail and in the end Godzilla fights against Ghidorah. The battles between the two giants are very cool, but the plot of the movie is full of holes and the whole thing about "Japan is great" is really stupid. The creators of this film did not even threaten the enemies of Japan, turning them into stupid, tall, blond guys who are easily outsmarted by the clever Japanese. The good news is that Godzilla and King Ghidorah have almost destroyed both Japan, and they are ridiculous opponents in a (actually two) spectacular battles. But until this battle, the movie was really boring and pathetic.
