I liked it, I really did. I do not think I'm an idiot, but I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie. I expected it to be crap, it was crap, but sometimes it's okay to relax and watch a lousy movie you do not have to focus on, right? I did not expect any hidden meanings or morals, and there were none, but it does not matter because I just saw it for entertainment and talked all the way through. Movies like this are the reason Ben Stillers (sorry there's something about Mary) and Vince Vaughn (no matter how you spell his last name, I did not bother to check) have jobs. It's okay to watch a crap movie as long as you do not expect too much from him, and I should take a stand, jog, maybe run, but not drive because I do not have a car, to blockbuster video. or even the choice, and borrow some of these toilet-erotic movies and stay in one night to watch them. Hello to you readers. Ps, if you do not say that comment helped, then I do not like you. If you say that it helped, then bless, God, you bless to heaven.
