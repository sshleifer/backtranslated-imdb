This film has some serious mistakes, as someone can walk through an open back door of a high-security medical facility is unbelievable. Then the same person just walks around the facility and enters the doctor's office. She writes badly or writes badly. <br /> <br /> Very very predictable movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this movie was made unless it was filmed in Canada and was likely to receive state aid. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the person Aaron plays, Cory Monteith, did a good job. <br/> <br /> If you do not get bored and see nothing else on TV, I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise it's a movie that no actor wants in his resume.
