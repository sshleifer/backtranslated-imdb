This is not a good movie. It's disjointed, all acting is bad and has a lame story that you've seen a thousand times, somewhere much better. Not to mention, you can see every plot point from a distance of one mile. Worst of all, nobody wanted to tell Lonette McKee that she can not sing. But who cares, she looks sooooo damn good. But I digress, nothing new here. In the end, a hot girl group is exploited, someone becomes addicted to drugs, someone becomes dependent on a guy, somebody gets damned out and then the horrible stuff happens. Surprise surprise. Welcome to the music business. I can not believe that so many people think that this is a good movie. Many of you seem to use a sliding scale when it comes to rating black movies. I do not play this! If you want to support these films by seeing them - great! If you liked it - great! To each his own But do not try to tell me that it was good. Pleeeease! I wish colored people would not enjoy these kinds of movies just because they have black actors. Want to see a good African American movie? See Love Jones. Beam. Or the color purple. That would be great movies, no matter what color the actors have. Why? Because they told gripping stories with great acting, you feel like you feel something long after you leave the theater. Just because it's our experience does not automatically make it a good movie. It's only good - if it's good. Period.
