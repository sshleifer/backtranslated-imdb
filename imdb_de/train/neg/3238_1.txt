Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn movies can be divided into two categories, with an appearance of conspiracy (the happy Pizza Boy) and the one without (Anal Amateurs 36). Devil's experiment falls firmly into the latter category. <br /> <br /> It's of course the horror version of hardcore porn. An almost complete 43-minute wait for the money shot. The video was shot in 1985 and consists of three relatively undescribed Japanese boys torturing a rather unattractive Japanese girl. The tortures range from banal (fives hit 50 times, hundred kicks), silly (tying them to an office chair and whirling around), the fear factor (a bath of maggots and sheep's clothing), and finally the money. (A well executed eyeball piercing). <br /> <br /> That's it, no conspiracy, no motive, just Blair Witch Tree Shots and Torture. The girl looks bored and with the exception of the screaming "No one expects the Spanish Inquisition" during the office chair scene I was bored. He stared dumbfounded at the screen and waited for the money shot. Just like hardcore porn.
