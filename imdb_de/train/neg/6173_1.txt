This film is an obvious attempt on the left in Hollywood to portray Reagan's administration as incompetent and harassing. There may have been some mistakes made during the crisis, but I'm sure this lame movie does not look that way. My first reaction was that this movie had to be led by Oliver Stone, but this time I was wrong. There are obviously many others.
