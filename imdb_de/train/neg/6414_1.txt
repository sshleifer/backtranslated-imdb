This is by far the worst piece of cr4p I've ever seen in my life. It hardly made sense. It was not scary at all (unless they're scary like loud noises and screams?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar has to stop short horror movies. I think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when I called "SHITE" when the credits came up. <br /> <br /> On my list of the worst movies ever made, it would look like this: <br /> <br /> 1. The Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill. <br /> < br /> The reason why I made Silent Hill 3rd is that it showed some scary scenes, but the rest was absolutely cr4p. The same as with cabin fever made no sense, but the return led over this list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever together
