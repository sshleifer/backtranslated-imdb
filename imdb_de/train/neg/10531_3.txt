This is a kind of genre thing, which means that you either like the musicals of the 1950s or not. If you do that, you will love it. Personally, I prefer the 1930s and most of the 40s musicals with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple and so on, but the songs of the '50s are the slower ones Dance numbers and the soapy melodramas of the decade put me all off. <br /> <br /> This film is a case study. The first song was okay, but the next three did not do anything for me. Until then, the story had not much appeal. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another minus. I do not think I've seen a movie starring her, including the film in which the English teacher with two shoes she portrays spends half of the movie to leave Siam. (I had her!). <br /> <br /> But if I separate myself from likes and dislikes, there's no denying that this Rogers and Hammerstein production appeals to a lot of people, especially those who liked "The Sound Of Music" a decade later. There are similarities in the R & H musicals. So if you like the Julie Andrews movie you should also like this movie. <br /> <br /> This is an elaborate production with yes "L". This kind of musicals you rarely saw after this generation. They also get the synchronized singers, unlike today, where the actress can not really sing. Marnie Nixon rescues Kerr as she did with Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady". "<br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is" King Mongkut "and is the stereotypical traditionalist, the kind that filmmakers always portray negatively, he's not" progressive "as the left likes, but the educator (Kerr, as "Anna Leonowens") will make it clear that today's worldly progressives are always putting teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer, but Yul is good at this role and even uses some comedy along with his more than snappy character Right, he's the big star of this movie, Brynner had magnetism, even in "The Magnificent Seven," Yul was the only cowboy who intrigued the audience. <br /> <br /> In summary, it's a good movie for his day, and Millions of people enjoyed it and I will leave it at that.
