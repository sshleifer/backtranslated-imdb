Final score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> *** Possible scene spoilers (but who the hell cares) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right: zero. And I rarely give 1's. Even for the lameest films, I'm looking for things like music, cinematography, fantasy, humor, and even a good tempo to make the score as objective as possible. Looking at it within its own genera or subgenera. But there is absolutely nothing redeeming here. I can not remember another time when a movie actually made me pacing up and down the room when it was over. The only reason I made it to the end was that I could not seem to change the channel - I just sat in horror watching the offensive stupid piece he would come next. It was like watching a snake digest a rat. <br /> <br /> But let's have some fun and pull this baby apart, shall we. First and foremost, there is nothing technical about "Whipped" that works. The visuals are all in sitcom style. The cut scenes show only pictures of the traffic that passes by at night. The music and the score do not only contribute to the film - they are disgusting. Not to mention that it has nothing to do anyway. Acting is as round as it is, all around, and so is Amanda Peet (clearly the "star" who lit up this loop). These people, supposedly good friends, have no chemistry and no sense if director Peter M. Cohen had collected them for a few minutes at a bus station before filming. <br /> <br /> On the creative side there is no '' An original bone in his body. It has no imagination. It does not show us anything we have not seen a thousand times. The overall premise or "twist" of this film is based on man-bashing and the "idea" that an empowered woman can "play men as they are played". Anyone who thinks that this is a twist or somehow original has apparently never turned on a TV. Twisted, flat women are common. Male-bashing is the norm. It steals nothing specific, it is worse: it steals cliches. I can not imagine a woman doing a movie showing other women who are so based on stereotypes and that sense of contempt. Lets me like to rent "In the Men's Society" - or better yet, "There is something about Mary". This movie wants to be a "edgier" version of "Mad About Mary", so bad that you can see the sweat. <br /> <br /> The film has no insights into women, men, dating, sex or anything. Cohen is simply content with dissolving myths that he has indoctrinated with other sexist films. Nor, on the other hand, does the film function as satire, for although mature with exaggeration, it may be considered "satirical," but it does not have the foundation that satire needs in reality. It does not even know what satirizes it. Then there is the dialogue, which is something more than the characters who shout at each other's obscenities. Example: Sign 1: "F ** k you" Sign 2: "Oh yeah, well f ** k you" (repetition) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line thing that could excuse everyone else's discretion : There are many films without action, without good acting, with morally repulsive characters and obscene dialogues that were funny and therefore good. "Whipped" is not funny. Not for a second. It has no comic skills or timing. The situations are all wrong and not based on any truths, especially to laugh at us. The signs are all drawn broadly, so that they refer to the lowest common denominator. Just look at the "Marquee Scene", the "cult classic" gilding scene. One of our limping antiheroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mena (Peet) vibrator. For some reason, light shines on it as if he had found the holy grail. Why Cohen thinks men react that way to vibrators, I do not know. While rubbing it against himself, he drops it into the loo and then tries to fetch it out with his bare hands as Mena approaches. Oh, my pages. <br /> <br /> But, strangely, people actually like this movie. Of course, people also like "friends" and reality dating shows, so I should not be surprised. All this, however, has a common thread. "Whipped" is great proof to me that in America there is just a huge bag of people who laugh at every joke just because it's about sex. They will like any show or movie (or think they like it) just because of dating or relationships. It is a lack of quality that does not bar these people. As people are indoctrinated to desire whiter teeth and thinner bodies for the sale of toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to blindly deduce anything from the relationship / relationship to make them cheap, empty, effortlessly watching television, Sell ​​movies and any number of products. <br /> <br /> The only problem will be that if I die because of watching this movie, I can get back 80 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
