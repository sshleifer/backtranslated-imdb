I like Chris Rock, but I feel like he's wasted in this movie. The idea of ​​renewing Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the turkey conspiracy too closely. As Eddie Murphy Doolittle and The Nutty Professor rewrote and rewrote them, making them Murphy's movies / vehicles, not just lukewarm remakes. That's why they were successful. If Chris had done the same thing, it could have been a much better movie. The few laughs that come are when he does his standup routine - so he might as well have made a concert film. It would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabited were a truck driver or a backwoodsman. Why is Hollywood doing so much rubbish? Because people see it - because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Do not make movies that were not that good!
