This movie was a big flop. The level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. Some scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and mean. It was impossible to identify or even understand the main characters. the character of the main protagonist was as slimy as they come. The atmosphere of the hospital room / greenhouse offered itself for outstanding theater performances. Little or nothing could be learned from the film about the Spanish Civil War. Luckily I was in Spain and realized that this is not realistic! In addition, the use of same-sex attraction as a scary "horror" was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the DVD is packaged and promoted to attract gay audiences. The actors seemed to feel uncomfortable in their roles, as if trying to distance themselves from this mess. I think if you want to watch children and pets being brutally killed, this movie might appeal to you.
