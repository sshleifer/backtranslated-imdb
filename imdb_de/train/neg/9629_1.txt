I saw it for free, and I wish it was better than it was, but it's really the old stuff the movie studios have been accusing us of for the past ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple that are opposites yet still attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If this action will not surprise you and excite you, the movie will not. <Br /> <br /> Many eyesight and fart jokes. Halfway through the movie, I realized that Ben Stiller is not really funny, but he tries very hard. And Jennifer Anniston is not that pretty, but her hair looks great. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman have paid a lot of money to be in that kind of average bumblebee movie. I expected more from you. <br /> <br /> What was interesting was that I saw this after seeing American Splendor, which is a really funny and original movie - and I compared them in my head. I wished the film managers were forced to move through these two films - maybe even that would make sense to them, and <br /> <br /> they would start making better movies with strangers than with this formula stuff that works best in airplanes.
