A half-hearted attempt to bring Elvis Presley into the present, but despite a sexy, small shower scene and a pseudo-Playboy magazine, Presley is surrounded by the same old Coy and winks clich√©s. A woman chooses E.P. pull up on the beach and then take his life - and it does not seem to matter to him! Dick Sargent gnaws himself in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Strive to be Elvis' two bosses (he seems to be in the moonlight, you understand). Some of the songs are pretty good, especially "Almost in Love", but if you want a looser, hotter, updated Elvis sex comedy, look elsewhere. When Elvis and his Lethal Attraction go to bed together, there is indeed a wooden panel between them! Real ** ****
