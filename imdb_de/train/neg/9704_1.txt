Okay, if you have a few hours to lose or if you really hate your life, I would say, watch this movie. If anything, it's good for a few laughs. They have not only obese, topless natives, but also special effects that are so bad that they are likely to be banned in most states. Seriously, the rating of 'PG' is also pretty humorous once you see the Native Porn Extravaganza. I would not give this movie to my retarded nephew. They could not even show this to the Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is unclear and clich√©d and stupid and stupid. Acting is terrible and the end is so painful to see that I actually started to pour salt into my eye.
