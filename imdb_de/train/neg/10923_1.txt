A television movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the United States during the shooting of DeMille's first version of the Ten Commandments in the 1920s, which is revived when DeMille's sets are found in the desert. <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The question is, were the filmmakers serious or were they joking when making this movie? If this is serious, it is a ridiculously bad movie and a great movie that you can pick out for its malignancy. If it is a comedy, it is less good, but funny for all the wrong reasons. In this movie you will laugh long and hard, probably more than many other Hollywood comedies.
