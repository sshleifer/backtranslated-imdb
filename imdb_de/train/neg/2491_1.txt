Maiden voyage is just that. I'd like to say that I've seen 5 minutes of it before I just could not stand it anymore. As mentioned in another comment, this movie does not fall into the whole thing "that bad is good", but is just bad. The drama is terrible, the SFX are poor and the story is bland and stupid. Even the extras are shit, the "Bag Guy Guards" and those seem to hold their guns like water pistols. <br/> <br /> Do not bother watching this movie, the only thing special is that, no matter how low your expectations are, you will still be disappointed.
