Well, what can I say about this movie? I'm speechless. I could go on talking about how stupid this movie is forever, though the music that really made me crazy was the music. And to top it off, someone commented how much he liked it. All I have to say is that she was whipped out of one of the best martial arts films of all time, Fistsof Fury, with Bruce Lee. If he was still alive and ever met this movie, he would be horrified. The rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape. I say tape because such a movie has been impossible to be shot in the movie. I feel stupid now because I've wasted 30 minutes of my life looking at him. The only reason I ever saw it was that my roommate downloaded it out of curious curiosity. What is this world about?
