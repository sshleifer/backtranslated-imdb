I found Tremors 4: The Legend Begins boring and boring. All action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of a modern domestic cat, if not smaller. The acting was abominable and this movie was just an unnecessary movie in the tremor saga, because although it tells the story of the Graboids' making, the story is so stupid and useless. So if you want to tell a story in the past, you should make sure you use the SAME ACTOR (Michael Gross) to be someone in the past if he is someone in the present in the other tremor movies. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste time shaking, 1, 2 and 3, for a good time. However, this movie makes sure the remote control is right next to you. The STOP button makes for a quick retreat away from this nonsense.
