This inappropriate adaptation of a probably weaker novel by Martin Amis does not even manage to make comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as Requiem For A Dream or any of Irvine Walsh's, as it's hard to decide whether it's a slapstick cartoon or a hyperrealistic act hallucination. <br /> <br /> Bored by overly saturated hues by William Marsh, a group of public dropouts gather in a manor house awaiting the appearance of three American friends for a weekend of decadent drug use. And that's it. Apart from the ridiculous subplot, which will soon be the main reason, it is nonsense about an extremist cult group that expresses itself with the violent killings of the elite figures of the world, be it political or spoiled. In the first role, you know exactly where that leads. <br /> <br /> What does a talented actor like Paul Bettany do in this boring, badly written boredom? Prior to his rise to fame and Jennifer Connelly can be assured that this garbage would have been offered to him now, he would have immediately changed the agents! Avoid.
