Every time a movie is so short-sighted that it wants to present a particular ending or point of view, the real story just does not bother him, it's annoying. These are the types of movies where the ending or the point of view is thought of first and the story just tackled. That's why we often talk about the story of "leaking through tires" when it turns, and trying in vain to logically reach the predetermined end. Do not just jump through tires, it's a circus with three rings. It's so ridiculous, so badly thought-out, so insincere, that if you tend to speak aloud on the screen, you'll be quite a joke before it's through. Cesspool is that of a woman who decides between family and work , Since everything is so terribly confused, it becomes offensive to the people of both views. In the end there is no sense of the story, the topic becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with bad scripts, acting does not save anything.
