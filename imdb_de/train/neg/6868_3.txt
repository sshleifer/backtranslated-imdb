OK, as an orthodox woman living in Boro Park, I will be a bit skewed against this movie. However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin's sole purpose in this film was to be orthodox. With our wigs, modest dresses and separate seating we are already a pretty easy target. Yakin never made it over the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia that she loves him more than G-D or her parents. Then he deliberately defies his father's instruction that he should not go swimming because of his poor health. 2. Sonia strikes the breeze of her son. Why should a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It is hard to believe that she has never visited one. Let's be honest: Even Reform Jews today are organizing Bris Milah ceremonies. 3. Did Mendel slept during his chosson lesson? He should satisfy his wife's passions in bed and not kiss her on the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had been married for over a year and just realized they were not meant for each other. A small note: The arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents arranged her with. It is also not shunned by the community if the marriage fails. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business so much, she did not have to go through her lusty brother-in-law. There are orthodox doctors, lawyers, teachers, and so on. Sonia felt weepier than sympathetic. Instead of taking her life, she leaned back and waited for something to happen. Then she complained that she did not like the result. That does not belong to his environment; that's a stereotype. Honestly, I think she got what she deserves.
