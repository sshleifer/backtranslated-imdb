Films like these are for the originals, which album-oriented rock stations were for music - repetitive, boring music and all the original energy of a corporate drone committee. I am glad that Aragorn is not from this P.O.S. Go back and look at the 1971 version, count things that would NEVER be included in a modern version, and thank the deity you adore, that anyone in the distant past had the balls, an original one Writing and shooting conceptual film that is not based on someone else's ideas and was not channeled through a corporate board before it saw the light of day.
