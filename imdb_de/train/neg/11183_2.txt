"People I Know" is a clunk that nobody can root and no one cares about - despite the efforts of a talented casts. Pacino delivers his usual show of strength as Eli Wurman. an agent from the past who was eroded by a life of moral corruption. Unlike Michael Corleone, however, it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, his dilemma, or his fate. The film follows Elis's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause while being distracted by a customer (Ryan O'Neal, well in a signed part) of the latest "dirty laundry" - in this case a companion of a TV actress who dealt with the wrong people. Tea Leoni brings her usual star power to this supporting role, even if the script does not give her much work. As Elis sister-in-law Kim Basinger creates sympathy despite implausible action mechanisms. <br /> <br /> This movie is for those who like it when Pacino sees his things and enjoys the other clients. Unfortunately, "People I Know" is strictly amateurish between the script and the manual. Hence the limited theatrical version and the quick trip to the DVD. Consider yourself warned.
