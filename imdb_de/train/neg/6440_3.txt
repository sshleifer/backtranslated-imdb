This was one of the worst wrestlemanias I have ever seen. It simply did not get up at all. As for the cards, I thought it would be pretty good, but every match seemed to be too short. Chris Benoit vs. Chris Benoit MVP One of the better matches. Benoit wore it. I just did not like MVP, but Benoit saved that match. <br /> <br /> Kane Vs. Khali Wow, these two guys do not mix. Or maybe it's Khali and every other person who lives does not mix. Terrible match. <br /> <br /> Melina Vs. Ashley I'm not a fan of women. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals Vs. New Breed I was thrilled with this match until I saw it. Really, really disappointing. <br /> <br /> Edge vs. CM Punk Vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay Vs. Randy Orton The absolute worst MITB game. Just a big disappointment, for many people at the same time in the ring. It just did not live. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley Vs. Umaga O.K. not very impressive, but not the worst of the night. <br /> <br /> Batista Vs. Undertaker This may have been the best match of the night. Very, very, very nice to see something good for a change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels I really have the feeling that this match deserves the last place. People favor Batista against Undertaker, but this match was just as good. I'm getting tired of watching Cena win every game. It is getting old. Well, I have to say, I think this match is the best of the night, but I'm a big Shawn Michaels fan so I'm a bit biased. Batista vs. 'Taker may have been better, but I'm biased, so ... sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best games of the night and most of the other games were really close.
