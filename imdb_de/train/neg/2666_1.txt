If someone has a mind, there is nothing positive to say about this film. <br /> <br /> I lost my $ 1 when renting. I would rather laugh at Smith and say, "If you have a dream, you must protect it." <br /> <br /> All actors must have gotten bored or had no fame at the time. Even Matthew McConahay, * even though you spell it *, was better than any actor in the movie when he played Psycho in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you watch this movie and have something good to say, you, IQ, must be extremely low. With such bad taste in movies, it hurts. Thank you ... and the TRUTH was spoken! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from misery. <br /> <br /> Get Devil's Rejects, this is now a classic.
