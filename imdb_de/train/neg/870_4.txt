Towards the end of this thriller, Ally Sheedy's haggard image of the last few days is creatively used to build more than a hauntingly evil image. She is convinced that if a bad role of the type Bette Davis approaches her, she could take her brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can not find many other reasons for it. If you've wondered what Sheedy looks like in old-fashioned glasses (but why would anyone?), Then here's your answer. By the way, Sally Kirkland's sex-hungry crazy woman is really tiring, and even if you like these kinds of things more than me, you have to admit that the tension goes down a lot during those scenes. Savages drunken brute of an insurance agent is just as uncomfortable, but at least a small role. Of the main characters, Nicholas Walker gives no sympathy for Paul Keller's plight and his play is made of wood. Dara Tomanovich is better and during her scenes with Sheedy the level rises a bit. Sheedy's meticulous, unobtrusive performance (though she often appears to be an autopilot) is admirable in itself, but not in the context of the rest. The sets are drab, the camera work is indistinguishable.
