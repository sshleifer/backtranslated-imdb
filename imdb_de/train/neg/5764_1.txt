Scary Movie 3 is such a stinkfest that it's hard to put into words. It does make films look like Malibus Most Wanted like Oscar material, let's say that. <br /> <br /> The original Scary movie was a lot of fun, one of the better 90s parody movies that came from a great team Previously, our album rocked the world with Dont Be A Menace to South Central while you drink your juice in the hood. But what the hell happened ?! After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2, I thought that the cast and crew would help the crew, but it was even worse. Within 20 minutes I had smiled twice. No laughing, the jokes were recycled and originality obviously did not matter. The fact that at this time the majority of people on this site chose 10/10 made me feel physically ill. If there are great movies like School of Rock that are actually funny jokes, anyone who wastes their money on such trips must have their heads examined. <br /> <br /> no stars / ****
