The focus is on unironic ideas to deal with the guilt. <br /> <br /> Merrill berates the desperate boy for not having to complain about Rennie's death. Old style real men in action, here. <br /> <br /> The crashing airplane model and the car accident must have been impressive on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Storytelling itself, in spite of the Flashback sequences, is playing it right now - all storytellers will be trusted by us (regardless of the "truth" or "untruth" of the dialogue), so it's not a game for the viewer about the narrative structure there. This would become a rough template for future retellings, e.g. B. "Fearless". <br /> <br /> So all we have left is individual performance, and at this level it's best for Wynn's joke, man show.
