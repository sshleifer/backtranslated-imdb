This film is probably the cheapest, cheesiest and poorest successor ever made. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, he is Disney's funniest and most idiotic film, which will guarantee laughter from the beginning on the juicy stories and lame plots. <br /> <br /> It's a group of short stories that seem like bad fanfictions. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * The first thing is that Beast and Belle are petty because of a miserable argument. Then, three new loser characters decide to repair things by forging a letter of forgiveness to Belle. During this little episode, Belle has wall eyes that made my siblings and me laugh. Then she and the beast fight more for the letter ... and later learn what forgiveness means. How old are they??? Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Then the next topic is that Lumiere is the world's biggest jerk when it comes to romance. It's from the man who could court something feminine. And they turn FiFi into a psychotic villain who tries to kill Belle and end up with Scotch-free. What a message to send the kids! <br /> <br /> Then the next one is about Mrs. Potts, who is scared. And in the next episode, it's all about Beast becoming too obsessed with a bird, to the point where he seems downright stupid. <br /> <br /> The animation is so ugly, it kills. There are at least 100 mistakes that you can easily see ... and the color scheme is terrible. Belle is a simple juice that bubbles when something goes wrong. She is also petty and very different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> And the minor characters are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere are almost always fighting, I know they did that in the movie, but it was exaggerated.) <br /> <br /> But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. She is ruined. I can not even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I'll give it a 1/10 for the juice, but I'll give it a 10/10 for the comedy.
