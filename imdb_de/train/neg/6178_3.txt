Frank Tashlin's "The Home Front" is one of Lifeless Private Snafu Shorts, a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military. Instead of Snafu taking unforeseen measures that lead to disaster, 'The Home Front' focuses on its relatives at home and what they have to offer to the war effort. Snafu realizes that he was wrong when he thought they had it easy. It's a concept with few opportunities for good jokes and instead Tashlin plays the risqu√© card stronger, extended jokes with strippers and scantily dressed dancing girls instead of effective comic relief. The result is a well-intentioned short that today has little relevance or entertainment value except as a historical artifact.
