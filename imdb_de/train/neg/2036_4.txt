The film is about a young man, Michael, who takes care of the elderly. One day he decides to kill some of his relatives. At about the same time, he decides to model his murder on the Zodiac killer of the 1960s. He gets in touch with the author of a book about the Zodiac Killer and they form a friendship. Michael has a weapon (the only weapon, it seems, in the hands of some of the other actors, just not shown as the same weapon.) And he goes out. Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you like B movies. I liked the idea of ​​the movie, but the cut and acting really did outshine the plot. I thought the "blood" was just too fake, the lighting in some places terrible and the dialogue just too standardized. The movie was shot on video, which is fine, but the editing of the movie is only made for some weird "Plan 9" scenes. Not a bad movie for fans of the B-Movie genre, but if you want something more polished, move on to something else.
