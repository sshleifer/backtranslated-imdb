Published in 1965 but clearly shot years ago, Melodrama is an incorrigible little crime with inappropriate sexploitation. As is the case with Grindhouse films of the time, there is a whole range of undressing and dressing without any reason, supplemented by lousy music, annoying tales and laborious editing. The coffee shop scene painstakingly prepares as we chop between characters to avoid seeing them speak their lines. All we get is reaction shots to the voice of the off-screen character! The fifties pretty Misty Ayers takes off her French-cut panties a couple of times before the action starts. It is continuously accompanied by seemingly contemporary music ranging from romantic to western to mother's food, which happens to be mixed to create, among other things, the most exciting cigarette lighting ever recorded in the movie. Watch how he taps on it! Watch him hit the match! Will he breathe in or will he be captured by Apaches? Only time can tell !! The film tells the dirty story of how Sally is tricked into working in a whorehouse, falling into a dope and not being able to escape. For some reason, we are spoiled with some of the most bored and boring hookers ever to film, literally make or knit their nails instead of entertaining the audience. An astonishingly lame comedy (drunk lady inadvertently drinks milk! Har dee har!) And silent film play does not help. This is one of the worst feature films I have ever seen, even on the marquee Something Weird Video. For film enthusiasts, that's more of a curiosity - very bad cinema.
