Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her dedicated son (Ron Silver) to locate the retired former movie star Greta Garbo and introduce them to Estelle before she finally checks out. Could have been titled "Bancroft Talks" as the actress attacks this uncertain comedic / dramatic / sentimental material for its duration. The hot or cold director Sidney Lumet can not get a steady rhythm, and Bancroft's constant overacting is not taken back by the filmmaker in any way - he always keeps it up to date: sweet, with tears in his eyes and with rage. Estelle becomes a burden in this scenario (not that the sparse plot is also busy). The silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks have little to do in the end, except to support the star, and everyone is trampled on by their hamming. * 1/2 of ****
