I went to a show of this movie and although there were some moments that made me laugh, he had some big flaws. It presents itself first as a humorous achievement of a divorced person who tries to find love in LA. The result is a depressing, narcissistic and listless game through the story of the love life and professional life of the director. The jokes drop quickly, and suddenly you do not notice how the man's data develops. The ridiculousness is that at the same time the director presents himself as extremely annoying and badly flawed and then we are expected to be worried.
