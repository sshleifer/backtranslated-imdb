Do not get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the footage is breathtaking and the material is dramatic. It was a big disappointment though, and I was really angry about what Disney had done. <br /> <br /> BBC's Planet Earth was all that and much more. It was subtle. It had a general sense of balance and showed the full cycle of life and death. There was tragedy and triumph, loss and profit. It was balanced. Disney's editing of Earth is none of that. They tried to make it into a movie Americans would talk to us about. They made it DRAMATIC. They made an exaggerated music there to scare us. They made predators angry. They made WALRUSES angry. They showed every encounter as negative. It tried to be exciting and successful, but at the expense of the lesson of equilibrium. The movie was negative for one and a half hours and only about 10 minutes positive. I'm all in favor of preventing global warnings, but this was exaggerated political and environmental waste <br /> That's another thing, I saw it on the big screen, but was disappointed with the picture quality. It looked better on my TV at home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, rent or rent the BBC series Planet Earth. It's a better lesson, a better sound and (if you have Blu-Ray) a better picture quality.
