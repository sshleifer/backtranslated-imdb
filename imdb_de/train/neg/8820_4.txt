In a movie like this one, I did not expect anything out of the ordinary, except for a lot of kills ..... what I got was even less. <br /> <br /> Christmas 1947, a child bears witness to his parents doing it while dad is in a Christmas suit. Startled, he runs up the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins 33 years later and Harry Stalling is your normal everyday Joe ... besides being obsessed with Santa Claus. After his boss makes fun of him, he goes insane, disguises himself like a Santa Claus, and begins killing non-Santa Clauses who believe he believes patrons and his boss. A recalcitrant neighborhood catches up with him and just as she wants to set him on fire, he drives his van from a cliff ... into the moon. Not the best end I've ever seen, but it was original. <br /> <br /> It was a slow, boring movie that really did not have any redeeming quality, unless Harry went to churchgoers. There was hardly any gore and even the "sex" scenes were toned down. <br /> <br /> Too boring ...... 4 out of 10
