9, the movie I've been looking forward to for months ... was little more than a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised that there is a lack of story and strange character development. All fantastic action sequences in the world do not make a single unappealing character. <br /> <br /> The strange, almost occult sequences were not only out of place, they were annoying as well. The story is about robots and scientists ... Why is it suddenly becoming a Necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magical ghost lines instead of giving answers to things that could possibly have fearsome storylines? > How, what, when, why ... Questions that only ask if you are interested, and it will be less and less likely that you will do so if you move away from the theater. <br /> <br /> A movie like this is frustrating because it's not so deep ... I would see this movie drawn in crayon if the story were good. But the filmmakers have relied on CGI magic and Tim Burton's name to attract the crowd. What ... that was what attracted me but did not win my respect. <br /> <br /> 9 could have been fantastic ... with a few more revisions and a little more respect from its own creators.
