I did not think that would have been possible, but something came and replaced Open House - a low budget horror because someone killed the high house prices - the worst movie I've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet movie have life. <br /> <br /> It was touted as the best movie in Montreal's last film festival, which leads me to believe that every second post must consist of empty images accompanied by people reading grim poetry. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was like a little piece of hell. It comes from Austria and tries to stumble on the trail of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet scenes about different characters who live in a dark suburb suburban area. There's the fat dog owner and his fat maid who striptease for him, the meager divorce whose wife still lives in a house containing the untouched room of his dead child, the over-the-top trampyper who's the top ten Lists. , The list goes on. Forever. Similar to the two hours I spent in this theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, the characters interact, but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way. I can not say if they are good actors because they were subtitled with lines that were the Austrian equivalent of "You're so lame!" Surely they did not have to learn many, because everyone repeated the same lines at least three times in one scene. <br /> <br /> This is not a rubber or any of the above films. There is no art to discover, and nothing to engage with later, except perhaps whether or not you should change your "Never go out during a movie" policy (which some older couples in a random org It's not, unless you're one of the few who does not get the idea that your parents have sex - and with a few middle-aged middle-aged couples (who dislike booting). <br /> <br /> This movie was offensive to me, not the slack nudity, not the frightening soundtrack, not the shocking scenes with guns, I was offended that someone spent money on having capable writers and filmmakers I was offended that someone from the city visited Dog Days and wondered if this was the best thing Montrealers could find, and most of all, I was offended that the people who were involved in the festival, made everyone believe that the Emperor had a beautiful and intriguing new outfit, when it became painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat striptease woman. <br /> <br />
