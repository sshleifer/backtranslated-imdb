This Hamlet was made for one of the most boring MST3000 episodes of all time. I'm not a Shakespear fanatic, but I do not think he ever intended his works to be so slow and dreary. It's also one of the hardest to find movies because there are so many Hamlets. As I said, although this is pretty boring. It's in black and white, the pace is slow and the landscape is minimal. The actors are all in sync, that does not help. This is the MST 3000 that I can not watch in one sitting because the guy playing Hamlet says his lines can make anyone sleep.
