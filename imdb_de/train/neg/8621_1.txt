The previous poster obviously worked on the movie. It's a joke, how bad it is, and no one would review that kind of movie in its own way. To mention all the names of the actors and what they were before is a sure sign that he is somehow involved. <BR /> <br /> It's on Cinemax right now and I'm sure this was a movie where pornstars (Ava is great and well endowed) was forced to do something else for crazy reasons. <br /> <When I saw it for the first time, I was sure it was made around 1986, and I was born in '73. I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but no ... it was done in 1993 !! Incredible! <br /> <br /> Although I would call it a bad one, it's good movies. Like watching a train crash.
