Alan Rudolph is a mediocre director without that special touch. For example, in The Secret Lives of Dentists in the dental office, there was an attitude that could express the whole relationship between husband and wife. Rudolph wasted it. The camera is in the hallway and looks through the doors of the two dental offices, with Dana and Dave each alone in their respective rooms. They get the idea of ​​their devastation and isolation, but not much else. Lighting, colors, body language and facial expressions could have been significantly improved. If I was directing, I would have spent the whole day to get that shot right. That's the beauty and the power of the film: it can express so much, a whole life in a matter of seconds. <br /> <br /> The attitude with the toddler who steps into the puddle of the puke could have been improved. The child should have been more fascinated by the puddle, stomping and shuffling her feet, tilting her head down to look at the puddle with all her attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell did not deliver. He plays an uncommunicative man, true, but instead of conveying the inner turmoil in voice, gesture, body movement, the film relies on voice-over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter ego, played by Denis Leary.
