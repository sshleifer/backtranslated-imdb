James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to a psychiatric ward at Dr. Ing. McCort (Bruce Paynes). There he realizes that many interns are being killed by "The Ripper," who drives his souls to hell, in a book written by Dr. Ripper. McCort promoted cult. This story is so absurd and stupid that it is impossible to write a summary. The dialogues are so ridiculous, especially when Helen, James Bishop's blonde fiancé, arrives in asylum that it is almost unbelievable that a writer had the courage to include her in a screenplay. And what about the return of James to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients? And the cast, consisting of ham actors and actresses? Honestly, I do not know what or who is the worst in this movie: the script, the director or the cast. The correct answer is certainly all. I've seen this streak on cable TV and am amazed how a producer can spend money in such a trash. This horror movie is very funny given the absurd story. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Demônio '(` Devil')
