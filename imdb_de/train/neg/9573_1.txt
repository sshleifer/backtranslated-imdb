Not quite off the wall, but totally stupid. "Killer Tongue" is an unpleasant mix of science fiction, horror and supposed comedy. What this means is a pointless and totally incoherent movie. There is very little dialogue, mainly due to the fact that the script, if any, is a complete "pond scum". I would not even call it strange, rather than "total nonsense". This movie will surely disappoint and you have been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time, and if you do, the stinging smell will remain like rotten fish .......................... ..................................... MERK
