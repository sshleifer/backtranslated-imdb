Why have I never seen or heard this junk movie? It's right in my alley with bloody Teenkill, ridiculous conspiracy and an irresistible 80s cheese atmosphere. For some reason, no one really cares that the staff and students of an elite Catholic university are slaughtered by an unknown psychopath. Newly recruited teacher Julie Parker gets involved when all the people she's in touch with either turn up dead or behave strangely. This movie is hilarious! There is absolutely no logic or coherence and every character is equally meaningless to others. For example, a girl is killed and her body is thrown into a container. Then, and for no reason, the story moves suddenly for three weeks, but the murdered girl is never mentioned or even missed. Not even from her friend! Acting is pathetic and there is not even a bit of nudity to enjoy. The murderer's revelation is pretty funny because the creators were really convinced that it was an original twist ... It's not like that, guys! "Splatter University" is by far one of the worst horror stocks of all time.
