Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who obviously tries to be a director. "A Walk on the Moon" seems to be borrowed from other, better-made films. The present story takes place in the late 1960s in a summer resort for workers' Jews near Woodstock. The screen treatment of Pamela Gray does not have much to offer, so it's a mystery why Mr. Goldwyn decided to start this film as his first try. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz family spends some time at the resort. We see them arrive in the small bungalow that will be their temporary home. Marty, the father, comes only for the weekend; He works in a small family business that mainly repairs televisions. In a few days, the first man will walk in space, so the excitement is obvious. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz women are staying behind. Pearl, Marty's wife and mother-in-law Lilian spend idle days in town until the "blouse seller" arrives. Pearl surfs and she finds much more than a shmatte; She also gets the seller. It seems that Pearl and Marty have no sex life at all. After two children, Pearl, who seems to be sexy and with high libido, is ready for extra marriage fun. <br /> <br /> That's the basic requirement for the movie becoming a soap opera with the little daughter, Alison, decides to be addicted to play and go to the Woodstock festival near where she, horror of horror Witness is how her own mother plays with the blouse seller! What does a girl do? Stay tuned for the grand finale, when all parties are happily united at the little son's bed when he is stung by wasps and the vendor applies a home remedy and dad is called out of town after he knew with Pearl about his betrayal that younger stud. <br /> <br /> Poor Diane Lane later made "Unfaithful", the upscale version of this Dudel. Viggo Mortensen is the seller who appeals to his lonely female customers whispering something in their ears! Liev Schreiber as Marty, the cuckolded husband, does not have much to do. Anna Paquin plays the rebellious Alison and Tovah Feldshuh is the unlucky Nana who would have loved to stay in town to see her soap operas instead of witnessing a hand playing in her own backyard! <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk, or snap the DVD into the TV when you're having fun at home and really want to laugh, or two watching the movie.
