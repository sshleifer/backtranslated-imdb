In fact, Marc Blitzstein's off-Broadway adaptation of "Threepenny" was not as "bowdlerized" as is widely believed. <br /> <br /> (I have a special interest in "Threepenny", my dad was part of the first full production in the US, and the U of Illlinois Theater Guild did it towards the end of World War 2. HJitler had the piece suppressed so well that they had to reconstruct the script and reconstruct recordings from two different languages ​​German prompter script and similar sources.) Blitzstein's adaptation - no "translation" that had the full approval of Lotte Lenya - was much closer to the original than general accepted. <br /> <br /> The Problem Most people know that this is the MGM Cast recording (recently available on Polygram on CD) (to Beatrice Arthur as Lucy, the "big, complete woman") and I can not see her hands on her hips and shoulders being thrown back on that line - Bea was a big kid in the 50s}, Paul Dooley and John Astin) was heavily censored by Mike Curb, head of MGM Records - I mean, 17 (I think that's what it was), "Goddamn" became "damned". <br /> <br /> (All of a sudden MGM also offered a 2-LP set of the * entire * game, no doubt so heavily censored.)
