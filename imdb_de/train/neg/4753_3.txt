The director F.W. Murnau stayed wise with the silent film medium he knew so well to tell this story of the indigenous islander in the South Seas. The documentation style works very well in the first half of the film. The landscapes are beautiful and the activities of the daily life of the islanders are interesting. However, the film loses momentum as it focuses more on the story of two convicted lovers. The story never gets so interesting, even though she is treated well by Murnau. Won an Oscar for best camera, though the award should have been for the best backdrop. You can not really believe the DP that you can shoot in such a beautiful place.
