Take young, pretty people, put them in an exotic locale, put in a few bad guys, let the two main characters find romance after a few heavy breathing scenes, flirt the acts, and then work out a happy ending for all (apart from the three or four who are of course murdered) This is the classic (and successful) format of Harlequin Romance. It's not very good, but it's not as bad as most little yellow paperbacks. And the location in Budapest is particularly interesting, even if the wonderful old train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) was not used or the famous thermal baths of the city were shown.
