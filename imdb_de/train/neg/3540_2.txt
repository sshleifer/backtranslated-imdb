Guy Richie's third real movie (not counting the godly "Swept Away") is a complex action thriller that deals with gambling, gangsters, and chess. Fans of Richie's earlier efforts will probably hate guns as much as I do with his twists. Jason Statham, the seasoned Jason Statham, plays Jake, a recently released ex-con who will take revenge on the ridiculously named Dorothy Macha (an outstanding OTT Ray Liotta), but instead gets involved with a few other opponents (one of them Andre 3000 from rap outfit outkast), who are throwing him and us the audience, a series of red pegs throughout the movie that are all extremely boring. The culmination of this confusion of a movie is the part of the restaurant where the dialogue is turned. For a great shot, a slow shootout set to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, Revolver is a flawed work, not terribly awful, but far from Richie's best performance , That would still lock, Stock school homework it would be graded "must try harder!"
