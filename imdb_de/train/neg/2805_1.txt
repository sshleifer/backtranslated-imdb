This adaptation destroys a classic that is popular for its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no idea of ​​the different nuances of Rochester's character. I have the feeling that he never read the book, only strolled on the set in his too tight pants and was given a character summary with the inscription "grumpy, brutal, gloomy past". He does not play Rochester as a character or as a real person, but as an exaggerated complainer who never breaks a smile until he becomes engaged and at one point he miraculously turns into a pansy. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that excited this adaptation in me was disbelief and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte, who in any case turns in the grave. GO BACK AND BOOK THE BOOK. ROCHESTER HAS PERSONALITY. By the way, a "Passion Love Scene" does not mean you have to eat your face.
