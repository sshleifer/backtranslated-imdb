My brother is in love with this show, let's make that clear. I completely agree with the people who said they were copying Dexter's Lab and Fairly Odd Parents. <br /> <br /> I've never liked very strange parents, I mean, some things made me laugh, but mostly that's annoying and not cute at all. This is almost the same as I think about Johnny Test. Except that NOTHING makes me laugh in this show. The gags are so stupid and pointless, and to tell the truth, maybe it's just me, but kids do not dress like that! Yeah, I think Johnny's hair is great, but come on! <br /> <br /> And Dexter's Lab, that used to be one of my favorite shows and I still do not mind. That makes me disgusted and ashamed that Johnny Test is making an absolute joke out of this wonderful show! <br /> <br /> One more thing. The. Dog. Is. So annoying. He is louder and more disgusting than Johnny! And the gay accent? What the hell! I hate the dog to death and I hope he dies because that would be better for children than listening and watching the vile crap that goes on this show and finding a gay accent if you do not want that Your eyeballs are burned in wondrous flames and your brain is fried in this show, do not look at it!
