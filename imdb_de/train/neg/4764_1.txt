86 wasted minutes of my life. I fell asleep the first time I tried to see it, and I have to say that I can never fall asleep in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a pointless conspiracy enforced in such a stilted and so enforced game and can only guess that the actors were as tough as the protagonist who was supposed to be in the movie itself would have. <br /> <br /> Everything in this dramatic adaptation is over the top. And if it's not the wooden game, almost as if you could see the teleprompter, then the set itself overlaps and intervenes in a completely unnecessary way and is overly dressed to an unimaginable extent to keep you from the entire farce. <br /> <br /> As for the supposed shock of a detective under cover-up, anyone who does not see this - as well as the rest of this ridiculous plot - should have light-years in advance telegraphed to check his eyes immediately. <br /> <br /> Poor drama and two very decent actors, paired with Branagh's hypermodern overpass, is enough to use real missiles instead of blanks. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a fully ascending homoerotica root, which is intensified towards the end. I can only hope that this is such a flop that people will never again try to imitate this level of cinema.
