I was skeptical when I saw the Calvin Kline-like commercials for the first time, but I thought I would give it a shot. So I saw it and all I can say is pale. This movie was so bad. Rarely do I hate a movie so much. The sight of this film reminded me of these funny scenes in Altman's "The Player" when the authors introduced their whimsical ideas to the producers. I'd like to know which MTV producer has decided that Bronte's one and a half hours of music video adaptation (but Heathcliff's name is Heath and he's a rock star and Hindley's Hendrix) would be a good idea. <br /> <br /> Even if not so bad, they would not have done every other aspect of the movie so terribly wrong. The direction must have been "you are lonely, pout for me". I laughed out loud in all the "serious" scenes and was bored with the rest. The camera work was jagged, reminding me again and again that I saw a bad movie trying to be nervous. My theory is that the sound guy was bored and went to the beach with his boom for a few beers - all I could hear in half the scenes was the waves. And in the other scenes, I wished I could hear everything. Speaking of sound: What they did with the Sisters of Mercy song "More" is absolutely inexcusable, but also not excusable, what they did to Bronte - especially the moment Johnny Whitworth licked Katherine Heigl's face - and if you do Can tell me what this scene had to do with all the rest of the story, more power for you.
