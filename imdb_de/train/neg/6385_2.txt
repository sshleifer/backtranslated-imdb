Gayniggers from space is pretty much grouped with his name. It is only 27 minutes long and describes a spaceship gay black who come to Earth to free the men from women. Although I see a small meaning for the plot, but is also really illogical. Granted, it should be a comedy / parody of society and science fiction. I had to laugh several times, so it succeeds. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terrible. When the spaceship floats above the earth, you can see stars magnified for no apparent reason. The asteroids shown at the beginning look spotty, the ship's equipment is illogical, the text contains several misspellings, the actors are unconvincing, the characters are confused; In general, the whole thing is not serious. If you pass all the aspects that make the movie a bad movie, it is very accessible and transparent to the end. Some parts are funny. All in all, the only thing you can remember is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever. <br /> <br /> Since it's a short film and has some fun aspects, it's not the worst thing you see. But it is illogical and has little long-term value. I can not really recommend it. If you see it, you do it for the unique concept, not for the quality.
