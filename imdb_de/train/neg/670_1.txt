Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her on her prom night. And by doing so she killed her family, friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> Well, before I start, let me say that you are fed up with PG-13's horror movies that have not been scary lately. Are you tired of talking dumb girls with the dialogue 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things? And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And last but not least, you're tired of the US shooting Asian, Japanese and Chinese movies. That pretty much sums up the prom night, but I'm still not done with the review. <br /> <br /> The only reason to watch "Prom Night" is a laugh about the killings. If not, do not look into the evening. You never see the killings, you just hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. Incidentally, the deaths are repeated around the clock. They are not only scary, but also unpleasant. When I met the cast, I was probably ready to fling. Too much girl talk, too much guy and a lot 'Oh my god. It's our prom. I understand it's fun, but seriously it's too much to ask, so you do not concentrate. <br /> <br /> If I put Prom Night on the list of the worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films, I would be the first. I will not be surprised if it is released on DVD for cheap and fast. In case of emergency, do not spend your money or time on boring, cheap fear and a "night of dying" watching the movie. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars. (PS If i could get the movie zero stars i would).
