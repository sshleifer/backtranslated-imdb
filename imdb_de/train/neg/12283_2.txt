College student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is plagued by nightmares of a cellar-dwelling ghoul in Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting off his hand, spitting a worm, a ghoul tearing his chest and being roasted over an open fire. After his friends saw him float 6 feet above his bed, a helpful, occultly-obsessed teacher (Donna Denton) suggests sneaking into Alcatraz to face his fears. Of course, they go in the middle of the night, when no one is there to help, when things get out of control! <br /> <br /> The group sinks, Alex's brother Richard (Tom Reilly) gets possessed and starts to kill everyone. Toni Basil of "Mickey" is seen as a helpful ghost by Sammy Mitchell, the singer of the group "Bodybag". She teaches Alex how to float out of his body and does a rock music dance with repeated nightmare shots to make up for the runtime. All victims emerge as whispery spirits of the Griffin Dunne figure in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. The script is full of storylines, cheesy dialogues and lame attempts at comedy. Good FX work and cool start credits (both from Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that deserve any merit. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") play some songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
