I wasted my time giving this show a chance. This must be one of the worst new shows. If they award an award for shows that Suck THESE, the category should be swept. The drama is bad and the storyline is invented. Now dinosaurs were a bit strange, but at least it was entertaining. This show lasted three seasons and was eventually canceled. This new show, which is based on commercials of an insurance company, is not funny and has really nothing to offer. Maybe the original ad and the number of repeats that have been repeated are what's wrong in this show. It just got on TV and we're tired to see the "Caveman" sign.
