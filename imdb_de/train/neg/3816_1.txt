It works very bad. Bad story. Bad Signs You should never see this show when you see it on. TURN IT OFF. Or you crawl for the next 30 minutes. It should never have been broadcast. It is not that great. You should never see it. NEVER IN LIFE. So, if you ever want to see this show, please do not. Contact THE CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh. These are much better family shows. So believe me, I've seen it before. And honestly, and honestly, the worst show I've ever seen, and I've watched a lot of TV. So do me a favor and never watch this show.
