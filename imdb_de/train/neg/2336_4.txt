I read some bubbly reviews here on IMDb and thought I would give this movie a look. Disappointed. On the plus side, the male leads are good and some interesting photography, but overall, this movie does not convince. Seems to be full of its own indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful, but it falls short, and overall the picture is an unconvincing mess. <br /> <br /> It is one of those films that can be classified as noir film can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> "A film Noir is characterized by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, and threat cynical characters. ". <br /> <br /> Well, that's the story here: 3 losers clash with their collective problems, including mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness, etc., and together they conspire to kidnap a child and each other to outsmart. <br /> <br /> It would have been a much better movie if the story was limited to the kidnapping rather than the character weakness of the kidnappers. I thought that the main female character had come out of her depth and as an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> For a few good moments, I felt like I was wasting my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
