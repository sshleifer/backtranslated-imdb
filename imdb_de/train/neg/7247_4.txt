In short: This is a romantic comedy with cookie cutter that really WANTS and TRIES to be something more. It wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. It wants to be deep and human. There are interesting camera shots, lighting, music and editing, all conveying the feel of an important movie. The dialogue is at times intelligent. There are a few "loud laugh" moments. <br /> <br /> But here's what keeps it from being more than a formal late-night cable, during the flight, the time-killer: <br /> <br /> 1. David Schwimmer - How many times can Joe Sad Sack Puppy Dog, with his chin open, look empty into space before it gets annoying? Maybe some drool would have helped. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - Here she is really flat and not just in the chest. Her role is to be this lively, nice, caring girl, who always gets into the wrong situation and is very confused. For this reason, a sad Sack Killer like swimmers has no chance. But Gwenneth plays her very boring. Combine this with a puppy dog ​​drool face (above), and you only have to worry about a little chemistry. <br /> <br /> (I've always imagined someone in this role - Kate Hudson, for example.) <Br /> <br /> 3. The script and the storyline - the stuff that's just happening sounds basically not true; All these problems are finally wrapped up with such a neat and orderly bow that it sounds like a whistle and the scriptwriters simply said, "Oops, time to wrap it, get a train to catch!" So they pulled out the Hollywood formula book, checked out all the boxes and went home.
