Hello people <br /> <br /> Forget this movie. John C. should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits. Bon Jovi was and is never an actor and the FX are a joke. <br /> <br /> The first vampires were good ... and they were the only vampires. This thing carries here only the same name. <br /> <br /> Just waste of time thinking ... <br /> <br /> JAKE Scorpio
