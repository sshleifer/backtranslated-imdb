Actually it was pretty funny ... in a kind of "God, how the hell was this movie made". If you make fun of movies ... what am I doing ... look at that ... but if you really think, "Is that a good movie?" eff off. <br /> <br /> this movie sucked from the beginning with the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie ... usually they start for five minutes before realizing that "maybe this movie is annoying "... but no, you know it right away. This film talks about Edgar Allen Poe. I've never tried to explain it to people who have not memorized Poe's life story yet. So I do not know if that is what's being said this film is about a writer "ethan poe" who is associated with his cousin "ann" ... both are descendants of edgar allan poe ... or are they? !? apparently, people give what their ancestors did. This guy Ethan Poe is actually Ethan "Guardian", who is supposed to be descendants of the story "The House of Hunter" written by Edgar Allen Poe. Ann's brother sometimes appears to try to rape her ... Ann is also followed by three different people in the same street (seriously, three ...) as if they were right behind her, staring at her and she does not even notice it). The characters who are murdered everywhere turn up in the end to save the day ... but they can not. In the end, Ann shoots Ethan while trying to kill her best friend. Of course, before she shoots him, "never again!" This movie should never be seen again!
