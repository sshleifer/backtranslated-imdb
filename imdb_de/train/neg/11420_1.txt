St. Elmo's Fire has no bearing on post-graduate life (common to most of us anyway). Why was this garbage made at all? Who really can relate to it? Who lives like these characters? I'm really sorry that the actors are dealing with such a horrible script. There are some talented young actors in this "film" who have done a good job elsewhere. It just has to be a joke for her on the set. <br /> <br /> I actually found this "movie" insulting to my intelligence. The only joy I got is the hope that Sir John Hughes had a good old laugh when he saw a performance that same year, when his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released, the same mistake I'm seeing from movies of the 80s. It's really so offensive to the genre.
