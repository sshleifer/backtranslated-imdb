"The Screaming Skull" will be opened with a free funeral warning and offer if you should die looking - now there is a catch! The story itself has a rather interesting premise for a horror movie: The husband marries a wealthy woman with mental illness in the past and tries to convince her that she goes crazy with shrill sounds, mysterious tapping and skulls that emerge at awkward times , Add to the formula a sufficiently scary gardener who still retains the memory of the first wife of the man to whom he is dedicated. Maybe it's just that the 1950s did not have the technology to produce some of the horror scenes needed to film this film. The techniques used here seem simple and banal. But when I first saw "House on Haunted Hill" as a nine year old, in the same way I was sure it was made for young viewers of the same era. <br /> <Do not get me wrong, the movie is not terrible, it sometimes seems boring. There is, however, a great deal of atmospheric tension in Whitlock's generally huge but unfurnished house. The gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me, this is the best scene in which Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) gets mad in the pond and tries to get the hidden skull. He just undresses in clothes and everything else, unlike the mentally handicapped gardener (director Alex Nicol in a doppelganger) role). One wonders who the real fool was. <br /> <br /> In its own way, perhaps the most shocking part of the movie: how about this cute roadster, the first time the Whitlocks appear in gullwing doors 1958! At least that made me jump out of my seat!
