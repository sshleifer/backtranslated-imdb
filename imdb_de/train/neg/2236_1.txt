I do not really know where to start. The acting in this movie was really terrible, I can not remember seeing so many "actors" in a movie who were not able to play. Not only was the acting bad, the characters were incredibly stupid too. <br /> <br /> Then there is the action. I believe that even children know that when someone is shot, blood is there. But if someone is shot in Snitch'd for ten (!!) times, there is no blood at all. Well, I think that's just me. <br /> <br /> To make it short (because I think I can talk about this movie for hours), this is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. This film should undoubtedly be number 1 among the 100.
