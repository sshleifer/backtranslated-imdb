Madison is not so bad - if you like simple, not offensive, "family-friendly" fares and, more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited seaplane racing. If you grew up with sport like me and your heroes had names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., you should prepare for disappointment. <br /> <br /> Professional film critics have commented extensively on the formulaic nature of the film and its preference for using any deceptive sports clich√© in the book. I do not have to repeat what they said. Unfortunately, what I felt was missing was the feeling of the real excitement of the unrestricted hydro-racing in the "glorious years" (many claiming that they were already over in 1971). <br /> <br /> Yes, it was wonderful to see The old, classic boats rustled six side by side in the square, though it was clear that the restored versions (hat to the volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum) at a reduced speed were cared for by the scenes. But where was the sound? The thrill of the old Hydros mainly consisted of the dazzling roar of six Allison or Rolls-Merlin aircraft engines, converted to RPMs their designers could not imagine, and reached the starting line right in front of you. You did not hear it, you felt it. Real Hydro fans know exactly what I'm talking about. There's nothing like that in Madison. Instead, every racing scene is buried under a "heroic" music score. <br /> <br /> And then there are the close-ups of the drivers driving quietly and comfortably in the cockpits. They relaxed in the latest luxury sedans and sometimes took the time to smile evilly while they thought about them The best way to defeat the poor hero of the hometown. Or, in a particularly ridiculous setting that took time to find Jake Lloyd, who gave a "Rocky" salute from a bridge pier. In reality, some unlimited riders wore Flakwesten to minimize the impact as the boats crashed over the rock-hard water at speeds in excess of 150 km / h. <br /> <br /> As a reviewer puts it: "The sport deserves better than that." <br /> <br /> Finally, as another user has addressed anachronisms, I add one more: The Introductory shot of Seattle showing the Kingdome and the Safeco Field. None existed in 1971
