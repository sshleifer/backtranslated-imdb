The golden era of Disney cartoons died in the late 90s. This show quack pack should not even be considered a DuckTales offshoot because the show had little to do with DuckTales. It's a teenage girl of the age of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, who cause trouble for their uncle Donald and speak in hip-hop talks and are totally dressed unlike DuckTales. I prefer the little adventurous nephews of DuckTales. There are people in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals that live in Duckburg. There is no evidence of Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repeated, the plot is boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of slapstick humor, I recommend this. If you're looking for a better Disney show, check out "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales."
