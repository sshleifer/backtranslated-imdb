Yesterday I happened to see this movie in a movie theater. I had some hopes for the movie because I really like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book he's based on. The film starts well, as it seems to be a nice thriller at first glance. The movie quickly becomes a jumble of uninteresting plot lines, characters that have never been painted and that are not of interest to the audience (like Marjoke) and a terrible cut. The film has faded to black bits that are just too long, a jumbled up chronology that jumps back and forth, and many scenes that add nothing to the story and could easily be dropped. After you've gone through history, you're confronted with one of the worst endings I've seen in a long time. It should also be mentioned that the movie has many explicit sex scenes that you are probably used to when you see a lot of Dutch movies. It's hard to say something good about this movie. About a third of the audience had already left the theater halfway and I did not hear a friendly word after the movie was over. Avoid this movie at all costs. it really destroyed any trust I had in the Dutch film industry.
