I am surprised by the many voters who give this film even better grades. I thought of this movie that the target audience is adults and men. Whipped and tormented women, merciless revenge and a high body count are typical ingredients that introduces the spaghetti subgenre in film history. The opening and hand-smashing are DJANGO rip-offs. However, the SHOOTER lacks the style of e.g. DJANGO. Score, drama and cinematography are mediocre at best, but if you're looking for the ingredients above, you've come to the right place. And the actors do not have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
