Welcome to a bad ghost story and a nightmare. This horror story finds a newlywed husband (John Hudson) and his wife (Peggy Weber) being persecuted by the memory of his former wife. Is the husband really trying to drive his anxious bride crazy? Or is it the learning gardener Mickey (Alex Nicol), who has been looking after the property of the villa since the death of the original mistress of the house? This low-budget horror movie features a story that includes the entire finale. Special effects are pretty bad even at the 1958 standards. I swear sometimes that the screaming skull sounds like it should be in a Godzilla movie. Also in the cast as Reverend Snow is character actor Russ Conway. By the way ... the lurking gardener (Nicol) is the director of the film. You can see this as part of the AMC monster festival.
