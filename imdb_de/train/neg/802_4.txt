As with many media experiments, this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary. In the more than 5 years since its release, the premise has been made less daunting by real events in software development, and for that reason I found it less boring than the previous Hitchcock commentator, and it's too bad the film did not perform better but in fact it's almost a parody of Pulp Fiction, including the soundtrack that screams at us if we're to be careful. You can almost see the exclamation mark and the capital letters on a yellowed page. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that for all these reasons I found it more than entertaining. Sometimes the slick has less to offer, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for educational purposes. Oh yes - and although the sutures showed and there was a lot of creaking, my heart rate increased and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.
