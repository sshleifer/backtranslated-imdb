I had the distinct misfortune of catching up with two of the worst movies of 2004 this morning: first, the incoherent CGI-driven emptiness of Riddick's chronicles, and then the embarrassing vanity project called Greendale. One costs multimillion and the other costs a few cents, but both are bad. Really, really bad. <br /> <br /> In the run-up, I have to say that I'm not the biggest Neil Young fan in the world, but he has contributed his share of classical sounds: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were Young's compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps. Harvest and Mirror Ball, the guy wrote some really great songs. Unfortunately, Greendale does not have great songs and only a few good ones, and the movie they are built around is really jarring and simply politically repulsive. Without merit like art and inconspicuous as polemics, Greendale is best forgotten. Buy the book if you feel compelled to deposit in Young's account.
