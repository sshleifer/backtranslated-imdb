You're already in a movie and after it's over, it's like a big "wtf!?" <br /> <br /> Welcome to the Decoy. <br /> <br /> Another direct video action fuck movie you immediately forgot to have seen or better yet. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick Star are quickly wasted in this fast action doorknob, where the story is pretty damn bad and the action is shit and what's the use of seeing an action strip when the action blows? In particular, Robert Patrick reaches a new low in an action sequence in which he fires a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus. Co-stars like Charlotte Lewis and Canada's own Scott Hylands (by Night Heat).
