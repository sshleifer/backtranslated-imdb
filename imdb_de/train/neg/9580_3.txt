The former bellows-pack actor and all-around pretty boy Rob Lowe play a major role in a movie in a high-security American prison. I felt like his character would become popular in the first series of OZ for all the wrong reasons like Tobias, but PROXIMITY is not such a movie, he's more like a "man on the run" movie THE REFUGEE. James Coburn is a representative of the subject of "punishment and justice". He advocates as a spokesman for Justice for Victims Working Group, but any intelligent discussion about how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film becomes tired old clich√©s from shootings and car chases
