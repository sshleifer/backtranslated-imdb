(r # 97) <br /> <br /> This poor man's Pokémon (make what you want) is a good thing: the starting point. It's probably the coolest themed music of any sloppy Japanese made-for-the-consumer-oops-iops-I-mean-the-young-fan-anime TV programs. Unfortunately, after the opening theme a kind of show had to be added. And they just could not find anything more interesting than people who clamor about whose cards are better than the cards of the others. Freud would have a day in the field, but unfortunately I can not imagine why kids want to attend a show where the dialogue of a thousand monkeys takes 98% of the runtime in five minutes. <br /> <br /> "My over-the-top doomsday creature of Ultimate Destruction will hit your crappy pyramid-diamond beast in one hit! Can not you see you have no chance to win this battle, you Stupid ?! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! " <br /> <br /> "Oh yeah, look at this, I'm in the process of using my Delta Time Pie card from Destruction Force, which wipes out all your Power Munchers, and your Ultimate Uber-Fantastical Doomsday creature Dooms Destroy beyond all meaning useless! I bet you did not see that coming! "<br /> <br /> Seriously, that's all you ever do in this show, talk. While I was watching another crappy children's show, the commercial phenomenon Pokémon (the darling of every football mom), the monsters, at least, had the courtesy to say it over and over: "Yu-Gi-Oh" In the quiet words of Roger Ebert's review A Clockwork Orange is called "simple and boring". Not to mention lethargy (I realize I'm hypocritical given the sentence I just wrote). <br /> <br /> This show goes on forever. I do not know if there is a conspiracy, and the static monsters have no character of Pokémon. Even though she is not compared to my favorite cartoon as a kid, this show is shitty. It is unintentionally funny, but not funny enough to be worth seeing. Bye, sleep well, dream wet dreams.
