A noble effort, I guess, but ultimately a bad one. Before I saw this movie, I felt that "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was not filmable. After seeing it, I still do it. I think only those who read the story will understand what's going on, and they'll be upset over the unnecessary reworking of the movie (updated from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London). Even the outstanding talents of Paul Scofield can not save that, which for me is a well-meaning but misleading effort to film Melville's metaphysical classics.
