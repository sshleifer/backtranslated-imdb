If you've seen this movie, you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." Hehehe !!! Every time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed and thought "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie"? I can not believe Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreamlike Spectacle I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and I do not think I'm having a lot of fun with him ... but I prefer an actor, not this android named Timberlake. And his girlfriend was flat, hollow and damned annoying. I was happy when both were popped on the street. <br /> <br /> The story was alright and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did a great job as a villain. The movie was entertaining, but I think Timberlake ruined everything. Without him it would have been very pleasant. By the way, the music was fine, but every time the music appeared, the movie turned into an MTV video clip with flashes, slow movements, and the like. Something wrong for this movie of the cops, I thought. Maybe they wanted to make an MTV video clip for Timberlake.
