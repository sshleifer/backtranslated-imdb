How this movie was made with an alleged $ 70 million budget and without being completely retooled, I do not know. The plot and the dialogue are not amateurish. Characters say things that no real person would ever say and almost never respond to what was said before. Nobody seems to be anchored in the real world. The show of leads is fine, because writing is such a doodle ... but some actors in supporting roles really pull the production down. The hero's hair would probably have earned its own reputation, it was so strangely eye-catching ... not to mention it had one of the better performances in the picture. After all, this film is shockingly boring for a film about L.A.'s siege of giant reptiles. Pity! When you see this, your thoughts will keep racing and wondering how to capture the SFX scenes and build a much better movie around them. Unfortunately, it did not take much.
