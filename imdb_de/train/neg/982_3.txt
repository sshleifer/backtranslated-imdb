The real star of this ridiculous story is glorious Technicolor. A visual benefit to the eye, the mind and the heart are not stimulated. At first I was fascinated by the idea that Dietrich and Boyer left the religion to "find" their love ability. What follows is a big disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in the production and you can feel his torment. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe towers above her performance - sometimes her face is scary - an emotionless mask. As a monk, Boyer took the formula for the liqueur of the monastery (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) - when he leaves his "marriage to God," the reaction of his peers is the shock and the fear of perpetuating organized religion. The viewer feels that Boyer was well off his past. However, the following trip is too predictable.
