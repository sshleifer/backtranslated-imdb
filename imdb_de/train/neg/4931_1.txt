This time around, we get a psycho-toy maker called "Joe Petto" (bring it?) Who makes living, evil toys that kill people. He goes after the family, which has the misfortune of simply living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son "Pino" (again, do you have it?) Lived to live. <br /> <br /> (and hopefully (probably) the last) in this semi-series, this and the previous movie look like softcore porn movies, but without sex and nudity. It's like a mix of "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad home videos. Presumably in 2000, the sixth chapter of the series was started, but it was abandoned and never completed. We can all just hope it stays that way ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 Star of **** <br /> <br />
