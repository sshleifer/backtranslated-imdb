Why is it that every movie about Cleopatra, the last Phaohoh, produces the worst in filming? What attractiveness the woman had for the greatest Roman of all, Julius Ceasar and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seems to appear on screen as anything other than the antics of overzealous high school seniors. Despite elaborate sets and costumes, this film is as bad as any Italian extravaganza "sandals and toga" of the 50s. Granted, this kind of spectacle belongs on the big screen, which is why "Gladiator" was well-endorsed, but "Gladiator" did not have all the romance lyrics. Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare. Too bad that some of them were not washed off by the others.
