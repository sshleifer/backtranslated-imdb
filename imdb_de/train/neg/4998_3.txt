This is one of the best celebrities ever shown. we can see the concerts we can see the life of britney, i love the five episodes. I was always surprised by Britney and the themes of the show. I think some people do not see the show at all, we can be like a great person who they are. She is really funny, very gentle and she loves her fans and we can see how she loves her work. I just do not give 10 because he's a real jerk and he does not seem to like Britney at all. I'm doing a second season of this great show because it shows how Britney really is. Go for Britney and you will never leave our hearts.
