To put it in a nutshell: This movie is softcore pornography that is marketed to the masses under a name that says the studio deducts every last penny from the American Pie teat. Period. <br /> <br /> The entire plot (and that should not mean much to do) serves as an instrument to show the public more breasts and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you're a Tween type and too squeamish to buy pornography, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, the film does not have much to offer. <br /> <br /> The acting is below average, the character development is virtually nonexistent, and the story is a nonsensical nudity of nudity and pranks (none of which is particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> Buy real porn if you want it, and if not, watch a good movie. Animal House, Kids or even the original American Pie are great cinemas and all contain heavy alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "It's not like how much you use it"
