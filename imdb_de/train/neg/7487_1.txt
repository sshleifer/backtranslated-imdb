Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was crazy and very funny, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, Neil Simons' script is not used in this movie, so it keeps falling flat. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The direction is very slow and boring, and if there is a joke, it is given away, so that the joke dies, d. H. The couple who has sex in the park. They announce it is a New York light ceremony. Well, we all know the lights are on, and we'll see how sweet and overpowering Goldie & Steve are doing a bit of slapstick. The whole movie is just as it is ... a joke is set up and given away. Why is not Goldie's hair messed up in the movie at all? You will also notice every close-up of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis if you want to laugh.
