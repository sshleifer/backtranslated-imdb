"So there's this bride, you see, and she's being squeezed to death by this statue that falls on her on the day of her wedding, and then, a year later, her former fianc√© falls in love with a beautiful soul, and then it becomes beautiful medium haunted by the spirit of the angry dead bride who wants to keep her from stealing her boyfriend? he he? s going to be hilarious. "polite giggling. <br /> <br /> So I want to imagine how Jeff Lowell, the man who came up with "Over Her Dead Body", introduced his concept to the studio guides in New Line Cinema. The big mystery is how exactly these corporate concerts can turn around and give the project the go-ahead, so Lowell can write both the movie and the script. If you think that no film could do that. If you ever sound as bad as this original premise sounds, then you clearly have different thoughts. The only way it could have worked would be if the writer had just gone crazy and turned it into a satirical farce. Instead of making sure that he delivered a fuzzy, harmless and warm romantic comedy, Lowell takes every step of the way, boring half steps and strangles the absurdity in favor of drab conventionality. In fact, "Over Her Dead Body" is so thoroughly indecent and unsteady that it's hard to know exactly where Lowell believed he could handle it. Virtually every set-up, joke and visual gag in the movie is flat and poorly executed, even the actors seem to be aware of their location. How else to explain the half-hearted, lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? <br /> <br /> I decide not to accuse the actors, some of whom have already demonstrated their talents in better vehicles (this is especially true of Rudd). But Lowell and these studio managers certainly have a lot to do.
