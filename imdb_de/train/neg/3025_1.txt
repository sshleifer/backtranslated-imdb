this movie is really bad ....... no i mean really very bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. Of all the movies he made, I just like public enemies, and he's one of the worst directors of all time. What shocks me the most is that Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the script. Now Richard Kelly is, in my opinion, a genius, but to be involved, he lets hope that he has learned his lesson. Now I love Mickey Rourke's new roles, but I can not even like him in that respect because of the terrible story and looks of it. Do not get me wrong, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he made a few accusations in his time, and this is one of them. I do not know what to say chivalrously about Keira, I think she's a bit over the top. I just can not feel it in movies. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is bad. that's it ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
