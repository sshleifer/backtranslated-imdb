From the beginning of the film, there is the feeling that the director is trying to portray something that I want to say, rather than the story that determines the style in which the film should be made; conversely, it has become a kind of movement that he wanted to do, and wrote a story about it. And he failed very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. In any case, I think this movie is a waste of time and effort. The director knows what media he works with, what I'm trying to say is that I've seen the worst movies. Here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the film. And the actors have also shown a decent performance.
