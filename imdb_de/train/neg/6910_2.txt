I've never seen this movie before, but I can say something about its production. When I was a comedy / oldies radio DJ in 1988, I got a call from the production company. They asked if I would write anything and record it, they would fall into the soundtrack because the sounds came from a TV (the TV screen itself would never be shown). Sure, I wrote a parody of the 1950s sci-fi monster clich√©s, collected some sound effects, and called on another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female role. Since she was in the air at the time, she put on a long song, joined me on the microphone in the production room and we cut the voice track in a single take. Giggling, she went back to her show while mixing the stupid sound effects. We would never have done it if we had known that "Woodchipper Massacre" would be such a turkey - but on the other hand we were never paid for our efforts! - Gary Theroux
