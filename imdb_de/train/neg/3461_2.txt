Slasher films are often viewed as distracted, repetitive and, frankly, unoriginal. I happen to be a horror movie fan, but this movie was just so poor that I miss the words. The script is missing strong, the plot is ridiculous, the drama amazingly bad. Only an all-rounder stinker, on which I wasted my time. This had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a movie that was primarily bleak. <br /> <br /> Who made this mess green? <br /> <br /> I only liked two things in this movie. The first was the mask of the killer - which was nice. The second was the Austrian affinity with humorous obscenity. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this heinous mess.
