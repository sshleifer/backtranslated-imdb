Nothing to say except Wow! Has anyone actually sneaked up in the open field? Well, that happens about 25 times in this movie (clearly the director's favorite scare tactic). In one of the opening scenes, the smooth talking / hot shot producer has to drive in the back seat so that the cameraman can sit in front to film. Shortly after arriving on the field, the 5 participants appear, and although it is clearly two o'clock in the afternoon, they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute. After about 30 minutes of unencumbered garbage, we have a look back at the story of the clown, in which we see some of his earlier victims. If you look at this movie, look at the ladies' chest. Her ribs reach to her throat, it was completely disgusting. Most horror movies take place at night, but without a night vision camera, the chaos must occur during the day. The few night shots that made the film look as if they were stolen by the Blair Witch Project or by chance from the backyard of the directors. In the end, the movie did it for itself when there was a matrix, such as the clown we rewound, and how he laughed hysterically IN AN OPEN FIELD. <br /> <br /> SIGNS THE ANSWER
