The Sentinel stands for everything that concerns the soullessness of Hollywood and the sad lack of imagination in so many films today. I can not think of anything good, it's all so generic, so factory-made, and so lazily assembled that it's really just an infomercial of how to make money from the unsuspecting, unearned public. <br /> <br /> A conspiracy over a Secret Service Agent planning to kill the Prez could be entertaining. When handled by a good director or a caring cast. Douglas is the one who is framed. Basinger is the first lady with whom he has an affair (an undeveloped, unresolved conspiracy device). Sutherland is the best buddy who thinks he's guilty, because without him there would be no movie. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with a fortune from Maybelline and ... that's it. I think there are fewer requirements for women entering the secret service. As usual in a movie like this, the role of Prez itself is nothing more than a tool, a sign, and very poorly written. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson's, who has given back to us the equally miserable SWAT In 2003, the mechanical direction lacks any sort of signature and the visual sophistication of a cheap television movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored in their performances from a distance. Eva Longoria, the most exposed woman of the 21st century, is basically just to attract the audience of Desperate Housewives. Her role is 100% pointless and she does absolutely nothing to promote the plot or contribute to character development. She has barely two rows to rub herself. A really shameless marketing trick. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in punishment, do not let me stop you. But it is time and money that you will not come back.
