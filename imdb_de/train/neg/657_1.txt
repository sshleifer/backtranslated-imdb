PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> Director: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> with: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis. Plot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) experienced the death of her entire family through her teacher (Jonathan Schaech), who has a crush on her. Now she is preparing for her prom with her stupid, annoying friends. Once there, they gradually start to die because the killer escaped from prison and no one cared to warn Donna because her prom was obviously too important to interrupt. <br /> <br /> Pros: I've got some good laughs from the movie because of the terrible dialogue and stupid nature. <br /> <br /> An example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man, strangely obsessed with her (she does not seem to be that great), is out of jail escaped. Their reason: They do not want to embarrass them in front of all their friends. LOL <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Let me start by saying that I'm a big Slasher fan. Normally, I can also have fun with the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror movies. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also like POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). The fact that this is a stupid Slasher movie rated PG-13 has nothing to do with the fact that I do not like the movie. <br /> <br /> At first I had a big problem with the story. I like Slasher movies that have no stories. At least they can be entertaining. It's about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills her entire family. A few years later, he tries to make amends by ruining her prom and killing all her friends ...? Then there were subplots that I doubt was important to anyone. Claire (Jessica Stroup) fights with her boyfriend, she has cramps and I do not care. This should be a lifetime feature, not a PROM NIGHT remake. <br /> <br /> And then ... this is a Slasher movie with terrible death scenes. It does not matter to me that it is not so bloody. Some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not that bloody, but they still had effective murders. Here, half of the characters die in front of the screen in the same hotel room, a woman stabbed several times without stab wounds, and a close-up on the face of a nasty actor screaming in pain. I'm sure 10-year-old girls were scared but not me. <br /> <br /> I also hated the characters. There was Donna's unrealistically sensitive friend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee that you will never meet a friend who is so sensitive in your life, unless you are a gay man. Then we had Donna's annoying friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the silly girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying, watch this movie. Do not get on with Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and the DJ (Jay Phillips), who gave me flashbacks to Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT. <br /> <br /> Add a terrible effect to all these predictable twists and soundtrack and a great lack of respect for the original material, and you have a pretty stinker.
