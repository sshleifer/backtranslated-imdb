"Ninteen Eighty-Four" is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and nobody can be trusted. It's a very dark movie and you will not feel well. It is about a romanticism in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and that human nature is selfish. The film has some very good ideas and is good at depicting this society with the dark hues (as opposed to happiness and bright colors in the dreams) and a general sense of loneliness through objects and people and places. Despite the film's cleverness to present this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to convey the idea entirely. It seemed too smart, instead of telling a story.
