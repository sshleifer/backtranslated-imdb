The rookie suffers so much. There are the random musical songs scattered throughout the film, the long pointless script and enough slapstick to blush Jerry Lewis. Noonan and Leavitt just do not know when to stop. It takes a whole hour for the story to finally reach the main plot and the characters shipwrecked. Then the boys play Japanese sailors with the usual racist caricature of the day. It's a shame that the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt play the stupid, stereotypical Japanese guys. But it gets pretty exhausting when you switch back and forth between two character sets. Then it ends abruptly. Even a naked Julie Newmar in a towel can not save this. <br /> <br /> The film has really little charm and is over half an hour too long. The story is just racing around, trying to build funny situations and fail. Stay with Martin & Lewis. At least Deano had charm and Jerry had this animated face.
