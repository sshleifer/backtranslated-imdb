I watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why he got such terrible reviews here. It was pretty easy to see (at 3am). It was a good casting - Kevin Dillon's role as a serial killer of the sociopath was very credible - he was both charismatic and chilled. The rest of the main characters were not so bad either. <br /> <br /> This is your typical stalker / suspense movie. A married couple can not get pregnant, so it goes to a fertility clinic. A sociopathic "genetic substance" donor fixes the recipient and invades her life in typical Stalker form. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the movie was pretty good. We see "Conan" grow More and more obsessed with raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother. Of course, things do not go the way he planned. Not a bad plot. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes were just awful. I'm pretty tolerant with movies (especially at 3am!) .. but I was just surprised how bad the end was written. I really laughed over the mouth! All in all, not the worst movie I have ever seen, but I could not stand it anymore (unless I skipped the end). The only renewing quality here was Kevin Dillon's role - one of the best serial killers ever. <br /> <br /> Try to look at the other channels before you look at it. If there is nothing better, I would do it try it .. =)
