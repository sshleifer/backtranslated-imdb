This is really one of the worst movies ever made. I consider myself a GIANT zombie movie fan and usually tolerate bad acting, lame "special effects" a stupid story and whatever is seen in second-class films as the film has a good atmosphere / story / suspension or whatever. This basically has no positive aspect and is the third or fourth rate, possibly worse. Some friends of mine and I shot a little movie in a week and did a definitely better job (not a zombie movie). <br /> <br /> This movie is not even funny about talking about anything else. Really bad and superfluous special effects, zombies that look like normal people (apart from a white extra skin that gets pulled over their faces) Gore presents is just stupid). The camera stays pretty long in feeding scenes, it gets boring and you can not wonder why the zombies kill their prey with the help of WEAPONS (!). I will not go into the details of synchronization (others did). Although I am from Germany myself and at least a little curious about the original version, I will NOT waste any more time with this film. <br /> <br /> Stay away as far as you can.
