ORCA is not bad, but not the best hour of Richard Harris. As a crazy, ahab-like fisherman, Harris gets into a death play with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whale's "wife" and the unborn child. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who deals with Harris. She screams at him how important it is to leave nature alone. He does not listen and somehow lands in the Arctic and fights against the vengeful whale. There are no special effects to talk about, except what a whale eye looks like a round mirror - there are endless shots of Harris mirroring in the eye, so the audience realizes the whale knows who it is , Bo Derek, as one of Harris' crews, has a particularly uncomfortable battle with the Orca, and most of the co-fellows, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson, and Keenan Wynn, are not very good at it.
