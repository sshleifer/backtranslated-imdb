This 1968 Tim Burton remake of the original "Planet of the Apes" (and with Charleton Heston) is far from the quality and plot of the original. <br /> <br /> Certainly, special effects have since improved in 1968, but do not write. The characters were boring and the dialogue was awful. I sat the whole movie with a friend (who thankfully rented only) and fully understood why before Christmas all "Planet of the Apes" toys were at Target at Target. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: Do not put this on your CV. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone else: Watch the original 1968 film "Planet of the Apes".
