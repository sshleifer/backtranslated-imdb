Tim Robbins is strangely benign. He was cast as a workshop mechanic in the New Jersey of the 1950s and falls in love with a naughty blonde, who turns out to be the niece of Albert Einstein. Although Robbins is on the screen most of the time, he breaks off the inner workings of his intense personality and steps into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). Chunky romantic comedy with a gimmick, this is Walter Matthau, who plays Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoon-like character). Otherwise it is sugary and sunny, rather sleepy by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or wit. Meg Ryan is her usual friendly self and the chemistry between her and Robbins is charming, like that of a tender sister and her big brother. ** from ****
