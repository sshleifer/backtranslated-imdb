An avid fan of George McDonald Fraser's Flashman books, I was thrilled to see Flashy on the big screen when this movie was first released. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment then - so I left it alone for 20 years before looking at it again, but the second time it was not better. Mr Fraser is a hugely skilled writer, but I'm not a fan of his script writing with Richard Lester. The love of slapstick has spoiled 'The Three Musketeers' for me and the same is true here. For me, the whole tone and feel of the movie is wrong. The Flashman books are sometimes very funny, but they are adventure novels. The kind of adventure Flashman takes is very serious - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. This is conveyed in the novels, but due to its comedic style is not transferred to film at all. It's a huge shame, because it could have a great movie if it had been a faithful adaptation of the style of the book. The first time I read that the book was to be shot, the article said that the movie should be played by Oliver Reed. I was glad when Reed was the epitome of Flashman for me. How I would have liked to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but he does not fit with the visual image of Flashman created by the books (too poor Flashman is probably a tough guy). Nevertheless, Reed was awarded as Bismarck. What kills the movie is that it is made as a comedy. The only scene that creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman de Gautet (Tom Bell) kills. A shame, because the production values, costumes, sets, etc. are excellent and the casting is generally excellent - just about everyone in the movie is well-staffed except for Malcolm McDowell. Maybe the direction of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the movie works. A recent Fraser-adapted radio adaptation of "Flash For Freedom" worked quite well. Maybe one day we will see that Flashman lives up to the screen.
