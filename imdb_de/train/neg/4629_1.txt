Obviously made to show the famous "acting" talents of the 50s. Too bad she can not act. <br /> <br /> Boring little story about sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers) being drugged and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then she meets the likeable Tommy Cole, who immediately falls in love with her. He wants to help her escape, but can he? You really do not care. <br /> <br /> There is no real skin here - Ayers slowly pulls herself to her underwear (twice). The rest is just a boring little story full of bad acting, cruel "comedy" (never thought prostitution would be funny, but what do I know?) And a dreadful dialogue after syncing. I admit there was a turn in the end that I did not see coming, but that's not enough to get through it. Ayers' acting is also hysterical! A real bomb. Avoid.
