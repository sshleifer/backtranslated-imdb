Tom Wolfe's sprawling, brilliantly satirical life novel under New York snobbery looks shiny, but is not well served. The film not only suffers from the abuse of the Everyman Tom Hanks as a carefree yuppie, Kewpie doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative Southern Belle and Bruce Willis (?!) As the darling of the writers of New York. The most serious abuse was in the director's chair. Robert Altman may have brought these unlikely characters to life and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma, in spite of all his visual sophistication, never had the nuances of human experience in his sights. The resulting film looks good, but seems to be dubious in favor of status. Honestly, if a satire does not make the viewer angry, what's the point?
