Scary .. yes scary !! Maslin Beach is packed with nudity (from fat people to skinny people) and takes place at a nudist beach in SA. I saw this movie for the first time two years ago - you can say with certainty that it made a bizarre topic Talk the next day at school. This movie was terrible! Hardly a romantic comedy - just a showcase of nudity! This movie reached its low point with one of the New Age characters staring down between a girl's legs. <br /> <br /> Girl: You will not find God there! Guy: Nah, but I think I found the sky. <br /> <br /> Avoid amateur actors wanting to talk about follies, adultery and the process of genital overlap. AVOID!
