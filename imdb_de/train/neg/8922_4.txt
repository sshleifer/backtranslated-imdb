Two old men sitting on a park bench. I really have no problem with this scene - the only problem is that it is not a scene. It's the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Yup films do not get a concept more than this. They do not get bored any more than that, but it gets worse because those two old men are chalk and cheese. One is Nat Moyer, who is Yiddish-Communist, while Midge Carter is a former gold-glove champion, who is also black. Let me now see how a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench get on well together. Well, I think it's unlikely, but if this movie has such a harmless scenario, why stick to the Jewish stereotype? Why should they make loud tribilist agitators who abandon Hebrew oaths? Slightly ironic that at the beginning of the film the Jews were just the sort of Jews that were seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s, written for a very different medium than cinema, based on a stage play and showing. Walter Matthau sleeps by his role as Nat, while this commentator has almost slept the whole movie
