I really wanted to love this show. I honestly said it. <br /> <br /> For the first time gay viewers get their own version of "The Bachelor". With the help of his obligatory "hail" Andra, James, a handsome, handsome thirty-year-old with 15 battles (or "colleagues" as they are referred to in the show) has the chance of love. The only problem is that half of them are straight and James does not know that. If James is looking for a gay, they get a trip to New Zealand, and if he chooses one straight, he gets just $ 25,000. How can that not be fun ?! Take my hand, let's stroll around: <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem with this show is the bachelor himself. James is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body that you probably take two glances at throw a local bar before grazing on greener pastures. Why they chose to occupy James as the leading man is not mine. God knows that there are so many other hot and lively gay men who would die on television. Aside from his rather average physical appearance, James is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. As such, he has that arrogant, smug, condescending aura around him. But if James stood against a blank, white wall, he would melt right into it. I honestly can not remember a single interesting or remarkable word that James said during the show. He is so boring and unforgettable. In fact, one of the buddies advised that he felt no connection. I thought that was the best part of the show. James also talks with a painful annoying Lilt. Listen to female or male, but do not blow sounds in the middle of a sentence ... so painful that you sit through. I hated him so much throughout the show that I thought, "Please select a straight guy and humiliate you and your unfortunate looking witch." <br /> <br /> Then we have the suitors. A remarkably mild group of men who do not care what happens. Likewise vapid, they seem indistinguishable from one man to another, except, "Hey, this guy has blonde highlights or oh, that you have curly hair." Again, amazingly inappropriate casting decisions seem to be the goal of this show. It may be a hindrance to typing cast roles, but it would have been much more entertaining than these amorphous drones. In all their banality, however, they still manage to put James on stage (which is not that hard anyway). You know you have a problem when some of the candidates are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man. And the fact that the volunteers seem to have more fun with EVERYONE else than with the leading man? Very sad. <br /> <br /> Besides, I just thought that I mentioned something on the Message Boards that I thought was true: the hetero-men are all hotter than the gay guys. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm not saying that all the gay guys are ugly and boring, in fact I found some of them very sweet. It's just that they were just BLAH in total compared to the men you see on shows like A Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or The Bachelorette. I do not know how many times I move fast during this show. I can accept a lead figure as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept the profane, apathetic candidates, but PLEASE keep entertaining me a little just because of the love of God. No such luck. <br /> <br /> If you expect drama, intrigue, sexiness or excitement, you will be VERY disappointed. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the candidates might still have a friend in New York (How scandalous!). As exciting as that may be, I guarantee that this is the ONLY thing that remotely resembles every conflict in this show. Of course there is the twist, but if you have the appearance of Gaydar in it, it's you. I'll easily recognize who's who (it was not hard at all, I was only wrong once.) This show stacks so many chips on the Twist that she has nowhere else to go. <br /> <br /> We can watch James & Co doing such exciting activities, such as: Learn how to dance the western step, buy gifts, visit a petting zoo, and go gay karaoke. YAWNING. Sure, you occasionally have topless to dance, but who cares if everyone's boring anyway. This is one of the main problems on the show: No one seems to enjoy themselves - they are in the process of going through the movement and they are eager to have a good time. And you really can not blame them because the events are all wildly uninspired and lame. <br /> <br /> Finally, the physical aspect does not exist. There is no cuddling, no stroking, no kissing (!), No caress. It's just "Okay, that was a boring date. I'm going back to my ugly, cheesy Sydney Opera House (CYA)." This show is so prude that it is ridiculous. I can understand that they do not want to give up the supposed indiscretional nature of homosexual men, but get the mess. People who watch reality TV shows will want more than immovable hugs and tight kisses. This show refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if this took a long time, but I felt that these were issues that needed to be addressed. I recommend Bravo for putting up such a show for the first time, but the amazingly incompetent way in which this show was handled is overwhelming. To summarize my three points: Boring + Boring + Boring = Doing something else. You have more fun waiting for an appointment in a doctor's office, at least there are interesting magazines there.
