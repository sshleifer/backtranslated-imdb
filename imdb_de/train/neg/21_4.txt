What about all Turkish actors? No offense, but I thought it would be all in vain for all these actors. The film did not have a script to test the actors' acting skills or abilities. It demanded virtually nothing that I had bought for this movie to see Michael Madsen. He's one of my favorite actors, but this movie was another failure for him. The script was so bad. It was just nothing you could get involved with, and all the characters were two-dimensional. Madsen tried to act as a hard ass, but the script and directing did not even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or three-dimensional. The beginning of the movie sounded like the sound of paintball guns when they did to be fired in a fight. It was really weird and they did not sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this movie. At the beginning of the film, there was also a really annoying guy who was a member of the robber gang. He had that American whining voice like a girl who exclaims lines like "Lets get the F # $ k" and "What do we do, man?" I laugh too. For a few seconds. Whoo Hoo! Stupid film. Poor Madsen. He will jump back.
