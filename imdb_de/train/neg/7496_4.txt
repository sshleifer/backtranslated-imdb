It's hard to put into words the almost seething hatred of this film. But I'll try: <br /> <br /> Every other word was a blast, the sex scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were common and stereotypes were beyond the norm, if not offensive to Italian Americans I'm not saying that Acting was terrible because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. all right, good. But ... almost every character in the movie I despised. Since the Bonfire of the Vanities, I have not liked every character on the screen.
