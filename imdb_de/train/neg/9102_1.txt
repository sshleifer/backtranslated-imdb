I was ready to proceed with the original _Cruel Intentions. She followed the plot and remained true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, in my opinion, this film was a shitty repetition with essentially the same plot and no clear character choices. I honestly did not care what happened to them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) is the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. I did not realize until I read the IMDB that this movie should be a prequel, especially as the title is a number Contains "2". Overall, I have to say that this movie was at least read to me like a gentle porn version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
