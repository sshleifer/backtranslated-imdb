This film has the potential to be really good, considering that some of the plot elements were borrowed from science fiction actor THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always gives his rolls a touch of cheese. But somebody really dropped the ball somewhere. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a monk (!) who steps in the butt who travels to New York to fetch a key that opens a door under his monastery that has been holding the Antichrist prisoner since 2000 years. He has to fight against the henchman, who is a mind that leaps from body to body, similar to THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL. The servant of course wants the key so that he can let out the antichrist. There's an annoying female archeologist for the ride, and Dolph and Minion's possessed bodies are hunted with her. <br /> <br /> If I make this sound entertaining, forget it. The tempo is very awkward and sluggish, the acting best and the fighting scenes poorly staged. Dolph Sleep goes through his role and spits out the worst dialogue of his career. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor gets really good in the end when the servant fights an army of machine gun monks in the monastery, but the rest of this movie is a snooze party. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I really wanted to do that.
