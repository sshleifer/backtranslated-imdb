This movie sucks from start to finish (especially). They probably will not get any worse, drama, plot, photography, camera work, etc. It's all bad, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> But that makes it a 'great' clock gives you more than enough good laughs. The worse, the better! <br /> <br /> I really have no idea what these people ever thought of this movie. A serious Viking movie? The story is goddamn ridiculous, it's more of a disguised comedy, somehow like mafia, also pointless, but damn funny. <br/>
