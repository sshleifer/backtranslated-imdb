The Corruptors in this review are offered as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist, Lady Barbara Skelton, is eventually raped and gunned down. And not a moment too soon. I would have shot the screen myself, but I was scared to have met James Mason. <br /> <br /> The 1943 novel titled "The Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton" (I think people did not do that. (moaning about spoilers back then) was written by a woman Her heroine is devastatingly beautiful and the author seems to believe that nothing else is important if you have beauty, but other things are important, such as the fact That Lady Barbar's immediate and only reaction, if anyone stands in her way, is murder, she murders three men in five attempts As a serial femme fatale, she has a case of dissocial personality disorder that could have landed her either in Bedlam or Newgate <br /> <br /> Lockwood plays her as a narcissistic vampire and has so much makeup on it that I thought she was a restoration (Joan Rivers) (or restoration), but Lady B. is irresistible to all three male protagonists - Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, who all do a good job, as does Patricia Roc. Of course, all three admirers know in a short time what a psychotic bitch Barbara is, but the plot keeps them all in orbit until one of them finally pulls them down. With the dramatic death scene in which a boom lifts the camera up through the windows and into the sky, we assume we have to take care of her death. But hers is the first corpse we do not care.
