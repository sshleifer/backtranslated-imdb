The Treasure Island DVD should be viewed in every film production class! It's a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. When you watch the movie and then hear the commentary from the director / director, the huge chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he tells his audience is graphically depicted. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication. The communication is incomplete when the audience does not know what the director is talking about. The declared goal of the director is to make a film without "Hollywood conventions". Unfortunately, among these conventions is the consistency of the character and the clarity of the term. The director himself realizes that the audience often does not understand points on which he consciously avoided a "Hollywood clich√©". However, he never seems to realize that stereotypes exist for a reason. They are the short form to convey complex ideas quickly and clearly. It is okay to avoid them, but they must be replaced by another way of communicating the same idea, which is not simply eliminated. The film is based on a fascinating premise, rich in potential. Two puppets are assigned to create a personality and background for an unidentified corpse to be used in a disinformation mission in the last days of World War II. Soon everyone starts populating his personal fantasies with the character, and their invention becomes more and more real to them. If you less despise the "Hollywood Convention" of traditional storytelling, this idea could make a wonderful movie. This movie is certainly not! The dolls do everything they can to maintain consistency in these characters, but they are all too often struck down by the numbed and confused writing. I'm getting more and more impressed by Gonzo, who plays the lively corpse. In a number of Muppet films, he is always characterized as a very charismatic puppet.
