Although there were some amusing moments, I found the movie pretty lame. The longer it went, the worse it got. As soon as the action arrived in Monument Valley, I looked at the great serves more than the increasingly stupid and not always convincing coexistence of the characters. <br /> <br /> The daughter's figure was particularly incoherent. First she is involved in the deal, then she discovers the truth and she enters. Then she is back and leaves again. Then she is back. There is no obvious motivation for one of their decisions. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes and many missing possibilities. I have to say, the pictures were much less than the sum of their parts. Apparently, people who liked Repo Man tended to like it. Searchers 2.0 is not comparable to The Searchers.
