let us appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Entertainment: a trashy script that's typed thousands of times by typeless people in typewriters ... pathetic action thwarted by history ... OK, production value, well set / place and beautiful girl .. rating 4/10 <br /> <br /> social message: The film has no social message. it's free thought ... but if I pretended to be 10 years old and my IQ would be 70 years old. I feel like the message is, do not be afraid to love? Rating 0/10 <br /> <br /> offensive stuff: nothing special, just the mild Jewish hedonic and arrogant attitude that the author / director presents. Generally good, nothing degenerates -8/10 <br /> <br /> Overall rating is 4/10
