Robert DeNiro plays the most incredibly intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it's really disgusting. The script is incredible. The dialogue is incredible. The character of Jane Fonda is a caricature of herself and not a funny one. The film moves at a snail's pace, is ill-advised and preaches tirelessly. It is also in every cliche in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is outstanding in a supporting role, but what? <br /> <br /> Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule, which requires ten lines for each check. If a movie is so worthless, it will not take ten lines of text to inform other readers that it will waste time and waste tape. Avoid this movie.
