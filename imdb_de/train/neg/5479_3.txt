I'll bet none of you knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando Cortes made a preliminary exploration trip to Mexico before he attacked the Aztecs. Good that he had done, because he had never known of these T Rexs who inhabited a particular valley, where the locals worshiped them as gods. <br /> <br /> That was understandable. What was not the casting of Ian Ziering with blue eyes as Cortes. Although the blonde hair was dyed black in Beverly Hills 90210, Ian looked absolutely ridiculous. At least he made no attempt to put a Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> The true hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca, Marco Sanchez is also late in a television series with a semi-recurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of Dallas PD. He finds true love for an Aztec princess, and life would be just perfect if the annoying prehistoric beasts did not worship the natives. The Tyrannosaurus Azteca seems to use some outtakes of the famous Sid & Marty Krofft series The Land of the Lost All that was needed was a few Sleestak. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this exhibit expedition that has not created the history books by any means, read the Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then try a straight face.
