In this time of incredible special effects, it was a painful disappointment. The actors seemed to be stiff and uninspired, just like the dialogue. Westerns are not as common in Hollywood these days, but movies like "Silverado" prove that someone out there still knows how to make a good one. With that in mind, it's hard to imagine anyone at the expense of tasting anything, let alone such a weak movie like this one. If you love and are looking for a good western, keep looking!
