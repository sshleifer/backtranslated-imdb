As a history nut who is particularly interested in this particular historical event, I was very disappointed with the movie. Granted, the costumes and productions were pretty authentic, but the Hollywood portrayal of this "British Little Big Horn" was really boring. <br /> <br /> The amount of footage devoted to marching or demonstrating troops must have been unprecedented in film history. Anytime I heard triumphant background music begin, I knew I needed to prepare for another tedious scene of meaningless pens. Obviously, the producers had invested a lot in "staging" and were determined to get their money's worth. Despite the outstanding cast their dialogue was boring again and their characters were never developed. Whenever Peter O'toole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene, I was disappointed. Her given lines were so weak and meaningless that I could hardly believe that they were the two great actors who represented Lawrence of Arabia and the birdman of Alcatraz. There are worse epics, but these are not much better
