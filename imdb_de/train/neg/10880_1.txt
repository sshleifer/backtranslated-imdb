This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have a big appetite for terrible (and good) movies. It would have (kind of) made a kind of youthful sense of humor, if it had always been crazy - like the ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really funny. Other films, such as PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, manage to be funny while they are (seemingly) trying to be serious. In terms of acting, it looks like they're collecting brain-dead teenagers and asking them to watch the entire production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was a decent interpretation - the older ghoul busting on the bike.
