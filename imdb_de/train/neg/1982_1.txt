Who? What? From where? When? Why? The acting was terrible. Very robot, rehearsed. I've seen all the actors in better roles in this movie. The script was very simple. At the end of this film, the plot was tied. And also Jeane Claude LaMarre should be tied up. So he never tries to write / direct another movie.
