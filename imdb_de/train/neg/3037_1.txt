It's one of those stereotypical MTV dance films, and I do not see where this "not so bad" garbage came from. The spectacle is terrible, it follows exactly the same action as all other "dance" films. It is terrible! The name should not scream. 'How she moves.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance films had half decent dance scenes, they do not even earn a clock. I give a 1 out of 10 just because there is no zero. I urge anyone with an IQ over 60 seriously not to see this and not to waste money. The 1.6 / 10 should say everything. This movie should not even have been made.
