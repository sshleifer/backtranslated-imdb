Phantasm .... class. Phantasm II ..... great. Phantasm III ..... er ..... terrible. <br /> <br /> Although I would like to stay for this film, I just can not. The movie seems to be "sold out". First bad signs occur when the video has trailers for other films in the beginning (something the others did not have). Also too many pointless characters, best examples of the kid (who's a crack shot, funny at first, but soon you want to see him dead), the woman who uses karate to fend off the balls (um, does not work or should not) and the blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, in the other phatasms there is no connection to it). There is also a serious shortage of dwarfs running around. <br /> <br /> The only good things are the start and of course Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (Possible SPOILERS coming up) <br /> For me, this movie seems like a filler to be between II and IV, as additional characters can stay at the end and continue with Head 4 in IV. <br /> <br /> Overall, very disappointing. 3.10
