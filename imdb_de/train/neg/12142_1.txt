Please, for the love of God, do not watch it. If I say that, I know what you think, it can not be that bad, right? If everyone says it as bad as he says, I have to watch it! Do not do it! It's like a terrible accident with little babies and a gasoline tanker! You will be scarred for life ... the picture will never leave you! I could only see it for half an hour before getting seriously ill. Acting is the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen Barbwire !!! If you risk to tear your eyes out and borrow this movie ... do not say I did not warn you! The cover and the story are a trap !! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the Dead was great! This movie has to be the same ... right? NO!! The writing = Mist Director = Trash act = There was no action. Still not convinced? Then your soul will be tormented forever !!!
