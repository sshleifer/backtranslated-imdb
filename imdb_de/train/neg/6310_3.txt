I saw this movie last night and was a bit disappointed. Many of the "time facts" were gone. At the beginning of the film, the grandfather made a comment to this grandson and his friends about how they felt when September 11 came. This film was to take place in 1994. In addition, one of the grandchildren wore an Eagles Donovan McNabb jersey. He had not even been drafted yet. The story was good, but the facts and the timeliness of the timeframe were so far from the basics that the film looked cheesy. My friend is an avid reader of World War II books and memorabilia. I rented this movie in the hope that it will be fine. The acting was so-so. The dog was cute. But the way this movie was performed made me happy that I only paid $ 4 for it, as opposed to the 50 I needed to see it in a theater. I hope everyone who reads this understands that I do not mean dissatisfaction to those who waged the war, but the facts and time frame should have been more closely monitored.
