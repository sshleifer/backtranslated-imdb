I'm a big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, but I could not believe he made this movie. I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag does not come close to the real Sholay. It leaves no lasting impression on the viewer. Ram Gopal Varma does not create chemistry between characters. There is no camaraderie between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant Raj). There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame. Noteworthy is the order outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal. Amitabh Bachchan should not have done this movie. Ajay and Sushmita Sen tried their best, but nothing. Rajpal Yadav's speech modulation - ineffective and rather meaningless. Mohanlal has shown full justice and has once again proven that actors are just facial expressions and body language. The rest of the cast was below expectations. The comedy situation inherited from the original Sholay scene falls flat in this movie. Ram Gopal Varma could have edited the script, but due to the controversy that surrounded the film, he failed it, and this was just for the sake of it, he made that Aag. But there is no fire.
