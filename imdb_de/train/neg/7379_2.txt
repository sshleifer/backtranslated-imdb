What did Steven Seagal think? I mean, I love Seagal. I love all his films until the mid-2000s. His early stuff is one of the best in the genre. However, this does not do justice to its excellent name. It is expected that Attack Force (with the protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) is a pointless action movie with Seagal in typical one-liner-ass form. But what we get is a crime mystery bordering on a political thriller that has little or nothing to do. Seagal is always in the shade because of its weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who mutate into superman when they take a drug. What happened in this movie? The synchronization of Seagal is a shame, a shame and a shame. Why dub the man? The story is terrible. This got me a 2/10 because of the scene where Seagal asks for help despite an army, and a fun fighting scene where Seagal waves his hands like a girl standing in front of the camera! "Revenge is a one-way street," Seagal says in this movie ... Well, forget about revenge Steven, you need salvation!
