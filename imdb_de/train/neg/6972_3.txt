When I first saw the cover of this movie (a huge mistake that chased a few nurses) and the name "Blue Monkey," I knew I would not see a big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this cheese-ball streak, who always does a good job in every role he tackles. Still not sure why this movie is called Blue Monkey, since this movie has nothing to do with monkeys Has. But come on, people, what did you expect? It's not really as bad as it seems ... If you enjoy the old 1950s-style black-and-white access movies, it's basically an updated version without the special FX updates
