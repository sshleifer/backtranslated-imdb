.... about the level of wit on which this comedy acts. As soon as the feature length reaches "Can I do it until I need glasses" is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can not believe it when you realize that this should be the punch line (example: the Santa Claus gag); Others are so long that you can not believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up this punchline (example: the student gag). And almost all are directed without any artistry. Do not get me wrong: About 1 in 10 jokes are actually fun (the iron / phone is probably my favorite). There is also some wonderful full-front nudity that proves that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best on this planet (there is also a weird male nudity). And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually damn catchy! But none of these reasons is enough to give this movie more than * of 4.
