The idea behind this movie was good. Too bad that it was not written well. The appointment of Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent was a good idea and he did an excellent job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one emotion in most of his films, anger. Kirstie Alley's character could have been great and even showed some possibilities, but the author really let us down by making her role mostly as a helpless woman. This was completely incompatible with the highly independent character she was supposed to be. I'm not interested in acting alone. The film should have ended about fifteen minutes earlier. The director milked the cow dry before the incredible final action. I will keep this in my collection only as an example of the performances of Poitier.
