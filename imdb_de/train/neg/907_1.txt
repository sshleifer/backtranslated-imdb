I wrote a review of this movie below, after I bought it on DVD and was disappointed. <br /> <br /> After reading some of the comments, I tried again. I am a film student and make similar films myself (ie no budget, taken with a digital camera) and stand by my original comments. This is a no-budget student project (and not very good) released on Video / DVD and looks like an award-winning movie (if you're reading the cover). To deceive the public, to think, is something that is not. I want to return my money under the trade description! Complete garbage!
