Cheezy action movie with Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a one-time military man who has retired to a teaching position. But the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have frustrated him and he decides he'll hang it up. It gets insane when some robbers in jail imprison a few students who take over the school as a base for a tank car raid. His dolph against the bad guys in the fight to the death. Jaw looked back at the late Grindhouse era exploitation films, in which bad guys were dressed as punk and some of the bad women had hair on their faces. What a stupid movie. I can not believe that people were made this way. This is an action movie that was probably doomed to failure even on a low budget. False outlier sets and a bad direction of action were a sparkle for a producer. Watch cars drive through the school late in the movie (do not ask), they plunge into the security tower (do not ask because it looks more like a prison than a high school) and destroy their barely constructed form (it does not look as in previous shots). What did the gods of the bad movies do? Actually, I'm baffled since Sydney directed J Furie (?), A really good director who made films like The Boys in Company C. Has his ability failed him, or was this hopeless from the start and he does not even bother? It's a turkey. Still an observable, but a turkey.
