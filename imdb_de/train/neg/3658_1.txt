Despite some thought-provoking curiosities and the curiosity value of the film, Fury of the Wolfman appears as a boring, uninteresting excursion into lycanthropy, saved only by the statuesque presence of horniness Perla Cristal. The rest of the players, including Hammy Naschy, are fully depreciated (though admittedly none are helped by vile dubbing). Although the script is in enough variations of werewolf / Frankenstein / dr. Moreau's motifs are packaged to filter out a dozen films, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterizations so weak and the dialogue so literally (at least in the English version) that everyone's latent interest in the turbulent process is soon lifted. <br/> <br /> Zabalza's direction is jerky, even amateurish. His staging is awkward and ineffective. Villasenor's over-illumination does not help. Even promising sets are so atmospherically photographed that the director's few attempts to scare the audience are signaled far in advance. Other credits fall into a similar pattern of insensitivity, though the overly emphatic music score and the ridiculously raw, totally primitive special effects deserve a special condemnation.
