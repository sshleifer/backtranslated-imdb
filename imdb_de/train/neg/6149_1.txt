I will devote some days to Ron Howard before I swear his work completely. Unfortunately, Howard has dealt with Lucas at such a young age and is now entangled in so many qualities of Lucas. How else do you explain how he was hit by disasters? His only useful movie was of course "Willow". Everything else, including this, relies too much on superficial garbage. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> He can not even have a half-intelligent focus like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard has so stuck to his Spielberg tee-off qualities that he's quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> Here's the old adage: "Love conquers everyone, even disease." It's a pity for Howard that Lynch has already mastered the entire subtext with more skill. Heck, even Disney has done better. Ron even jokes about the possibilities offered by imaginary realities. <br /> <br /> Howard's comment track is just awful. Do not even borrow the DVD. <br /> <br /> Final analysis = Cinematic Dud
