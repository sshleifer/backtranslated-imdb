I can only say that I am glad that I knitted socks while watching the movie, or I would be very angry because I wasted two hours of my life. The acting was terrible, the action was even worse. There were some scenes that were serious and that made my husband and me laugh. I highly recommend this movie to anyone creating their own version of MST3K.
