What are the people talking about here? I must have seen a different movie than you. I was so bored that I left the theater. What's wrong with this stuff. I only laughed once and not even so hard. Who lit this movie, should be brought to the street and beaten. Usually I always find something that I like in a movie, but that's crazy. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Teen Movie" look like a classic. It counts there with garbage like "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory" the worst of all times. AVOID ALL COST! I thought the studio would give people money if they left the theater as a token of their apology, but to my dismay this did not happen. Looks like I'll never see the money or the two hours again.
