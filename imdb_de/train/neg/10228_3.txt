To be honest, I had heard that this was pretty bad before I decided to look at it, but I'm never one that makes others influence my assessments, in fact I'm more likely to be out of defiance! Bullwhip had one thing to do before watching anyway, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes were in it immediately interested me. The picture is not very good and in fact very morally questionable, all characters are corrupt and immobile in a form or form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories. That's fine and good if the surrounding movie can do justice to a whole bunch of despicable people and create a tense, shocking image. Unfortunately, that's not the case, and since the finale fills your eyes with sugar, you can not scream that you've been cheated to watch a pretty bad movie, and no one in the cast is coming to extremes with a wooden credit. <br /> <br /> Not even the beautiful Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10
