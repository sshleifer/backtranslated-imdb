This kind of movie is old hat, right? The whole thing is a syrupy nostalgia, which is set in a kind of feedback loop on itself. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a good idea: a great ensemble cast, some good gags and a human drama about what you could have / could have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event that binds them all together, as in "The Big Chill," one of those seminal films that produced imitation films like this one. In the end, you want to see more of one or two specific people instead of getting involved. The superficiality that results is not only annoying, but crazy. The below-average script does not help.
