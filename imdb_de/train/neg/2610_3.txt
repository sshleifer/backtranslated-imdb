DALMATIANS [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous episode, and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a silly, cushioned storyline that's terrible because it's played by Glenn Close, who poses every scene as if it were play their own amusement and unbelievable borring and uninteresting lead actor. Once again, the dogs are the only "actors" who seem "real" and that's a stretch. Another wasted effort here. GRADE: D
