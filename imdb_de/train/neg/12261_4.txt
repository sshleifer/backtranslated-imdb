Normal Paint-by-Numbers pattern set filled with a series of routine plotter creatures from large creatures. It's like someone has a deck of cards with plot ideas from other films mixed and distributed. Whatever storylines and characters appeared in the deal were then thrown into the script. <br /> <br /> Characters are so clich√©d that after less than ten minutes you can play in the movie "Guess who ends up as monster food" and you're likely to get every single right. including the order that they are devoured. Many of the characters are so heinous that the creature forces them to silence them. Some of the main characters are: a billy idol clone surfing with sharks, a big mouth, bankroll flashes, a captain of Ahab with a vendetta, and Ahab's girlfriend dancing sloppy dances in a bar. Oh, and a big, big animal needs anger management therapy. <br /> <br /> On the way, people argue a lot, pretty girls walk around with wet t-shirts, couples make their way to exotic beaches, explosions emerge, ruins of a shrine appear, and pirates with greasy faces come by. <br /> <br /> Mostly amusing, but one thing bothered me: the mendacity of the characters when other people were killed. After a violent downfall, they make one-liners jokes. I could almost hear edge shots. All in all, OK, if you have 90 minutes to lose, and you want to laugh about such a bad, good movie. Otherwise, you may want to skip this one.
