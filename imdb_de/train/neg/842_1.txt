That's not Michael Madsen's fault, he was barely there. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and get bored, watch this movie. Words can not describe how idiotic it is. Sorry Michael. The cinematography was dark. All other actors are unknown. When you look at it feels like a gentle porn, but without nudity or hot scenes. This film had sexual overtones because it's about an underground S & M killer. The acting was bad, with the exception of Michael Madsen's roles. He looked as if he wanted to laugh. I hope he was well paid for this lousy movie. I would not be proud of that. It's not even a B-movie for cable, it's more like an F and should never be shown.
