Not really spoiler in my opinion, but I still wanted to cover myself. As executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore his character's numerous absurdities in 10 Items Or Less, a film with a deliberate indie feel, and simply get involved in the mentor / all-you-can-a topic his. He plays an alternate, half-rinsed version of the real Morgan Freeman, chauffeured from Brentwood to Carson, California, in an old Econovan to explore his next movie role. Why Carson is a mystery for So. Cal residents. He could have saved the trip, going back and forth all over the San Fernando Valley, finding the same elements. Paz Vega is a pretty magnet between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz. She plays an angry food checker on a large but slow local market, which seems to be the ultimate source for Moragn Freeman's research. His character is known only as "He" to point out that actors in real life are seen by average people - "Psst, that's 'he' etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted that he had all kinds of worldly wisdom advice however, did not have a reliable return to his home in Brentwood, did not carry cash or debit cards, or had the wisdom to carry a mobile phone, if someone has such a high opinion of himself that he believes he has an answer to it he, then, I have to see cash and a Blackberry showing intelligence and good survival instincts to get the big ego he definitely has in. Nothing really happens in this movie I do not think any of the main characters was essential by the encounter Changed with each other, it flirts with the idea of ​​adultery, but then flickers this thought, which for me resembled the shopgirl of Steve Martin, without the sexual affair, Selfish for Freeman and unconvincing to the public.
