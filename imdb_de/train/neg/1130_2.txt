Excessive drama that does not give a real point. So she became an actress - so what? She has learned to love - big deal. There is some eccentricity between the characters and in the dialogues and situations, but the kind that is bad for the film, which often makes it seem absurd. Summer Phoenix starring, speaking and behaving like a half-retarded person, there is no choice but to watch the movie about a backward girl who makes it into the world of the theater - which clearly is not the intended point was. We are told early (in this "Barry Lyndon" -like narrative) that she has learned to hide her emotions, which, of course, explains her autistic stony face, but the film suffers. She basically walks around like a zombie, and her success as an actress is not entirely believable given her lack of emotion. Occasionally, the film had the boring, sleepy feel of a Dogma 95 movie. Is it an I would not be surprised at all. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix is ​​the sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late River Phoenix.
