This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and boring. While Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself as a perfect and fair prosecutor (not to mention executing producer), the film never showed a defender or attempted to ask the audience with a genuinely meaningful debate about how a country could be led down such a terrible path become. <br /> <br /> Sure, nobody wants to defend the Nazis' point of view, but that was the point of the Nuremberg Trails! Four hours to shoot at the Nazis ... come on! That has already happened! <br /> <br /> I really think Alec Baldwin should just stay Kim Bassinger's husband. Immediately after the end of the film, TNT showed the 1959 Film Trail in Nuremberg. This movie is far superior.
