Wow, this movie was really crappy. I have heard that this film expresses the meaning of friendship very well. And with all the internet hype in this movie, I thought, what could go wrong? The movie was just bad. It was boring and the character development was never there. Space Travelers was also a horrible movie. If you did not like this movie, there is no way you will like it.
