If there was a weird, upturned Oscar Academy Festival, this movie would win everything. It has all the gods, great action, extreme special effects paired with extremely good acting skills and of course there is a celebrity superstar in every role. Well, this could be the scenario if the world were the other way around, but it is not. Instead, it's the worst horror movie ever made. Not just bad actors who seem to read the scripts of a dyslexic telegraphist, but also extremely few special effects. For example, the devil costume (which is a must, by the way) is some of the hottest thing I've ever seen. Whenever I saw this red and black monster on the screen, I could not hold back my laughter. And on top of that, it looked like the funny creature was being transported by a conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as me. When reviewing the IMDB that the film was released in 2003, there were fewer than five votes and thinking: - "Well, it's worth a try, can not be so bad." /> <br /> I will not even waste words in this movie anymore.
