The Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in impeccable print that fully lives up to all the merit he has as a movie. Unfortunately that does not say much. <br /> <br /> It has a competent cast of second-rate employees who are as well involved as they were in the circumstances. It is efficiently directed, exclusively on sound stages and standing sets on the studio back surface. It looks alright, but is difficult to manage and with just under 80 minutes it is still heavily padded. <br /> <br /> For example, the double cobra attack on the first of the GIs was certainly an attack too much. <br /> <br /> The business with Julia, who marries Pete, is never something. Tom instantly falls in love with Lisa and she never has a reason to be jealous of Julia (and not even she). Julia's 'female intuition' is introduced as if it would lead to an important conspiracy development, but it does not. Similarly, Pete's investigations into cobra cults and the suspicion that Tom falls for him serve nothing but to fill the screen time. <br /> <br /> These are just symptoms of the underlying problem. The film is structured like a puzzle, but it is not. Once the curse is pronounced, we know exactly where the story is going, so the characters painstakingly reveal what we already know. <br /> <br /> The end is especially lame. Julia is threatened by accident. Lisa has no reason to want to kill her - she happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom arrives just in time to save her, it's not even clear if she's ever been threatened. Then he simply removes the cobra in the way one of the previous victims might have done. <br /> <br /> It's such an insignificant little pipsqueak of a story that I wonder how it had been on earth the studio heads Then it occurred to me. Someone said, "These Val Lewton movies have been very successful at RKO, why do not we make such a movie?" The cult of the cobra is clearly modeled on the cat man: mysterious, troubled, woman who moves a form, falls in love with the hero, is apparently cold, kills people, arouses the suspicion of the hero's girlfriend and dies in the end. But "following the example" does not mean "as good as" - by far. It copies but does not understand what it copies. <br /> <br /> It's obviously being attempted for the understated, suggestive Lewton style, but this approach does not go down in history. Lisa is not an Irene. It should be strange and mysterious, but there is no secret about it. After the first attack in Asia we get a quick look at them. So recognize her when she turns up in New York. There is never any doubt about their purpose. There is also no uncertainty as to whether she actually turns into a snake. <br /> <br /> Then we will not get one, but two attempts at "buses" during their nightly patrol. None of them comes because the director does not understand what constitutes a "bus", and they definitely happen to the stalker, not the person being persecuted. <br /> <br /> These faint echoes of Cat People give you the cult of the cobra, no matter how small, but they only draw attention to the yawning gap between the original and the imitation. Plagiarism can be the most sincere form of flattery, but I doubt whether Lewton or Tourneur were particularly flattered when this lanker little passerby came out.
