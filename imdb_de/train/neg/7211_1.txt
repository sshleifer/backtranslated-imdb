I grew up with Inspector Gadget. It was and is one of my favorite cartoons, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history from the Field Trip of the Spin-Off Inspector Gadget. I wanted to get on a banana skin and become the greatest detective of all time. <br /> <br /> But the movie has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon. Matthew Broderick, an actor with potential, was definitely NOT the role for Inspector Gadget. The first thing in the movie is Inspector Gadget smart. Not so in the cartoon. In the film, Gadget mostly solves the puzzle himself. In the cartoon, it was almost always Penny, Brain and the great book (I still want her book!). If Gadget solved the puzzle, it was a coincidence. Gadget in the movie seems to be a competent detective, but in the cartoon it was pretty stupid where the humor came from. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it's too much "Good Guy v. Bad Guy". in the movie. It's not just a silly cartoon on Saturday morning. Besides, Gadget should never have a love story, but Disney Corporation is full of idiots. <br /> <br /> I also miss the true gadgets that Gadget had, and especially the gadget car. In the movie it was a fancy convertible. In the cartoon, it was a limousine police car and could turn into a van. It also had very few gadgets and was mainly there to take him from place to place. <br /> <br /> But if anything, the only thing that was horrible about the movie was that it was a movie. Inspector Gadget was a silly cartoon on Saturday morning. The movie was too serious, too over-the-top, too much action and not so funny. <br /> <br /> Tip for those who have not seen him yet: NEVER see. JE. Look at the cartoon, it's a true classic.
