I've been through hundreds of children's films in the past and I think that's one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I am annoyed these days that I have to explain this to my children Russia is not "the bad guys". Even the mocking Russian names like "Poopchev" are inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) The grandfather's birthday party scene featured a quasi-sexist joke in which he implied that men drink beer and women talk on the phone. Two other flies also unnecessarily use the word "crap" twice. <br /> <br /> 3) The whole movie smells mostly of the 50s stereotypes and propaganda that I thought we, as a nation, were proud to go over. All in all, it's just rough, badly animated, even worse written, and it's not worth wasting your time looking.
