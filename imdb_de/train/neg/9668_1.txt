1940. - A visit to the ghetto of Lodz in Nazi-occupied Poland, taken by a German cameraman with naive collaboration of the Jewish community, combined with archive material, excerpts from international newsreels and excerpts from related cultural films, the Jews of the world as cheats and parasites. This "documentary film" interprets Jewish life from the point of view of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. An open, cinematically unique expression of racial hatred. Personally, I find this movie scary and extremely insulting. One can only hope that such pictures never reach the screen again.
