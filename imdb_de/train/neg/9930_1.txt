A relentless, stupid and painlessly funny attempt to transplant the character of Sheriff Bart from Mel Brook's Blazing Saddles into his own weekly sitcom. This is really as bad as some people say it is! <br /> <br /> The laugh track serves only to remind the unused spectator what all in this supposed comedy is a joke and how desperate it is to be laughed! <br /> <br /> However, it is somewhat interesting to see Louis Gossett, Jr. trying to personify Cleavon Little. His embarrassment is evident in every scene. In the HBO movie El Diablo he was much funnier than in this cheese slice! <br /> <br /> Really the best and funniest thing about Black Beard is the name of his horse!
