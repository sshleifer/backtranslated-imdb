Whoa Nelly! I've heard a lot of mixed reviews for that ... but one of my hardcore horror reviewers found it really disappointing. Man he was right on the nose! This movie was played by pure amateurs. They had taken a take, maybe two in each scene, the movie looked so hectic. The script was also bad ... they had lines that tried to be unique, but failed. Miserably. "Take your Meathooks from me!" Oh man, I hate it when movies try to do that. This happens again and again with comedies ... but with a horror movie and with below-average actors ... the results are incredibly pathetic. The lines and scenarios were all very predictable. But what made me so negative about this movie was again the fucking actor. It was awful. Apart from the little Asian man who worked at the booth. I thought he was great. <br /> <br /> The film is about five stupid stupid tourists who are in Asia. They end up in the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia sex / slaughterhouse. Sounds like a cool story. But watching someone with bad diarrhea is probably more fun and more intense. The only reason this is considered a horror lies in the murder. There was no trace of tension. <br /> <br /> I like that many other horror fans would dare to get their damn little fingers into the thing. But with a huge capital U, the movie was unbelievably disappointing. I enjoyed the ankle break and blood effects. The floppy chicks were like that. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie screams amateur. This is the first length of Ryan Nicholson, which failed for the most part. There is no denying that he has a bad sense of humor and horror. I pray that his next movie will not be like another B horror movie ... unless he tells us it will be. Even after this disappointment, I'm ready to give Ryan another shot. From what I've seen from him, he's a true, dedicated man to the genre. Good luck next time because this was bad news.
