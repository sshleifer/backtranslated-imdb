Batman Mystery of the Batwoman is stale in one word. The plot assumes that a mysterious vigilante ("Batwoman") invades Batman's ground, and while Batman tries to fight a penguin / bane / Rupert Thorne-threesome, he tries to find out who the mysterious Batwoman is. <br /> <br /> Nothing is strikingly wrong about that, but there's nothing really special about it. <br /> <br /> Bruce had long since stopped seeing Mask of the Phantasm and fell in love with his head. Subzero was a significant event in the life of Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Even the movie Batman Beyond turns off, Return of the Joker, and he dug deep into the characters involved. <br /> <br /> But Mystery of the Batwoman had some minor subplots, a lot of formula that was crowned by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise ship. To be honest, this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight and lacks the punch and bite the Animated Series had in bloom.
