This movie was awful. At first, I just read the plot summary and it looked OK, so I looked at it. The spectacle was terrible. it was as if the actor were almost camera-shy. Everything seemed to be wrong. I feel bad for Edward Furlong, Terminator 2 was my favorite a couple of years ago. I've seen it at least 20 times ... <br /> <br /> The plot was crap too. The authors probably had a lack of sleep when they lined up the lines. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it's the good kind of bad movie. The movie you watch all the time, to see how bad it could be, so you can later tell other people how you could not believe how horrible the movie was, so that we could better appreciate other, real movies.
