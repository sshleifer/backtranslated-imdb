Oh what a condescending movie! The film is located in Los Angeles, the center of the universe from the POV of Hollywood filmmakers. He tries to be a deep social commentary on current American anxiety. Stereotypical, smarmy characters with very different socioeconomic backgrounds intersect in their everyday lives. The plot is disconnected and desperate. Numerous uninspired conspiracies keep the film going, including a car-shooting, an abandoned baby in the weeds, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a kid in a camp. <br /> <br /> And in all these events, the one constant is the generous help of sociological "insights" conveyed through dialogue as the characters compare their life experiences. One figure tells another: "When you sit down on the edge of this thing (the Grand Canyon), you realize what a joke we people are, these rocks make me laugh, I could tell it to myself and my worries really funny this Grand Canyon ". <br /> <br /> And another character points to the importance of the whole thing: "There is a gap in this country, an ever-increasing chasm between the people who have stuff and the people who create it as if that big hole had opened up in the ground, as big as the ... Grand Canyon, and what's pouring out ... is a rage, and rage produces violence ... ". <br /> <br /> Aside from the awfully unnatural and forced dialogue, aside from the flat, dingy characters, aside from the stupid plot, the tempo of the story is torturously slow. Acting is uninspired and superficial. The tone of the film is smug and self-satisfied, in contempt for the screenplay for viewers. <br /> <br /> This was a movie project that was endorsed by Hollywood suits pretending to be omnipotent gurus and looking down from above. They believe that their film will be a startling revelation to us who has no idea what the real meaning of social change is in America.
