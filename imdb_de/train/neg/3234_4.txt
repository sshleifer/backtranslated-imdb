Well, how do you rate a movie like this? Does it even have a cinematic value? It's a movie that tries to be as close as possible to a snuff movie. Basically, the whole movie is just a couple of guys torturing a young girl. Not very appealing and not really realistic. <br /> <br /> It's obvious that the movie wanted to be as realistic and shocking as possible. However, the film is just too fake to reach the goal. The beating and dulling looks soft and unreal and sounds too. They often only kick in the ground and not in the girl, obviously. Also, the way the girl reacts to all torments is pretty tame. I mean, if that was real, she would have screamed it. There is more moaning than screaming in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film obviously has a low budget and is a bold attempt to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provocative with very limited resources. I do not think this movie had much impact at the time it was released, even though it had to have done something good, as six episodes were released after that movie. Shock and Gore fans will most likely be disappointed by this film, though there are still some fetish people getting a kick out of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
