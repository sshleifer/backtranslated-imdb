"Indian Summer" is a sleeping boredom. Eight alumni campers are barely introduced when characters we know of do not get boring flashbacks. The good actors Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton are completely wasted in this movie. The observation of a camper that "everything seems so much smaller than I remember" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you squirm. The expected pranks are neither funny nor original, unless it is believed that Kurzbogen is a real "howler". This movie was a big disappointment given the great talent. "Indian Summer" did not make me sick. - MERK
