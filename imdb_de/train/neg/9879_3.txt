After watching the movie, I was really shocked to see such a high rating on IMDb. <br /> <br /> 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' is an adaptation of a popular children's classic that depicts the story of smooth, sleek film protagonist Mr. Fox (or 'Foxy') as he tries to make a 'last' Steal raid from the dreaded Boggins, Bunce and Bean. That's right, a short one, a fat one, a slim one or whatever. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where to start my review. <br /> <br /> Well, I 'I was in my late teens and never was a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his material well enough after reading a few of his books as a child and Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate factory over and over again. However, this film fights for an audience. Is it addressed to children? Adults I'm still unsure. Many of the "jokes" would endure a child, especially since Mr. Fox, for example, visits a lawyer or complains of being poor. It is also expected that an audience of (I assume) children will sympathize with a character who steals and kills chickens. I'm all for the food chain, but you practically see Mr. Fox biting his neck! That's a bit much? And also the plot ... well, somehow boring. I only stayed hoping it would get better, but instead I got more and more annoyed with Mr. Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> The sense of humor now coincides. I have only laughed once or twice, although I have purposefully detected joke attempts. I think the voice output is so incredibly flat and monotonous. The speakers have no sense of comic timing, but aim at the subtlety of humor that only works with certain media. George Clooney wants to portray Mr. Fox as charming and slim, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep shows no emotion, I did not know that Bill Murray had a role to play until the end, and Ash, twelve years in Fox, sounds like he's about 30 years old. <br /> <br /> I love him animation, especially stop-motion, but the visual style has actually sneaked me up a bit. Characters are tall, spindly and lack design warmth. They move very fluently and often the animation is jerky and weird. There is also a pronounced "mixed medium" as 2D components are added sporadically and unsuccessfully. Characters look directly into the camera and speak; it was very awkward. There were a moment or two when Kylie looked straight into the camera, did not move and whirled on his eyeballs. It really freaked me out. <br /> <br /> Fantastic, Mr. Fox had so much potential. Many people still seem to like it - look at the reviews. Maybe it just was not for me.
