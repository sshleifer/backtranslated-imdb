The 1973 TV remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First the good things. Lee J. Cobb makes a great Barton Keyes. Of course he's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, but he's the only reason to look at that. The only enhancement of this remake over the original is that it restricts the role of Lola Dietrichson, the stepdaughter of Femme Fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> And that's it for the good things too. <br /> <br /> There are many bad things. The director takes everything indifferently: If you see the film with subdued tone, you have the slightest impression that something very interesting happens. Due to the modern bad taste, the film must be colored and not black and white. Because of the bad taste of the 1970s, all sets are distractingly ugly. Especially the expensive apartment of Walter Neff is disgusting. <br /> <br /> The modern environment hurts in many small ways. Train travel was somewhat more unusual in the 1970s than it was in the 1940s, so Mr Dietrichson's decision to take a train seems more of an invention. Men no longer wore a hat, which prevented Walter from covering his brown hair while posing as the white-haired Mr. Dietrichson. Women in mourning had stopped wearing veils, which robbed Samantha Eggar of the support that Barbara Stanwyck made excellent use of in a key scene. (Oddly enough, Lola still has the line revealing that her stepmother tried on a black hat and veil before she needed it.) Stephen Bochco does much of Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler's script the same. However, he makes a lot of tiny, inexplicable changes to the dialogue, leaving the script a bit limp where it used to be lean and muscular. The famous motorcycle cop joke has abominably disappeared, but if you look closely, you'll see what a post-production cut looks like, where those lines should have been. Bochco may not be responsible. Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff. What made this version bearable is a really great Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead, we get Samantha Eggar, who looks like a standard lust of "Barnaby Jones". But who can blame Eggar? How could Barbara Stanwyck get on well with a director who is hardly interested in the action in front of the camera?
