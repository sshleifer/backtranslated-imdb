<br /> <br /> According to the reviewers, the year is 1955 and players are 20-year-old college kids who are about to enter the graduate school. Funny joke! <br /> <br /> 1955? The synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet, but it's on stage there. The Ford Pony Car has not been invented yet, but there is oldies music playing there. The synthesizer seemed to be a model from the mid-70s. The pony car is at best from the mid-1960s. <br /> <br /> 20 year old college kids? Josh Brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this film produced for the TV was produced. <br /> <br /> The storyline is so predictable that viewers have plenty of time to think about all the mistakes that occur on their televisions.
