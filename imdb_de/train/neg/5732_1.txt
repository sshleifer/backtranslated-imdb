I'm all for a "bad" horror movie, but that was just a bunch of dogs! How anyone can call this movie cool or decent is a mystery to me. If you prefer to edit the special effects, bad acting and a bad script, then do it! There was no tension and the Gore factor was ridiculous because it was so wrong. I'll take Hostel or Wolf Creek over this bunch every day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, she knows a stinker when she sees one. On the other hand, I sat stupidly throughout the movie, just to see if it got any better. No such luck! I did not film his other movie and I doubt I'll take care of it now.
