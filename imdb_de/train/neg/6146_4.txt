I will never know how this film escaped the wrath of MST3K. "Gymkata" is a ridiculous action film filled with paper thin plots, stupid characters and absurd situations (or is that empty?). But take it from me, if you like to see bad but stupid movies, you'll really enjoy "Gymkata". <br /> <br /> The action revolves around a gymnast who is a government agent (at least I think they were government agents to become a spy.) You see, his dad was another quasi-government agent involved in this game was missed in the contest, which is eloquently called "The Game." So the gymnast (bored by Kurt Thomas) practices to take part in this game and find out what happened to his lost father. <br /> <br / Okay, but it does not, but the bare-boned Sypnopsis does not begin to describe the pleasures of this movie, as they can be found in the film's curious details, like the gymnast's mysterious Asian girlfriend, who does not speak the first half hour of the movie, she suddenly starts to talk and does not remain silent for the rest of the time! Or the really hard, naked torso, who likes to see the non-existent rules of "The Game" pills and breaks whenever he pleases. And of course, the heroes of our hero are going crazy through the "Village of the Crazies" (apparently the real name of the place!). Nice place, but I would not want to live there. <br /> <br /> But where this movie really shines are the action scenes. Since our protagonist is a gymnast, the director considered it advisable to put gymnastic equipment in the back alleys and squares of the cities of the Middle East, so that our gymkata master would be better able to use his skills as a gymnast to defeat the scourge of the Fighting evil in parallel bars and pummel horses. It has to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing. A lot, I would say, about half of the cast dies from a shot with an arrow. Interesting because the arrows are the only credible effects or actions in the entire movie. If it was really about effects, this was my only big compliment to those who wounded these very realistic arrows. It was more likely that the movie did not pay any extras. Nevertheless, "Gymkata" deserves a look if you can see it without paying, and look for something stupid that is an easy target for riffing. <br /> <br />
