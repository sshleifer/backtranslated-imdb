Plot Synopsis: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria Tunnel, is murdered by his co-workers along with his wife. His twin sons Chad & Alex are separated. Twenty-five years on, Chad, a karate teacher in Los Angeles, and Alex, a Hong Kong-based smuggler, kill the murder of their parents and rightfully clean the tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sheldon Lettich have worked together, previously "Lionheart". This is also the first of three films in which Van Damme plays two roles ("Maximum Risk" and "Replicant" are the others). The plot is a very simplistic version of the revenge story. The sole redeeming feature of the film is Van Damme's performance as two very different people. the prissy rich kid & the rough - & - fall, a cigar - fucking tough guy. Van Damme does not do a particularly good job in both roles, although his attitude towards Alex is a bit amusing. It is puzzling that the brothers are mistakenly confused with each other. They wear different clothes and have different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung is a very worthy stooge for the bad guys.
