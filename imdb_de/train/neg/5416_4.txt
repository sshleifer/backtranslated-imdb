This was director of Stroheim's third attempt - it's pretty rough and does not show much of the extraordinary flair for the camera and cutting mastery that he would show a few years later with his masterpieces GREED and THE WEDDING March. Essentially, we have a trio of gardeners who disguised themselves as Russian count and two Russian princesses who rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use counterfeit money and win a fortune at the game tables. Part of this plan envisages the Graf (von Stroheim) entertaining and courting an American ambassador and his "foolish" wife, hoping to earn some money playing off their weaknesses. He makes the mistake of accepting also the lifesaver of the maid that he has promised to marry. When she sees them together, she lights the room (Stroheim and his prey are on the balcony of the room). Here Stroheim first establishes his person as "the man you like to hate". He is thoroughly bad and his weakness of character finally makes him a very bad and deserved end. The film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth watching if you are not fascinated by the director. There is a sweet piece - when he first tries to meet the ambassador's wife, she reads a book - we see the title - FOOLISH WIVES by Erich von Stroheim. Originally this was a 210-minute film that was reduced by the studio to 140 minutes and finally released at 70 minutes. Restoration of Kino Video recovers the surviving material (damaged in most scenes) from the earlier version, giving us 107 minutes of printing.
