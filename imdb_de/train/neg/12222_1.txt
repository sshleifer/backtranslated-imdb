(Honestly, Barbra, I know it's you who clicks "NO" on my review 22 times, how many people did you need to instruct to help out here?) You have nothing better to do, see you in the mirror all day?) Steven Spielberg told Barbra that this is "the best movie I've seen since 'Citizen Kane'". That says pretty much everything - and serves as a terrible warning! <br /> <br /> What are the ingredients for a safe fire and one that will thrill you without forgetting the tears of both laughter and pain? The ingredients: Barbra Streisand's face, a musical, feminism, Barbra Streisand's voice, Barbra Streisand's directing and an ultra-kitsch / idiotic premise. Hollywood is full of egomaniacs, that's what we know. In fact, almost everyone? by definition ?? Must be an egomaniac in Hollywood. Why would someone want to trade? For the "art"?!? Well, if you're stupid enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviews? And Streisand has the biggest ego of all! That's quite a performance. Surrounded by narcissistic cretins and yet able to beat them all? remarkable. <br /> <br /> The film, like all its "solo" efforts, is an ego journey straight from hell. Every scene in which Streisand is located is automatically ruined. Born dead. But as it was not enough, she sings a whole bunch of Streisandy songs. You know, the way that Mariah Carey's, Celine Dion's and Whitney Huston's made this world poison our precious airwaves for decades. She deserves not one but 100 South Park episodes to ridicule her. <br /> <br /> The premise that Streisand masquerades as a man to study to become a rabbi sounds like a crazy ZAZ comedy. Apart from being a clich√©, the obvious problem is that Streisand does not look like a woman and does not look like a man. I'm not even sure she's human. As she looks in this movie, so what? it can not be described in words. E.T. looks like a high school jock in comparison. She looks more alien than Michael Jackson in 2015. She looks awful. <br /> <br /> The songs. They made me shiver. Especially "Daddy, do you hear me like a mad female walrus in the heat?" and "Tomorrow Night, I prepare the sequel, YENTL 2: THE RETURN OF THE BITCH". <br /> <br /> Did you know that Streisand was considering a nose job early in her career, but changed her mind when she said her voice could change? Can you belive that? She should have done it! It would have been like killing two birds in one go. <br /> <br /> If you would like to read my biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, please contact me by e-mail. <br /> <br /> SHOULD BARBRA STREISAND FINALLY GO TO THE RETIREMENT? CLICK "YES" or "NO".
