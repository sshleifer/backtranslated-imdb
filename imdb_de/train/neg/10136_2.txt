Nobody likes this movie for the sake of it, but if you have a sense of humor and enjoy the best movies for their MST3 quality, then this is for you. It stands there with "Road House" for its absurd characters, sets and plot. The bad writing has really ripped me up: "I want you to dust off the boys" instead of "... dust the boys." F-14 start from the carrier, but when they are in formation, they are F-16! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal returns for the General, who only a few minutes earlier had overseen a covert train of thought on Seagal. Segal has no bullets and grabs a knife to kill the guards. Of course, the guards drop all their weapons and fight with knives! The hand grenade is a guy, but it explodes anyway. The little stealth fighter can fly all the way from California to Afghanistan without refueling. Then Segal flies back to California - the long way, d. H. About Europe - though there is an airline giving it 20 minutes away air support in the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the Carrier consists of 3 black PCs, 2 flat screen TVs and images of gauges and maps on the walls. What a scream!
