After the outstanding AANKHEN (2002), which was a remake of a Gujarati game, he comes with WAQT, which also looks like a stage play. <br /> <br /> In plays we have characters screaming and doing the same thing here too. <br /> <br /> The first half shows Amitabh, who jokes almost the 40+ Akshay Kumar, who seems too funny like a little one Nerd. <br /> <br /> The film has a good message on how not to spoil your son, but unfortunately the way Amitabh wants to blame Akki for being absolutely fake. <br /> <br /> Even his reason to hide his illness, his runes from the hospital and Akki's melodramatic speech is a deterrent. <br /> <br /> Some emotions touch you, but most are too over the top. <br /> <br /> Rajpal's comedy is funny, but too long in the second half. <br /> <br /> The direction of Vipul Shah is too exaggerated, although some scenes are good music okay, <br /> <br /> Among the actors Amitabh he exaggerates it in the first half, but is in emotional scenes outstanding. Akshay Kumar does his part well, but in some situations he looks too uncomfortable with pyc scenes. His chemistry with Bachchan is incomparable. Rajpal is a highlight. He makes you laugh without doing too much, and only his presence and his stupid behavior and humor are a riot So nothing to do, this is her last movie with Akki. Shefali is fantastic, though she looks too young for Bachchan
