This film seeks to highlight that criminals are a product of modern society. So can thieves, rapists and killers (the killer of this movie, Carl Panzram (James Woods, all three and worse)) be held accountable for their actions? An interesting idea, but very difficult to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way. And here comes Killer: A Journal of Murder falls very short. Although the film attempts to put Panzram's behavior in perspective with a look back on his violent youth and dysfunctional upbringing, the viewer never gets the idea that Panzram is more of a victim than a culprit. Sure, the system is corrupt, with a gangster occupying the entire infirmary at Leavenworth Prison (where most of the movie takes place), most prison guards are sadistic bullying and the prison warden is a megalomaniac. But why on earth does the new prison guard Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard) have so much sympathy for Panzram? Even after reading his cruel diaries? The film offers some explanations: Less is witnessing Panzram being beaten to pulp by the most sadistic (and stereotypical) guard, and he is impressed with Panzram's intelligence (though it is not clear why Lesser keeps this man so smart). Surely this is not enough to sympathize with a hostile man like Panzram, though this movie tends to downplay his crimes and highlight his personality? In the direction of Lesser, Panzram is quite loyal, and gives the viewer the impression that for Lesser, all outweighs the cruelty he has read about in Panzrams' diaries. Does this man Lesser have such small friends that he appreciates anyone who only seems to be close to him? Perhaps it is Lesser, a product of modern society, that judges more by appearance than substance. <br /> <br /> I can recommend Monster with Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci as a movie that covers about the same topics more integrity and scope. <br /> <br /> By the way: Killer looks like he was filmed for TV (not so good)
