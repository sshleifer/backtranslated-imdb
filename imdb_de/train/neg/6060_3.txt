There is this girl and she runs through the forest, but she ends up in the clinic of this woman and wants an abortion. Her dad is out in a van and he is angry about it. The entire episode takes place inside and outside this abortion clinic. I'm not really a pro-choice, but I wanted to choose to kill this episode. I laughed when I saw the baby coming out and cornered it. The part in which they made the ultra sound was also pretty funny. I am really sorry for the poor father in this episode. He just wanted to protect his daughter and I could not really blame him for what he did. I do not know what happened to him in the end or what happened to the other father and his daughter in the waiting room. I just laughed too much and I would suggest "pick me up" instead of watching this episode. It was not the worst episode, but it was not great.
