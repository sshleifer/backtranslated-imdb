The first episode set the bar pretty high, I thought. It played William Hurt as a hit man, who was commissioned to kill a toy maker. We get very little information about his character or who kills him for killing him. The episode is remarkable because it has no dialogue at all. When he returns to his modernist penthouse, he receives a toy soldier's package. This gives him a smile, but he dismisses it and does his business. But he has a hell night, the soldiers are alive and about to go to war, drive jeeps, shoot machine guns and bazookas and even fly helicopters! The special effects are good for a TV show, and it gets pretty tense as he flees with his mind through the flat to survive, sometimes the upper hand and sometimes not. I will not spoil the end, but suffice to say that it was a clever little twist. That gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the other episodes were all trash and I lost interest in the fourth. Stephen King adjustments are always a mixed mix and this is no exception
