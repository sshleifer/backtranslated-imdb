This movie was great when I saw it for the first time when it was called "Lost in Translation". But somehow, Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man, played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson became a shrunken Latino woman played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan, turned into Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence, which we enjoyed while translating, we get in 10 items a meaningless gossip, which is annoying. Instead of thoughtful and thoughtful characters like in translation, we get characters who give meaningless advice on issues they have no idea about. How can a character who wears hundreds of dollars of T-shirts and has never been in a Target department store give advice to a working-class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Do not think that stops him. If he does not give advice to her clothes, he tells her what to eat. The most annoying part of the movie was for me, as they were in a hurry to make an appointment, and yet the characters always find time to do another job, be it washing the car, stopping at Arby's, or just plain lying down from their 10 items or less lists of things they love and hate. I always wanted to yell at her and say, "Did not you say you have to be somewhere, what the hell does that do? One minute ago, you were practically late, now eat roast beef and ponder your life!" Until I saw this movie, I never really understood how something could "insist on itself," but I think this movie does just that, and wrongly. The dialogue makes the characters cheesy and unsympathetic, except that both actors were sorry they signed up for this project.
