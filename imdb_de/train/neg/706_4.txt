The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really did show a first-class performance and the girl who played his sister was really great and great. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can not say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm reading the vampire chronicles right now, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a bit too "real" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis' funny little Tiffs to slavery. Eartha Kitt was so scary and after her character did what she did, the film was ruined for me; I could hardly bear to see the rest of the show. (Sorry for the ambiguity, but I do not want to reveal anything.) Sorry, but it's just not my kind of show.
