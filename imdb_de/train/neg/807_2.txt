I did not expect much from this TV movie. You need to set the bar lower for each TBS movie with Antonio Sabato Jr. than you would for the midget limbo. Nevertheless, he managed to disappoint, even if it was a bad-bad movie. As if someone had cut scenes from a dozen films and television programs that dealt with great conspiracies in the script and inserted, he leaned back and said, "My job is done." It's all clich√©, everything predictable, and worse, the actors must be forced to act as if they're taking it seriously (even if the plot's plot is ridiculous). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Take a look at "The X-Files" if you fancy paranoia. You better deal with it. Let everyone know that sitting through "Fatal Error" is just that.
