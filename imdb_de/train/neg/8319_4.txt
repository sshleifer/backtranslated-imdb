Quite inconspicuous. The "twists" are all pretty predictable if you've seen movies in the last decade, and the few slightly interesting parts (where someone uses contextual hints to make a decision) are few and lacking in clout, since the "mystery exists" has already been shown before these notes are explained. <br /> <br /> (spoiler, sorta) <br /> <br /> The spectacle is decent enough. The story is just not very interesting. The whole "still awake" premise is saved by the astral projection material (no joke). <br /> <br /> The surgical scene is initially tense, a little uncomfortable, but then becomes completely banal. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, but not memorable. Terrence Howard's most uninteresting role so far, as far as I've seen. <br /> <br /> Boring, overall.
