I bet Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be prepared to perform. And big pussy? What the hell was that "Look at me, I'm a rat!" Double episode crap? All The Clich√© Mafia Joke COME ON! The big names just voted, had already received money for their charity and got a tailor made exit. Hmm ... This is not a reality, but a staged drama! Mark Burnett's other show "Survivor" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay staged his farewell, clearly ahead of his child's birth. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
