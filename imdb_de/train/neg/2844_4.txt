This is one of the worst movies Clark Gable has done. Only PARNELL was obviously worse. It's just so painfully clich√©d and the dialogue is so lousy that neither Gable nor Jean Harlow should have been proud of it. Gable is a heel whose illegal activities cause his girl to go slammer (as the gangster talked?). She hopes he will do the right thing, but he just leaves her there - nobody knows that she is "in the family way". At some point, the rogue returns to do the right thing, and somehow they tie it all to a happy ending! They seemed to have forgotten that Gable had to take the rap and spend several years in Hoosegow. Leonard Maltin says "the stars are best here". By what standard? Best in the production of unintentional giggles? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> PS - after I said that, my wife says Leonard Maltin will find me and kick my ass. Hmmm. Despite my comments, I think Mr. Maltin is the best reviewer and human in the world (I hope that calmed him down). <br /> <br /> UPDATE - 2/2/08. Since I did not like this movie the first time (especially the ridiculous ending), I decided to have a look at it again. Sometimes, when I watch a movie again, I like it a lot more and realize that I was a bit too hard. While this has been the case with several films in recent months, I still have not liked this movie - even the second time. Most of it was not the first half of the movie. In the first half, Harlow's character was amazingly stupid, but at least believable. But when she got to jail, it was all stereotypes until the last ridiculous marriage scene occurred. The conclusion is that this sequence is embarrassingly stupid - it just does not make sense and is like turning the movie into a crazy fairy tale, rather than a love story about two drawbacks. I stand by my original report (despite all "NOT HELPFUL") and think that apart from PARNELL and possibly POLLY AT THE CIRCUS, it could be the easiest Gable movie.
