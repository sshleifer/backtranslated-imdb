"The Fox and the Kid" is the new film by French director Luc Jacquet, who brought us the Oscar-winning documentary "March of the Penguins". The focus is on a young girl (wonderfully played by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and her blossoming friendship with a fox. <br /> <br /> There are some really fascinating moments here; Badgers are driving around, a lynx is chasing the fox through a snow-covered forest; A scene, in particular, when the fox is tormented by a pack of wolves, is very intense and sometimes even scary. There simply is not enough of it. <br /> <br /> Nice shot; the cinematography is dazzling. The bubbly look of the movie is wonderful. It is undeniably a very lush production. <br /> <br /> The English version is told by Kate Winslet, but the little dialogue that already exists here has been very badly dubbed. The score is also too fluffy or at least for my taste; and the script jumps while it's subtle, seemingly from one scenario to another, so I'm almost confused. <br /> <br /> There's a nice moral in the heart of the movie and Noël-Bruneau's rather quiet performance is nice, the true star is the fox. These captivating moments, focusing only on our furry little friend, are enormous. But there is not enough here too. <br /> <br /> - To stay up to date on the movie, including reviews, news, discussions and more, please visit www.mybluray.com. com.au
