.... CAUSE IT IS CRAP! The kind of movie that makes you want to beat the filmmaker and "WHY?" Accept. Terrible camera work ... Count how often the camera stays stable with a person and can not. The dialogue is ridiculous. The spectacle is funny. It seems they have taken over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie with the least possible money. I would bet $ 10 that they used home video cameras to do that. Either that or most of the cameramen were drunk. The trailers are really more entertaining than the movie. If you ever want to host a "worst movie party," bring it with you. Do you want more entertainment? Staring at a wall.
