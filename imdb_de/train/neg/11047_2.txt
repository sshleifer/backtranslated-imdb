There are two reasons why I did not give this movie a 1. One reason for this are some of the actors (like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) who tried to play on their normally good acting level. In many scenes, however, they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the cool idea and look of the cyborg, which is different from most of the other roles I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as possible. Boring scenes, useless and boring dialogues, bad script work. And it seemed like the first movie for many actors. It could have been an interesting story, but they failed completely.
