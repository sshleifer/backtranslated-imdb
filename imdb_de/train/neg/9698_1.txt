In Germany, there are now many talented filmmakers / actors. None of them is in contact with this "movie". <br /> <br /> Why do producers in the world actually invest money in such a thing? With the budget of this garbage you could have made 10 good films! It's not entertaining that seven adult men walk around as dwarfs pretending to be funny. The funny thing, however, is that the producer of the movie (who happens to be the oldest guy in the group) plays the YOUNG Dwarf. <br /> <br /> The film is full of moments when captions say, "You're supposed to laugh now!" It's hard to believe this crap should be a comedy. Many people actually got up and left the cinema after 30 minutes. I should have done the same instead of wasting my time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
