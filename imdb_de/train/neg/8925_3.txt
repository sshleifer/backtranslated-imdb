I've never really liked the Myra movie, and I appreciate how he came across the Hollywood cover back then. Surely Miss Welch's costume became an iconic image, though I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the movie and knew what it was about. <br /> <br /> I have been re-watching Myra on FMC for a few years and did not think that it had aged even better through the years. In the comic books of Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History there is a segment about it, in which it was recognized for the reputation of these big stars in a then unprecedented production. IMHO, however, the film is too bitter to be charming, too stupid to interfere, and is so busy shocking that he fails to inform, engage, or entertain.
