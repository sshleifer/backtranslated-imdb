And so continues the grandiose description of the Hollywood-style story. <br /> <br /> That was pointless ridiculous rubbish. <br /> <br /> It shocks me that so much money can be spent to produce what is the most scared, badly working, inaccurate movie I've ever seen. It is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage's short flirtation with serious acting seems to be over. I can only assume that Leaving Las Vegas was a mistake in an otherwise unimaginable movie. Diane Kruger proves that her appearance in Troy was no accident, she really can not act. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed to be interested in such trips. <br /> <br /> Only for those who are either recovering from a lobotomy or are recommended by an opinion that America has invented the world.
