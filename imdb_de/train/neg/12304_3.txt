I saw this movie sometime last week and had the biggest laugh I've had in a long time. The plot of the film is quite stupid and interwoven in a poorly crafted way. The only advantage you can find anywhere in the movie is the impressive abdominal muscles of Corey Savier. Alexandra Paul (I think that's her name) is appalling as the preacher's wife who has had depression in the past. Ted McKenzie is disgusting and his character is a moron. And as if the fact that you think she has sex with her son is not enough, they'll throw in unnecessary saxophone solos on every occasion! The end and the climax of this film are absolutely miserable and also ridiculous. I mean, who the hell wants to carry the kid of a cheater who tried to make you think he was your son and that you had an incestuous relationship with him!
