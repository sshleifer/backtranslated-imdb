As interesting as a sheet of cardboard, this expendable piece of time has little to offer. It is too verbose and spectacularly fails to evoke the tension and fear that the real characters must have felt as they dodged the fickle hand of justice of the French Revolution. Eric Rohmer at 82? It shows.
