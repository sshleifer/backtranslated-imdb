Follow-up to 1973, the much better "Cleopatra Jones", leads the statuesque black actress Tamara Dobson to her signature role as a chic, extremely hard narcotics agent conquering a heroin ring in Hong Kong. The mutual pollination of Blaxploitation-Action-Flick and Kung-Fu-B-Movie is fun at first, but eventually it is flagged. The shooting finale is straight off the assembly line, and Dobson himself seems less energetic than before (she's still sexy and gives her funny stilted dialogue a unique twist, but that environment may have been too much for her - she's dull). Stella Stevens plays villainy this time; She is good but can not compete with Shelley Winters in her predecessor. ** from ****
