Lady in Cement - PI parody with ole Blue Eyes.Frank Sinatra is a shamus on a houseboat in Miami in this rarely funny "comedy". Offended by an annoying and repetitive Hugo Montenegro score and a bunch of misleading punchlines, this 1968 movie never gets bawdy to make TV movie status on television. Dan Blocker is effectively in the role of Mike Mazurski / Ted De Corsia, and Raquel Welch should thank her personal trainer. The only thing that makes the DVD valuable is the collection of cheesy trailers for Welch films like Bandolero, Fantastic Voyage, Mother, Jugs & Speed ​​and Myra Breckinridge. Even if you see the DVD skipping the predictable movie and the trailer library in the specials. Apart from mysoginistic Sinatra lisps @ the gay owner of the local go-go bar. A relic that must be put back in the time capsule. D
