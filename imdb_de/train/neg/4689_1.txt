Really terrible movie by director Ted Tetzlaff. Decent enough-looking movie, but for a time bomb film that is completely tension-free. As someone here said, sleep goes through this one with its characteristic grin. There are some details in the area - Canadian ex-army or RAF, defused bombs in war, his wife leaves him - but none of these stories make any difference. The bomber itself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to blow up that mineshell? What time are we talking about here? WWII or postwar? I have adopted the latter, which makes the motive of the bomber even clearer. In general, just a horrible movie. There are many good time bomb flicks to skip these. Watch every episode of "Danger UXB" for a more exciting time, at about the same time.
