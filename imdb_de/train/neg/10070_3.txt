Roy Rogers plays the lead role as Jesse James and his looking player Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is the former buddy of Mr. Rogers, Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a remarkable team, as two reporters are searching for stories about the elusive outlaw heroes development, since Roger's essays a "dual role." Rogers is as always charming; However, there is nothing that increases this performance beyond the ordinary. Any potential for a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance is achieved through poor material. The better couple to see are Mrs. Storm and Mrs. Paye as reporters of the St. Louis Journal - they are the highlight of the movie. The songs are good but badly dubbed. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane - Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
