Well, I rented this movie and found out he really was shit. It's about this family with the stepmother and the same stupid fighting in the family, then comes the cool son with his stupid camera and he likes to photograph a damaged building and weird stuff and weird movies, and then he asks his daddy take it take him with you on a trip and just agree, etc etc ... you go to the city that nobody knows exists (bla bla bla). And the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and you still do not understand what this movie is !!!! I've seen a lot of mystery movies, but that was the worst, frankly, it has no description at all and I wish I had not seen it.
