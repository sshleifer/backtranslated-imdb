I've heard about this movie for many years and finally got the chance to see it. A massive murder of cheerleaders in 1963 and 1969 finally led to the closure of a cheerleader camp. Fast forward to 1982, and Bambi, a former student, opens it up with new recruits, including Candy, Glenn and Sandy. They are gradually murdered by the murderer until only one is left. Then we find out who did it and why. <br /> <br /> Also in the film, Tom Smothers as Canadian Mountie play a terrible accent and Paul Reubens his Pee-Wee Herman ticket. Overall, the plot is not very well developed and quite lame, but there are some fun scenes, the House of Bad Pies and the strip poker scene. The end seems like a jumble, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> Overall good for about ten to fifteen minutes in total, the rest can easily be gone through. Maybe on TV, but it's not worth buying.
