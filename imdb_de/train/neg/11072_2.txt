I saw it on TV last night. Yes, I can hear what you say about it. It is probably classified as one of these stereotype TV soap series. In all fairness, the plot has a fine twist, and you could nod and say, "Well, I did not expect that." But as a film, finding a redeeming element is not easy. Casting, drama, camerawork, cars, costume, setting, script, no, there is nothing to congratulate. Reviewed r ?? Oh, this scene. Did we need it? This is a movie you can watch and then forget that you even saw it. And what was the title again?
