This movie was recently released on DVD in the US and I finally got the chance to see this hard-to-find gem. There were even original theater predictions from other Italian horror classics like "SPASMO" and "BEYOND THE DARKNESS". Unfortunately, the previews were the best thing about this film. <br /> <br /> "ZOMBI 3" is bizarrely linked to the notorious Lucio Fulci "ZOMBIE" franchise, which began in 1979. Similar to "ZOMBIE", "ZOMBI 3" consists of a worn-out plot and a handful of extremely bad actors who barely keep this "horror" trash afloat, and the blood is almost nonexistent (unless you're afraid that people with green moss are running around on their faces), and the English dubbing is a notch embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The plot this time involves a sort of Covert military operation involving a group of incompetent scientists (ie an idiotic Man and his stupid female kick), who are developing a kind of chemical called "Death One" to revive the dead, and if my ears do not need to be checked I do not even remember a REASON for exploring "Death One" It seems to exist just to confuse the poor souls who have made the mistake of choosing themselves as "star" at this cinematic laughter festival. <br /> <br /> In any case, "Death One "experimenting on a corpse I swear, it looked like Yul Brynner), and after it was injected into his system, he sits upright and his head explodes! The sound effects are also quite funny - as the face of the body gushes with green slime, the sound of "paper crumbling" is heard. The toxin "Death One" is transported outside and "snatched" away by a group of thieves, who make up for it, but become infected after it has cut itself on an exposed ampule. Needless to say the guy turns into a zombie, but before he flies to a cheap motel in time, he infects a low porter and kills a maid by pushing his face into a bathroom mirror (!). The military is slowing down and taking immediate action before anyone unlucky enough to find themselves inside the "Contamination Zone" and turn the motel upside down. They find the infected thief and burn his body just so the smoke infects a flock of birds flying over the chimney (!). <br /> <br /> We rely on a group of men who are on vacation from the army and listening to "groovy music" that comes from a small dinky boom box as they chase after a sloppy girl's trailer load leaning out of the windows and showing their breasts. Can someone say "zombie food"? We also have a negotiation where a girl and her boyfriend drive a car to inspect a group of birds on the street ... the same birds that got infected by the zombie smoke! <br /> <br /> The birds attack the friend and the girl drives to an abandoned gas station to look for water. This is one of the hilarious moments in the movie. She walks around this old, dirty, rusty and obviously abandoned building, where she continues to ask aloud, "HELLO, ARE ANYONE HERE?" PLEASE I NEED SOME WATER! "She encounters a group of zombies, one chained to one wall (!) And the other swinging a machete." After a bit of rumbling and rolling around on the floor, she flees, but not before she runs the gas station with her In the meantime, the birds attack the hookers' trailer load and a girl gets pecked and infected, and they all move to the same motel where the original infection took place, and here After a few hours (at most one day), the same motel is now trapped in dust, grapevines everywhere, and looks like it's been sitting for years together - what's the best place to seek refuge, It is needless to say that the group breaks down as several people go out together to commit a zombie attack in an incredibly stupid situation The third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman exploring an abandoned village of which the woman commented: "THIS PLACE IS A DUMP!" Then she is taken in by a zombie pirahna (?) "pushed" contaminated water from a balcony where she has to bite her legs off and become a zombie within seconds! Meanwhile, her friend at the motel, who had previously pecked and infected HOURS, is still a zombie! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that make this film too stupid for words. For example, the time rate at which infected persons are "zombified" varies widely. Sometimes it takes seconds, sometimes it takes hours. Some zombies run, others pull their feet and walk very slowly. Some even make kung fu moves while others hide under haystacks to surprise people. Some of the zombies even speak! The funniest moment, of course, is the infamous 'zombie head in the fridge', which "rises" in the middle of the air and "attacks" a stupid man looking for food. Oddly enough, his girlfriend gets her throat ripped out of her "headless" counterpart (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment for me, however, was the lack of storylines in which the people involved were killed by zombies. We will never see them coming back as zombies, in fact we only see zombies being picked by the birds, and the only girl who can bite her legs off. Otherwise, at least I expected the couple killed in the kitchen and / or the guy killed on the bridge to come back as zombies. It's also amazing that these zombies take only a few bites and then move on to their next victim. <br /> <br /> The most memorable moment, of course, was the zombie fetus. An infected pregnant woman is lying on a bed in a hospital. A woman who seems to have a lot of 'medical knowledge' is trying to free the baby (!) And has her face pulled off by a zombie before her head is pushed into the woman's stomach where one hand slips out and she rips the rest of her face path. Timeless! <br /> <br /> As usual, all characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre. The megalomaniac military officer, the pathetic, pointless, screeching women screaming to get killed, the obvious characters to be killed (ie, the man who chases a chicken!) I think this movie is really a comedy. There were many ridiculous scenes, such as the shed blown up with a hand grenade (obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent) and a climate scene in which a man screams, "I AM DIRSTY .. DEIRSTY FOR YOUR BLOOD! ". The costumes are really bad - the same zombies keep cropping up in the movie, wearing the same "Asian-like" clothes as in a Bruce Lee movie, and watching out for the blue skirt of the 60s worn by the girl at the motel, when she and her friend meet the infected man. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie opens the door for the apocalyptic plot as usual. A radio DJ who tells the full movie proves to be a zombie and warns his listeners about the "beginning of the end" while the two survivors take off in a helicopter. Hardly "DAWN OF THE DEAD" material, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> No matter, this movie brings a lot of laughs. The Gore is minimal and what Gore gives it is not very convincing, let alone unimaginative. The usual mixture of black blood, thick green slime leaking from crying wounds, and "zombie make-up" of green moss. "ZOMBI 3" is a great choice for a sleep-over party or a night of beer and popcorn. Apart from that, horror fans should stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points
