I was really looking forward to seeing this because I love Danny Dyer and think that Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. Then it quickly jumps to the main action, ie they are attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer is severely beaten while Anderson is raped. They then decide to take revenge. Sounds good, right? It is not good. The story gets boring and is tracked down, and certain things get really funny. I will not give details, but things happen that I do not want to see myself. I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and I really wanted to have this one. It simply did not work. I give 3 out of 10 points, mainly for acting.
