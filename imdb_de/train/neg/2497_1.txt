There is only one problem with this website, you can not give a negative feedback. In addition, a comrade rated this as a D-grade movie. I say he was too nice. A piece of wood could be more emotional than the actors in this film, and the money used to produce this film could have been better used to trigger a fire. This is absolutely terrible, two hours of life that anyone who endures this untalented massacre will never get back. After five minutes, we and I wondered if the sinking of the heavy masses would make this more entertaining. Half a cartouche and a bottle later, I finally found out that some of these G-grades look strange at a distance. It's an insult on this planet that the director thought anyone could benefit. He should buy a rope. And the actors in this movie, I hope you were well paid to be in that joke because I doubt you'll ever work again. In summary, I can say that everyone in this movie is 100 big and 12 penalty points from your show license.
