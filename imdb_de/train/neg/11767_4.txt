I had high hopes because I like Tim Roth. I was not satisfied with this movie. I liked Ang Lee The Hulk a few years ago, so I thought it would be more of a bang. At first I was very disappointed with John Hurt here. He looks like his eyebrows have been reshaped for it. His performance did not convince. He was not as good as one would expect. Tim Roth is cool as always. The Gama thing did not really stick to the original story, I do not think so. I think the best part of the movie was the end. It had a cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not that long, but it got boring sometimes. I remember some time ago when Walmart had this film really cheap for sale, and I've always wondered why. Now I know. I was hoping to be blown away, but I was not.
