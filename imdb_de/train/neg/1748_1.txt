Do not waste your time with this movie. This is a total thrash in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack ... Some of the very good actors had such a waste of power. The film does not do justice to Paresh Rawal, who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, who is also an aspiring star, has done a pretty poor job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Are you calling the spectacle? I mean, he should thank God that he has a pretty face, otherwise he would win Razzie Awards in India if there were such awards in Bollywood. Asrani is a great talent, but exaggerates his piece as before. The script, of which a rip-off of the Boeing Boeing 1965 was not to mention was framed pretty bad. First of all, people in Bollywood just can not do anything original. Moreover, they do not even know how to copy well. The jokes in the movie were so exaggerated that it was painful to sit through them. Priyadarshan may be a star in the South, but he's just not fit to make a decent Hindi movie. The sound editing is amazingly shitty. I can go on like this, but the bottom line is that Bollywood should be ashamed of such a movie. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that some people seemed to love this movie. What's wrong with you? That's why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood produces more films every year than Hollywood, but most films abroad are unknown because films like this one are found here. I am an Indian and I am totally ashamed that Bollywood has produced this piece of Thrash. Films like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just great. They are world-class films that are timeless ... the best of the decade. However, Garam Masala is perhaps one of the worst of this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give 1 out of 10 points.
