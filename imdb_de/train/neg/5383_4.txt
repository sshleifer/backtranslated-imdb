I think I should start by saying that almost any style of work can be partially entertaining. The real test is whether it's good from start to finish, which is why I gave the analog title for this test. Most of us would agree - even those like me who like to read a lot of blogs - that blogs for various reasons are not comparable to good writing novels. Likewise, FEM can not be compared to good filmmaking for a variety of reasons, and I truly believe that this is a bad example of independent filmography. FEM feels like a composite vlog from start to finish. (Crap, even MySpace gets a little pimp.) If I wanted to see a lonely girl for an hour15 - I do not know - I'd take a look. Although FEM is a bit dirtier than the chewing gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media, it is so personal that it does not require an interesting story. It's like watching the tirelessness of life, which I think would most naturally be boring. And yet the creators of FEM want them to make a very postmodern movie about filmmaking. Cue my yawn. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm leaving and I do not care about everything. I am shocked that I am actually interested in even taking a break to write this review. It's not that FEM is really bad because it is not. There are a few moments when I smile or think that maybe something interesting is about to happen. It's more that it's just mediocre. I feel so indifferent that it almost suits an oxymoron: passionate indifference. <br /> <br /> I hope the creators / "actors" in the movie are getting out of their efforts. You will probably need it when one of them goes out and moves on with life. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have time to lose and do nothing that you want to do; Otherwise, hand it over and do not worry that you missed a great, undiscovered talent. You really do not have that.
