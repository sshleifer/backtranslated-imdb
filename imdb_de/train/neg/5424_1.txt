Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a full-length film. Why did I watch such films when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I was someone who punished me by watching one horrible movie after another. I do not know, I guess I needed a hobby in my youth. A teenager outsider (Rainbow Harvest) seeks comfort in an old mirror. Soon she learns of the terrible power that this antique mirror has, and uses it to take action against those who have wronged her. Movies like this, the force transmitter has an unpleasant side effect. This changes her from the inside out, whether she likes it or not. <br /> <br /> A mess of a movie that was restored to d.v.d for some reason. A few years ago. I do not know why. You should have left it on the shelf and collect dust. People love this movie for some reason. If so, I would like to know why. Until then I do not like this movie and I have no reason to ever look at it again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended at all.
