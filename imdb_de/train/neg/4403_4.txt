Whatever the virtues of the film, it is poorly researched. As others have pointed out, the film shows locals in Iran who speak Arabic, not Persian. That's enough to lose credibility to anyone with the least knowledge of the region or country. The landscape could not deviate from the actual one. <br /> <br /> Other factual errors: It is shown that a train is traveling in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan has no railways. The Turkish ambassador wears a fez (the red hat), while Fez was banned from Turkey for a long time against the background of the film. The daughter of the Turkish ambassador is actually dressed like an Indian, and in many scenes Indian classical music plays in the background. I suppose the filmmakers wanted to show an exotic woman, and Sari was what they had decided to make exotic.
