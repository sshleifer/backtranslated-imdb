This film is one of the most distorted depictions of history. This film is terribly inaccurate and does not honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and Indigenous slave laborers who have killed and tortured the sadistic Japanese. The bridge was to be built "over the bodies of the white," as the Japanese chief engineer noted. It is disgusting that such an indescribable horror, committed by the Japanese conquerors, is the source of a film in which the bridge itself is not nearly exactly tuned to the actual bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What about the survivors who still live today? They hate the movie and everything it's supposed to portray. Her friends were starved to death, tortured and murdered by cruel sadists. Those who have not died of dysentery, hunger, or disease are deeply hurt by the film, which makes their dark ages so bright.
