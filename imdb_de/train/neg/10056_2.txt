So ... we get extra material from Brando ... interesting, but not exactly Oscar-worthy stuff. Susannah York was hardly a problem. A new scene in which Lois finds out that Clark is Superman is unbelievable, as he does not notice that the weapon is empty bullets and no real bullets. Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then fell to the ground, but forget that ... let's hear how Donner mocks Lester's version, which would be more logical. The president says that the Zod "bleached" Washington's monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. The setting of this scene made this line quite absurd. Superman's "Press Freedom" sounded stupid compared to "..Care to Step Outside," which was better delivered and had a fitting connection to Clark's previous scene in Truckstop. Then there is the end with the effect of "turning the world back to go back in time". It has all turned back in the whole movie and you wondered exactly where exactly the rocket aimed for Hackensack, N.J., since Zod and society were no longer released.
