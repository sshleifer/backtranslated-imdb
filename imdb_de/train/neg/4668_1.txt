The potential movie extravaganza of the 19th century could not be produced. With well-known actors like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others, there was no reason the film failed. The film, however, came to an end, he had an apologetic apology for an action line and fell to pieces with his continuity. A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy brought together by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval has a touching side to the early death of a mother and an absent father. The father played by Finney is a disturbed man who tortures his daughter both in life and in death. He believes that his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune if she marries under her social status. The actors tried in vain to save the remaining parts of the plot. Washington Square is a black hole of destruction and destruction, wasting valuable time for those watching sadly. I give this movie a 1 instead of a 0, purely for the actors' attempts. Save yourself, stay away from Washington Square.
