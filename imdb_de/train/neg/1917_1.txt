Although not completely bad, this film should have been shot at the actual events. Grand Island, Nebraska, was devastated by no less than seven tornadoes on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located in the almost treeless, flat Platte River Valley in County Hall. The creators of this film were filmed in the hills of Ontario and moved the entire event to a non-existent town called Blainsworth. The inhabitants of Grand Island have bravely survived this terrible night, only to be forgotten by a bad movie.
