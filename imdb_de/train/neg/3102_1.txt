No matter how you look at this movie, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> If you take it as a horror, it's an unconventional movie in which the monsters are hand puppets. <br /> <br /> If you think of it as a comedy, you will find that most of the humor subsides and is only lame. <br /> <br /> If it's a romance, you'll wonder why a man would stay with such a B ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you look at it as an action, you can not really pull for the weepy hero. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this movie can not deliver anything entertaining. As mentioned earlier, the monsters are obvious puppets, and this movie was another attempt at a Gremlin movie. However, this has the worst-looking monsters in the genre. Critters looked pretty good, as did the ghoulies, and even the munchies' dolls looked better. The characters in this movie are extremely unlikely. The hero is a whiny guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a dreary friend who has a military friend and another who is a spaz. At one point in the movie, the hero and the military fight with Harken ... this movie is just stupid. I like the scene when they're in the dreaded club scum (which obviously is not a club, but rather a diner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them is 21. Give me a break, I'm 25 and I look younger than any of them.
