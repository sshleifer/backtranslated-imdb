You saw when Harry met with Sally and then this one. Not only will it make you hit your head on the table, because why can not you even make a good remake? They also annoy you with the so-called funny moments. The charm of the film is missing. Ranee looks awful. Saif tries to act like he's a fucking actor. The plots that were picked up from the original also do not work effectively. The part where both bring their friends and hit a note does not look appealing. What can be more catastrophic? You want to waste some money, you can get that. Otherwise, put on a few dollars and look at the original. It's too good to miss.
