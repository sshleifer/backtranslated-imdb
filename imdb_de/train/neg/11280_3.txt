This movie is about a man's life going awry. His business fails and he can not impregnate his wife despite repeated attempts. It just does not make sense. In fact, nothing makes sense in the movie. The story is told so badly that I just could not understand it. It's a shame because the sets and costumes are well made and visually stimulating enough. The recordings are well composed throughout the film. However, these redeeming functions can not compensate for the bad plot and bad storytelling. I am amazed at the big names who have agreed to participate in this film. It's such a waste of their talents. This movie is very bad. Avoid it !!
