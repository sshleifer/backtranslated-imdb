It's a ghost story. It is a cannibalistic story. It's a revenge story. It's a very bad movie with a lot of violence. I suppose it follows cheap every Slasher movie you've ever seen. It has the usual isolated place, the bold camper going into the wilderness. Granted, there are some pretty intense scenes. It's just so boring. Bad editing and the whole thing works. There are ghost children who sound as if they are talking in a trash. I'm not really sure what rules the spirits and the psycho with the seed cap go by. It also has the rough out scene, where a man eats a piece of meat, which is actually left of his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of voluntary, diseased violence. I'm afraid it's just another step in our desensitized evolution. Three is no wisdom, no tongue, just a sad waste of time. Much blood; small property
