I was angry that someone made this movie. I was even more angry when I lost precious minutes of my life sitting to look at it. I could have had a wax job and was more entertaining. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. I was a bit confused at first, but then I realized what was going on. By this time, the movie was already halfway done, and yes, I'm a Zauderer, but I always want to get through to the end. So I stuck it all out. The actors are not only not as attractive as in Cruel Intentions, they just do not convince. I saw my nephew cried more convincingly than the alleged lust that is portrayed on screen in this film. If you like bad movies with bad behavior, look at this.
