Of course, I did not forget "GI Jane". I was more or less forced to watch this movie in the house of my ex-girlfriends. <br/> <br/> GI Jane immediately loses her credibility by trying to convince the viewer that it may be a real scenario. The result is that the story is automatically tied to restrictions that Amount of humor (of which there are none) or entertaining action scenes is restricted and soon too serious. The film is therefore extremely boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> 'GI Jane' is failing where other action films are successful, especially as movies like James Bond, Dirty Harry and others are larger than life, but never in favor of being different. They are escapism and therefore entertaining. "GI Jane" tries to be real and fails. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing movie by Ridley Scott, with a very unreliable plot, understated acting and the only reason I give him 2/10 instead of 1/10 is something for the technical work ,
