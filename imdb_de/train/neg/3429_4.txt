I got a copy from the author of this movie on Soulseek. I have to say, it's pathetic and painful to see the two policemen, but I've seen the movie as a joke, and since it's a tribute to August's subway that I happened to see, it's more fantastic in my book Movie . Its quality and all that is pretty bad, but it's entertaining and something to talk about with friends. Reminds me of troma but good stuff. I recommend seeing this in two conditions, if you are bored and need a good laugh or high, otherwise just let it be. Recommended download for sure. o and the murders are pretty funny. Like when the zombie tears off the Satan's worshiper's tail and punches someone in the head with it.
