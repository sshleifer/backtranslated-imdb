There really is not much to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's harmless enough, but it's little more than a boring seventies movie. The movie is neither as smart nor as sexy as it wants to be. The storyline is a retread of the tired old casino robbery that was made to death. Apart from Las Vegas Lady, I believe the robbery was designed by a 3-year-old. The plan includes three women? The outside of the Circus Cicus building was scaled out unnecessarily and in plan view to pretend to be a waitress to blow her cover at the first opportunity. That's about it. Complicated, right? Apart from Stella Stevens and her already mentioned breasts, the other women involved in the conspiracy are not particularly memorable. Stuart Whitman, the Lady of Las Vegas. Unless he taunts Stevens, his involvement in the film is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun battles ever made on film. It has the 70s feel that I always enjoy, and some nice shots of Las Vegas around 1975. But the movie itself is too boring to score over 4/10. and that's probably overkill. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of perfect splitting.
