I do not particularly like remakes, or steal the modern jargon "retellings," but this movie really pulls me off. The original prom night, though not a masterpiece in my humble judgment, still became clear what it was ... horror. When creating a horror movie, there are a few simple things to keep in mind. Tension is crucial to maintain the interest of the public. Sorry folks, but a white ankle movie was not! The fears were cheap and terribly anticipated. (A good example of the fear that has been made into a stereotype excess, but the cat jumping out of the closet, soon after an unexpected appearance of the villain of the film. This film could not do it, so how could I expect There must be a sympathetic hero or a heroine, this film has no, the person I most identified with was the chief detective, his calm demeanor, but a balanced approach to escape a murderer was what should have more films of this sort. Common sense at the events that occur. (If you run out of an ax, the psychological causes, turn in the opposite direction. Do not jog while you look back every three seconds and progress of the killer, just to stumble over every branch and inanimate object on your way.) If your friend disappears, look Do not you alone? And if you suspect a suspicious game, tell someone, do not investigate. These stereotypes are tired and overplayed. In the horror genre in general and in this movie in particular.
