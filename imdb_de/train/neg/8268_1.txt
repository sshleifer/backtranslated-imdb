This movie is awful. Everything was done before. There is nothing original. I can not stand it if writers do not come up with their own plans. <br /> <br /> A girl wishes for her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, sounds like a movie in the 80s called Big. Even more annoying is the play by Jennifer Garner. She does not act like she's 13, she pretends to be stupid. <br /> <br /> From then on you can guess the whole story. She gets a good job and by chance, a friend she had at the age of 13 works with her. Wow, how cool! But no ... her friend is bad and turns against her and tries to get her job. But in the end she wins with a "great" idea. <br /> <br /> There's also a dance scene in the movie that I've seen a thousand times. <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
