I can say with no doubt that Going Overboard is the worst movie I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is a scarecrow as Schecky Moskowitz, a would-be comedian who works on a cruise ship. That's the story. <br /> <br /> That's it! Nothing else in the movie makes sense, it's like a mad man everywhere, not a crazy, nude weapon, but rather a frustrating way to kick both shoes in the direction. Even General Noriega appears for no reason that I can understand (it certainly was not for humor). Add Miss Australia, which has the worst Australian accent I've ever heard, and you have what I would not call the worst movie ever made, because overboarding is not even the basic definition of a movie fits. I highly recommend seeing this movie as it increases the reputation of any bad movie you ever see. First of all, I guarantee you will say after a bad movie, "At least it was not as bad as Going Overboard."
