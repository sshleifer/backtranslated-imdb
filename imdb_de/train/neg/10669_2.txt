An ensemble of uninteresting and unlikely characters revolves around a threadbare plot that could be interesting if you could only care. This "turning and turning", of which I speak, does not refer to the story (which contains all the suspense of a tuna casserole recipe), but to the director's inability to keep the faces of the characters centered in the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and a left ear. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the movie are the big names that convinced them. If you remember that this movie was never released in theaters despite the All-Star cast, you may be inclined to think something stinks. <br /> <br /> And it actually does.
