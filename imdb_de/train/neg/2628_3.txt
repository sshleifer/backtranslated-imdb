Director Sidney J. Furie has created a post-modern absurdist masterpiece in Hollow Point that challenges and constantly surprises audiences. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares to ask what happens to the tired traditional traditionalist paradigms of "conspiracy" and "characterization" as you remove the crutches of "motivation" and "reason." , <br /> <br /> The result makes me say that my opinion of him could not possibly be higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. <br /> <br /> P.S. Nothing in this film makes sense, law enforcement agents are absolutely unlikely and organized criminals are completely crazy.
