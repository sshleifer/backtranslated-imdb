When I was little, we were always babysitting and always rented a movie or watched a movie in the cinema. This is one of the movies we saw. This is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. I think it might even be a movie by Walt Disney Pictures! A Martian is dropped on the ground, transforms into a human being, befriends a human and tries hard to get home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the earth. The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors: Back to the Future's Christopher Lloyd as the Martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie , But otherwise it is total crap. Poor!
