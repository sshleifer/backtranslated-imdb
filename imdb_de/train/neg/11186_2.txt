I wanted to see this movie, but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to turn it off. Characters do not seem to respond to anything. Consider the following: Heath Ledger walks one night (through a graveyard, I believe) when he is attacked by ghosts he drives away. After leaving this ordeal behind, he quietly leaves and meets a friend who has seen everything. When asked what happens, he says mildly "attacked by demons, nothing serious." As if this was just a little more exciting than a flat tire. <br /> <br /> I'll turn it off if you want to ask something. a demon or something, I stopped worrying - a question. The answer can only be rented out by someone who has the energy of his death, and the priest looks in a vague annoyance when a man is hung up and hung up, and they confront his booming, dying body question br /> 0 by *** * Stars.
