Promise a lot and nothing more. An all-star cast, certainly by HK standards, but man oh man is this one stinker. No story That's fine, the action will make up for it like most HK action flicks. What? The action is terrible, trite and sparse? The releases of Dragon Dynasty are by and large great and generally considered a classic in Asian cinema. This is a mistake. They've managed to fight a few actors from Infernal Affairs, but they can not breathe life into an incoherent script. There are dialogue scenes in which two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between and no continuity in what the characters say. They almost feel like they're all running a monologue and just ignoring the other characters. Michael Biehn is really made of wood? Sammo Hung uses a stunt double? Under no circumstance. Yes, stay away.
