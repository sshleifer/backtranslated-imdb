I had high expectations for this film (the title is "How do we get rid of the others"). After all, the concept is grand: a near future in which the ruling elite has adopted the consequence of the constant verbal and legislative persecution of so-called freeloaders and the left wing of the right-wing government in general, and has decided to simply kill those who can not prove that they contribute something to the establishment (the establishment is called "common good", but actually means the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology). <br /> <br /> Very cool idea! Ideal for biting satire! Only this movie makes his chance completely. The satire only comes out in some scenes and performances of absurdity, but this satire is not maintained; it is neither spicy nor funny. And for an alleged comedy, the movie has virtually no funny scenes. I suppose the comedy should be in the absurdity of situations, but the situations are largely uncomfortable and overly serious, instead of provoking laughter or thinking. The script is full of serious mistakes in disposition. The action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do it. Instead, a lot of time is devoted to a young woman who has written the new laws for fun and who tries to save everyone by organizing a resistance that sends people to Africa. All this is secondary! A movie like this should not be so serious! It's a satire! A political statement. However, the problem that it is actually dealing with is not addressed. Maybe it was scared to go too far? How cowardly That's no art. It's not even a real satire. <br /> <br /> SÃ¸ren Pilmark, a very serious and meanwhile one of the absolutely older Danish actors, was very good. He largely contributed the low entertainment value that the film had. Everyone else: nothing special (well, maybe except Lene Poulsen, who delivered a compelling performance). <br /> <br /> In fact, a problem with most Danish films is that the language never sounds natural. Neither the wording nor the delivery. Why is it so hard to make it sound right? Why does it have to be stilted and artificial? I hope when people look at these films in fifty years, they do not think people in Danish society talked like that to each other. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points.
