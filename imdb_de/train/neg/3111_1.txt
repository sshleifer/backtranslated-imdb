I would have rated this movie with minus 10, but unfortunately it is not offered. I can not say why I did not go out in the first five minutes of this movie. I should have gone with my instinct and had to go immediately !! Some people in our theater did it and unfortunately I did not pursue them. <br /> <br /> The story did not have all the criteria for a movie. NO plot. Terrible Spectacle Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I may never see another movie in which he is. No single relationship in the story went beyond the conversation in the salon. I liked the Tazer scene. Too bad that it did not bring any flesh into the futility of the conspiracy. Someone has to beguile the writer and the director of this movie!
