I do not like this movie very much. If you have read the books of Puzo or have at least seen the first two films (especially the first) very closely, you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to the featured Corleone saga by Puzos Roman, the script of this film is sometimes even ridiculous. The characters and the relationships between them are distorted. The story ends nowhere, though it seems to go in one direction during the movie. <br /> <br /> It's understandable that different times are to be expected for the Corleone saga in the '90s, and that we would not do that to find things the way they were before. On the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other films if they did not fit. Why this? It sounds like those badly made sequels that are just trying to copy the qualities of the original movie. <br /> <br /> What will never be understood is the fact that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino joined forces. A man who has directed plays such as "Apocalypse Now" and "Godfather" must forgive almost everything he does in the cinema until his death. Al Pacino too, because he is the actor. But Mario Puzo should not have written that. From where? He damaged all his previous works. What a shame, my friend. The Puzo novel "The Last Don" is a 90-year story about the mob, and it's great. We can never tell the same thing about the conspiracy of Godfather III.
