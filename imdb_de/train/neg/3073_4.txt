On the back of the DVD box are Ellen Page stars in this movie. It does not even appear until two-thirds of the film is over and then in a minor role. I do not consider it as a supporting role, but rather as "something". The plot also contains many inexplicable elements. Some examples are: Why does the main character reject her eldest son? Why are your youngest son continuing on the train? He says it is for a "sucking" bet that explains nothing. Obviously, the scriptwriter does not know the definition of a sucker bet. This movie does not deserve the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and watch it for free on TV if you think it needs to be seen.
