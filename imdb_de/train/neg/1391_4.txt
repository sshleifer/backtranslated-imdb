Before this TV movie was shot, I had relatively low expectations. That's because it was made after the last episode of the series was aired and many originals of the series disappeared. There is no president Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, in the penultimate episode of the series, all the regulars except Zack, Vir, and Captain Lockley left the B-5 permanently. For this movie, they brought Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) to join Zack and the captain, and the doctor makes a short and irrelevant appearance. But because so much of the old chemistry is gone, this film is already severely handicapped. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen) who is led to Babylon 5 in search of a world full of Babylon 5 souls stolen from a hidden camp by an archaeologist (Ian McShane) were. There's a lot of scary hocus-pocus stuff, but honestly, it was all pretty stupid and pointless. Yes, yes, the station was nearly blown up, but it was saved and everything, but I felt it was a case "made there - and that has done a lot better in the past." <br /> <br /> The secondary conspiracy, which was more to facilitate the comic, was much more interesting when an entrepreneur installed a holo brothel and the commanders were not sure what to do about it and when they tried To force her to shut up, she was hit with a suit. That was fluff, but there were a few laughs - something that the other bleak conspiracy certainly lacked. By the way, Sheen did a good job first, as she played the Should Hunter - with his fierce eyes and bizarre delivery. During the entire episode, however, he always fell into the background. This should have been discovered and corrected. <br /> <br /> So the final verdict is that this only applies to total B-5 nuts (like me). Others who see it could assume that the series is shitty - which is a great injustice. This is a great example of a show that does not know when to stop.
