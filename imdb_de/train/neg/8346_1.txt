The title should have been the Wanderer. The guy spends 90% of the movie. He does not know what he wants or what he wants. Go through life and steal people's identity in vain. He gets no benefit, no money, nothing pretending to be another person. <br /> <br /> No body could understand why he pretended to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing In this movie, it was clear that he loved his father and was a good son. But the rest was crap. <br /> <br /> Maybe a director is a loser who wants to be someone else. But what he really should do is get a real job, because after his movie, I do not think he has a chance to work as a film producer.
