I'm doing that short and sweet ... this movie is shitty !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I looked at Part 1 today and thought it was one of the greatest movies of all time, there were 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought that part 2 and 3 were good sequels, I was wrong. This movie bored me to death and was so different from the first, he had continued the plot and that was it. It was like bad outtakes from part one or something. <br /> <br /> I love walking, but I have regretted it here. I was so happy that Glenn Danzig was in this movie, but do not blink that you will miss him. There was a full cast of crappy actors and people I do not like, like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he is one of the funniest people in the world. <br /> <br /> This movie makes you like the first a little less, so do not look at it because you think you owe it to yourself and you're a fan of Part 1. I'll wait a few days before seeing Part 3, and I pray it's better than this crap. <br /> <br /> The last scene of The Flash Movie was one of the nicest things ever shown in the movie. Fast forward or skip if you can not stand the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars - that was terrible!
