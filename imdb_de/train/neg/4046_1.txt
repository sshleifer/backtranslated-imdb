What an insult to the SA film industry! I have seen better SA movies. The comments I read about Hijack Stories are worth ten out of ten. That's pretty scary. The rating of a film should not be dependent on .., "OH, ONE FILM FROM A DEVELOPING COUNTRY". REPLACES YOUR INDUSTRY THROUGH NICE THINGS SAY ABOUT YOUR WORK. We have the know-how to make good films. Do not judge the movie industry for what people say about how great they are for Hijack Stories. We can tell great stories like Cry the Beloved Country and Shaka Zulu. Shout the beloved country I give 9 out of 10 points. Great director of Darryl, great acting by two great older actors, no matter where they are. Hijack Stories ..., I give 1 out of 10 points. Only people could be involved in the project who would receive high scores. I would have done the same if it was my movie.
