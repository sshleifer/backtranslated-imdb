I really must have caught another movie from the other commentators on this site, because at a screening of the movie last night, the audience was so humiliated by the dialogues that (let's joke a joke) halfway out there. As if the filmmaker believed he was approaching a daring new ground with a homosexual history of growing up, he takes up the David Lynch-inspired visuals with Fassbinder-inspired drama. The performances in this film are so boring and boring that I thought one of the actors would faint, how uninspired they seemed to be through the script. Worse, it's colored like a sequel to Miami Vice. I do not know who this director believes; Maybe he has surreal claims like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all of the aforementioned directors have a certain erudition that is painfully lacking here. I could understand the meaning of this movie about ten years ago, but if we have masterpieces like Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin, and Show Me Love, why should we care about this cinematic bastard? There is nothing new to see here.
