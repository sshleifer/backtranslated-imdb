I think Cliff Robertson was certainly one of our best actors. He has half a dozen classics. He makes it tough here, but the direction is so bad and the tempo is so tiring that it never goes off track. The story starts well, though I'm wondering how he could count on his wife hanging up. Nevertheless, he drinks well and carries things with him. The death blow is two-fold. If we took the time to move characters from one room to another or one part of the house to the other, that would cost about a third of the film. In addition, Robertson's character sits in bed in the blue light and looks confused, which may add another chunk. I agree with those who said that half an hour shorter would have turned into a pretty decent though insignificant film. The biggest weakness is just an intricate plot that leaves unbelievable questions when everything is said and done. I do not use spoilers, but when it ends, do not think too much. I can come up with ten what-ifs without breaking a sweat. It would have been better if it had remained a ghost story.
