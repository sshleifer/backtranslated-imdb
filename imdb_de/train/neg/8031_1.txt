The American Humane Association, the source of the well-known disclaimer "No animals were injured ..." (registered trademark of the AHA), began overseeing the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after blindfolding Das Horse had to jump from a cliff to his death to be shot in the movie Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the cruel act kills the entire entertainment aspect of this movie for me. I think you could say that the horse died at least not in vain, because it was the beginning of the public's growth, because the vile and terrible pains made animals responsible for the fame of filmmaking. If the poor beast had a choice, it would be surely not the way he would have taken!
