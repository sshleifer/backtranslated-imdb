I must admit that "Over Her Dead Body" was not as bad as I expected, my mom wanted to see it, so I rented it. I thought I just wanted to see the horror in front of my eyes, but actually that was not so bad. I was just expecting this terrible movie, but it seems the authors did not do any harm, but the casting of Eva Longoria (Parker, sorry), she seems a bit displeased for the movie. I think I might have found it a bit better without it, only it annoys me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the movie a bit likable. But you have to admit that this movie did not make sense, it was one of those quick paychecks for the kind of actor. The movie could have been funnier if someone had really paid attention to it and had a better cast. Henry had just lost his bride, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on her wedding day. When his sister brings him to a clairvoyant, Ashley, Henry falls for her, but Kate chases her from beyond the grave. Kate is jealous and does not want Henry to move so fast and she will make sure that Ashley does not get him by torturing her day and night with her raids. <br /> Over Her Dead Body is a good movie, not sure whether it's worth the money, but I would give him a rental car if you want to see it or are curious. Eva Longoria just does not have enough star power to make the movie work, no offense to those who love her, she just belongs on the small screen above the screen. Not to mention the character of Ashley, she still does not seem too sympathetic with anything she pulls, or her "gay" friend Dan, just again, not really likeable. Only with some rewrite and appropriate attention could this film have been better, but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy left with an empty feel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
