"It's not such a big mechanical toy," says one figure early on to "Jaws." Well, "Blood Surf" only wants an animal as convincing as the shark of the "Jaws" series. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are terrible. Acting and directing are not much better; they seem to be more suitable for a deodorant or a bubble gum commercial than for a horror movie. The attitude of the people who have worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but also for the audience. To say that you liked this movie encourages filmmakers to offer more of that crap, further destroying the bad horror genre. (* 1/2)
