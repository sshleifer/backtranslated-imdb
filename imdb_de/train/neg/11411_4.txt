The action was worked up several times; "a touch of life in a nursing home". Several plays, films, novels, short stories, poetry and news articles have struck the subject without end, but it's still a terrific platform for character studies brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely swamped with clich√©s (even the subtitle and the summary of Gideon's "simple wisdom" almost made me laugh in his ineffectiveness). Mostly indifferent drama is the last straw for this weak movie, but the rest is boring enough to make the lack of actors almost irrelevant.
