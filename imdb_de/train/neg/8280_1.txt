On this occasion, I mainly noticed the ad placement. DHL, Aquawhite Strips, Rockstar and more. It's one product placement after another. It's obvious how this film was financed. Jessica Simpson's "drama" is ridiculous. Every dick should never work because he plays the same lame character. The "story" is just a backdrop for this very long commercial. I can not believe that this movie was even considered for the theatrical release. The longer you watch this movie, the more embarrassing it is for everyone involved. The only small rescue operation is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who have almost no time on screen as Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed that I saw the whole thing. I would recommend avoiding this.
