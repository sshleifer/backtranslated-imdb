This is a movie that is bad in every possible way. Of course we would like to know what happened 12 years after the last movie and it works on a certain level. But the new characters are just not interesting. Baby Melody is terribly awful! While maintaining the logic that humans can not stay afloat forever, other basic physical logic is ignored. It's cool to have no cold weather clothing in the Arctic. I do not know why most of the comments here are more favorable for Return of Jafar, I thought this one is more horrible.
