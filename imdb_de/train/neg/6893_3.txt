I had high hopes in this movie. The theater monologue is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of many Belgian films, but this movie is bad. It is absolutely unbelievable that actors who are 34 suddenly play the role of a teenager. The "language games" were abominable and exaggerated. Nothing about the movie seemed to me to be real. The end was far too deus ex machina for me. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and think I wasted an hour and a half of my life.
