This is an interesting treatment of a topic that is quite controversial (just read the other comments on this movie). Apparently, you either love it or hate it and it seems like most people make that distinction based on whether they feel that the tribulations and end times will appear as they are portrayed in the movie made around $ 1.30. The production values ​​are right down there with "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and the drama is about the same level as "Glen or Glenda" (sorry to Ed Wood). Aside from the religious message, the story is as scary as it comes. Add even the slightest thought that the story could actually be near something that could happen in the future, and there will be even more frightening reasons why the tribulation happened than it did. "Left Behind" and "The Omega Code" tried to explain everything that "Thief" had done and to explain all policies and maneuvers in the Middle East that led to it. The net effect was that "Thief" did a much better job in the creepy part of the film, instead of spreading too thinly and explaining what was happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget the politics and watch this movie and its sequel to what they are - horror stories. That these are horror stories indirectly told by God makes them all the more formidable. If you think about the subject, it has done its job - even if you never believe it.
