WOW is all I can say if you read this or think about it. Trust me to see it! <br /> <br /> I've laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie that the worst drama ever made is so funny! I can not believe that they have superimposed the school sign! I have to play this scene over and over again just to laugh more and more. When such a film can be made, it gives us all hope to make our own films. Even the costume was bad. It looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done better. I bet he could write and act better. All I know is that I have to watch the second part, just to see if it was as bad as the first one. It's a cool idea of ​​a killer scarecrow, but it could have done much better work. hopefully another killer scarecrow movie will come out, just not like this one.
