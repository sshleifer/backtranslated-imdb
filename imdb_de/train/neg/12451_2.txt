This movie is funny, not good. The battles are terribly bad, and sometimes they try to shock you by breaking a few bones, and even that happens only two or three times, definitely not enough to call it a shock film. A shootout means that a hero can run into an open field with 10 people with Uzis shooting at him, shooting a weapon, shooting back, and not getting hurt. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, the guy who wakes up has lost his memory and starts fighting because he can. Five years later, memories come back, robs blablabla. <br /> <br /> It's not worth it if you are not drunk and bored.
