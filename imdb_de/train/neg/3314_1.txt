Reading all these positive reviews, I find myself amazed. How did so many enjoy what I thought was a sadly bad adaptation of my second favorite Jane Austen novel? There are many problems with the movie that have already been mentioned in some reviews. Simply put, it's a cluttered, exaggerated chintzy chaos from the opening credits to the slaughtered end. While many characters are cast incorrectly and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette show a performance The worst is Paltrow. I've enjoyed her performance in a few roles, but here she is disgusting - she's self-confident, nasal, slippery and totally independent of her characters and those around them. A most disappointing effort - though even a perfect Emma could not have saved this film.
