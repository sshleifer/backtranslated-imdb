This gritty movie has cult and one of those word of mouth features you just had to see. Perhaps hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwest Arkansas, Fouke, who knows that the legend is true. This story is told in a documentary narrated by Vern Stierman and filmed in actual locations to speak with the people involved. Legend changes with storytelling, but in the late '60s and most of the' 70s, the area around Fouke was visited by a Bigfoot-like creature that traveled along Boggy Creek. This elongated creature had three toes and was over three feet tall. It caused damage at regular intervals and scared the "bejeebers" from the majority of the community. Personally, I crossed the small Boggy Creek Bridge in 1974 and yes, the hair on my neck has risen. Of course it was about 1 o'clock in the morning in the rain. When I arrived in Shreveport, I laughed.
