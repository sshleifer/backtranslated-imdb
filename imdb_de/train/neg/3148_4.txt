Essentially, this is a story between man and nature. This movie features beautiful film footage, the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the movie never really gets going. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later pulled to the foreman of the plantation, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the influence of the deceased father of the owner Peter Finch, whose spirit distracts the Elephant Walk, which becomes a major conflict between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are determined to regain their traditional route to water, which was blocked when the manor house was erected opposite their roadblock. The beasts romp and provide the best moments in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some good moments as they struggled to remain a faithful wife despite marital problems with Finch.
