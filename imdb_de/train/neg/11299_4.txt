The Mummy's Tomb begins with a review of the events in The Mummy's Hand and then leads the story across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and mummy Kharis set out to practice chaos and revenge. who have violated the grave in the past. <br /> <br /> I absolutely loved "The Mummy" with Boris Karloff as Mummy Imhotep and "The Mummy's Hand" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is that) (direct prequel to this movie), I was not like that excited about "The Mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> It's done in a similar style as the previous movie and has a somewhat similar plot, albeit in a new environment. Lon Chaney Jr is okay as Kharis but does not really stand out. And I think that's my main criticism of this movie - that nothing really stands out. There is nothing really terrible here, but nothing really outstanding, so that the viewer has to do with a rather threadbare mummy story.
