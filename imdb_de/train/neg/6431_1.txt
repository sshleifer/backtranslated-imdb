This film is a terrible distortion of lies and exaggerations put together by the most shameless maniacs ever to work on a television movie. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this film that accurately portrays Senator McCarthy. It's just a dread scam, and I'm surprised that anyone connected to this production ever got another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists who wrote this trash did so to attack a man who was confirmed by history and whose fear that someone might destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist nut jobs Ronald Reagan took over the spot where McCarthy left off and they could not stop him, so the end of the Soviet Union and their cohorts They seek the truth about Sen. McCarthy. Read Ann Couler's book "Treason" for a better look at the truth about Sen. McCarthy. <br /> <br /> It will also be helpful if you visit http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
