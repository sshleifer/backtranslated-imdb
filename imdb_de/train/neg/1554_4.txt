Cannon has created a true visual beauty of a medieval epic that seems fascinating (except the dragon's prop). Well, why was it that the long-gone studio known for Chuck Norris movies was completely unrecognizable? A typical example: The amateurish theatrical and terrible conspiracy is a sign that a revival of the medieval legend is no cure for evil executions. They actually went on and made another cheap exploiter with hundreds of lustful Bimbos just to make that look even better. For the two "barbarian brothers", they certainly know how to make strange noises than to become brave warriors so strong and brave enough to save their homeland. This is the biggest waste of potential I've seen in a "budget" low-budget movie, and even worse enough to make an ax out of grace through the beautiful pressure. All this followed an ad campaign selling T-shirts based on THE BARBARIANS. Alone the movie is a great keepsake!
