Where should I start? I expected a certain amount of authenticity with the title of this movie, in the end I was completely disappointed. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, but it's a Hollywood story (or choose your shooting location) that is loosely based on some real characters. I should have had some idea when I heard a strong English accent that introduced the film in German; The blood-red text (title, artist) should be the second hint. The plot is invented (Lale was not tricked out of the Swiss parents of Rolf Liebermann, there is no information that Liebermann helped to smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song had been recorded outside the control of the Nazi regime, while the record was not under control was played at the station was picked up in Vienna, while a lieutenant was on vacation, etc. The costumes were bad and wrong for the time frames (SS uniforms that were used everywhere, from the border post to the staff positions from which these went off Daily use, as soon as the war started, etc.), the characters are stereotypes (SA bullies in a club, if they basically had no power) .Don't waste your time.
