You know that you are in trouble when, in the opening speech, you basically know who survives. From there it goes downhill. Unnecessary, "matrix"-influenced bullet-time camera work. Pointless cuts to video game material. Crunchy old captains and crazy sailors. Ravers who quickly become competent fighters. Even the zombies are boring. <br /> <br /> I had hoped to have at least one "so bad, good" zombie movie, but this one is "so bad that those involved in making it should be prevented from ever making a movie again ". <br /> <br />
