When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers that his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) has run off with his own brother, he rushes to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to unload his ordeal - only to find out that Norman has a secret lover : The proverbial Garson (Dennis Dugan.) Needless to say, Ben does not take it well and there are numerous complications - including Ben's attempt to bring Norman through homosexual relationships to a hooker (Tammy Dobson). Sorry this description The movie sounds much more entertaining than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Originally written for the theater by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... WHAT SHE? was an absolute disaster on the New York stage. To appreciate the piece, I actually saw it as a community theater staging in the '70s - and although no one would blame it for being anything but a flat farce, the performers played so broad and so gorgeous that it was quite amusing. It's a pity the actors in this movie did not do the same thing. <br /> <br /> This is a cruel movie. Red Foxx, one of the funniest comics of the twentieth century, is about as funny as yesterday's wash. Michael Warren (who later appeared in the television series HILL STREET BLUES with much better effects) competes with Foxx for who this may be worst performance, and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; To be honest, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson, and a Wayland Flowers cameo have a spark - and unfortunately that's only compared to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Not only is the film badly executed, it looks bad. Tradition has it that this was the first big screen to be shot on video, which was then transferred to celluloid for project purposes - and believe me, that shows it. The film looks like a bad sitcom from the 70s to the painted skyline that can be seen through the windows of Norman and Garson's apartment. <br /> <br /> Some films are so bad that they are funny, but NORMAN ... IS THAT YOU? is not one of them. I can summarize my reaction to this film in two words: do not miss it. Do not buy it, do not rent it, do not touch it with a five meter long pole. Just go back slowly and then how the hell run. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
