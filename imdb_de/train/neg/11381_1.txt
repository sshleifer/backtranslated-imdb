Now I like sci-fi cartoons. When "Robotboy" appeared in Canada in late 2006, I saw the premiere and was inevitably horrified. The characters are generic and stereotypical (do you really have to wear an African-American man wearing tiger-striped clothing and speaking in a Jamacian accent? WHY are all Asian characters alive and yellow and blinking?) Does the mother have big thighs and chest and complain all the time? ) to the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, rude and sometimes disturbing. Astro Boy is very similar to Astos Boy, even when it comes to stitches. Allow me to explain (dub names for the youth): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Konstantin / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay and so on. Similarities to "My Life as a Teenager Robot," "Star Wars," "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," "Kamen Riders," "Sailor Moon," and Co. are on the Line Not to mention the abundant racial / gender stereotyping. Do not even let me start with the allusions. I'm just saying that they are hidden and pretty dirty. But seriously. Do not even try to see this. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
