The best thing I can say about this movie is that he was sometimes mildly amused and a decent time murderer. Unfortunately, this movie is so annoying that I wanted to beat these characters. This is the kind of movie that is so sweet that it hurts your teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, but it becomes difficult when the dialogue is so disgusting. If the two leads are not together on the screen, this is not bad, but you are afraid of the frequent moments when the couple starts talking to each other.
