THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> When searching for a (Ghost Town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up a gray tramp hacker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories about carnivorous zombies allegedly haunting the area.

The 3D format is completely wasted here.
