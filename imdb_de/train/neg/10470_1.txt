What else is there to say? <br /> <br /> I read all reviews here and most are correct. , However, one person even went so far as to label this film evil, and Satan soiled him (or something in that direction). Angry?! Wow, what a shocker. , I mean, TBN made this movie. Please open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Anway, that was the lowest level of Propoghanda nonsense that has emerged in recent years. <br /> <br /> The most frightening thing about Omega Code is how much money you spent on it. If this movie can be made, there are no limits, and therefore we have no choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest loses the omega codes". <br /> <br /> For those of you who are interested in the biblical stories, the new movie will house dogma where omega code has not yet started.
