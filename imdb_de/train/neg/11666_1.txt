As gentle as I can, I sincerely believe that this film is a waste of time. I did not find it the 'warm, emotionally satisfying' movie that others did. I found it boring, with music that distracted from the movie. The story was thin, the characters oversubscribed and the direction pedestrians. <br /> <br /> Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now I will write more about this movie, so I'm doing the 10 line minimum. There's really no more to it and brevity is important, but IMDb has its minimums, so here. <br/> <br /> A young, eager child finds up-and-coming talent, looking for time with aging, embittered mentor despite his father's caricature of homophobia. The aging, bitter mentor proves to be very drinkable and teaches little. Conflict arises. Although I do not think this is a spoiler, I added the warning if anyone feels that so much information is too much. <br /> <br /> Mostly I found the movie boring and overbearing. A waste of my time. I honestly do not understand what a bit of excitement the transcendent quality of this movie seems to be, mainly on this website. I think it's really worth avoiding. But as Dennis Miller said, "Maybe I'm wrong."
