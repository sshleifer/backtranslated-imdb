I got this as an assignment for Trent Harris, who occasionally teaches in the U of U film department. I think this is the only way to get someone to watch his movie ... <br /> <br /> The documentary pulled out at the beginning. Yes, the kid is a nut job from where, but that's not good enough to keep it interesting. <br /> <br /> To see Sean Penn disguised as ONJ is the only highlight ... and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor. <br /> <br /> When Crispin addresses Glover Larry, storytelling was better, but I just could not take it anymore ...
