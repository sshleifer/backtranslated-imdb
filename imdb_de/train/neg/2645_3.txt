The final pairing of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete dropout. The script is weak and was presented poorly. The movie just has no life. Eddy and MacDonald would have better just made a filmed concert for their finale There's nothing wrong with their singing, it's just everything else in this turkey overcooking.
