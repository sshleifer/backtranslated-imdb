"The Seventh Sign" borrows much from "Rosemary's Baby" and "the Omen" (it actually mingles the two stories). Even the title is reminiscent of Bergman's "seventh seal". <br /> <br /> It starts well enough with all the omens scattered all over the earth and, in parallel, a seemingly unequivocal conspiracy in which Moore's husband tries to kill a poor boy (his parents, his brothers and sisters) Sister's were killed) to save from the death penalty At that time, both Christian and Jewish religions are called to salvation (even the wandering Jew is involved), which sometimes makes the lines unintentionally funny (Have you ever been to Sunday school? taught me that God was love!). The Best Scene IMHO, is the brief dialogue between Priest John Heard - who apparently does not take things seriously, too bad he did not play a more important role because his relaxed acting is priceless - and the young Jews. <br /> <Demi Moore probably had the same desire as ex-husband Bruce Willis: saving the world. She does not save the movie for all this.
