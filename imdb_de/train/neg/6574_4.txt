(Avast, slight spoilers in front of me) I received this volume from my local library, which keeps a copy for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> I was once in the city of Matewan, West Virginia, and in a small museum I saw the schedule for the Citra City Theater in May 1954. The movies would change every day in the theater. Since there would be no television in these areas for about a decade, this was a big part of the available entertainment in the city. "The Raid" seems to have been made in the 1950s for cities like Matewan. Although it was not listed for this month, I was sure it was shown on a Monday or Tuesday night to an audience that was probably not too demanding. The historic raid - daring and remarkably successful - did not seem to have been very well researched, so the movie is full of Hollywood ornaments, including a loose cannon played by Lee Marvin. Marvin takes the opportunity to be Liberty Valance. St Albans appeared to have more Yankee soldiers on the road than Washington, DC, than Washington D.C. <br /> <br /> What really made me giggle was when the robbers changed into their Confederate uniforms. Only in weak Civil War paintings do the rebel uniforms look so flawless. When Anne Bancroft's son caught Van Heflin in his uniform just before the raid, I expected the boy to think it was Halloween. <br /> <br /> And then there's Anne Bancroft. While watching the movie, I looked at the IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft. The former studio contract actress does not look that way anymore in her later films and has no presence in "The Miracle Worker", "Agnes of God" and of course "The Graduate". <br /> <br /> Worth seeing if only 1). They live in St. Albans and 2). You have a few hours to kill a Hollywood fiction of your hometown's biggest news.
