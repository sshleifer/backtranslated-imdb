Oh God, I must have seen this when I was only eleven or twelve years old (do not ask how) I may have been young, but I was not stupid. Everyone could see that this is a bad movie, evil, gross, careless and very stupid. I've seen more impressive effects in Disneyland, I've seen better performances in a school game, and I've seen more convincing crocodiles in the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water and ignore the kids knocking on the glass /> <br /> The story takes place in Northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people are trying out new water sports and surfing in shark-filled waters. It quickly becomes clear that something more dangerous is in the water. After learning, they get the help of a middle-class fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge his family's food. I think I've seen every crocodile film made in the last movie fifteen years, of which Lake Placid is the best, and the worst of it is its sequel. Blood Surf would be the second worst Croc band, I think, with Primeval and Crocodile just behind. <br /> <br /> The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures on the market and has more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. However, films like Blood Surf not only ruin the cruel image of such a creature, but also one and a half hours of the viewer's life. Avoid Blood Surf unless you really want to see it.
