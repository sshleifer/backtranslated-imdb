What's the use of creating sequels that have no relevance to the original film? No point. Because of this, the prom night sequels are so awfully bad. <br /> <br /> The original movie was a group of children who hid a dark secret that would eventually kill them all in a brutal revenge. Can someone please explain to me what a dead queen from the tomb of Stahl der Krone has to do with the first movie? Prom Night 2 had uninterrupted storylines that kept asking the audience how it happened and why. But in the end, one could say that it is one of those films that are so bad that you end up laughing yourself.
