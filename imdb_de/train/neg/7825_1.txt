I think this movie is a fitting homage to the first Superman movie because it is as gruff and painfully long as the original. After an opening scene, which consists exclusively of murky intergalactic images, the credits are paid homage to the downright unfriendly-looking futuristic, fat credits of the original Superman movie. <br /> <br /> Then there is something darker stuff. Ma Kent sees a grim ruckus on the farm and spends much of my life walking slowly to some debris in the cornfield. Then Superman stalks her and faints. <br /> <br /> Next, we meet with Lex Luthor in a scene about many grim close-ups of an old lady as she dies. We do not see the face of Luthor until the end of the scene, an early instance of the film, not to mislead a stone. Lex Luthor is a guy who does not like Superman because he's not human. He also probably does not like people, as the film occasionally involves a kind of conspiracy over Lex Luthor, who wants to kill most of the earth's population. After a while, Clark Kent returns to his old job (I forgot to mention he was on a five-year journey where nothing happened). Then he learns that Lois Lane has an illegitimate child and is with Cyclops. It annoys him so much that he loses control of his superpower to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame. <br /> <br /> At this point we see that Miss Lane is in a kind of jet that is connected to some kind of space shuttle. It's a kind of important event because it's on TV. Then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event. There are also people watching TV and there are pilots in the cockpit. The film then reminds us that these people cut in between them during most of the summer. <br /> <br /> When the events started before the inevitable disaster, I decided to get a lemonade. I accidentally went back to the wrong theater and saw the film about Al Gore with slides in its entirety. I tried to find back to Superman Returns, but somehow I hiked to Prairie Home Companion, which I saw twice in a row. Then it was time to stop, to turn around. <br /> <br /> I went back to the first theater, found my seat and saw that the impending catastrophe of Space Shuttle Lois Lane was almost in front of us. Still, it seemed to take forever, so I wandered around in the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son, and sent him to college. When I was studying at my son's medical school, it occurred to me that I should probably check in to Superman Returns. So I apologized and ran back to the theater just to find out there was no need to hurry. It took about half an hour before the Space Shuttle Lane went awry. When they did that, Superman rescued everyone, which was pretty cool. <br /> <br />. And then there is a subplot where Superman really gets scary and follows Lois Lane and her family with his x-ray vision and super-hearing. Then he tries to get her to cheat on Cyclops, who seems like a good guy. In the meantime, Lex Luthor is involved in a contest in which every possible generic villain is presented before the end of the movie. I forgot to bring my scorecard home (they give you one at the door), but I think he has scored almost one hundred percent. I hope he wins the millions of dollars. <br /> <br /> At this point, things are getting ready for the big sinister finale. I think maybe the projector was broken because the movie seemed to be in a loop for a while. I remember how we saw how sombre things grew out of the water, Superman got sick, Superman got better, back to the gloomy things, he's sick again, no waiting, he's fine. Villain move: yell at his girlfriend a bit. <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was over, so I left. <br /> <br /> Ninety years later, the nursing home where I lived felt a bit cold. I realized that I had left my sweatshirt in the theater, and went pick it up. When I did that, I was a little surprised that Superman Returns was not over yet. I tried to ask some viewers what I missed, but most of them were now skeletons with long gray beards. I sat in my old seat and watched as Lois Lane poked around in her house for a while. Then Superman appeared and began to quote the beginning of the movie, and since I had already seen that part, I thought it was okay to leave. <br /> <br /> So that's my review of Superman Returns. <br /> <Oh, even if you joke about people eating dogs, or jokes about having a dog eat another dog, you'll love this movie. That's why there are two such jokes in it.
