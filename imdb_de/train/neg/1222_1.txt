This is a seriously disturbed movie. Although the boys earned some of what they got ... the sadistic cruel executions were "a little over the top." The only character who showed some conscience at the start of the hunt was killed before he could offer some help to the sad plan. <br /> <br /> However, this was just a trick to lure the viewer into a false sense of security with the joy of coming. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved the movie for me would be if Jack Nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled, "and where is the Batman?". Kim Basinger could have screamed. <br /> <br /> Well, that would have been cool!
