One of Scorsese's worst. An average thriller; The only thing to recommend is De Niro, who plays psycho. The finale is typical of this genre, d. H. Exaggerated, with another almost invincible villain immune to pain. I did not like the original of the 60s, and this version was not an improvement. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time with a remake. Considering how bad his last movies were (referring to his boring Buddhist film and all the others with his new favorite actress, blonde girl Di Caprio), this is not all that bad in comparison. And considering that Spielberg wanted to do the remake ... it could have been a lot worse.
