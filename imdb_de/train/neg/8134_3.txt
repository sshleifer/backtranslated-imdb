A man awakens from a nightmare of bats. He and his wife go to the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon. He seems to hear a strange noise, and the sight of a bat creeping over her picnic blanket bothers her. He wants to do a high altitude tour, which has something to do with his work, but she wants to enjoy her honeymoon. She gives way. They go on tour, but leave the group to understand it. It falls down a slope where it is disturbed by insects. He follows her. He hears the strange noise again and seems to know that a bat is approaching; you do and get her hair. He struggles against her and attacks him, biting his forehead. <br /> <br /> You get out of the cave, but when you're in a gondola in a ski resort, it starts with seizures that it's experiencing. Hallucinations or visions of bats attacking humans. He gets angry when that happens. He can not drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife is worried about rabies and he starts a Pasteur treatment, but reacts violently to the injection. <br /> <br /> And then some people are killed. We see parts of the transformation of the man into a bat person. It seems that it is not just in his head. Whether the bite of the bats causes these transformations is not clear, as he already had some symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> Even if the title seems inappropriate, it means in the end that the same thing happens Another person. Not a very good movie, but I liked the variety of desert, cave and ski slopes and some of the weird scenes. I did not find that as bad as other people, and I did not think that the 1999 movie Bats was as bad as others think (I rated the movie as 5/10).
