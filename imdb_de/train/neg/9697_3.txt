I saw the first dwarf movie and sometimes I had little fun watching it. There are many famous TV / comedy performers who appear in the first part and present in fantasy costumes typical little episodes of their stand-up program, and that is exactly the problem the second movie is struggling with. Everything was already there .... nothing new to get. You are familiar with most of the often boring and stupid jokes, and you always feel that your goal was to use every Comedylooser of the last decade who wants to get back on the stage. There is nothing important in the story: typical fairytale story of Rumpelstiltskin, without meaning. I was expecting something like that, but I can not complain about that. I'm actually complaining about the lazy historians who had a whole backstory; Their only business was to get a lot of jokes and parodies, but they did not understand it anyway. This crap is a total waste of time and money besides Helge Schneider's great performance. (If you do not like it, then remove 2 points from my rating.) If you want to save your money and make bad jokes, watch the crap every Friday night for free on SAT1 or RTL. I am sure you will recognize some "laughs" I saw last night in the cinema.
