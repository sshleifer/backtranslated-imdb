I will not go and give them my 10 dollars. I bought the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my kids enjoy it and can see it without having to worry about what they see. I have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather see the original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a terrible daisy. She thinks she looks more like a slut than a daisy. These shorts might as well not wear them. And since when did American Pie have anything to do with the Dukes SHAME ON because they put this nasty line about having sex with a car? That would have received a rating of R in itself. The only good thing that could come of it is a reunification film with the originals. Let us all hope. The people who saw and saw the movie will see what it should look like
