Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly widower when his wife dies. Soon after, he will be replaced by a dr. Price, an expert on Electronic Voice Phenomena (EPP), who claims he has received news of Jonathan's late wife Anna on various electronic devices. Is Anna Jonathan trying to say something? Is this just an indication of something on a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale? It's nice to see Keaton starring, but the story he captures is confused and absurd in some places. It is as if the film does not know how to answer the questions it raises, and it distracts the viewer with new, unrelated questions. The widowed widower desperately tries to communicate with his deceased wife. He's quite mature as an actor and leaves the friendly roles he played about 15 years ago. He looks a bit harsh, a few more folds than you might expect, but he has not lost any of the cunning and Ã©lan he showed in Hollywood during his quarter century. In a mediocre performance, the script itself is subpar. The plot is written by Niall Johnson and the more confusing the further the winding path ends in another sinuous path. That's fine if the path leads to an acceptable resolution, something that more or less connects everything and explains something. But not white noise; I did not know much about what had happened to Jonathan when I saw him before my first visit. <br /> <br /> Keaton is really the only reason to look at this garbage, though it's a matter of love interest from Ian McNeice (as Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger.
