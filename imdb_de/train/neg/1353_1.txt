What is it? is a mish-mash of bizarre recurring motifs (snails, Shirley temples, swastikas and openly racist music, etc.) that are not affected by any kind of narration, plot, or character development. The whole thing seemed like a confident "freak show", and I'm not just talking about the unusual casting decisions. It has the feeling of a bad acid journey, far beyond any drug consumption that could be attributed to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs. The only movie I can compare to is Eraserhead (my second lowest movie ever), which was intentionally much more oppressive, but I still found What Is It? a total waste of my time. It's one thing to give me a glimpse into someone else's inner workings - even the chemically altered consciousness of another - but it's something else entirely, just for the weirdness of throwing strange pictures at me.
