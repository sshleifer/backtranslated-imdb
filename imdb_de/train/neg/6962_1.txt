How could such good actors as Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet get involved in such a thing? I can not understand It was awful, it was played very smoothly (but some of the few main roles), the jokes are stupid and absolutely not funny ... I will not talk about this movie anymore, except a little piece of advice: Do not go It will be a waste of time and money.
