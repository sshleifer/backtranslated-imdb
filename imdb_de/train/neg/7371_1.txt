Steven Seagal .... how can you be part of such a horrible movie? I rented this movie because your movies were usually pretty clean. I lost a lot of respect for you when you were in a horrible movie like this. Very, very bad taste! I'm embarrassed that I even rented this movie. Steven, if you continue to perform in movies like this, I think your career is over. My husband and I really enjoyed watching a lot of your movies because you can always "get the bad guys" and clean them with a few hand maneuvers ... and the language is pretty clean in your movies as well. I'll think it over before I lend you another movie.
