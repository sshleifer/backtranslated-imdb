Man, even Plan 9 from Outer Space is better than this movie. This strip does not have enough plot for half an hour, but they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, especially in those exaggerated fight scenes, but stuff like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is way better than this sad thing that would not have been done better.
