Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most tired conspiracies (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to life in his skilled hands. Even his occasional flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) shows vital signs and humor worth seeing. So I was disappointed that Reitman could not do something quite original (drop superheroes, get super powers out of super powers) and make it enjoyable. "Girlfriend" is an exercise in futility. The one-trick pony plot is in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The movie can not decide if it's a romantic comedy or a superhero drama. The result is a movie that shows the flip-flops between the two, none of which is very well done. Uma Thurman is the leader as usual, and Luke Wilson also takes his role, although his limp antics quickly get tired. What's even more amazing is that in certain scenes (such as when a very upturned Uma pushes a headboard through a wall), you feel a funny, raw Reitman opus that is practically crying out. But seconds later, the magic is lost, as fast as the superhero, whose films are disappointed in almost every way.
