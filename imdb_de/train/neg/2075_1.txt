I have to admit, when I saw this movie, I did not have high expectations. But even with my low expectations I was totally disappointed ... <br /> <br /> Luke Wilson is basically a hot shooter going out with some crazy girlfriends. There is a slight mention of a girl pursuing him, but that was it for this character. Which does not bother me, because it's probably just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> During an underground ride, Rainn Wilson (whom I liked before this movie) convinces to talk to a "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. At least that's strange, because everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not fall under the category "hot". Rainn Wilson's performance is also far from "hot". Usually I'm all for his acting, but even he could not save this movie. His character was nervous, unrealistic and quite annoying. You could never tell if the authors were trying to make him a funny, gay guy, or just desperate. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> But somebody else steals her purse when she leaves the tube, and Luke Wilson is the charming savior he tracks after the robber. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero or "G-Girl", as they like to call her in the movie. It's still baffled what the "G" stands for, but we'll leave that to the debate for the Message Boards. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes I suppose to be funny, but I find myself asking, who has sex? They almost throw the bed through the wall because Uma Thurman says "Passion". It hurts my head, but not in the "I think really hard to understand this way". <br /> <br /> When Uma insulted Anna Faris and called her a "whore," I had no argument about it. Apart from the fact that she can not choose movies, she can not act and seriously relies on being blond and typical. All in all, I would have gone out of the theater if I had not paid $ 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let them know that just because you move your head a lot does not mean that you are acting. <br /> <br /> Also, the script and action could either have used a lot of work or a match and / or a game have slightly lighter fluid. I actually felt embarrassed for the actors and their dying careers. All in all, if you value your money and your self-esteem is not wasted on this pathetic attempt at a movie.
