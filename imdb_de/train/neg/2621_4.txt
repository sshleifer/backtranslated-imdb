I would not bring a child under the age of 8 to see that. With puppies hanging from houses and squirming through dangerous machines, and listening to Cruella's scary laughter, to name only a few events, a little kid is too exciting. <br /> <br /> The live action gives a more ominous feeling than the cartoon version, and there are some disquieting moments, including a guy who seems to be a transvestite, many tense moments that worry and little fears scare children. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the Disney people think, but neither the story nor the acting were at their usual level. The puppies are cute, but this movie is spotty at best.
