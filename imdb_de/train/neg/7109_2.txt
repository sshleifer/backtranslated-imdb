Now I understand it. The title refers to the immediate aftermath of each audience member after 68 minutes of psychological torture. If you try too hard to be scary, not having a good dialogue, even if you're scared, the screaming skull really does make you look like a snoring stump. The villa and the property in black and white set a dark tone for the movie, but that's about it. The only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money from it! Do you remember the coffin guarantee at the beginning? This is perhaps the funniest thing I've ever seen on screen. Sadly, viewers probably hoped that director Alex Nichol was forcibly put in a coffin, nailed down and buried alive for his lame effort. Jenny, who has fallen into this unfortunate, terrible situation, never really sympathizes with a woman whose fear is due to an enchanted, cranial vessel. Her husband John also comes out as a condescending wannabe speaker, but that does not work and he proves how hard he is by beating around a helpless cripple. Ah, Mickey? Days ago you could get a restraining order against estate managers like him. The guy of this guy is not very good or maybe too much airplane glue. Despite his strange personality, Mickey is probably the only good thing for this movie, which offers a light sense of entertainment, and I can not get enough of a guy who says, "It was Mary!" and browse through pots in a greenhouse.
