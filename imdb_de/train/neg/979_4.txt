Anyone with a distant interest in science fiction should start with the basics. Everyone says that STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best sci-fi movies in the beginning, which is fine, but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, is far better choice than this series. SOYLENT is probably the best kept secret of science fiction. It's still one of the biggest but most forgotten movies, but the movie's impact is becoming more reality with each passing day. Charlton Heston exaggerates his role, but it works. Edward G. Robinson makes the best of it in SOYLENT GREEN in his last role, more than anyone else, and his final scenes touch each other. <br /> <br /> It's Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and the food is overcrowded is an incredible fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150). A large Soylent executive is murdered and police officer Thorn deals with the case. <br /> <br /> The secret of Soylent Green is no secret when researching the film. SOYLENT is fun, but the whole script is a joke. It is just as cheap as the entire production. The script and the drama of the actors made the film, but were totally funny. Everyone seems to be an idiot, and nobody knows the rules, especially the policeman Thorn, who just rolls around in people's homes, walking around shamelessly and stealing everything he wants. The character's interactions keep your attention on the movie, but you still recognize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks. A delightful piece, if you have time, but expect nothing more.
