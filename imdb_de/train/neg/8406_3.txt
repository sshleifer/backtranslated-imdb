A memorable line from a short-lived show. After watching the episode in which this line was introduced, my brotherhood intrastural football team began using the line to break our heads off the offensive. Instead of Ready / Break, our back cover said FOOTBALL and the rest of the crew answered YOU BET! A fun way to break the bar where our opponents scratch their heads as very few of them saw the show. The use of this line has added a unique element to our season which I will never forget. We had our best season during my college years this year and in a way, it was the fun we had with this direction. The show was quite a stinker, but she lives on in the memories of the 1977 Pi Kappa Phi intramural football national team of West Virginia Tech.
