I have to admit, I do not have much of New Age hocus-pocus. When people "share energy," I always wonder how much kJ is actually exchanged and how this can help solve the problem of global warming. When energy is "enforced," I always wonder how they have succeeded in violating the laws of entropy, and still without Nobel Prizes. When people feel how well instinct enables them to easily navigate through the complexity of life, I wonder how they can not find a simple thing to do like finding the station. <br /> <br /> However, this is not the first movie With action holes and most of them I find quite acceptable and entertaining. If this were the case with "The Celestine Prophecy", I would not burn this movie, but unfortunately not. Every actor seems to be bored out of his head and can not understand what he is supposed to do on the ground. This leads to many "ah-s" and "oh-s" as I do when I talk to someone about quantum physics, who actually knows what he's talking about and pretending to understand. <br /> <br /> The direction is also not inspired. You could expect a little more from the man who could expect "What dreams come," but hey, I figured he was well paid and adopted the attitude of a New York taxi driver: "It's your money, buddy ... "The only one who seems to have fun is the all-time evil JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does he have a job, he's one of the few actors in the film who can crack a few wiles in this eternal and dreadfully boring New Age gossip. <br /> <br /> This film is similar to If you find that your appointment is indeed a terrible boredom, it does not seem to be possible to shut up. At one point in time, it would seem that the words are turning into little ping-pong balls, which are incessantly thrown at your head until it hurts. <br /> <br /> If you have a good time and want to choose between this movie and if you put safety pins in your eyelids, take my advice: Choose the latter.
