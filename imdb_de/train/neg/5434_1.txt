Impressive. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few handles. - The scriptwriter has removed two main characters from the book. - The plot was changed grotesquely. Voiceovers sound like they've been picked up directly from written passages (which is easy to read, but does not differ in conversations, especially Chabon's writing style). - Acting is more wood than a log cabin. (Esp. Bechstein) - This should be stopped in 1983? Feels more like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be fair, I could not bring myself to end this movie. It is possible that he has redeemed himself ... I really hope that nobody has paid for it or at least someone who has read the book and hopes for something decent (a la Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer, but he should be ASHAMED of this adaptation. <br /> <br /> No stars.
