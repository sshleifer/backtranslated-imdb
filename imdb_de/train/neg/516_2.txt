Have you ever noticed how Burt Reynolds' laughter sounds like screaming brakes in his later films? <br /> <br /> Must be hanging around too much with Hal Needham. <br /> <br /> And from "Stroker" Ace, "way too much. <br /> <br /> Can you believe this was based on a book? I could not, but it was. And probably not a bestseller, I bet. <br /> <br /> Burt is another good old boy from the NASCAR circle who harasses Beatty as roast chicken magnate with his team's motives, Anderson makes love interest and Nabors does his Repeated impression of Gomer Pyle as a loyal mechanic / best friend of Lugs. <br /> <br /> Many people here are friends of Burt or Hal. Others must have needed the work, and even real NASCAR riders join in and have more talent <br /> <br /> As for laughter, Bubba Smith ("Police Academy") brings her as Beatty's chauffeur, and Petersen, who is in full Elvira mode, is called Lady, who wants to get to know Lugs really well, showed a lot of appreciative guys .. REALLY GOOD. <br /> <br /> It's a shame That Burt threw away so much time and effort in a movie like "Stroker Ace", it did not matter if he bothered to act or not. You have not bothered to write a character for him, why bother to act? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly for Petersen and for the out-takes in the end. Now they are funny.
