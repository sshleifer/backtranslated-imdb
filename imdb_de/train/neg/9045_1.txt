It began with a semblance of action and then gave it up to an endless array of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story. It was impossible to deal with this movie. This movie is a very cynical rubbish dump made by some people who have animation skills but are totally lacking in creativity or storytelling. It's a shockingly bad effort coming from a big studio. Obviously, there are problems with morality and motivation at Disney, not to mention a complete lack of supervision and quality control. This management allowed this movie to see the daylight, speak volumes about their incompetence and despair. This movie follows my very short list of the "worst films of all time".
