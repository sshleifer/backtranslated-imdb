I saw this movie with my climbing teacher, and we found it so ridiculous that it was beyond compassion. (For one thing, if Stallone climbs free on her own, you do not have to carry any gear, but I think these dangling karabiners would somehow look like "mountain climbing," so let's throw them in). For the lobotomized people who think Colorado resembles the Dolomites in Italy (where the movie was filmed), the Hollywood moguls have a lot more ridiculous and foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow.
