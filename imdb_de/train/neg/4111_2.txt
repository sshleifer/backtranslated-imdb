Think of a no-budget version of the China Syndrome run by a film student who worships John Woo, and you get "Power Play." The idea was good, but the execution, the drama and the dialogue absolutely killed her, not to mention the ridiculous acts of violence and catastrophes that were used to compensate for the lack of substance and the development of the more interesting parts of the film. <Br /> <br /> This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously disappeared after breaking into the offices of a power plant suspected of causing an earthquake could exercise. The rather reckless reporter who fought against a relentless group of business executives is being hunted around the city (along with everyone he's talking to) to "cleanse" the final evidence of the factory's mistakes. <Unfortunately, there is no real emergency, as the characters interact with much hesitation, paired with idiotic dialogues and a lot of terrible acting. Not to mention that the viewer, attracted only by his action-genre appeal from the movie, has to endure an increasing number of bodies and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot-ups and earthquake catastrophes. The entire focus has been put in the wrong place to compensate for apologetic apologies and a more interesting sequence of events that should have fueled the story. It would have been much better if the filmmakers had focused more on a thriller and paid more attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story. Creepy villains, a naive reporter and those who try to inform the reporter about the misconduct. It's formulaic, but at least it would have been entertaining.
