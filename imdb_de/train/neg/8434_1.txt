This movie showed more racial hatred of Jews by David Mamet than I have ever experienced in an American movie. The sterotypes are so exaggerated that my ability to go on has died. I was so disappointed that Joe Mantegna called a group of men who were sitting in a Jewish center in New York, cleaning weapons. I am deeply disturbed by the concept that Jews are not Americans and "different". I claim that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hate and not a healer of it.
