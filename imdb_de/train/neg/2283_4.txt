And the Oscar for the most underrated classic horror actor goes to - Dwight Frye. Seriously, his name should be mentioned with the same reverence as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this movie proves it. His character Herman was one of the two reasons why I can see this movie. Dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed mishap a lovable, but scary attitude that made her hope the entire movie had a bigger role to play. The other reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. Being myself in the medical profession, I have to praise the expert performance of a self-pitying hypochondria. Although other "medical errors" triggered a short giggle, especially when the good doctor examines his colleagues' medication ... "Well, pass it on" Unfortunately, these two outstanding achievements did not stop me from three attempts to go through unbearably slower Movie. The plot is predictable with only a few twists. Shooting a legitimate, ghostly atmosphere made me yawn - yes, you can use too much shade. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - take a look this time to see Frye and Eburne - but only when awake and with lots of caffeine.
