This movie had so much potential - a strong cast, a pretty strong idea and a reasonable budget. I'm not sure where everything went wrong, but each of these elements was wasted. The story went nowhere, the characters were at least hollow and the result was a very boring, pointless film waste. I hated it. Judging by the other voices, I'm in the minority here and must be a kind of freak. However, I found this movie terrible. I had high hopes, but I was very disappointed. A particular disappointment was Jody Foster's character. A kind of fixer makes a good idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and went nowhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - enjoyable, but nothing new.
