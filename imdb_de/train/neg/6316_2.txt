A movie like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country just can not get it. They never did. And liberalism is getting more and more into political oblivion. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a little baseball star who decides to stop playing ball in protest of the existence of nuclear weapons. The boy is understandably ridiculed until a band of professional athletes, led by former NBA star Alex English, joins in with his cause. Not a few of them are committed to the cause. When its movement reaches its peak, leagues in professional and college sports will have to cancel their season as nobody will play anymore. To push this report forward, I am ready to give you that premise. Even if it would never happen in a million years, I can easily imagine that it could, then I move on. <br /> <br /> I can not remember exactly how, but it does make a kind of agreement boy decides to return to the game he loves in an incredibly juicy and ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> Before we criticize the message of this movie, let me just say that this film is poorly written, played and staged. Even if one agrees with the attitude of the boy, it is impossible to overcome how poorly the film was constructed. And that's too bad, because there are many good actors who waste money. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). But Alex English is doing as well as he could with his character and I wish he would try to play in more movies. Unfortunately, finding a job in the coaching world of the NBA is much easier. One wishes that Mr. English would teach more of those flashy NBA types of today how to shoot the rock a bit better. Alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the tire. <br /> <br /> As far as the message of the movie is concerned, that's just wrong. Plain and simple. All those nuclear warheads hidden in the missile silos in the west prevented the war !!!!! It would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest against a real war or the use of nuclear weapons. These weapons were never used, and that was the genius behind their existence. During the Cold War, neither side was crazy enough to fire a single rocket. Without these weapons, who knows what might have happened between the US and the USSR. <br /> <br /> The makers of this movie obviously intended to have kids in America follow their cause and follow in the footsteps of Chuck. Children in America, however, are smarter than the leftists who created this mess. <br /> <br /> The movie is only worth 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie about the dangers of nuclear war, stay with Dr. Strangelove. <br /> <br /> Mr. Newell, you are not Frank Capra!
