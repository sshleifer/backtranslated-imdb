"Blue Desert" may have the potential to be even a reasonably plausible and enjoyable thriller if the main character, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox), was not so stupid. As she carries out another attack on the streets of New York, cartoonist Roberts moves to a small town in the west. In her first days there, she meets the suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, who plays this role well), who will not leave her at some point. Afraid of her safety, having twice been in this situation, she establishes a friendly relationship with suspiciously friendly city policeman Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, whose character does not seem convincing enough) and leaves the onlooker otherwise should not believe, convinced of the red herrings that the writers threw). Smith needs Robert's cooperation because Atkins, as he tells her, is an ex-con and guilty of being sexually abused. But the cops lacked evidence to discard before. <br /> <br /> The film had enough tricks to at least make an interesting movie, because soon there will be such confusion that Roberts should trust. Much of the intended tension, however, seems too coercive, since Robert's character never seems to react to simple things, as we think a reasonable person does. And their delayed responses make much of this tension seem light and unconvincing, especially in the final. Maybe Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; To Baby looked in a way reminiscent of Kevin Anderson's personality, which is evident in his character in 'Sleeping With the Enemy'. If Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger figure, that might be enough. Meanwhile, the movie is not as great as a low-budget B-thriller.
