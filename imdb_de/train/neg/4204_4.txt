David Arquette is a young and naive salesman who stands under the wings of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is a golden boy who made a big sale on his first call to widow Kate Capshaw and her stupid son Ryan Reynolds. <br/> <br/> Arquette is fine, he appears in commercials for the company <br /> <br /> and falls in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> Then Tucci and his right-hand man, Mary McCormack, let him dive into a little secret - sometimes they break into their customers' homes to scare them and to get them to buy neighbors. <br /> < br /> Security systems from the company. Arquette decides not to interfere, to take Capshaw with him to meet his family, and to go through life with a stupid smile on his face. Then someone breaks into the house of Capshaw and murders her and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci and sets up a series of traps that pulls his head in the head while Tucci confesses his innocence. <br /> <br /> Based on a stage play "The Alarmist" is not well opened. The <br /> <br /> scenes in which Arquette takes the Capshaw to meet his parents <br /> <br /> are poorly played and completely unstable. They are also out of line with the character Capshaw plays when she gets drunk and tells sexually explicit stories to Arquette's mother Michael Learned. Apart from these scenes, Capshaw is not much to do, but she does a lot with the little she gets. Stanley Tucci, who looks exactly like Terry O'Quinn, is a riot as the owner of the security firm <br /> <br />. He's a creeper who really does not understand Arquette's moral disgust. However, when he turns into a <br /> <br /> sniffing whine after Arquette has kidnapped him, he is funny. Mary <br /> <br /> McCormack seems to have been prepared for a bigger role, but <br /> <br /> usually stands around and agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds <br /> <br /> is too old to play a stupid teenager, but he's funny, especially <br /> <br /> Arquette tells his own explicit sexual story. <br /> <br /> The screenplay will soon be gushing from the romantic comedy to the dark comedy. Capshaw, who meets her parents, is completely unmotivated, except to give her a reason to leave the city so someone can invade her home. Capshaw and Reynolds are in the film only to give Arquette a reason to revenge himself on Tucci. Arquette, who has proven that he is a good actor, is terribly here. He <br /> <br /> relies on the constipation that has brought him through these AT & T ads, and he's not strong enough to build that <br /> <br /> weakness around filming. Actually, Reynolds would have been a better choice in the role. Dunsky's direction is good, nothing that will soon win an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Christophe Beck's light jazzy score is reminiscent of the kind of film noir this <br /> <br /> movie tries, and it's really catchy. <br /> <br /> Despite the benefits, Arquette is a failure a trail and the schizophrenic quality of the script engulfs the movie. I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is rated for (R) for physical violence, violent violence, some gore, <br /> strong obscenity, short female nudity, sexual content, strong sexual life <br /> <br /> References and situations for adults.
