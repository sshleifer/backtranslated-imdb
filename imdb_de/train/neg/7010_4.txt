I know nobody cares, but I do. This movie is historical for a reason. It is the unity of two heroes from two great science fiction films of the seventies. Well, one is great and one is pretty bad. The big one is really great, actually the best. The bad is really bad, in fact it is the worst. Of course, I'm referring to "Star Wars" and its star Mark Hamill, aka "Luke Skywalker," who is the hero of this film about a boy who invades his vette and then to Vegas (on a leash) and goes after a whole Eventually you win it back through a series of adventures. (Since he repairs cars, you can probably call him "Lube Skywalker"). Along the way, he meets a hooker with a gold heart and ends up with a character played by Kim Milford, the hero of the 1970s science-fiction film Laserblast, which, as I've already suggested, is the worst science Fiction movie that has ever been filmed. Milford plays the lead actor, whom Hamill has to take back his car. I realize that nobody cares about this meeting of two great science fiction heroes, but I do. And I have to say that this is one of the best / worst movies ever. Mark Hamill's acting needs strength, the plot requires extensive Jedi training, and the hooker character Annie Potts plays is perhaps the most annoying character of all times in any movie I've ever seen. But it's a funny movie that you can watch very late on a weekend or weekday, late at night. It's one of those movies that meander and search for something without really finding it, and at the same time their goal is to just as free-form jazz exist as it is. And it does. And what is, is not great, but you can not say it's not entertaining, because for an hour and a half you may feel torn, but you do not feel cheated. Turn off your mind, relax and enjoy this jumbled gem with no expectations. Maybe the power is always with you.
