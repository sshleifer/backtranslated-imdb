I'm not a big Freddy Krueger fan, but that does not mean I do not like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare on Elm Street movies. I think Robert is a very good actor. Nobody plays a better Freddy Krueger than he does. But no offense Robert, this movie is shit. Acting is awful, the plot is really weak and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that's even worth seeing on Friday, the 13th franchise (I thought the remake was the best in the series.) But that is not one of those films. The original was good, the second one was better in my opinion, the third was okay, but I did not have any. I saw the others. Whatever you do, do not make the same mistake I made while looking at this crap.
