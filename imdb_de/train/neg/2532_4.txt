The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman, etc. as kings of the B's. Because people at Crown International were so important, they were not elevated to the status they deserve richly. A movie like THE VAN may now appear as a throw-away of drive-in esoterics, but was a notable hit when it was released (not to mention later re-releases as a double feature with other Crown hits). <br /> THE VAN was a perfect example of Crown's hit strategy, capturing the mood of moviegoers at the time of film release. There was sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll and the short "custom van" fashion. As others have noted, it's ironic that the movie's "hit" song refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the movie itself. I had a city called Selectman, in which I was then even to declare these transporters to "pebbles on wheels". A perfect commercial for the movie! <br /> <br /> There is the usual assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscles and low-bray hijinks (including a supporting piece by Danny DeVito). In many ways, this is not much different from the old 60s beach party movies, but now upgraded with nudity and drug use. Obviously carried out on a limited budget and on a limited schedule, the film is pleasant enough with a breezy charm that balances some, by today's standards, certainly un-PC views of women. <br /> <br /> The classic touch is a toaster for Bobby's sin on wheels. Yes, a toaster! Hey, you have to have something hot for these munchies! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
