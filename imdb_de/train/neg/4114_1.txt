There are some big philosophical questions. What's the meaning of life? What happens when we die? And why are you making these films bad? The premise is absurd. The action is one-dimensional. The special effects are exaggerated. And the movie is an endless shootout between some of the lousiest Hollywood recordings ever produced. But if they had taken good shots, everyone would have been dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. Too bad that it did not happen that way. I tried several times to turn it off several times. I stayed with it to see how bad it could get. I'm glad because (SPOILER?) The last line is the gross stupidity of the whole stupid, gloomy scenario. It's not even worth the second feature status on a third rate drive-in during the low season. Apart from the general awfulness of the movie, I am very worried about its impact on the young audience. The Americans make such a mess and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is a really banal cinema on Brobdingnag's scale!
