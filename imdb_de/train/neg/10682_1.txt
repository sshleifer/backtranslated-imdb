So I'm looking for a DVD and come across this movie "End Game". It features James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR in the lead role and contains a summary of a taught political thriller. Then take a look. At least that's what I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> End Game has pretty much the most ridiculous story I've ever experienced. Now that I am something of a whodunnit, I can not really break as much as I want without ruining it for those who have not yet experienced this monstrosity. But questions like 'why did he / she / she do that?' And 'Where on earth did they get the means to do that?' After the unintentionally hilarious conclusion of the film are all too rich. As far as acting is concerned - you know those films in which you can almost feel that an actor has realized that they made a terrible mistake when they signed up for a movie, and that shows in their performance? That's one of those. Accompany this with a ridiculous script and a seriously flawed, irritating direction, and you have the recipe for cinematographic poison. Of course, it did not make it to the movies, and for the same reason you should not leave it in your living room; it is horrible.
