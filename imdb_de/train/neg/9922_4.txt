In my youth, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, but even this movie left me cold. For the better and worse, "The future is unwritten" is not an uncomplicated "behind the music" documentation. It's more like a biographical art film, full of interviews, performance material, home videos, and mostly pointless animated sketches that come from "Animal Farm." The film is coherent, but too long for half an hour. <br /> <br /> The campfire format, while thinking in thought, is quite annoying in execution. First of all, without a title, it is difficult to know who half of those respondents are. Second, who really needs to hear that people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack lick their butts with their mouths and lick Hosannas over the man? They were not relevant to Strummer's life and their opinions do not add to his story. <br /> <br /> This picture is best when Strummer touched through facetted interviews and conversational facets of his life, which most people did not know about: the suicide of his older brother, dealing with the death of his parents, the joy dealing with fatherhood. These were the most moving for me because it did not show Joe Strummer as a punk icon that we all knew and loved, but as a normal human who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life. There were better, simpler documentaries on Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends and Kurt Loders told MTV documentation from the early 1990s). Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten is for Diehards only.
