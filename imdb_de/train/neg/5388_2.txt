There's a good movie lurking here, but that's not it. The basic idea is good: to examine the moral issues that arise for a group of young survivors of the apocalypse. But the logic is so confused that it is impossible to get involved. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes (understandably) are paranoid about catching the mysterious airborne attacks that have wiped out virtually all humanity. Nevertheless, they sometimes wear surgical masks, but others do not. Sometimes they are fanatical about bleaching any area an infected person touches. Other times they seem completely unconcerned. Worse, after apparently surviving a few weeks or months in this new kill-or-kill world, these people are constantly behaving like total newbies. They do not bother collecting the right equipment or food. They lack the fuel in the middle of nowhere. They do not make any basic arrangements when meeting strangers. And after wading through the rotting corpses of all humanity, they're just as squeamish as protected debutantes. They always have to ask themselves how they could have survived so long ... and even if so, then why anyone wants to make a movie about it. <br /> <br /> So if these dweebs stop torturing themselves about the moral dimensions of their actions, it is impossible to take their soul research seriously. Your actions would initially have to make a minimal sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, we have to deal with the dubious acting skills of Chris Pine. His portrayal of an arrogant young James T Kirk might seem isolated. But in Carriers he plays the same thing: arrogant and awkward. It is impossible not to suspect that this is his entire dramatic spectrum. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film * looks excellent *. It has an overly sharp, saturated look that really suits the southwestern United States. But that can save neither the really weak writing nor the paper-thin (and annoying) signs. Even if you're a fan of the End of the World genre, you should be spared the torment of watching carriers.
