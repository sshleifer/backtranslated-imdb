When "expired Catholic," who had been a Catholic Catholic for eleven years, but had not gone to Mass for thirty-five years, except at weddings and funerals, I thought I would make a kick out of it. And I did. , , for the first two-thirds of the movie. It was all standard - strict ecclesiastical school teaching, suppressed sexuality, etc. But suddenly the movie became evil. Really mean. Well, I saw that before the pedophilia scandals hit. , , and perhaps I would not have been so offended by such evil, hateful digs at the Catholic Church if I had known about this abomination (such a Catholic expression!) and cover-ups. <br /> <br /> It was an I rented the video a few years ago, and I will not rent it again with a new perspective. It just left a dirty, unpleasant, ugly taste in my mouth. , , I wonder what all the actors have done with the church because they either really hate it or hate the paycheck. It's an unbelievably anti-Catholic film that appeals to anyone who shimmers respect for Catholic education. What else am I doing because there were no better teachers in the 1950s? Whatever these nuns did, they forced me to learn and write English. They let us learn by heart. (How many children today can perform simple arithmetic in their minds?) The truth is that nothing more is important for success in America. Can you read? Can you add / subtract / multiply / divide? Great. You can get any advanced degree you want. And the discipline of Catholic education will benefit you, not only as you continue your studies, but for the rest of your life, regardless of what you think of the Catholic "mythology" that we all needed to learn. <Br /> <br /> Such a great cast, such a lousy, lazy font. I feel really bad (and no, it's not "bad" - trust me, the nuns taught me better) for the writer and director. <br /> <br /> I thought I had mixed feelings about the Catholic school. But the participants in this project must have been those bad (ie, stupid) kids sitting in the back of the room when they were ready to shoot this movie.
