This movie sucks the ass. Something about a heatwave in a European country, complete garbage. There is nothing at all for this movie. maybe 30 seconds of sex, but that's it. There is a very annoying chick that rides with people and really pisses me off. This movie is totally rash and you should not be viewed. I regret that it is very boring. I would rate it at zero, but I can not. No body in the mind should see this. I'm sure you'll regret it. How could they come up with something so bad? Even Mystery Men was better. MYSTERY MEN. That sucks. This movie was not worth doing. total waste of time. The characters in this are very hard to understand and I am very bored.
