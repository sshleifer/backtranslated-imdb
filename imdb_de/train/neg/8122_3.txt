To look painful and not only for the empathy in the characters' struggles. Two of the main characters, Cynthia, the mother, and Monica, the acclaimed daughter, spend the bulk of the movie, which makes a miserable and bitter smack. Her characters are so firmly rooted that their salvation into bearable personalities is incredible after a quick family catharsis. The wait was not worth it. I wish honest honesty among families would have less headache.
