In the recent move to bring Asian movies to America, this is the last movie to be released here. Since I was a big fan of Asian films from all genres, I searched the internet and came across this release to be re-released on the US market. That's why I decided to try it out first and rent it in a local video store Trust me ... the action scenes are unbelievably disappointing. Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey have completely blown this movie out of the water. Jet Li fell asleep watching the combat sequences. If you're looking for martial arts entertainment, your time with a Jackie Chan movie would be better! <br /> <br /> Also ... you think you're going to see a show with martial arts girls devoured in revenge for their parents' death, BUT SURPRISE !!! A good hour of this film in the middle is filled with dialogue, an absence of action, the absence of a detailed conspiracy that has nothing to do with the premise that we are exposed to. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and with the boy with his conspirator group, where the producer / director did not have time for the uprising and yet devoted a part of the film that dragged the subject. It would have been much better if they had just shortened the whole hour and developed the story in another film and focused on the martial arts aspect. Speaking of that, I really do not believe Iron Monkey's choreographer made the action sequence in Princess Blade. I was utterly offended by the frequent use of slow motion and fast camera shots to illustrate the physical speed of the assassins. I just did not buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I warn you, PLEASE do not waste your time / money on this movie. The premise is fascinating and the trailer might even seduce you, but I'm sure this movie is NOT for the public (maybe in Japan, but not in the States) and the worst movie from the Asian movie brought to the States becomes industry.
