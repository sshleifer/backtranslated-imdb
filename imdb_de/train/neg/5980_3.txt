There's a group of Fox TV executives sitting around a boardroom wondering what new show to show. <br /> <br /> "How about targeting something like 24 or the West Wing?" one of them says, but they all agree that it would be too expensive, and cheap television does less harm to the station when it flops. <br /> <br /> "Well, how about bringing some great comedy writers together and doing a quality sitcom?" offers another and is fired on-site. "Do not you know that good writers cost a lot of money!" the big boss barks. "That's why we invented reality TV." <br /> <br /> "We could do another drama ...", suggests a man in a threadbare suit. "I hear ...", the boss answers suddenly interested. "People like CSI, so let's make a copy of it," Blandman adds. <br /> <br /> "But there are far too many CSI clones, what can we do to make our customers stand out?" A naive junior asks and gets fired immediately. 'Attracting attention! If we do that, people might be confused! Let's give them more of what they like! The big chief is screaming. <br /> <br /> "Let's just add more violence and make it really scary, after all we're Fox," suggests another plaintive response: "Now you get it," by the Great Chief. "We could make her the unit of deviant crime," he adds clearly. <br /> <br /> "By Jove, he has it!" The great chief laughs, "and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who carry very little on the canvas." "Well, that would certainly distract people from the average acting and the poor scripts," Blandman says. <br /> <br /> "Then it's done, we just need a name," proclaims the Great Chief. "We could call it Sex Cops Violence?" <br /> <br /> "Too literal, how about Killer Instinct? It conveys violence, but sounds a bit like Basic Instinct, which had a lot of sex." <br /> <br /> 'Puuurfect', replies the great chief and then they beat each other on the back and cancel the arrested development.
