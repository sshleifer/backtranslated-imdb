This movie is promising and then gets very confused and confused. Kamal Hasan went to great lengths to make the period look right, too bad he did not spend more time with the conspiracy. Most of the little characters in the movie appear for no particular reason. All in all, very disappointing, I would recommend to avoid this movie.
