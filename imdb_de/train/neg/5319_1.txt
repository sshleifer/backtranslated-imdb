Recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: A villain who looks like she's escaped from the WWF has a terrible target with a weapon that has unreliable effects (the first man she shoots catches fire, but if she does she shoots at other people she just disappears) and takes the time to pet a deer. Then you got the unlikely characters, 30-year-old college students, a lame attempt of a surprise ending, and more. Avoid at all costs.
