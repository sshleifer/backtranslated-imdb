Gregory Peck's acting was, as one would expect, excellent, and the cinematography is even amazing when you play directly into a melodramatic "moment". But the rest of the movie was overkill and hard to see anyway. I tried to like it, but had to move forward for the last thirty minutes. I feel like I wasted a couple of good hours. If Gregory Peck had not been, I would not have taken fifteen minutes. 10.4.
