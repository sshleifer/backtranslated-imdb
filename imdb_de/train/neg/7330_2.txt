Kill Me Later "has an interesting basic premise: A suicidal woman (Selma Blair), about to jump off an office block, protects a bank robber (Max Beesley) who promises to kill her later. <BR /> <br / > The actual implementation of this premise, however, is stalled, as almost every act merely serves as a means of moving the action towards its predictable conclusion. Skillfully written characters that have no motive for their behavior affect the quality of action In particular, character depth reduces the performance of Selma Blair, whose character Shawn claims to be "cool" from Morast and ultimately acts as a confused dork, which is unfortunate as Ms. Blair is an appealing and capable actress in other circumstances. <br/> <br /> The thing gets worse: Director Dana Lustig insists on fast cuts and inappropriate special effects (eg B. look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end) and a hip soundtrack in the hope of addressing the short attention spans of MTV audiences. Certainly Ms. Lustig proves that she can master the technical side of the line, but her skills do not help to overcome the film's inherent problems, and the film goes right to the end. Funny has clearly its own visual style. However, it may be better for music videos than for a movie. <br /> <br /> The producers (Ram Bergman & Lustig) can be recommended for their ability to realize this film: they were able to record $ 1.5 million film finance, secure good cast and distribution at home and abroad. This is no small feat for an independent film. However, the result is a mixed bag given the quality of the product.
