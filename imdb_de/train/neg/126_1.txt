"I am Curious: Yellow" is a rising and arrogant steaming pile. It does not matter what political attitude you have, because this film can not be taken seriously at any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that's not true. I've seen r-rated movies with male nudity. Granted, they only offer a few glimpses, but where are the R-rated movies with gaping vulvas and fluttering labia? Nowhere, because they do not exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the wind, but no clit in sight. And those presumptuous indie films like The Brown Bunny, where we find the side of Vincent Gallo's throbbing Johnson, but on Chloe Sevigny there's no sign of Rosa. Before crying (or suggesting) "double morality" in terms of nudity, mentally mutilated people should consider an inevitably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: no genitals are shown when actresses appear naked, and one can not say that for a man In fact, female genitalia in an American movie are usually portrayed only through porn or explicit eroticism. This alleged double standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to engage culturally with the inside of women's bodies.
