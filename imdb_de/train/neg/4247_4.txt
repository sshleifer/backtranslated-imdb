My twenty-fifth Sidney Lumet movie, Garbo Talks, is a painfully boring, maudlin and predictable drama. He is abruptly beaten down at the end of my search. <br /> <br /> The film features a hurried young worker named Gilbert (Ron Silver), son of Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft), eccentric, vivacious and above all an obsessed fan of Greta Garbo. When Estelle falls ill with a brain tumor, her son decides to go on an obsessive search: to find Greta Garbo and bring her to his mother. Anne Bancroft is in full swing, Chew-the-Scenery aunt-mame mode here, this kind of passionate old movie that the movie loves, where it feeds on people and stands up for their ideals and all the time in jail lands. She stands outside the film as an obvious artificial construct, and every scene with her is Yuk-Yuk-Lahm; Every note is wrong. The rest of the characters are equally one-dimensional, but uncommonly less interesting. Ron Silver is as shallow as possible, and his attempted love triangle is as telegraphic as anything else in the movie: he's with affluent Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher) but is co-starring Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks) and I have each one Scene called three scenes before they happen. <br /> <br /> That's the other problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if they are in a fascinating and compelling story, but there is nothing here. The tempo of the film is icy and radiates with strange material that reinforces absolutely nothing. When the movie begins to follow a linear plot, it is plotty and uninteresting. There are, so to speak, many guest stars, including Harvey Fierstein as a gay New Yorker (imagine that) in another extremely unimportant scene. <br /> <br /> Late in the movie he tries to make a halfway. a decent statement about the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but at this point, none of the characters exists as real humans, and the film had bored me into submission, so it acts as a case of far too little. way too late The film is my twenty-fifth Lumet-directed film that easily makes it my most watched director, but outside of some annoying Misses (A stranger among us, anyone?) he has not discovered the painfully uninteresting depths of Garbo Talks. <br /> <br /> {Rating: 4.5 / 10 (C / C) / # 21 (of 24) of 1984 / # 23 of 25 Lumet Films}
