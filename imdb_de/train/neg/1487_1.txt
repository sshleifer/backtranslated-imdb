Thanks to this movie, I can now answer the question, "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" <br /> <br /> I can not even imagine a second, and I've really seen some bad movies. <br /> <br /> Nothing works in this movie. Name a single element of a horror movie, and this movie fails. Honestly, I have seen better on YouTube. Here are some typical dialogues: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, is that you?" "Steve, I'm not kidding." "Steve, that's not funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "ARggh !!!! Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo!"
