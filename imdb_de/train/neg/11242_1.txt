I saw this movie in a free preview last month and went out. It was pretty awful. While they were trying too hard, they played too much and made a terrible movie. I was disappointed because I felt that all the actors had made serious decisions in the past, so it could not be that far off track - but I was wrong. I was hoping they would issue a poll at the end of the film so I could tell them not to release this movie. The free aspect of the preview lured me, but it turned out to be a waste of time - and usually I am very easily amused. It was trying to be innovative and creative with the recordings, ideas and films, but because they brought so many ideas together, it failed. I'm usually not picky about movies and I do not usually feel like making my opinion about movies, but I had to warn everyone not to watch it. I registered with IMDb to tell you all
