I was fascinated by how bad this movie was. Should the viewer learn something here or think about it? What was wrong with the pumpkins? Should I be impressed by the motel pictures? Is it important to have garbage bags on the roof terrace opposite a hotel? Why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews (it's so obvious that he spit out the really informative parts of his interviews to scoff). The best part of the film was the interview with the film professor, who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it's done. <br /> <br /> I'm really excited. I believe that the Creator seeks to become an intellectual or to impress the intellectual community.
