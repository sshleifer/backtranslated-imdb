Let's just say, I had to expose my unbelief less for Spiderman than for hooligans. In other words, I have fewer problems believing that Toby McGuire can hold on to buildings than Elija Wood, who hurls down hard in Manchester. I'm not going to deal with details, as I do not want to write a spoiler, but the idea that mature, professional, British men fall into the deadlock every weekend is ... well ... funny. And this movie is not. The fight, the idea of ​​the fight is taken too seriously. The severity of pugilism, the reverence with which the subject is treated, becomes irritating as it neither creates nor resolves the conflict. It seems that the storyline with holes large enough to pass through a Guinness truck has been smashed with a fictional "fish out of the water" theme so that viewers can gaze into Wood's teary eyes as he learns to be a man to become . other young men of opposing football hit with blunt objects and then run away as fast as he can. The characters are cartoonish, especially the Americans at Harvard. The character development and the storyline are sent to the viewer throughout the image. Unfortunately, the film's absurdity does not reach its climax, and by then you have spent almost two hours of your life never getting it back. Collect "The Football Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this stupid and disappointing guy. There is no time wasted on empty melodrama, the tired old "Yankee in King Aurthur's Court," or weeping parables of old-age costs. They are just pure, dark and smart fun. That is supposed to be violence.
