Well, I did not read the original short story to know all the literary issues that went wrong here, so I'm not going any further here. <br /> <br /> But I learned some time ago that Stephen King films - with some exceptions - are just not horror movies. This was not one of them. It started well enough, and for once I will not complain about acting, although Fred Gwynne was wonderful as usual. Also, I'll forgive the total lack of parenting skills necessary to bring the story forward here ... <br /> <br /> But there was a fixed point where I could not help but get angry. And that came pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least two characters participated in the activity of stupid stupidity. So, the moments I refer to are: A little zombie runs around the house. They suspect that it is under the bed. (a) You get as close to the bed as possible before you blindly lift the covers, and pretty much expose your entire body to the damage that such a small, undead cannibal causes you , or <br /> <br /> (b) Move away from the bed a little, so that you can look under the fully open end from a position of somewhat enhanced security, or at least see the mini-terror coming Give them a little reaction time. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go with (a) I would like to bid for slaughter today Bleh <br /> <br /> A fun movie. .. just not very scary.
