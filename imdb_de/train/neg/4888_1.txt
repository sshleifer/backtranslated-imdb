Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips would have had to rely on good enough when he made "Criminally Insane" 10 years before the release of this terrible waste of time and effort. The fact that the original "Criminally Insane" was less than an hour long should have made him aware that he had probably milked this story for everything he wanted to bring out of original material in this section, even until it was recycled the original opening credit! Unfortunately, retrieving the rapidly aging Priscilla Alden has not saved them. What a bit of original material was in this movie looks like it was shot with a rented handheld camcorder! If this movie cost more than $ 100 I would be very surprised and I would be equally surprised if it had something close to that amount! Avoid this and see the original instead!
