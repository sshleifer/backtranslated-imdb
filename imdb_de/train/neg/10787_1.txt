Let me say it differently: balls. Or how about bollo * ks? This is really awful, more embarrassing than the one who tries to satirize it. Julia Roberts is a talented actress, and usually her work is at the highest level. This movie is so missing in the direction, even if she tries to look good. Normally she is the accomplished professional, but I swear that in her eyes were signs of confusion and desperation. <br /> <br /> The one thing that could have saved this step was the idea of ​​the director (Chris Walken). The film becomes a secret documentary about the actors. Unfortunately, this topic was not fully exploited. Too little too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was made of wood, Cusack was Cusack, and Crystal should stick to acting. The two talented ex-Buffy stars had different experiences - Green played hopelessly wrong and Balfour used too little. Well done for Julia just to prevent this being the worst movie ever made.
