As usual, I watched this movie for A.R. Rahman. Otherwise, the movie is not good. Rajni wanted to end his film career with this film if he would be successful. Luckily or unfortunately the movie was a failure. After that he scored a goal with Chandramukhi. I'm looking forward to his future Shivaji. <br /> <br /> I read the other user's comment on Rajni. I found it interesting because the user is also from TN. Rajni is an actor who acts, I think, out of his heart and not out of his head. He is not a methodist like Kamal Hasan. I think we have to appreciate Rajni for his strong demeanor at his age. Anyway, I have to fill in 10 lines for this comment ... so good luck, Rajni ...... .....
