I wish I had gotten back my rent money from this garbage so I could donate it to the Home for Aged Actors. Total garbage !! Five people saw this movie at the same time and not a single laugh was heard, although a lot of yawning. Paltrow is a beautiful woman and she was the best you can see in the entire comedy movie.
