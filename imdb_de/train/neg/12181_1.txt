Unfortunately, there was no 0 for a rating, otherwise I would have chosen it. This movie does not have the star power the original movie had in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of the newcomer Aileen Quinn and the expert of the experienced professional John Huston (father of the actress Angelica Huston) make the film so charming. Even the remake of 1999 with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming, and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this sad excuse for a sequel. Before making this film, all Ashley Johnson knew was her role as little Chrissie Seaver on the primetime show "Growing Pains." She had a few small parts in movies, but I do not know who thought she had the talent to do a movie alone. And to add Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ridiculous! They could not get enough actor actors like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan, and Annie, but they're going to sign Joan Collins to play a British lady? It does not surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was. The critics agreed to disapprove of this film, even if it was meant only for television, it was a poor continuation of an otherwise endearing film.
