There is no going around - this movie is awful. I've seen the old films of Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu, I'm familiar with the characters and their serial origins, but it's still a shame. However, Peter Sellers' genius still seems to emerge through his portrayal of Nayland Smith, with echoes of sadness, tragedy, and strength floating through a stoic fa√ßade. It's a performance that I compare to Peter Cushing's Van Helsing presentation, but in a tenth of the total screen time of all Cushing films "Dracula." If the film was filmed during the AVENGERS TV show of the 1960s in a serio-comic-style scene like BUBBA HO-TEP, it could have been something special. If you're a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, you need to see this, but it's a pass for everyone else.
