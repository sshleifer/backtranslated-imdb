This type of "inspirational" saccharin is enough to get sick. It telegraphs his feelings like the biggest semaphore in the world. It removes the audience's own interpretation and feeling by making the decisions. The big goal is swimming in a weeping orchestration that has to work like jumper cables on a dead car. I think you need such a request to feel, if you are stupid enough to watch such a simple and sour movie. Streep lights up and you wonder if it really shows the depth of the feeling or is it just that - a display that turns on and off like a light. Because I can not see for my life how she could find a life in such a movie. Although based on a true story, I'm sure the setup, execution, and performances will look like a third-rate television movie or a semi-suspicious high school drama.
