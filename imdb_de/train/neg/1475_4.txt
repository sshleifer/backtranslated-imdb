Most episodes in Season 1 are terrible. There is no comparison to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as these programs actually had decent story lines. Most Amazing Stories are boring ... not stunning. Whether you're renting or buying the Twilight Zone series ... I've heard that Season 2 of this series is much better than the Ray Walston parts, which further reduce this compilation. The one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... However, most storylines are very predictable and the series could be better with twists and turns that you had to wonder ...
