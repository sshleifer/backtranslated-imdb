The only real highlight in the movie is the death of the snooping guy and the reaction of the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> In every other respect, this film is a very lame rip-off of Jaws, Lake Placid and Alligator with some Godzilla (1998). <br /> <br /> As is common in a 1990s horror movie, the two non-star-shaped women undress at least once. The female lead not because she obviously has a better agent. <br /> <br /> The entire film surrounds the shooting of a really stupid extreme sport called blood surfing, where surfers cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters. This movie also features a giant saltwater crocodile in the area. People are being eaten. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against a bad horror movie, but I really hate a boring bad horror movie that is definite.
