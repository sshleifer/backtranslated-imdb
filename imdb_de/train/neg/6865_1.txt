This movie was so bad that it was ridiculous. I could not resist seeing it. The plot is standard, the drama pretty awful (supporting cast like the crazy neighbor and the lawyer's friend were better actors). Somehow amusing, if you lose some time and like to see the conclusion of a dramatic conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The headliner who plays "Kathy" was simply fascinating because I could not decide if it was a deadpanic effect was the result of a bad surgery or just bad acting (me decided that it was both). The script remains to comment, which was pretty awful. Pat remarks, idiotic decisions and reckless stupidity of every character in the film. Maybe that was what was so fascinating. I dont know. I just looked at it to see how bad it could be. (Actually, the dialogue can not even be called a "clich√©" - but he is almost completely crazy.) All in all, a very bad, cheap produced film. The scenes, the same scenes (a house, a building) were shown again and again, without any artistic ability or actual connections to the plot. more like props that happened to fall into the action in a bad game. A chase scene could have been taken by a teenager in a warehouse or old school: bad shot, cheap props, minimal action ... and I still wanted to see the end. Imagine that.
