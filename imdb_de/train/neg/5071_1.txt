I can not believe that this show lasted so long. I think it's all part of the dumbing down of America. Personally, as David Spade said, I liked this show better when she went for her original title - "Seinfeld". What bothers me most about this show, apart from the obvious sense of humor and general foolishness, is the sophisticated way the episodes are labeled. Really great shows are still funny after many repeated visits, such as "the one where Rob is accidentally hypnotized," the "Dick Van Dyke Show," or "Lucy and Ethel working at the Confectionery Factory." In other words, it's an honor that is given great audiences by the audience. The fact that the authors and producers of "Friends" have the fullest hybrids to actually name the episodes themselves, before anyone even had the chance to see it a second time, speaks not only for the mediocrity and the lack of original thinking of the said Authors, but also the mutilated mind of their viewers. They read the comments of some of these people and can only conclude that they are in a hallmark card-like Neverland, full of greeting cards. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people are supposed to work in cafes and look for work as actors, but somehow they manage to live in $ 4,000 / month. Apartments? Anything I want to say to those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all of that. This New York does not exist for someone who earns less than a serious six-figure income. But good luck with all this anyway. Now shut up and pass the soma.
