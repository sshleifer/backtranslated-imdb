After reading the text on the box I picked up this video, the story seemed to be good and there was Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes, I watched how awful his acting was. He goes and talks so stupid, the whole time it is wrong and not convincing. It does not end there, almost ALL the characters behave so badly that it's ridiculous, the only acceptable spectacle was Alan Boyce (David), but the guy committing suicide early and you do not see him anymore, you never know why he did it ! Everything about this movie screams in poor quality, I can not believe how such a thing will be published! I was often tempted to stop watching, in fact I did. Midway, I decided to stop watching, put the matter down, and came to the IMDB to see what the others think about them. So I decided to force myself to deal with the pain and finish it to finish it and then come here to comment on it. The only good thing for me was the high school rock band theme, occasionally guitar playing and vocals, but that's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting and directing ... Terrible movie.
