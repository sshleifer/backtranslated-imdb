This movie story is bad enough that can happen in real life. I can not understand it when they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there is a reason. 1. If Madonna was rich and can do whatever she wants, why she falls in love with this evil man. 2. How can the story script be so weak? She was so rich, she can do anything she wants, but she does not dare to divorce her husband. <br /> <br /> The words I LOVE YOU mean nothing in this movie.
