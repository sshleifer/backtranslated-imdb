If you are not an evangelical Christian, do it like an Egyptian and avoid it like the biblical plague. <br /> <br /> Awesome - why, why is IMDb the cheapest reviews at the top of the list - it was due to one of those I was just wasting the end of what started off as a good evening with this claptrap. <br /> <br /> The plot premise began strong enough - I was drawn into the film and interested to the point where the Bible sermons took over. What a waste. <br /> <br /> This film got me so upset that I first registered with IMDb to complain about it - at least I hope it will save someone else's evening. <Br /> <br /> Hay - what a Christian act on my part ;-)
