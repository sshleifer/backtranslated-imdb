Body Slam (1987) is a horrible movie. The low budget stinks, the direction is (at best) pedestrian and the writing and acting is lame. But if you're in Old School wrestling (from around '70s to mid-'80s), then you'll be more entertaining than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this movie stinks of ice. I gave him two because I felt generous. This turkey was "led" by stunt master Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a few scrub wrestlers and c-list actors (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> The summary of this "movie" is about a promoter who wants to combine "hair" rock and wrestling, but there are others who do not want him to succeed, there are more, but I do not want to SPOIL it for you If you can stand the bad acting and the crazy plot, there are some surprises for diehard wrestling fans in the end. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to my worse enemy (and I'm serious).
