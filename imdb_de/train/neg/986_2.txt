This movie had an IMDB rating of 8.1, so I expected much more from it. It starts funny and lovable with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the film is halfway over, he begins to pull and everything becomes pathologically predictable. The characters in the office were adorable in the first third of the movie, but we get to know them a bit too well. they become caricatures, not real people. This is the same story I've seen hundreds of times, only here with a little different circumstances. The thing is, I could endure another predictable love story if the dialogue were not so stale! <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and incredible motives, and unfortunately that was the case with Dead Letter Office. Hopefully this movie will end up in the Dead Movie Office soon.
