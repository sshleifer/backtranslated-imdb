The author and director Bart Sibrel relies on a film can, which he says was accidentally sent to him by NASA. He says it shows the astronauts how, with the help of camera treats, they faked the television recordings of their moon journey. The astronauts were in a low Earth orbit all the time, and the local editors built this raw material in just a few seconds of the finished film. Unfortunately, Sibrel's research is so sloppy that he does not recognize his "backstage" footage comes to a large extent from the 30-minute live broadcast (even on this role) that was seen by millions and was not hidden in NASA safes, as he suggests. And we must ask ourselves why Sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narrative about the astronauts' audio recordings in the footage, because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly states that the astronauts only tested the camera and did not take any pictures. <br /> <Finally, anyone can see the raw material for themselves without having to buy the hacked version of Sibrel. (He shows you more of the Zapruder movie of JFK's murder than of his "smoking weapon.") Sibrel believes he's the only one who has seen it. More insightful are the clips from this raw material that Sibrel did NOT use, eg. For example, those that clearly show that the earth at a fair distance from the window frames are dwarfed by the window frames, etc., destroying its claim that mats and transparencies have been placed in the spacecraft windows Illusion of a distant earth. <br /> <br /> As with most films of this type, Sibrel relies on allusion, inappropriate assumption, misleading comments and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer to accept a conclusion for which there is no trace of To prove.
