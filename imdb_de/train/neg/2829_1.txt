The worst and a lot of people who really should know better (the actors have six Oscars between them). It is set in "contemporary" Africa (it was produced in 1979) and is about the slave trade. It's been scandalously scanned and played (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov, and William Holden get a career in this case), and they are completely lost in excitement, no matter what their moral orientation. It is also ridiculously drawn. They do not believe for a minute that any of the characters would behave the way they do under these circumstances. Richard Fleischer heads, but you have the impression that it was on the phone. This is as bad as it gets.
