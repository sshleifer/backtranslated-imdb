Okay, someone a few years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies getting dusty on board the Apollo 11 and going to the moon. So they did it. Someone was an idiot somewhere. I want to give the props to the artists so they can do their homework on the hardware. As far as I can tell, the rockets and the launch hardware were in full swing. The graphics were generally pretty good - the rocket launch gave me shivers, as is always the case with a good rocket launch. The CG was not in Pixar quality, but in general it was good. The flies were a bit mediocre anthropomorphic, with a few half-hearted characters from the late '60s (hippie flies, African-American flies with huge Afros and black nuances, etc.), and the maggots looked more like maggots with human baby heads (though they made corresponding squealing sounds made). The scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework and relied on offensive and outdated clich√©s (1960s gender politics, including mostly useless female characters, racial stereotypes, evil Russians, a big fly that just wants to eat (2nd grade).) In a movie Having aimed at IMAX, they had a wonderful opportunity to engage in some instructive content on physics and space travel - they had not understood their physics correctly (burn Zero-g in the Lunar Module during the landing? PLEASE) bothered to read the original transcripts between Houston and the astronauts, which are all open to the public, instead they wrote their own dialogues that sound like crap. <br /> <br /> But we liked the maggots. <br /> <br /> You get one and a half points for rockets and maggots. Uh, yes, 1.5 / 5.
