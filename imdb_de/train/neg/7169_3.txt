This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The little slave Alice and Jared Harris, who imitates Christopher Walken, makes this movie entertaining. Alice's smoking, drinking and an eerie way of appearing when her name is called is strange and interesting. I must applaud Jared for his imitation of Christopher Walken and Christopher Walken for allowing this.
