Please let me forget. You're welcome. You're welcome. This is the worst movie I ever had. I think the movie is an insult to my brain and my butt, both suffering from watching and watching this movie. I have not yet seen the damage my eyesight and my ability to complete sentences have caused. What a load of garbage !! And do not let me start acting ... Someone please help me to forget !! "Weird Science" - come back !! Everything is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I am "proud" to give this movie here at IMDb first ... And I voted for hundreds of films ... Many of them c ** p but that is so bad i cant believe it. Someone actually came up with the idea and thought it deserved to be a movie? Someone actually read the script and decided to produce the film? Someone has read the script and auditioned for it? Someone saw the movie and decided not to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity. * These are the questions that I want to answer. Not the philosophical question about this tree in the forest and well, you know ...
