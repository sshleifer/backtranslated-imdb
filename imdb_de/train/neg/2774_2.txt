That's just a bad movie. With a seemingly good budget, it had the potential to be much better. It was almost like that. With the beautiful heroine, who looks almost like Salma Hayek, the hero almost fights like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger ..., music almost like in Conan ... about. But in the end, it's just boring and it's hard to find something interesting. Apart from John Rhys-Davies flying in duel like these warriors in Hero or the aforementioned Crouching Tiger ... I'm really ashamed of poor old John. After all, he is a good actor and deserves much better. Like you - if you have a chance, look at something else.
