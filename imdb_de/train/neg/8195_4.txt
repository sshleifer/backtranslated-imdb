Every Christmas Eve, my children have another show by It's A Wonderful Life. Bad Santa I really liked. So sue me. I admit it. I like cheesy, schmoozy films. I also like excellent, intelligent, but like so many things, variety is a good thing. What would be the Christmas season without Santa's all-time film-based Ka-Ching-Ka-Ching in all its forms, from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will not forget Bedford Falls, but I do not think a Christmas movie needs to reach iconic stature to be successful. "Fred" is a perfect holiday movie, with enough humor for the adults and enough charm for the kids. My wife and I laughed a lot, though the humor was obvious and Vince was just Vince. Paul Giamatti was a first-class Santa who helped a lot. It's not a great movie, and it's unlikely that it necessarily has to be seen for everyone's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed what it was like: Holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice. There is nothing wrong with that.
