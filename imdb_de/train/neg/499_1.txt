The Horror Channel plays only erotic soft porn gothic flicks every evening from 10:00 pm until about 4:00 am. However, their "fear" factor is very limited, if any exists. In fact, I'm sure I'll scare a multi million pound lottery win than anything this channel has to offer. <br /> <br /> The Bloodsucker leads the dance to a special highlight because I believe the undisputed low of a channel of lows. I can not even tell you how bad this movie is, but at least I'll try it to fulfill the minimum 10 lines required by this site. <br /> <br /> First, the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen. In fact, the film could have been called "Toothbrush" or "Wallpaper" when it comes to the storyline. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had wallpaper. <br /> <br /> There are no miles of bloodsuckers and worse, there are no dances, no. I'm sure they accidentally made two different films here. <br /> <br /> A more appropriate title would have been: "Horny Italian Count leads five people to an eerie castle and bores us for ninety minutes." Yes, that fits better. <br /> <br /> The acting is awful and the dubbing is horrible, and the guy who plays Seymour was almost as wooden in his gait as in his character ... abysmal. <BR> <br /> The only achievements of this film are a small but interesting lesbian scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes and the added attraction that every female figure gets her equipment. Bonus. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, divert a wide birth from this. No vampires, no dance, no scenes of brutal or cruel nature and no way on God's Earth that I'll ever see again. <br /> <br /> No word of a lie, this movie could set you moving pictures for life.
