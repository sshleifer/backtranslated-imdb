Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan belong to this class of actors that I always care about despite criticism. I've always found that Ms. Ryan is a charming and profitable actress in almost all her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth a visit. <br /> <br /> I say "almost" and "almost" in large part because of this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, Meg Ryan does not play sympathetic character, she plays a weak-willed hunter who gets nervous just after the opening credits and only gives up after several years days later. The character of Kevin Kline is even more annoying and less sympathetic. So, even if you usually like these two actors, I recommend that you give this movie a passport.
