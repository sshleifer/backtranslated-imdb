My wife and I just completed this movie and I came to IMDb to honor the reviewers who found this film unsatisfactory. Of the 10 reviews, however, only a handful are negative. I think this movie is a great concept that went terribly wrong and I would like to warn those who want to watch the movie in the future. <br /> <br /> I admit, I'm more inspired to write reviews, if I do not like a movie anymore than when I do, so my handful of reviews are negative. Still, that does not mean that I'm biased not to enjoy a movie, but I often find more eloquent critiques about movies that I really like. <br /> <br /> Paris is the best movie I have ever seen. I have seen in years. By using an "intelligent" concept and some great stories with great talent, the movie becomes the worst of all worlds. It's art for the arts, but something that a 2 year old could dream of and achieve. Giving the director the freedom to stay on screen for 5 minutes is a testament to why there is division of labor in entertainment as well. Directors can not write, writers can not direct. (I would also like to add that Clint Eastwood is overrated, but that's because he's an actor who is a director (which also rarely works).). <br /> <br /> What ends up on the screen is a garbled image. Chaos of short stories that make no sense are not completed in 5 minutes and entice me to Paris altogether. Why do we call it Paris je t'aime when a better title is cluster f * ck? There are only a few stories to be seen, especially the play by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, but everything else will be forgotten. The Coen Brothers Short is passable, but can you name a movie of them that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar? It's as if all the directors have decided to do what they want and to choose Paris as a place. Since we all love Paris, we are blind to the fact that this movie is SUCKS. I think they've put the names of the directors in each of the short films because the directors have seen how bad a movie is and decided to make sure they were only charged for their 5 minutes. Serious. Ernstig. <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman is not a good actress. She's not a Pixie dream girl waiting to be yours. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Do you look people or do you only have appearances from other films? I look at you: Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace). <br /> <br /> One last commentary on acting: I give double a big kudos to Nick Nolte for acting and looking more human than you have done for centuries or may ever do again. Find his short films on youtube, as his 5 minutes are pretty enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have understood it correctly. I think of Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever, just to name a few. It's much harder to write a complete novel, and only the genuinely gifted can achieve it. The same goes for short films. It seems that only one director will live on in the annals of history. <br /> <br /> If you preserve Paris as a jewel that you can discover with your own story and reflect on your own story, then do not expect to enjoy this movie in the first place. The directors either did not care or were lazy. In both scenarios, if you read this, it means that you have rented it. Praise that you did not pay $ 10 per capita in the theaters.
