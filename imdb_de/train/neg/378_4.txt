... but the keyword is "normally". I'm known for loving movies that EVERYONE considers stupid. But in the world of B movies, THIS Z-Rated is. Absolutely ridiculous. What I respect with most of my favorite B-respect movies is that they do not take themselves too seriously. The makers of films like these treat the film easily, even if it's a heavy topic. However, I have the impression that the producers of this film have taken themselves too seriously, as if they were putting together a 10-star classic, complete with poor attempts at sharp lines and stupid camera shots. Still, I still gave him 4 out of 10 stars because I'm biased towards movies like this one. However, if you're a B fan, I would try too hard to find it.
