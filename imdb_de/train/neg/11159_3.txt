I've seen this movie in a preview and I have to admit that I do not like movies with Meryl Streep that much. This picture was the worst. Half of the theater did not come back halfway after the break. I could not blame her, if that was not a true story, the second half of the picture would have had absolutely no need. Shortly before the film was about ten years forward, I myself expected that the credits appear.
