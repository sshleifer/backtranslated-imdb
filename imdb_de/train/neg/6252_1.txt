Ronald Reagan and a few US soldiers in a North Korean POW camp. They are tortured ... We learn that North Korean communists are bad people ... We learn that the beards of Americans grow very slowly during days of torture ... I tried to suppress them but eventually I burst out laughing about this Movie. It was the scene where Mr. Reagan came out when he told the Communists he wanted to be on their side. Then he asks for a bottle of schnapps. As a sober, sober actor, he takes a drunken companion, Dewey Martin, to fetch sulfur to cure Mr. Martin's hangover. Of course, the communist guard of North Korea is as stupid as they come. The drunk distracts the guard as Reagan comes to a drawer next to a pile of empty boxes. I'm sure the speakers should contain something. But, of course, Reagan causes them to shake enough to show that they are empty. You have to laugh! I think "Prisoner of War" will especially appeal to families and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise it's wasteful. <br /> <br /> * Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton - Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest and Dewey Martin
