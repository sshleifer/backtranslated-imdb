Final Score (average of various classic movie qualities - drama, graphics, creativity, profit, humor, fun, etc): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (of 10) <br /> <br /> Had "Atlantis : The Lost Empire "came out a few years ago. It would have turned out to be a bold, serious new direction in the Disney animation. However, it comes only a year after the innovative and almost ingenious "The Emperor's New Groove" and means a step back to ridding Disney of its repetitive "Disney Formula". I'm a big fan of Disney animated films. Must see that everyone loves or hate it. "Atlantis" is an animated retrospective of "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and similar live-action sci-fi adventures of the 50s and 60s. The problem is that this version hardly contains an original idea. It feels like a remake of something, even more than actual Disney remakes (Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame). The characters are little more than a walking cliche of the usual suspects who usually populate these kinds of movies (the crazy mechanic, the Gung Ho general, the naughty hard women). Beyond Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), the understudy is downright unpleasant. The film also suffers from its pithy pace. Instead of turning it into an epic story, Disney wails a lot in its normally short running time to take advantage of the opportunities to really ... develop something, characters, characters. They throw us into this new and wondrous world and barely get our barings. The awkward pace sometimes makes it a bit confusing, which is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark and dreary and cheap. This thing looks like a cluttered Saturday morning cartoon. Let's hope they have not forgotten that traditional 2D animations can still be wonderful. Among other things, "The Iron Giant" proved that. Negatives: the look, the pace and the sheer lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Positive: Probably the coolest death scene for a Disney villain in a long time. It's the creative highlight of the movie.
