I saw this movie at 3 o'clock in the morning, a time of the day when I'm usually very open when it comes to movies. Still, I think it was not good, this movie was not good at all. The reasons are numerous. <br /> <br /> The acting is not so good, and the situations in which they occurred reminded me of a bad Chevy Chase comedy of the 90s. I mean, come on, like the handcuff situation and the poker situation among the servants ... This movie was obviously very much based on the first one and that's fine. But if I had not seen the first one before I saw it, it would have been worse. Like the end, it came very suddenly, and I felt like I did not get closure, whatever it was ... Sebastian changed very suddenly, and this movie seems like it's just serving No. 1 explain, and there was no time and effort used to do something different. The result is the same as the first, and it did not feel like a movie at all ... <br /> <br /> You should have treated the situations with more style and class, but they did not and that was why this movie is bad ...
