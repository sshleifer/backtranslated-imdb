The WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was overruled by a match at the Excretion Chamber, as it was last year. The difference between the last years and this year's game, however, was the entertainment value. In fact, only three people had the chance to go to the WWE championship from the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York. These men were the current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. No way, Vinnie Mac would put the belt on the rookies; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane last held the WWE Championship in June 1998, and that was only for one night. It was obvious that he would not be the one. The match last year was an exciting affair with six of the best WWE she could offer. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair, but still the match of the night. <br /> <br /> The only surprise of the evening came after the bell at the main event had run. Out of the house, Vince McMahon sauntered and asked her to raise the chamber. It was then announced that Edge cashed his money directly in place in the bank championship game. John Cena had no time to prepare and was no match after winning the elimination match. He lost the title to a spear to one of WWE's most entertaining heels. This was the only entertaining action that went on all night. <br /> <br /> The undercard was really cruel just like last year. Triple H and The Big Show hosted a snoring party where I tried to stay away. HHH won the victory, but that was never a doubt, right? Any pay-per-view with Jerry Lawler and Viscera on the same card will never have a chance to become a success. The king put Helms (who books the stuff?) And Big Vis tasted with the help of his mother against the wasted Shelton Benjamin. <br /> <br /> The WWE women also had a hectic night. There was the usual diva nonsense with a Bra and Panties gauntlet match won by Ashley and the Woman's Championship also on the line. In a match, I thought, would have been left until WrestleMania 22 challenged Mickie James Trish Stratus in a good match. Trish won the competition, but it was obvious that this will continue for the foreseeable future. <br /> <br /> The night's opening competition soon became WWE Champion Edge against Intercontinental Champion Ric Flair. That could have been better, but it was a battered and bloody flair that persisted after a disqualification finish. Edge obviously had a bigger fish to fry. <br /> <br /> So, the New Years Revolution 2006 started the pay-per-view calendar 2006 catastrophically. The only good thing about it is to know that there is only one way for WWE. They will not be much worse.
