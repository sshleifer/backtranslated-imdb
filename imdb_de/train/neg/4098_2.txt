Although this is "better" than the first Mulva (which does not say much anyway, I would rather dry paint), it is still sucking. Do yourself a favor and avoid something from these low budget pictures guys. I was thrilled to buy some DVDs to support some Indian filmmakers, and I have regretted it. Some have not even been officially "published" (not bootlegs bought by the filmmakers themselves) and I can not even state how bad they all are. Avoid something with Teen Ape or Bonejack as they appear in other little Indy movies they are friends with. If you are friends of these guys, chances are that you were in their movies and had fun making them. But for those who had to watch them? Under no circumstance. Bad video, bad sound quality, bad acting, bad plot ... etc. etc. That's not funny. I only gave this one 2 because Debbie Rochon is there and that's it. Maybe it did not even deserve the 2nd. To show a 1/16 star, it was a little better than the first one (which I wish I could have judged negatively). If you want a decent movie with no budget, get some of LBP's "friends" like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes at Freak Productions. That's actually decent.
