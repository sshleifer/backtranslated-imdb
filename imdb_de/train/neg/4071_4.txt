A young man kills a young woman for no reason. The man's brother is detained on charges of being an accomplice, but soon escapes. During the escape, the seemingly innocent man kidnaps three victims and soon he ties his girlfriend into the plot. If that's not bad enough, the situation will quickly turn down. <br /> <br /> This movie had some good and many bad aspects. The strongest aspect was the leading actress Emily Haack. Apart from the fact that she is naked in this film, she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong figure. I see no reason why she can not use this experience and can somehow make career in any way. I was convinced that she was a reckless person. <br /> <br /> The creators of this movie were also very daring and made no move. Graphic nudity (both men and women), coprophagy and extreme anal violence are not deterred. I like it when my horror movies move the boundaries a bit, and they totally ignored them and jumped happily towards Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think they have achieved what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now the negative aspects. First, and most conspicuously, this film is very inexpensive and the film quality shows this. I can excuse that - the plot was decent, the acting good and in some scenes the worse movie actually made the movie more disturbing (a more realistic feeling). Well, I do not scold with bad equipment. What I'm going to scold them for is using bad decisions in shots. For no reason can I say (apart from the clutter of the movie), there's a lot of cemetery footage. I do not really know why, and I honestly fell asleep at that point because it was so long and pointless. <br /> <br /> I also accept the title. The idea here was to get people to believe that this film had a connection to the classic "I Spit on Your Grave." Well, there is a line that seems that the main character is the woman's daughter from this other movie. And the topics are very loose (a woman who takes revenge on men). However, there is no firm connection, and the reason for choosing this title was that the videotape customer thought it would get a sequel. This was deceptive and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last big complaint is that this conspiracy makes no real sense. Not even a little bit. A woman is killed at the beginning for no reason. A prison refugee finds time to abduct people without torturing them (because they hurt his girlfriend?). The same man goes from good to very bad without explanation. Similarly, the female lead (Haack) turns from a normal person to a person who is for no reason too cruel and sadistic, and against people who were mostly marginal (a neighbor offering drugs for sex) wrong, but it's definitely not worth torturing. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by this title or the claim that the movie is unbelievably shocking. Yes, some scenes were shocking, but the vast majority of the movie is boring and lets you take a nap. If you see this in the video library or on Netflix, just keep browsing. Or rent it and we can sit around for hours and air. You were warned.
