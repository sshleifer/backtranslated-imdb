When the movie starts, warns us a narrator. THE SCREAMING SKULL is so horrible that you could die of fear - and if so, a free burial is guaranteed. Well, I do not think anybody died out of fear of this movie, but some may have died of boredom. THE SCREAMING SKULL is a kind of movie that makes Ed Wood look good. <br /> <br /> Very casually based on the famous story of Francis Marion Crawford SKULL is based on a rich but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife marries her died under mysterious circumstances. Once installed in his house, she is plagued by a half-naked gardener, a poorly executed portrait, peacocks, and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and makes her scream a lot. And to her credit, actress Peggy Webber screams pretty well. Unfortunately, their ability to do so is the highlight of the film. The plot is, to say the least, pretty transparent, and although the cast is actually alright, the script is awful and the film is so uninspired that you're ready to scream for yourself. The thing only runs for about sixty-eight minutes, but it all feels much longer. Add a really awful print quality and you're there. <br /> <br /> There are films that are so bad that they are fun. It's true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few howlers - but the movie is so packed with it that I could not get upset anymore than an occasional giggle, and when the whole thing is over your head, your head will roll off boredom , If Peggy Webber's way was not a cry, it would be the surefire remedy for insomnia. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
