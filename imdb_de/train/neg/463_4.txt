Blonde and blonde was unstable. Basically, it was a rip-off of Dumb and Dumber, but it was less funny and they used too much background noise and music. It starts out immensely boring and totally crazy. It does not pick up speed soon, and I felt more frustrated as this nonsense continued for minutes. I found it entertaining and interesting as it neared its end, but that was the only part. Plus, I could not help liking Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards characters a bit. Although this movie did not laugh from me it kept my attention. I would not say I totally avoid this movie, but there are thousands of better movies for which you can spend your time and money than blond and blonde.
