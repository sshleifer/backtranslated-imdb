<br /> <br /> As usual, I was really looking forward to a new TV / movie about one of my favorite topics - a nice change to a * strangely well known * documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad in the History Channel. <I was really looking forward to Pearl Harbor and Enemy at the Gates - but tripped to earth with the recognition of Hollywood's malicious, stupid, and crazy power and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on it. <br /> <br /> So I was excited again about "The Rise of Evil", especially when I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved because I enjoyed his books. I can see why he left off. <br /> <br /> To name a guy responsible for this garbage: <br /> <br /> "The Kershaw book was an academic piece," he said. "It was pretty dry, we needed more incidents." <br /> <br /> Incidents? Are you crazy? One can not say that Hitler's life is without an "incident" - yes, the two-volume Hitler biographies of Kershaw were long and detailed, but they should be. <br /> <br /> The thesis behind "Rise of Evil" seems to be: <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - no, he was a VERY bad man who hated Jews, and for In case you miss that, we will emphasize this in every scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> There was no effort in explaining the mood of the times and why Hitler accepted the views and strategy he made. It is needless to say that this film neglected the fact that almost all the leaders of the Munich communist uprising were Jewish and that this may have colored his views on the subject - in contrast to the generally outstanding "Nazis - A Warning from History" has - and its axiomatic connection of the Jews with Bolshevism - an absolutely crucial aspect to understand much of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But there was not much understanding - the filmmakers did not want to go there, so we got everything we knew anyway. We certainly do not get the fascinating fact that Kershaw alludes to, which means Hitler as a Socialist / Communist shortly after the First World War. Of course, that would be far too complex for the movie and could even distract the ruthless mantra "he was very bad" that keeps bouncing off. <br /> <br /> We know that he was a bad man. However, we also know that he was a fascinating figure both as a public speaker and in private situations. He could be polite and even sympathetic and of course took some views like vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and anti-smoking, which many Guardian readers agreed with. He was also famous for animals, which is why this completely invented scene with dog whips was so absurd. <br /> <br /> He was, after all I've seen, a brave soldier in World War I. While we've seen him with his Iron Cross, we can never see how he won it (bravery was not in the script, it's needless to say). We also have no insight into why he was so fueled by his war experiences, while Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and so many others found it repugnant. And just like the point about the Jewish-Bolshevik connection, this is crucial to anyone's understanding of the subject. Why did he love the war so much? Why did he think it was a good idea, despite massive evidence to the contrary? Why did not he care about his colleagues who died? Or maybe he did - but still drew the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> Also, this movie certainly had nothing interesting to say. <br /> <br /> How often this is The film is a classic example of how to make "history relevant to the present" and to invent things or to omit clumsy facts for "present" - which is often the smallest Do not trust your audience a centimeter, so just jam things down and know (unfortunately rightly) that you'll always get away with it because there are so many stupid fools in the world. <br /> <br /> History is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing it color our present for the better and for the worse. This garbage was a great opportunity to get lost again. They spent millions on it and the scenes and big scenes were impressive, but they did not tell us anything we did not know yet, and did not promote any understanding of that dark time in human history. <br /> <br /> WT
