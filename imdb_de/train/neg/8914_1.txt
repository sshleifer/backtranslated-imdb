I had to stop this movie (a pseudo-intellectual product for presumptuous movie viewers) after twenty minutes because it was mediocre and boring enough to cause yawn, not to mention that I was down for the $ 3.99 I received at Blockbuster had wasted, soon went into tears. Joanna Pacula's acting and terribly presented Slavic accent are so terrible that you can clench your teeth. I knew that two hours from her would be two hours too much. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by inconspicuous actors with strikingly few talents. While we are dealing with talent, Breuer's arrogant assistant seems to have been pulled out of a local drama group. She obviously has not learned her trade. She is really pretty awful. All public scenes looked staged, with the extras mechanically on their Sunday best. Turning off this movie was far more satisfactory than turning it on. Do not rent this horrible movie. You'll be sorry that you spent your money.
