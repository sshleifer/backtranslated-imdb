I saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of the Fast Forward Film Festival, where we borrowed a bunch of B movies and wanted to choose who picked the worst, it was chosen best because of the appearance of plots and fun costumes , <br /> <br /> This is certainly a stupid, cheesy movie that must be viewed with the full understanding that you are watching low budget fluff. Personally, I would not recommend any additional substances. This film leaves a very unique impression on you. <br /> <br /> It made enough impression on me that I actually tried to get mine A copy for a few years. <br /> <br /> A good choice if you want to watch bad movies. That's fun, and I remember jumping music ...
