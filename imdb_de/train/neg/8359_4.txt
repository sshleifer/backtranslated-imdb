Despite a few moments of heavy rain, encounter with a drunk and an organ grinder with a gypsy and a monkey and a stay in a sanatorium, this Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle silent comedy with the support of Buster Keaton and Al St. John is just amusing amusing, though there is a rather funny sequence by Arbuckle flirting with Buster and the ultimate scene for "nice encounters", especially as The Great Stone Face often smiles and laughs in the movies! In addition, many scenes seem to have been spiked, possibly due to overuse of the film's inventory. But if you're an Arbuckle or Keaton executor, good night, Nurse! is certainly worth a look.
