This movie was as gay as its mother and son cat that has sex, they are also scared of little cats cats. They are set on fire by them. the strange thing the mother cat kills a guy by stabbing him with an ear of corn in the back? They are bulletproof. invisible. and what not. The star of the film, Clovis, is the cops cat, Clovis leads the cops to find the mother's aliens, and after the mother kills the cops, Clovis kills the mother by eating her head, then she catches Fire. This movie is shit. It was much funnier than scary, it was not scary at all. the girl hits the alien with a camera on the head, it knocks him out. then she goes and hugs her. then she grabs her and begins to rape her. Again, Clovis comes to the rescue
