After the reasonably successful MASTI, which was slightly better, Indian Kumar returned with the comedy PYAARE MOHAN, which is based on the Hollywood movie SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL. <br /> <br /> The film is reminiscent of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994). Where Squad and Anupam play the blind and deaf <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring exercise. <br /> <br /> The movie has jokes of such nonsense that you do not feel like laughing at Snehal Dabi's head at the back of the horse and all the kind of comedies we do not laugh about now, but mocked <br /> <br /> The movie starts out clich√©d and some scenes are funny. Such moments are unfortunately not the case As long as the story never moves in this half, even the comedy is boring. The Twist is well made and the second half becomes an action movie where the blind and the deaf save the heroines, and we all have OTT chase scenes and battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Indian Kumar's direction is bad. Music is alright, a song stands out. I LOVE YOU MY ANGEL <br /> <br /> Vivek is terrible in the comic scenes, his timing is very bad and in serious scenes all right. For some reason, he always makes comedies and ruines his career. Fardeen Khan is a bit better, but too sneaky Snehal Dabbi is okay
