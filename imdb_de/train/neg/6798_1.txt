This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Everyone involved should be embarrassed. Everyone. Ice-T is pathetic, the dialogue is absolutely terrible and Hokie does not begin to describe the performances of each actor in this film. The plot steals heavily from executive decision, but compared to Air Rage, executive decision material is the Academy Awards. I've never been so disappointed when I saw a movie. Air Rage should be burned with ashes in a vault to never see the light again. Anyone who has seen it should take a shower and wash off the stink of the horrible film. The best part of this movie is probably from the end, when the credits rolled. This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should abide by Law and Order, and the other people in the film should retire early or commit suicide. In any case, they should never try to be in a movie again.
