I'm not from America and I know what "Wife Swap" is. When that show came out, I was thrilled to see some cool, glamorous sexual moments from the program. But what I got was a real stupidity. I was misjudged by the title name, it has no adult content, no nudity, not even vulgar dialogues. > A show that conveys a picture of the current American / Western family state, overweight chubby folks, polluted teens and their suckling family life. In each episode, two wives / two mothers (right) were selected to live in their own homes and change each others' family routines with their own new rule. Sometimes it turns out to be good or even bad. In the end, the mothers are brought back with their husband and try to find out what they have done to each family in the past few days. It's the shitty part of the program where each contestant is fighting for his rights. I was so fucking shitty to see it all instead of seeing cool adult sex stuff. I mean, who does this program, more than the one who gave the name "Wife Swap". It's better to be called "mother swap". All in all, it spoils all the great things that the real Wife Swap stands for! <br /> <br /> Wife Swap = Average Sucking Reality Show.
