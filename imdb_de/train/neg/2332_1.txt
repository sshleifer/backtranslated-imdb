What was the purpose of this movie? I suggest turning a handful of actors and their producers and directors into a big payday if they do nothing. Even my favorite actor Bruce Dern could not keep my interest in this boring movie. A braindead ex-pugilist meets a strange woman and her relatives. He begins as a fix it man for the woman and ends up hitting a man and engaging in a kidnapping. It was so confusing that I can not write a decent review. When you see this, sweetheart, make sure it's after dark so you can go to sleep right away.
