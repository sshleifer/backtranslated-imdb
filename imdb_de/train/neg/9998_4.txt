At the end of the film, I found it too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom, watching our Navy carry out rescue operations at sea. I liked seeing the engines have fire extinguishers. I think I should have found out sooner, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport precious old paintings with very little certainty is strange and unrealistic. The acting was pretty good, as they are mostly experienced professionals, but if you go so far away from what would probably happen, it should be more of a fantasy, weird, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the film had Felix Ungar as a pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night fighter, and Dracula also on board. The movie was filled with familiar faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a little bit for drama, but it hurts the quality of a movie when a serious topic becomes a caricature. That's why I said it should have been weirder. My favorite with movies about air travel is that everyone moves casually. They walk around with drinks, set them down, and pick them up five minutes later, as if they're in a building or something, pretending that there's no turbulence. I also know that this is a disaster movie, but after a hit, a 30 second crash does not have to be considered. However, the talented actors and actresses prevent this faint script from being made into a movie that was put in cans after the first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to see how a psychotic person is covered ... :)
