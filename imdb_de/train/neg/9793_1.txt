Mighty Morphin Power Rangers must be the worst TV show ever made. There is no plot, just some silly, costumed kids using martial arts while dressed in second-grade spandex outfits from a bad comedy, and the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the TV show is the toys, only second-rate plastic waste that is given to our children. <br /> <br /> There are far better shows for your kids! <br /> <br /> Try to give your kids something like Nickelodean, as these shows actually have some intelligence, unlike power rangers.
