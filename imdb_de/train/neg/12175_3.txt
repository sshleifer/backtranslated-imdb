Why watch good movies when you see "Trancers II?" Can read? <br /> <br /> Oh, this movie is so lame. I can just imagine the cast and crew driving through a L.A. camcorder and throwing extras into silly monster makeup on poor, boring Tim Thomerson. The families of the stars actually appear to play cameos, probably because Full Moon could not afford the "right" extras. Lame effects, lame sets, and such an intricate script that takes eons to solve all the knots - that must be classic trance! <br /> <br /> And yet ... and yet ... it rules. Note that this is the same thing I say about "Trancers IV". I say it because it is true. What can you think about watching an old man wearing a trench coat when he has mowed down zombies, and then with jokes like "Do not worry, ladies, are they biodegradable?" Well, many things could be better, but still that's good. <br /> <br /> My only important reservation is Megan Ward, who really stinks the joint. She's a lousy rival to Helen Hunt's character - they're both young female eyes, and it would have been more effective if they had really contrived a little more. Well, you can not have everything. At least the wonderful plot of the "long second clock" is back in place, and we have more of Hap Ashby, the least compelling athlete in the history of cinema (oh wait, he has a rival) in the form of David Ogden Steirs in "Creator"). <br /> <br /> I have not seen this lately, but I remember that Martine Beswick ran away twice during the last battle. Hurray for lousy continuity! Just one of the many highlights in this beautiful movie.
