Elvis Presley plays a "Mischling", a Native American ("Indian") who has to defend his reservation from evil business tycoons. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight and make children. Fighting, wrestling and punching-out replace the stereotypical expression "how"? <br /> <br /> Although he has make-up, it is obvious that Elvis is healthier than in previous films; perhaps he was preparing for his famous comeback. It could not be, because the script of this movie was something to be happy about. Joan Blondell, who tries to seduce Elvis and Burgess Meredith in "war paint", should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (actually "Green Sleeves" with different lyrics). The most embarrassing song is Elvis' love song to the bull "Dominic". There are some surreal scenes, but it never gets too bad for this genre to succeed. However, "Stay Away, Joe" might cause some laughter if you're in the right mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> ** Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
