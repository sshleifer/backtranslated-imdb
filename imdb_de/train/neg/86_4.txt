As a Southern Baptist it hurts me that I have to rate an openly Christian film below average. There are certainly not that many that I want to discourage filmmakers from a genre that is regrettably under-utilized. Nevertheless, I must honestly say that "love lasting joy" is a typically low, self-assured Christian movie. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I am nice) and the cut cruel. As a TV movie, it could have been a little above average, but as a feature film leaves much to be desired. Keep trying, people. You have to have a movie about real Christians in you somewhere. May I suggest that you turn to G.K. Chesterton or C.S. Lewis for inspiration?
