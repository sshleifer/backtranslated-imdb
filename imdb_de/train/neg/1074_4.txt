I should never have started this movie and stopped looking after 3/4's. I missed the really messed-up end. This movie was a disappointment because it could have been so much better. It had a nice atmosphere, a first-class cast and director, good locations. But a Baaaaaad story, a bad script. I paid attention to Kenneth Branagh's southern accent - he was better than the script. The plot was stupid - driven by characters acting in unreal and unlikely ways. No one else behaves like Hollywood scripts.
