Man photographed the Rocky Mountains in Alberta in an outstanding way, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give exciting performances, as it always seems. <br /> <br /> But come to Hollywood - a Mountie who asks residents of Dawson City, Yukon, to choose a marshal (yes, a marshal!) and enforce the law themselves, and then shootings begin the street therefore control of the city? <br /> <br /> Nothing resembles that on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike Gold Rush. Mr. Mann and his company seem to have held Dawson City for Deadwood, the Canadian North for the American Wild West. Canadian viewers should look forward to a kind of reefer madness with this ridiculous plot. disgustingly shake your head.
