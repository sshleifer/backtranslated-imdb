A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to a doctor (James Karen) and tries to conceive. It works, but Adams slowly realizes that something is really wrong with the baby ... <br /> <br /> A pretty interesting idea is thoroughly implemented by a lousy script - the basic idea is fine, but screamingly predictable The End. I saw every "turn" coming. The direction is bad - he seems to have no idea how to turn a basic scene. The production values ​​are - to be nice - bad. Very shabby And the Gore scenes are too uncomfortable (I almost turned them off when a pregnant woman started stabbing in the stomach) with lousy special effects. In the end, the film completely derailed when it became clear that they had no idea how to end this movie. <br /> <br /> Some good plays make it a bit bearable. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are all good in their roles and have been watching me, but that's about it. This film was barely released in 1991 and is still unknown - it's easy to see why. I give a 4.
