I can not help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and rousing. For one thing, it is completely unrealistic that these people will lead a perfect life for their new home. <br /> <br /> How can these families afford to entertain these new mega-houses? And what about her poor neighbors? The property taxes must certainly rise afterwards. Plus, the noise would annoy me. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how exaggerated can a reality TV show be? It's practically the same repetitive garbage from week to week. We are introduced to a suffering family, they renovate the house, then surprise the family and everyone breaks out of the Kleenex boxes. Not to mention how boring the renovation section is. The only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like, but even this segment is destroyed by the fake confessions and the constant sobbing is heartfelt, but it falls flat. Skip this. If you like the reality television, "Survivor" is far superior and moving.
