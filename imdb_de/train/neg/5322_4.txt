There are two types of musicals of the 1950s. First, you have the brilliant MGM productions with big names and great music. And then you have the minor league with a lesser known cast, less famous music and top-notch directors. "The girl can not help" belongs to the latter category. Neither Tom Ewell nor Edmond O'Brien became famous and Jayne Mansfield was famous for them ... well, no matter. It seems every decade has its share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Anderson. The storyline itself is as thin as a razor blade, and one can not help but suspect that this is usually an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard, or any of the 1950s rock acts that appear in the film. If this music appeals to you, it's worth taking a look. If not, do not bother.
