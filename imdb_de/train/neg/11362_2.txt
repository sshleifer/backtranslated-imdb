"Fly Me To The Moon" must be the worst animated movie I've seen in a long time. That says something since I've seen all the animated releases of the last 4 years with my son. The story should be generous ... banal. The voice output is cruel, sounds too sweet. The humor is from the Romper Room variety. The animation is passable for a Nickolodeon cartoon, but is released on the big screen and not on cable TV. <br /> <br /> She only gets a 2 because she has OK 3D visuals. Some of the scenes had a slightly stimulating picture, but in the past we have seen much better. I also doubt the filmmakers' persistence of letting the characters fly off the screen in most scenes rather than driving them inside. While this is interesting at first, it became tiring after the third or fourth time. It seemed to me to be indifferent to the creators. <br /> <br /> But I'll say this: It had a pretty cool soundtrack. And for the album, my son was not that crazy either. Bad movie.
