LETTER ENCOUNTER is a ghastly and pointless remake of the 1945 David Lean classic, based on Noel Coward's drama Still Life. A doctor removes a grain from a woman's eye at the station, he is in a miserable relationship, she is a happily married social worker of Italian descent. On another occasion, they meet by chance, forming an instant attraction and meeting every Wednesday. The two fall in love, but after spending some afternoons together, they realize they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to split up. Coward's original one-act game involved two ordinary people falling in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two superstars and Hollywood Epics veterans, are not an idea of ​​"ordinary people." In particular Loren is in vain - Sophia Loren, who has worked out like a million dollars and works as a volunteer social worker in a Citizen Advice Bureau, does not seem to be true. Burton, who looks ugly, with dyed hair, too much makeup and wearing platform shoes, does not appear as a general practitioner. That is, you can not really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouse. Burton is married to a literary critic who writes toxic reviews in the evenings and treats her husband with utter contempt. Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, makes pottery throughout the day and is boring: the most exciting thing he's ever done is almost an affair six years ago. Your last scene together will cause nausea ("They were far away", etc.). The great British job actor John LeMesurier has a three-minute cameo appearance as a friend of Burton. He seems slightly intoxicated and speaks with barely audible voice his lines. It's a sad and memorable performance in a sombre, horrible rerun of a classic movie. Avoid at all costs.
