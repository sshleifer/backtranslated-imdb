Nothing positive to say. Rolling nonsense, wheezing and puffing with a "message". New Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (cuckoo comes to mind), but many have the bouquet of cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a kind of Dozor emptiness. Spectacle would be terrible, if not the saving grace of extremely unsightly direction and incompetent editing that is sometimes so horrible that it distracts from the powerlessness of the actors. Special price for the cameraman to make sure each shot is shaky (would anyone realize that Blair Witch had unearned fame for 15 seconds?) And is aimed at attention deficit teens who are on counterstrike and masturbating. The female lead posing and trying to look seductive too often, male antiheroes need a diction trainer (though genetics is not bad: more expressive eyes.) One (middle) finger for this irrelevant pile of non-art. Who evaluates this positively, should be a (distant) cousin of the "auteurs".
