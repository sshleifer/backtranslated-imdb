I thought that the low point of the horror film was reached with "Book of Shadows", I was wrong. This movie looks like "The Magnficiant Ambersons" compared to this piece of shameless, unrefined feces that have the audacity to call themselves movies. I would write more, but I'm still angry that I was an idiot to pay 3 euros for the rent, coils. <br /> <br /> And were these people Englishmen? and where is the forest? I've lived two-thirds of my life in the UK and, as far as I know, there are no dark, unexplored forests in the Midlands. The whole thing looked like a coniferous plantation on a national scale. These angels looked like anorexic pornstars (most of them were my research). I liked the piece, however, when Judd was torn to pieces. <br /> <br /> P. I love and admire Tom Savini, but he can not act
