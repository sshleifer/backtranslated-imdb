Serious HOME ALONE / KARATE KID knocks with enough evil stereotypes to have the writer sued and then shot. In almost every scene you could observe an obvious stuntman use. Oh, and the show is shit too. Although I have to say that the line: "I'm sorry, dude, I have to take a big garbage dump," made me laugh.
