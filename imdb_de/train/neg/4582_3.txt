If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend your $ 9 on a used textbook, not for this movie. I am a bit worried that the money I spent is used to buy Kool-Aid for shipping to Guyana. <br /> <br /> I do not think the directors really got any sense, but it looks like they want to make several: 1) Science can explain everything we do, which means ours Life is deterministic; 2) Science can not be used to explain everything we do, which means that we have free will; 3) Science is like a really cool brother; 4) we are god; 5) The world exists only in our heads; 6) Sarah Norman is a tough one and 7) here, put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see something really groovy stuff.
