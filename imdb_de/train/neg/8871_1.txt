I probably see 200 movies a year both in the cinemas and at home, and I can say for sure that this movie is by far the worst I've seen this year. (If not, I did not see "Quest of the Delta Knights."). This movie is just a bad joke after the bad joke for the 13-year-old, and since I had him rude to watch him on a bus trip, I could not go out one in the Mietgang. The four dollars could be better spent for each film by the numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
