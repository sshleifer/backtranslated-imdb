"Laugh, Clown Laugh", published in 1928, shows the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito raised a boulder (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and calls her Simonetta. Tito raised the girl in circus life, and she became an accomplished ballerina. While Chaney performs his usual great performance, I could not overcome the fact that Tito, who is now middle-aged, has the chance for the young Simonetta. Although he is not her biological father, he raised her like a daughter. This kind of "ick" factor permeates the entire movie. Tito competes for Simonetta's affection with a young and handsome 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls in love with the young man, but feels guilty about abandoning Tito (for loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the movie tells Tito what a stupid old fool he is (until he reveals himself in the end). The film is remarkable only because of Loretta Young, who would make a great career. While worshiping Chaney's brilliance as an actor, this whole movie just seems to be scary to me.
