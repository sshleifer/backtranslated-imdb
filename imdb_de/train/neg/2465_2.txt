This would be a Hollywood mediocre if you cut it well. It's based on the typical American thriller storyline - "Who's Outsmarting Everybody". The acting is below average, but with the shiny look of the detective who is the best actor in the movie, and he is mostly responsible when the tension in the movie increases. The movie was suffocated by blank video and sound recordings, and most of it looks like raw footage. All in all, if you do not mind watching a movie that looks like a student movie project, this is a movie you can watch. I think that's enough to say in this film, anything else could really lessen the tension, which is probably low enough.
