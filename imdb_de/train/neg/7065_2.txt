OK, I found this movie in my dad's old movies and he looked pretty good on the cover, but the movie was really shitty !! OK, the first story with the swimmer was pretty good, but it took a while for the boy to be completely retarded. It was not even scary! His dream sounds like the bedtime story of a young child. Then the news girls were left behind too. I'm sure somebody's going to call the newscaster and ask him to go out with you. But this ended up being cool when she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on the TV and he said all this garbage to her. Next up was this pretty gay story about the guy who brought the dead back. It's so stupid that I will not talk about it anymore. The last one was the best. It was not that scary, but the idea of ​​the story was pretty cool. Oh yes, the girl gets obsessed and she kills all her classmates or something. Then, when everyone has shared their dreams, the losers get on the bus (TO HELL AHAHAHAH) and they see all the people in their dreams on the bus (Ha). The end.
