That could have been interesting? a Japanese haunted house story from the perspective of a newly installed American family? but remains flat due to over-simplified treatment and the inappropriateness of cast and director. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from the same problem that I often have with the popular modern renaissance of such indigenous fare, ie the fact that the spirits prove to be evil for no real reason except that they are expected ! Besides, it does not deliver much in the anxiety department? a huge crab attack is just stupid? In general, the spirits inhabit a particular character and cause him or her to act in completely untypical ways, such as Susan George, who seduces the diplomat / friend of the family Doug McClure, and Edward Albert, who forcibly feeds his daughter a bowl of soup! <br /> <br /> Once, an old monk appears in the house to warn Albert of the danger if they stay there. Finally, he is asked to exorcise the premises. However, the story has to repeat itself and a tragedy is the only result of the tense situation that has been duly created. This leads to a violent, but unintentionally humorous climax, in which Albert and McClure, obsessed by the ghosts of their Japanese predecessors, lead a spontaneous karate duel to death! At the end of the day, it becomes a harmless waste of time. tolerable at only 88 minutes, but by no means indispensable consideration.
