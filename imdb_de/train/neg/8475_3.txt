(NOTE: I thought I was the only one who wrote what I did below, but I see that the others here agreed to write :) <br /> <br /> The owners took a two week vacation - A trip to California - and the cat (New Year's Eve) left alone and locked up in the house. That means no milk, but the cat finds, to his relief, a bunch of canned tuna. To his dismay, however, he can not find the opener. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the little mouse in the house has it ... and the cat lures it. This is a common rodent who teases Sylvester with the opener and pulls him off at the last second. Sylvester tries everything possible to open the tuna can, but can not. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story and why they make the sadistic mouse a "good thing" is a mystery to me. It's like some of the Tom & Jerry cartoons where poor Tom always gets the worst of it, even if the little mouse often triggers the conflict!
