The following happened: <br /> <br /> 1) The head of BBC3 must create programs that target different audiences to keep their licenses and jobs. <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry offers his touseless friends. <br /> <br /> 3) The boss of BBC3 picks them up and completely ignores the fact that they are not funny. The characters play bad stereotypes. If a white man does such a thing, there would be turmoil! <br /> <br /> Trash.
