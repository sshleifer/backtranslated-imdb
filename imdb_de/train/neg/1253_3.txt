I read somewhere that Hollywood should focus on making bad movies and leaving the classics alone. We can only hope. Although this remake was not a total waste, I still wished I had the six dollars back to go to a DVD of the original. Much violence and one of the worst endings I've ever seen. This version adds nothing new. It is only repeated why Hollywood should leave the good stuff alone.
