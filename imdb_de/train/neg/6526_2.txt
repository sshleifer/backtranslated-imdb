A hopelessly awkward and boring film in which the characters stand around in rooms or on a rocket ship talking endlessly. If you explore Mars, you might think things would budge, but these scenes are filmed by a strong red / orange filter that makes everything very murky. The Martian landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are absolutely unconvincing. There are echoes of "Bride Of The Monster" when the heroine cautiously wraps around the octopus like a tentacle of a carnivorous plant before faltering, except that the Ed Wood movie is a hundred times more entertaining. Wear earplugs better if you are watching. Otherwise, you will be driven crazy by the endlessly repeated "sci-fi" music. If you can not sleep one night, just put it in the VCR and your insomnia will be cured in no time.
