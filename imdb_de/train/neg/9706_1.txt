... and I actually gave him a ZERO on my personal 1-10 scale. I have been watching movies since 1952 and have seen well over 1000 in the theater (I do not rate films that I only see on TV). This is the ONLY movie I've ever rated ZERO. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (then 15, 11, 8 and 6), and even the kids thought it was awful. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who drew my attention to this page (amazed that the film received an overall rating of 4+). <br /> <br /> The animation of the dinosaurs was amateurish at the time (and is even worse in retrospect), the drama (especially by Sean Young) is cruel and the plot is just stupid. <br /> <br />
