Only the gland secretions of the young virgins - and please do not ask for further details - can keep the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the crazy old gardener gardener fresh and youthful. Since the virgins, like most people with the exception of doctors, seldom hand over their secretions voluntarily, Dr. med. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) that they are kidnapped and preserved. He will do the extraction himself. <br /> <br /> What a great cheese ball from a premise for a horror movie with a low budget. If The Corpse Vanishes does not turn out to be Havarti of Dread, it leaves an interesting aftertaste as a simple Limburger. <br /> <br /> Sure, the spectacle is almost terrible, except for the actors who were lucky enough to play the crazy dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played The Master in Mad Max beyond Thunderdome); his crazy fool of a brother Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the hair of the virgins; the crazy mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the crazy woman (Elizabeth Russell), who sleeps in a plush coffin, and of course the crazy doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> The young reporter Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters) is looking for the doctor because of a strange orchid with a particularly sweet smell, which was carried by the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay overnight, a violent storm breaks out immediately. This clue tells us that violent violence will erupt inside. Since it is known that in Hollywood at the time all unmarried young women were virgins, Pat could bring some unpleasant surprises. These include dark passages, a crunchy lab where an almost dead maiden is kept, a mausoleum in the basement, and later a direct threat to Patricia's own glandular secretions. If she survives, what story must she give to her editor. <br /> <br /> If you try this damp slice of moldy Velveeta (and why not? Do not be fooled), do not judge Bela Lugosi for the company he keeps here. He had a great influence in Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie of his is The Black Cat (1934). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast is a sad, ironic man who protects his two young friends. When he finally brings a scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and starts screaming the man alive, that's a great scene.
