I can not believe the same guy ran this crap and Dracula in 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well written if it did badly. This bunch can not even claim that. It begins with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then ignore the narrative that describes what happened afterwards. According to the story, this might have made a good sequel, but Craven opted for the style of his older films because he did not have a good relationship, but the name of the main villain. Even the actor who played Dracula was different (from dark hair in Dracula in 2000 to a blonde here). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you have respect for your taste in movies.
