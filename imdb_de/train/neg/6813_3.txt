Jean Rollin artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and the search for immortality. <br /> <br /> The women are beautiful and the photography breathtaking. The dialogue is crazy. It's a ridiculous mess. Great to look at, but horrible as any appearance of a horror movie or thriller. I try to find out if we are scared or not. Is it an investment at the same time or not? It's a curious mix of art film and horror that never really meshes, and although she's pretty to look at, she never seems to "mean" anything, and it's not scary at all, even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frizzing presumptuous ambiguity. Something that has to leave behind in the background as a living wallpaper for those who like naked women.
