Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a stupid, terrible Ninja movie, do not make a mistake. But it is also incredibly pleasant. This is largely due to the great presence of a Chuck Connor, who is billed as a movie actor in the film, but really shines in a few scenes. I suppose he should be some kind of Obi Wan Kenobi guy ("The Hard Ninja Buster," the box copy exclaims), but his "wisdom" is ridiculous. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says this is a sign of mental disability, not highest concentration. But really, his two helpers, Sonny and Dennis, have such a terrible dialogue that Brooklyn, as we tend to shine in comparison to. Pay particular attention to Dennis's logic regarding "genetic splicing" in which the sakura participates. If you know something about cloning, you will laugh. And yes, that's an important plot point, guys. <br /> <br /> Sakura Killers is a terribly fun movie, a hard-to-find gem. I will not spoil the 'trick' for you, except that it is perfect for a Sakura Killers 2. Too bad that Chuck Connors died. :-( Because he has one of the gentlest ways to blow ninjas away.
