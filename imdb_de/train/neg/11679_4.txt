First, this movie is not a "thriller". It is also not "gripping, tight". It may be based on the script, but the slow pace of the direction makes it difficult to get in. The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately, we only get a sense of how awesome it is after the picture is over. As a result, we spend over two hours playing long sequences of music interrupted by some action scenes that do not grab the viewer. I wish that was the thriller that the box promised. It would have been an excellent movie. Instead, Spike Lee let it go through to the end.
