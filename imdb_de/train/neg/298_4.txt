Daraar had a pretty good start. The first scene really left me at the edge of my seat and asked me what would happen next. Apart from that, the first half of the movie is a total hole. In the first half of the movie, Rishi Kapoor falls head over heels in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do not you think he's a bit old for her? <br /> <br /> Things are finally starting to turn in the middle of the movie as Juhi tells us about her former husband; and wow, what a madman he is! He was a protective, decent freak with a really hot TEMPER! He beat up poor Juhi for no good reason! One of the reasons why I really dislike this movie is that I can not bear to see Juhi (my favorite actress) being so abused. This movie generally has too much abuse and bloodshed; I find it so unpleasant !!! Anyway, I'm just trying to say, if you're thinking about renting Daraar, you should put it back on the shelf where you found it!
