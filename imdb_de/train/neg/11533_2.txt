If derivative and predictable rape thrillers are your thing, then you have a rare treat ... They do not really appeal to me, so I could not find anything to save this weird story. It seems to be something direct from the eighties, another era in which this would have gone straight to the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer work well with a weak script and a boring scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing after a brilliant appearance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year with such a movie? The director is said to have been influenced by a nearby rape and his work on documentary films, but even that is no excuse for the bizarre scene in which a pack of land dogs beat Dyer. I do not think I was the only person in the cinema who laughs. What I can not understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in several major UK independent films in recent years. Verve Distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve realize: Is this really the best you can do? What will independent British filmmakers judge of your artistic judgment? It is a great spot for both your reputation. Listen carefully: Can you hear that thousands of fans of independent British films are crying desperately?
