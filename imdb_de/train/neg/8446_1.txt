Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen ... Can anyone tell me where to laugh? There is not a single hint or shadow of an idea. The three main characters are pestilent, especially the (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily, who can put a Sicilian accent !!! Not to say about the dreamlike insertion of Dracula ... just another tool that comes from the worst cabaret tradition to keep this "movie" a bit longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called movie was really too hard to rescue. I would have given it "0" / 10 but the lowest grade was 1/10 and I had to overestimate it by one mark.
