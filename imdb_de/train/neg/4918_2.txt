A wealthy Harvard guy falls a poor Radcliffe chick much to the dismay of his stern father (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> Syrupy, sugary and, above all, juicy story about a class struggle When rich kid Ryan O'Neal brings home a librarian who ridicules his snobbish parents. Ali MacGraw is the dirty-headed social madness while John Marley plays her devout Catholic father, but no one in the movie is more annoying than O'Neal himself with his whimpering portrayal of Harvard's Champion Yuppie. <br /> <br /> 8 (!) Years later followed 'Oliver's Story'.
