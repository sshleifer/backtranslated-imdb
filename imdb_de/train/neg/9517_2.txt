Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time. Meet me in St. Louis, the evil and the beautiful. I expected this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some Came Running is scene after scene of fatal fatalism. Sinatra is a sad sack who has returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships. He is disappointing and hangs in disappointing circumstances as a girl gets him to finish his disappointing writing project. The film has a big dramatic ending in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. The sequence should be tense, but Minelli is not a Hitchcock; he is so distracted by pretty colors, he does not realize that the scene is a knocking cliche and the characters are so thin and poorly developed that we do not care much about being shot. (especially MacClane) But that's the only real camera in the project. Otherwise, we look at stuffy characters who are in bars and living rooms and for two hours on the nerves. Hell IS apparently other people. <br /> <br /> There's nothing going on in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to expulsion and indifference after the Second World War is treated more skillfully in "The Best Years of Our Life." And one of Inge's two products, "Splendor in the Grass" and "Picnic", covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead end with much more power.
