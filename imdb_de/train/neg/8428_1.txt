Despite the mysterious positive reviews and high rating, this is a horrible movie. Terrible enough that I feel obligated to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the last period of the Raj as India's struggle for independence begins. What follows in the ridiculous conspiracy simply fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave does not convince me that the characters exist at this time. <br /> <br /> For example, would the young married Hindu housekeeper from the village have an affair with her married Englishman Master, knowing that the discovery of the affair would probably amount to complete social exclusion and shame, if not the death penalty? ? Unlikely, but maybe. But would the same young Hindu maid in the conservative Indian society of this epoch proceed like a half-naked Britney Spears in the heat, taking part in hot outdoor sex in daylight in the open, where they could be spotted any moment? Not only is not bloody unlikely, this is a delayed plot line. <br /> <br /> Such idioms along with the bad acting drove me to leave the cinema one hour after the movie, so I did not see the second half of the movie. One can only hope that the end has more intelligence than in the first half.
