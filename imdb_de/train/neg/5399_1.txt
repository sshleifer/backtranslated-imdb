SPOILER Hollywood's Shakespeare adaptations too often entertain movies. Beautifully shot, they are well executed and faithful to the text. Films, including Branagh's "Henry V" and 1993 "Much Ado About Nothing", are a big piece of work. If you look at Love's Labor's Lost, it's a great disappointment to expect to be thrown so badly in the garbage. Unfortunately, "Love's Labor's Lost" is terrible! The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends have for three years renounced alcohol and women to concentrate on their studies. However, the plans begin to fall apart as the enigmatic Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and her entourage arrive. Soon love is in the air and philosophy is out of the mind of the prince. <br /> <br /> You can tell from the beginning that the movie is not quite Shakespeare. Ken Branagh was skilfully moved to a 1930s musical, the plot is still there and the script remains, but now it was sacrificed in favor of the bleak musical taste. Classics like "How you look today", "Let's do the music and the dance", "I'm in heaven" are all destroyed by the weak vocals and the feeling that they just do not belong here. <br /> <In addition to the weak singing, more and more uncomfortable performances of regular stars are expected. Ken Branagh and his friends may make the movie, but they offer us a number of roles that turn the stomach upside down. <br /> <br /> The eight main characters (four men and four women) are all equally bleak and the only positive thing for them is a huge improvement over the really terrible Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> In fact, only one person leaves the film, which deserves all praise, and that's the all-time great Nathan Lane. Lane has proven over the years that he is a comedic genius. In this function he adds humor to the joker Costard. <br /> <br /> There is hardly anything else to say. "Love's Labor's Lost" deserves gentle tribute to Branagh's original version of an ancient story. Unfortunately, the positive aspects end here. Weakly played, performed, sung and constructed, "Love's Labor's Lost" is perhaps the weakest Shakespearean adaptation of the last forty years. It should be avoided like the plague and should never have been done. A bad, disappointing decision from Branagh and hopes his next assignment will be better.
