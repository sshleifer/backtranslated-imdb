I understand that the Diehl character is a microcosm of America itself - to see Arab terrorists under every rock, but in the end find out that it is his own actions that have brought him into this state of siege, and really, if he practices goodwill to all men, everything will be rainbow and lollipop. I am sorry that in the past you have made amazing films that remain politically neutral. For good reason polemics are your weak point and they weaken this well-made, amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters, dialogue and conspiracy. Good luck with the next movie. Another thing that got me cranked up was the kinky point where the LA homeless section was there for starvation, these people do not get enough to eat. Actually, these people do not eat royally, but the real hunger is a spiritual hunger, an emotional hunger, a mental hunger. You need self-esteem, self-esteem and dignity that you can not give to a man. Yes, these people are hungry and if they need it, it is available. Less the center for hunger in America, I would say it's more like the center for alcoholism, drug abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. While dealing with hunger is a noble endeavor, it does support a more systematic social and ancient human problem of homelessness. Bill Diehl, however, was good and Michelle Williams was sweet as the young, but (clich√©d) old soul.
