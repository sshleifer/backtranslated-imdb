This movie had a great start. It had the potential to turn into a truly heartbreaking, romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between "Harlan" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really did not have to be anymore and for a moment I was excited that someone finally made a beautiful movie for themselves, another timeless classic, a modern myth. Why, oh why, then half ruin it by turning the main character (Norton) into another psycho. Maybe I miss the point, but do we really need another movie about psychos? Or is it this need in Hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature, which suggests a more general malaise in the film industry? For a moment I would remember the name of the director. Now I feel indifferent. At the very least, in defense of the film, it should be added that all actors seemed to be investing in their roles. Evan Rachel Wood is also very nice to look at and a good actress with a lot of potential.
