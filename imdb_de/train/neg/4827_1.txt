If this movie is to stop people from taking drugs, it will fail. I was ready to use them, I had to wait until something happened and nothing really did anything. This movie is neither horror nor drama. It's just the paranoia of meth users. This movie can be obtained so often and so uselessly for using the word "F". It was not exactly said, but I felt they were using meth to replace meth they owed someone. Hector was getting worse and more paranoid as the movie went on and the girl just became hopeless. The end really did not make sense. The movie did not make sense unless it just showed how annoying it is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a meth head. I relied on the other feedback when I decided to watch this movie, and the rating for this movie should be a much lower average.
