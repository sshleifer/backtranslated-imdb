Much worse than the original. It was really * painful * to get upset, and it barely held my six-year-old's interest. <br /> <br /> The introduction of some new Pok√©mon is not very interesting, but the plot is extremely thin, the dialogue is still bad and music is mediocre. Watch the TV show instead - it's much better.
