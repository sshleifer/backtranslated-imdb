For the local audience, I can see how they would appreciate this movie. For outsiders who had no interests, it did not make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetent and the Russians as heroes. The supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction. How a young woman could "love" the lieutenant by only briefly seeing him was nonsense. How she, as mentioned at the end of the film, could never marry because of this infatuation, was a mystery to me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots, and this was exemplified in the persecution in the swamp. Several hundred German troops advanced and forced the Russians into the swamp. So the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of the swamp and just stood there and listened. I suppose they did not want to wet their boots, but I'm sure an officer ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the swamp. But that would end the story. In addition, the Germans entered the stable where the Russians hid in the attic and did not fire themselves into the roof. In the worst case, a soldier would have thrown a grenade into the attic and had not climbed any ladder to look inside. <br /> <br /> I saw some reviewers crying in the end. I wonder why? They knew that this little band would go down and they were nothing the heart desires.
