I do not know what it was about this movie that made me react so sharply. Maybe it was the characters who were so unlikely and not compelling enough to care. Maybe it was the disorganized plot. Maybe it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long earring and an eyeliner. Maybe it was because sometime in the movie everyone broke out in song. Maybe it was because the 1980s were never the 80s. Maybe it was because everything was a sharp exaggeration. Maybe it was because a character is pumping his fist while fading away from the camera while fading out. I do not know what made me hate it that way, but if it means trying again, I'm not ready to find out.
