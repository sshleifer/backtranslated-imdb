I had such high hopes to adapt a classic story like the Arabian Nights. Instead, I was disappointed with a movie that did not hold my attention from the start, even though I tried twice !! <br /> <br /> It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie, but it was not worth much because the actors lacked the sympathy. For something like that, Zorro's Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras are far better for action, comic moments, and general joy. <br /> <br /> OK, so Son of the Dragon has a lot of potential fans out there, but if you're looking for something you can say about martial arts and story line, it will not be. If you want children to settle on a Sunday afternoon, maybe it will be for you and the 3 ninjas.
