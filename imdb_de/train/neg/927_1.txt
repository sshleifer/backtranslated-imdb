I mean, how could Charles Band, the head of Full Moon, let out a totally stinking ball like DEMONICUS? I mean, it should never have the green light for a start. The story repeats, the characters are weak at best, there is no real story about Tyranu unless he's a bad guy. Then you go as a writer or director for a bad ending. That's really a bad ending, Demonicus rises. The last survivor escapes a deadly cave, then a picture of Chimera comes alive, cheap I can add and chase her out. Then she goes home, like a FUNHOUSE. A statue destroyed centuries ago reappears without reason to collapse on her. I mean, that does not make sense. What the hell thought Charles, who made this crap, with four different film companies, they were so desperate for movies. You could have asked me, I had better ideas than DEMONICUS. THANKS TO TURKEY.
