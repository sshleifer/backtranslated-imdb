Before I saw this movie, I read a review here saying that this movie could possibly be one of the best movies ever! ha ha scene after scene, the tension grows good ... from the annoying characters in this movie. From the little girl who spoke gibberish, trying to drown the little boy, to the murderer who ran around without warning (and who the guy on the beach was talking to the little boy?) Unanswered in this movie. When I saw it, it seemed like the movie was going in one direction, then it's just not going anywhere, but in a new direction ... and on and on ... <br /> <br /> The acting is great, but the writing is terrible. Every character in every scene says or does something so unbelievable, unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow / extras are just weird. There are no solutions to the problems that have developed throughout the film, making it confusing and ultimately a waste of time.
