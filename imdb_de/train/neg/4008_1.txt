As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, I find this series a gross performance of it. Vampire Bill does not look very good and looks much older than described in the book. I've found that they already have wonderfully colorful characters that look very natural and vulgar. One of the things I loved about the books is that Sookie is always a lady, despite all the crap she's going through, and in the TV series, she does not seem to be that way at all. Not only that, even the prejudices of the television series are not nearly as common in the books. I did not expect an exact replica of the books, but at least I expected them to feel like the series.
