After revisiting "Lipstick" for the first time in several decades, I supported it with "Descent," though I've heard from other movie friends more negative comments than good, whose tastes are as different as mine. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see how the unique niche of the movie "Rape Revenge" has evolved over the last 32 years, from "I Spit On Your Grave" to the sensational "Lipstick" the tasteful treatment of the problem in "The Defendant". But "Descent," though highlighting some important points, never really offers anything new to us in terms of the revelation meaning. No, "Descent" is so bad in terms of image and sound quality that it distracts any important message it might hope for - a message that, on closer inspection, is not groundbreaking. <br /> <I knew pretty well how the conspiracy started. What I wanted to see was the descent or degeneration of Dawson's character. I was a big fan of Rosario, and I really wanted to see the layers removed and their psyche slowly twisted ... you know, the kind of portrait that brings DeNiro to Taxi Driver. Unfortunately, the script and director / writer selection do not provide credible transitions. <br /> <br /> The biggest point of failure is the second act. It was obvious what the filmmaker did with this segment of club hopping, drug use and obsession with the big black stallion Adrian (nightmare of every white boy) out of one Q & A intended on the DVD, but this excursion into Dawson's character has never rendered credibly. We do not know exactly what the hell she does half the time, what she wants or why she does it. The poor quality of audio / video does not help, but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless. It destroys all impulses and investments in the main character that was created during the otherwise exceptionally good first act. When we reach the final, our interest is already weakened. <br /> <br /> One point of Dawson's success in the questions and answers is that we are being retaliated at the end of the "revenge" scene. then you realize how tedious and ugly the reality is. This is valid, but does not make the scene more fascinating. <br /> <br /> If you have the DVD, look at the deleted "classroom" scene. This is an excellent 8-minute outtake that crackles with energy and provocation (though it's all verbal) and really shows that Dawson's slow cracking material materializes while delightfully bringing to life the poor Francie Swift, the condescending dorm room advisor. If more exposing scenes like this one had been added and more cut out of the middle third, we might have an interesting psychological study on the effects of senseless acts of violence. <br /> <br /> While the film is in the final cut We only get what we saw before, but in a more graphical rendering. So what?
