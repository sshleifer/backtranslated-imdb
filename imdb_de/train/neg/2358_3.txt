In the future of 2001, Freddy is the last surviving teenager on Elm Street. Leaving EVERY fear of funny attempts with humor and unnecessary cameos of celebrities (come on ... Roseanne ??? Tom Arnold? !! ?? WTF?), This is part 2. Wow that was a piece of crap. Even the great legendary Alice Cooper could not let the stench of this film disappear. And if they were to hell, did Freddy ever have a daughter? The entire film is greatly delayed in shape and form in every possible way. Rachel Talalay, you're stinking, baby. <br /> <br /> My Rating: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Cast and crew bios; Jump to the 3D sequence and jump to a Nightmare option (see the seventh DVD in The Nightmare Collection DVD for extras for the movie). <br /> <br /> DVD Rom Content: Trivia Game; Script; and weblink
