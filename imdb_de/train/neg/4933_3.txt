Compared to the first two sequels of the original, this movie was not so bad. Directed by Martin Kitrosser on Friday, 13th fame. The drama is indeed very bad, but the gore and special effects make it interesting. That's one thing I like about Screaming Mad George (make-up effect artist for the movie). Its effects are so unconventional and bizarre that you'll see a bad movie just to find out how crazy they get. The movie is not really that bloody, but there is an EXTREMELY nasty scene in the middle of the eyeball, in which a toy-maggot (what?!) Mickey Rooney is a guest of which he was probably not so enthusiastic, but needed could the money possibly be at the time? If you liked the 4th trick of the weirdo (my favorite of all 5), you will probably like it. I liked it better than the matrix! Enjoy.
