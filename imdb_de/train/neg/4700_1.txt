I totally hated the movie. It was so left behind. They need acting classes ... no, wait, that will not help because the Naked Brothers Band people are just holding back. Do you know why I'm here even though I'm a Naked Brothers band hater? To warn people, before they watch the stupid movie, so that the NBB does not get any money out of it, they can not do stupid amateur songs that are so cautious that any old man could write them in 10 seconds. The lyrics are not only restrained, they sing badly. Okay, somehow I'm getting out of the movie ... anyway, it was boring and they acted terribly. It was not funny at all, even though they really tried to be it. I guess they deserve some credit ... Well, the movie is not worth your time. Just look at the rating. The film (and the series) is very painful for anyone who has only half a brain. Seriously, if you liked it, you need to watch movies in which the actors are actually acting, rather than in a monotonous line. I'm in the theater club of my school and some people are actually better than these guys from Nat and Alex. Hurry up, before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poopie. I do not even know why I went through half of this movie. I do not think it deserves a movie ...
