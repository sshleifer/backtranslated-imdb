I would have given this movie a 1 in 10 if it had not been for MS. Claudine Barretto's performance. and I will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino is here. and ... end. <br /> <br /> I really avoided looking at Pinoy horror movies because the stories lack originality, and I really think that (some) authors do not pay enough attention to the characters (and their progress) stories (superfluous? ?). it was as if they "pushed" the movie when their story stank. and my goodness, creative exhaustion made her rip off other films. Why?? Why did this movie get a good review? I would not deserve that much credit. The film was scary to KIND OF, but the movie seemed to be more freaky as it dealt with Filipino folklore ... it's in my list of the "most likely to be expected" category. I just wish they had spent more time improving the stories and fixing the Flash back sequences, no matter if the lights were shit, it would not matter much if the content blew you away.
