This movie is by no means as bad as "Perfect Stranger", but it was just not funny. It could not live on a kind of comedy - it jumped from SNL to Adam Sandler-esquire, to romantic little guys, to slapstick, to "loser" (the movie) comedies. Although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments (the crash of the hill), no one was particularly funny or outstanding in any way. "Schindler's List" was funnier (and felt shorter). They never knew if Andy Samberg should be in high school, a drop-out or just a loser who lived at home with his mother - Sissy Spacek - in her worst role choice. And poor Ian McShane, THE serious actor, if I had to name just one, gets crap to read him into the camera. The story draws and is completely predictable to the end (no spoilers here in case Adam Samberg's mother wants to see it). Do not spend money to see this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels will get the hint and produce quality movies (yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy are quality).
