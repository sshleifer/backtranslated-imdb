.... seems to be far-fetched ... but there really was a true life story ... of a man who had an affair with a woman who found out where he and his new wife lived, and she killed a woman so that it looked like a murder rape ... In her delusion, she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him. So she left her job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota .......... <br /> <br /> The last time I heard she was in a mental hospital, in the security prison. ... She is still wearing the "engagement ring". that she bought herself ... and told everyone that he had bought it for her. <br /> <br /> The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin, USA, and the murder took place in Minnesota ...... <br /> <br /> There was even a feature story in the magazine "People" ... Spring 1988, I would like to say on page 39. I remember when I was in college at that time, and a colleague of mine had met the person at Security Hospital ...
