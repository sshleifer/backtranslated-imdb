Something that is really wrong with the theory of Al Gore (and his followers) is the whole thing about consensus. If there was such a consensus, then why are the "believers"? "In almighty global warming, we feel the irresistible need to bully anyone who questions them. <br /> <br /> Why is it? That anyone who is not concerned with global warming will be complacent, either being stupid or on the payroll of oil companies (apparently a professional researcher of global warming, does not mean you have anyone in this wondrous world anybody's payroll ...) Why is it so important to tell everyone how and when the whole question has been clarified It is in the nature of science to honestly question assumptions For some ideas to answer these questions, read Prey from the well-known oil trader Michael Crichton ... oh, he is rich and is not on the payroll of oil companies, he just took a big career risk by not sticking to the line of the greens and other Kyoto supporters held and told the truth when he explored them. By the way, did you know that adhering to the Kyoto Protocol would not lead to a drop in temperature, according to its own financiers? Just a few questions Al Gore made sure not to be stopped by him so he would not get every penny of the environmental lobby in case he wanted to run again. <br /> <br /> So, who is a cripple ...?
