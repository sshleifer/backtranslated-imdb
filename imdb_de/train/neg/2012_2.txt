Life in a future fascist or near fascist state, which severely restricts personal liberties, is a recurrent theme in both modern literature and filmmakers. Such work gives us warnings about unwanted trends in our society that need to be taken into account; but to be effective, they also have to be entertaining. Unfortunately, most books are likely to be more effective at publishing alerts than entertaining us enough to really read them; For the movies, the problem is usually reversed. The first such work that became well known was probably George Orwell's "1984" (first published in 1948), and it is still available in both book and movie form. <br /> <br /> Watch or read it: and if you feel a little depressed by man's inhumanity for humans, grab Cinderella 2000. This is a featherweight, low-cost movie comedy based on the same Theme-based, offering an effortless but uninteresting reputation. and as in 1984, the calendar has now gone beyond its earlier period. Most comedy is done with a trowel, although there are only a few really funny moments. To practice your thoughts in the long intervals between them, you can focus on the question of whether this film will receive a new life extension by being released on DVD, or if it will eventually be forgotten, as existing tape copies will decrease after release. Nowadays, there are many worse movies that appear on DVD, and honestly, I do not care what happens either way. <br /> <br /> So far the best movie in this genre has probably been "The Handmaidens Tale". But I would love to exchange them all for a well-made film of Jack London's novel "The Iron Heel". As ambitious as it may be, it is still unbelievable that no modern filmmaker dared to give it a try (IMDb lists only a b / w silent version from 1919 in Russia).
