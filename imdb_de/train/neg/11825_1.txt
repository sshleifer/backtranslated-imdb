This movie is a blatant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner by George Eliot. <br /> <br /> The details of the film shown on IMDb give credit to the original author, but I did it. I do not see that at the beginning of the film, only the end reads: "proposed by the book Silas Marner. " Recommended? It was nothing but a complete rip-off of all the essential elements of the story: <br /> <br /> A naughty and sad old man, a craftsman, poor and lonely, has stolen all his money. One night a child walks to his door while his mother dies outside in the snow. The man picks them up and brings them up until one day the local squire (or the rich politician here) wants to adopt the child. He fathered the child years ago in an illegal affair. Then it comes to the fight, who should have the custody of the child. In this and in every other aspect of the movie, the story is exactly the same. In only one can I find a difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy - but that might have strained Mr. Martin's acting skills too much. He also dyed his hair in a carrot juice preparation (presumably to make him look younger, but in fact he looks more like the clown he is)! There are also pointless jokes that this unusual comedian can not resist to bring in the story, which has no part in it, and only affect the depth of the story. Like when the child cries in the courthouse and declares that it can only be happy with the man who has witnessed it all these years. This is taught in the film by the girl who applies nasal decongestant to the bridge of the nose to make her whine. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that legitimacy and integrity within the film industry allow the production of such a film. If I were a steward of George Eliot's, I would insist on indemnity. If I were Steve Martin, I would send the profit to this country or to the poor. At least it should be called Silas Marner - adapted by S Martin. Or better still from the archives! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - and I hope you are - you should completely reject this and have a look at Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC did a great job in the 1980s.
