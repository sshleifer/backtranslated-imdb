I love all kinds of movies, especially horror. That being said, Survival does not do ANY of the hype surrounding it. <br /> <br /> I can not point out the originality. There is nothing wrong with exploring the same topics or recreating what others have done. It has just become an indie film police officer taking us on a slasher journey through the forest, throwing a crazy killer, and occasionally throwing in a crazy family. In this regard, I have to compare it with those of Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (though the phrase is obvious in this variant) and others. Survival is similar to movies. The plot was in no way original. Some movies can do with a weak (and far too far) plot with great drama, special effects, or a host of other factors. Survivial has nothing to rely on. If you like, note the following: Acting in the movie never started. I'm not knocking on the actors or the director. The dialogue was mediocre at best, and the actors involved never had the talent to do it. I mention 2 standouts. The lead actor in this movie certainly has the look, but I seriously think he needs to consider more training before he's ready to wear a movie. The actor who portrayed Greg also had potential, but we never saw any of it (watch the movie to see why, you will not believe it ...). <br /> <br /> The grainy movie look. Oh yes, this little bit of film magic that is supposed to lead us to the glory days of the "Grindhouse" movies. In today's filmmaking this has become a gimmick. It works either or not. In this case, it just does not work. There are too many other mistakes, so the film is distracted from the movie and does not contribute. I think they have added this crop well. This is good quality grain. I think with another script, better direction, and maybe actors, they should try another try at Grindhouse. They will probably do it. <br /> <br /> As far as the technical aspects are concerned, in my opinion, they have never really suffered. It would have been better to deal with audio (sounds like it was fed directly into the camera, but there is nothing to complain about) and for the recording on DV, it was too soft for my taste. <br /> <br /> That's all I have to say ...
