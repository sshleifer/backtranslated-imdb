The final song by Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately, that's all I can say about this western movie. I have to write 8 more lines to be able to post my comments, but there are more than 8 lines terrible in this west. I am not sure if the movie was a homage to Hopa Along or just a parody. The hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic. Not realistic at all Many of the supporting actors in this film looked authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. An earlier commentator found this movie great and included in the comments a cheap take on President Bush. This was not a democratic or republican West. It was just a bad western movie that was going to be sold commercially. I wonder if it has earned money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a movie made by college film students. If that was the case, then it was a great movie.
