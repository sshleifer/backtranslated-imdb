... or, more accurately, so bad that you'll have the time of your life when you laugh your butt when you see it! James Sbardellato's 1983 Deathstalker is certainly one of the most frightening productions the Sword & Sorcery subgenre has brought, but it's most amusing. The drama is terrible, the plot is sheer crap and the effects and photography could not be more amateurish. But it's the bad acting, the cheesy effects and the many mistakes that make this movie so funny. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS AHEAD - <br /> <br /> Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is an extremely strong and experienced warrior. One day a good witch challenges him to unite the three forces of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet, and a chalice to free the country from its brutal ruler, the evil king and sorcerer Munkar. Getting the sword is pretty easy, but the amulet and the goblet are in Munkar's possession. Fortunately, the evil king has organized a tournament in which the most experienced warriors in the county compete against each other to the death. The winner should then take the place of the king. Of course, the king does not want someone to take his place. Therefore, he plans to kill the winner (instead of arranging the tournament in the first place). Deathstalker should not only gain the three creative powers, but also save the old, good princess (Barbi Benton) from the clutches of the evil Munkar. Luckily, he will not be bored on the way to the tournament, as he is in the meantime allowed to raise the beautiful warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) ... <br /> <br /> The film has many great, incredibly stupid and funny scenes , Some of my favorite scenes are: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword. The head that falls off, however, is not the head of this man. The falling head has a red goatee while the guy beheaded by Deathstalker had dark hair and no beard. <br /> <br /> - When the character of female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) is introduced, she is first seen in a scene of black robes hiding her face and body. Oghris (Richard Brooker), the traveling companion of the Deathstalker, fights against her, and during swordplay her gown opens (under which she is naturally topless), exposing her breasts. Her breasts are the first thing we see of Lana Clarkson, even in front of her face. <br /> <br /> - The last warrior Deathstalker has to fight in the tournament is a huge guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig. <br /> <br /> - Evil Munkar has an ugly little creature in a chest. He feeds this little creature with human eyeballs and fingers. <br /> <br /> ... There are many other unintentionally funny, funny and great scenes. Acting is awful, but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are a feast for the eyes, and although I called this film "unintentionally funny," I sometimes got the impression that some of the actors were fully aware of how shitty the movie is. There is a lot of gore and a lot of female nudity to entertain the viewer. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly horrible movie, but I still recommend it. Humans have the time of their lives!
