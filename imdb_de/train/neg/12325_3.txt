I remember this show. I still remember the funny song "America's Funniest People". Honestly, it should have been called the lame or unsteady or downright disgusting American man. Dave could not save this show and also Bob Saget or the later released replacement hosts for AFV. The Jackalope segments were hilarious and yes, Dave made some good voice-offs that were better than Bob's. But this show went to hell because of the lame, crappy videos people had submitted. It also evolved into a kind of variety show with lame guest stars, including the Olson Twins. Plus AFV was in its prime, before they picked the drooling ugly scapegoats as winners. Did I mention that the videos were disgusting and lame? But still the title song rocks!
