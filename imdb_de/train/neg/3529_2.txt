I've heard this movie was much more stylistic than film director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) previously directed. The problem is that he may be too stylistic. Basically, Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after seven years in solitary confinement, and within two years he uses a lot of money. He's ready to seek revenge on the violent casino owner who sent Jake to prison, Dorothy 'Mr. D 'Macha (Ray Liotta). Meanwhile, doctors tell Jake that he has three more days to live as he dies of a rare blood disorder, and Macha uses him to beat him. The loan sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) ask Jake to pay back their money and do some weird jobs for them. The movie is filled with Jake, who recounts some flashbacks, and through his last three days, before he came to the great revelation about Zach and Avi and Macha, well, I suppose that was it. With Terence Maynard as French Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. These are sequences that involve a bit of animation, repeating lines twice in different perspectives and changing the speed for moments. All these things are irritating to confusion and boredom, which makes them a stupid thriller. Pretty poor!
