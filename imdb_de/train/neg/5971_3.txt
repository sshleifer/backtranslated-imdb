I was persuaded to watch this movie from a friend who cursed what a cute story this was. <br /> <br /> Yuck. <br /> <br /> I want my two hours back as I could do so many more productive things with my time ... like turning my thumbs for example. I do not see anything redeeming this movie, apart from the eye-catching aspect ... <br /> <br /> 3/10 (and that's generous)
