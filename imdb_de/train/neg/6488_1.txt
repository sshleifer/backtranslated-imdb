Yes, the theme is a direct quote from the movie and I think it's pretty much accurate. I was so bored with this senseless effort to be dead. All flashes, etc. that make no sense after the first 20 minutes are just bad movie productions. + If you are an epileptic, you would have died at least five times. Of course, all David Lynch fans would mark the flag for this type of turkey as "the best movie of all time" because it makes no sense AND if it does not make sense then it has to be art and art. Film is always good. Law? I say wrong. This kind of artifice is just a pathetic way to show that you're a good filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins was just supposed to act as a great actor.
