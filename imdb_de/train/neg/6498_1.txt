I've seen bad movies yet, but this movie is by far the "worst movie of a life"! Anthony Hopkins must be totally mentally ill to associate his name with that name - everywhere! I will never see another movie with him in it, directing etc. etc.! I can not believe that the other actors and actresses I liked (in this picture), who were so bent down to be part of this catastrophe! There must be some great drugs! Anyone who does not have to be ashamed of being part of such a movie is a mystery to me! Save your money on this! HUGE FLOP from start to finish! Shame on you, Mr. Hopkins! Also a pity about Christian Slater! I can not believe you are putting your reputation on the line!
