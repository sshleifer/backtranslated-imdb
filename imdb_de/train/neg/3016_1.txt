I'm, like many, a fan of Tony Scott movies. When this movie came out, I had great hope that it would be like "Man On Fire". To find out that it is the film that is furthest away! The story went down the drain from the start, and choosing Mickey Rourke was not such a good idea. And the whole arm scene was in vain! <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around Kiera Kinghtly and this movie shows that she will never become a movie star! The film brought some of the worst performances ever. <br /> <br /> I like Tony Scott's directing, but that costs the whole biscuit! Sorry, 1 in 10!
