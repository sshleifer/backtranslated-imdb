I think it was pointless to make a second part of a movie like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a very good movie, but it is ridiculous to shoot a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.) dies. The story was over after the first movie. I wonder why anyone tried to continue the story. That was useless!
