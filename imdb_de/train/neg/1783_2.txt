There are no spoilers here ... Because there is no conspiracy. Girl Amick is living proof that a face can make a living - no talent required. The only bright spot are some really good one-liners that were nicely delivered by Alice Krige, but she's Alice Krige again. Her gentle, dreamy voice gives the only clue to how seductive these strange creatures can be. She is credibly scary in this otherwise incredible conspiracy. How she got her to agree to this project remains a mystery. The scriptwriters must have been medically treated when submitting this script. It has big problems with continuity, superficial, stereotypical characters, writing horror formulas, and just does not make sense. The creatures have decent skills like dimming, but the question of where they come from and what they are is never researched that much. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this.
