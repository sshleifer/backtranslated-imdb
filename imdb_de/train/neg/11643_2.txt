Although the title suggests examples of the 10 commandments, this is definitely a wrong assumption. This is an adaptation of 9 SEEMINGLY disconnected stories from the 14th century "Decameron" collection by Giovanni Bocaccio. <br /> <br /> Located in the largely rural population of a medieval Italian city, this is an exploration of the reality of sex (and its reality) consequences) within this world and time. A realistic view of life in this world sometimes feels like a journey through time. Given the depicted human element of its time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists. At times also the ironies of life. Or it can also be considered a general satire of the rules of the Catholic Church. Nothing special, but definitely interesting if you have no expectations or assumptions.
