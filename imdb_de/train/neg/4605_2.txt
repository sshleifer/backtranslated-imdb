This movie was written by Charlie Higson, who has previously done the "legendary" Fast Show and his own show based on one of Fast Show's characters (Tony, the car salesman). He has also written James Bond books for children. <br /> <br /> In fact, I've only seen Gordon's films based on Lovecraft's stories, and each one is wonderful. Here Gordon tries to do something different. The style is totally "contemporary", which means shaky camera, fast and strange cutting, cool chillout music in the background. I think it works pretty well here, but it's still futile and cheap. I often think of the cameraman shaking his DV camera in front of the actors and trying to make stylish moves in the pictures (in the hope that something inadmissible will come out). The casting is good and there is a whole atmosphere that is the result of good direction. I think the main character, the "zero" boy, is pretty interesting in his "Zeroness". The fat guy is good too. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but he is not. But pretty soon after the beginning it turns out that the movie is not so interesting: in this case I mean an endless series of scenes of sadism and illness. There is not much humanity in this film / story: It is absolutely pessimistic and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless or soon dead. Needless to say, there is no humor either. It is a 1'40 long vomit without relief in every moment. Anyway, for me, Gordon remains one of the most interesting filmmakers active today, and I think of this film as an experiment and a failure. Everyone has to experience that sometimes he gets lost just to learn and find his way back. This could be Gordon's most uninteresting and emptiest work.
