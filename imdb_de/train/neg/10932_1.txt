The really sad thing is that this was supposed to be the highest budget Halestorm Entertainment worked with. All parties involved should be fined for refusing, as all the celluloid they have wasted is simply filling the trash. The writing is not only cruel and the jokes terrible, the camera work and the film quality are at best amateur. The soundtrack sounds like it was made on a laptop for boys. The worst part of all is that I actually sat through the whole thing. I think so, just because I could not believe that I was actually paying to buy a ticket and that the theater I was watching was actually ready to show the "movie".
