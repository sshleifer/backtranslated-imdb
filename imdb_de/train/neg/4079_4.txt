I bought a DVD of this movie for my girlfriend, who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this movie, and enjoys movies about the paranormal. The movie was completely recorded on video and looks like a PBS special. The special effects look wrong, but there are some scary moments in the movie that made us jump into our seat. There is a particularly powerful fear of a Virgin Mary statue. <br/> <br/> However, the acting is bad, the "plot" scenes are long and very boring, and I'll tell you that I have no idea what happens is the end. If you receive the film, borrow it when you buy it, please make sure you pay less than 5 euros.
