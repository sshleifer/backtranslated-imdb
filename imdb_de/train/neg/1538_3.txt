What a pity that a really competent director like Andre de Toth, who specializes in slippery, changing alliances, did not take that concept first. He could have helped to work out the true potential, especially with the interesting figure of William Bishop. The way the movie looks, it's pretty messy (as reviewer Chipe claims). The main issues are the direction, the budget and the bad script. The strength lies in an outstanding cast and an interesting overall concept - characters that are drawn by conflicting forces in different directions. What was needed was someone with a vision that brought the positive elements together by reworking the script into a kind of coherent whole, rather than the sweeping, embarrassing chaos that it is. A larger budget could have resulted in high-contrast locations and studio recordings and brought the locations out of the all too obvious LA outskirts. The real shame lies in the waste of a stellar cast - Hayden, Taylor (before his teeth were locked), Dehner, Reeves, and James Millican and William Bishop just before their premature death. Few films illustrate the importance of an autur-with-vision more than this low-obscure western that could have been so much more in the right hands.
