This may be the worst movie Steve Martin has ever done, but it was certainly far from his best. Obviously he did that crap for the paycheck. Dirt like this certainly does not help to strengthen his reputation as a funny man. What he does not seem to realize is that when people want to go to a Steve Martin movie, they are convinced that they are entertained and not bored to tears. It is sad that he has carried along Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman. I do not understand why talented people can not handle the fact that people do not want to see them in lousy films. If you call a movie a comedy, it should be funny. That was not so. Too bad for the US military to be associated with this Pabulum. Full Metal Jacket had more laughter than this miserable apology for a "service comedy." Surely Phil Silvers is rolling around in his grave.
