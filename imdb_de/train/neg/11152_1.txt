Why should you watch this movie if you can see great movies? It is a total waste of time and money. The movie is so bad that I felt bad because I wanted to see it. Everything is bad. Actors were bad. The script was really bad. The story is stupid. And the worst CGI EVER. The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the film in the Strip Club. An interesting thing, there's a character we wish he dies because he's so stupid that we get enough of him /> <br /> NOTE: If you want to watch a good movie, this movie is not the right choice. 0 stars from 10
