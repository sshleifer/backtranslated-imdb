To sum up this movie: Without real action, this movie is made up of 80 minutes of disturbed characters who either drink or make bad jokes. The music is just terrible, the humor is not funny and all female characters are naughty idiots or total geeks. It seems to me that the film was actually written by a 14-year-old boy who thinks that drinking is cool, women are meant to please men, and all those who oppose this view are geeks. Also, the film has nothing to do with the original American Pie films, except for a few names and Mr. Levenstein, who plays a minor role in this film. The only good thing about this movie are the pretty looking girls. Do not look at this movie and do not be fooled by rating 5.4 as it's obviously overrated and deserves nothing over 2.
