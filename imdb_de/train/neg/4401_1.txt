We went with a group to the movie, because the piece we visited was canceled. It is without doubt one of the worst films ever. It's not that I do not like cult movies that I do. But nothing happens in the movie. You can not feel any connection to the characters. endless times without dialogue. And the car How do you carry a huge tent and beds for every day in this car? It is a two-seater! I have to say, but the scenery is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director should have done a photo shoot of the movie so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time without anything happening anyway I would not recommend it since Is a waste of time
