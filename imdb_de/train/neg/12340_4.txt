"Transylvania 6-5000" is an insignificant, but occasionally funny and charming horror parody from the 80s with some very well known names in the cast and a handful of righteous opportunities to laugh in the script. Two bozo journalists from a gossiping tabloid are sent against their will to Transylvania to write a story about the alleged return of the crazy scientist Frankenstein. There are a few delightful little gimmicks and details found left and right in the film, such as a small guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes used to load cream and sugar at the breakfast table. The whole movie is not as successful as it could be and could have been, with jokes and too much parody situations. The Roger Corman production "Transylvania Twist", which came out four years later, is much funnier and much more recommendable. The film parodies in particular the classic universal milestones of the early 30s. So you should pay more attention if you want to capture all the tiny gags and hints. There is a rather original twist that says the Frankenstein character just behaves like a mad, vicious scientist when he enters his lab. It also turns out that he is more of a Father Damien-Messiah, who deals only with the condition of exiled monsters. Michael Richards, the crazy guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, plays a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inopportune moments. I'm pretty sure John Turturro's character in "Mr. Deeds" was inspired by Richard's role.
