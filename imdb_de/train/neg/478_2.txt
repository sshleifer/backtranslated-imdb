The competition for the worst Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is tough. I may have only seen eight of them, but the Comet on Broadway is the worst so far. The best part is that it's short. Oh, and the Orry Kelly dresses (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's movie is not. Kay Francis looks fat throughout and is far less attractive than usual. Minna Gombell, whom I do not know otherwise, is well suited as a half-burly "burlesque" dancer (she looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). The final shot - Kay Francis and her child (when the child learned that Kay Francis was her mother, did I sink in)? The whole movie is so cheap, so implausible, and so careless that it feels infected with an acid cynicism by anyone who makes it. what they get is rubbish.
