Unfortunately, more downs than ups. The plot was pretty decent. I mean, nothing extraordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror movies. The other good thing was the cast. I do not say the acting was good because it was not so, but every actor / actress was hot and attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the downsides is that the movie got exciting only after the first 40s minutes or so. The rest was pretty boring. Another downside (or you might consider it a climb if you want to) is excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not "The Dreamers." Unless you are very desperate to see a guy take off his swimsuit and walk around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl undress naked for no reason, or you are a hardened fan of Debbie Rochon, this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
