I originally rated this episode as two - I wish I had thought more about it now. I also wish they had negative rating options. <br /> <br /> Looking at it, I was amazed at how bad it was from start to finish. I love Ron Pearlman and John Carpenter ... so, what went wrong? Last season, episode 13 was pulled because of the way she treated the abortion issue. I think Mr. Carpenter has managed to do something so gray this season that you can not tell right away whether he has decided on the election or against abortion. It was only when I sat and thought about it that I realized he was against abortion. You will understand this most clearly when the mother shoots the baby and kills it, to the consternation of the "father." He goes away in mourning and leaves the mother unhurt. But you also see it in the way the Ron P. character is treated. I do not think anyone who has been a threat in the past to have a restraining order against him would not immediately call the police. Instead, we almost sympathize with him (just to pay for it in the end). It's a bit lame not to stand by that view, instead of trying to look like she's sitting somewhere in the middle. The music was retro 70s and just did not work. Acting (apart from Ron P.) was bad. The effects were terrible - it might have been better not to show the monster at all, instead of showing the lame apology for a monster they had. <br /> <br /> All this is said, I'm glad they're the ones I have the masters of horror - I do not mind sitting through some really bad episodes to find the good ones. It's a bit like borrowing horror movies from the video store - now and then you get a good one and it's worth it. I agree with the poster that said the name may need to be changed by Masters - some of these people just do not deserve the title. (Let me emphasize that I also hated this episode, John Carpenter earned the title TOTALLY, he is a master through and through)
