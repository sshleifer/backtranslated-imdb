I absolutely love all the books of Tom Robbins, so I was very excited and interested in watching a movie for one of his books. I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins' magic, but after watching the movie, I never wanted to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does not contain one-eighth of the contents of the book and seems to focus more on the love affair between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. In addition to the incredibly weak plot of the movie, I think that better actors could be selected for the characters. The only actors in the movie I thought would fit their roles into Robbins descriptions in the book were Julian's friends in their five-minute clip at the beginning of the film. Those who have not read the book may like the movie, but as a big fan of Tom Robbins, this movie was a disappointment.
