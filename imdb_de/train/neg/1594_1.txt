Impressive. This movie bored me when I saw it. Fad, meaningless and immovable. <br /> <br /> Apparently Ash and Co. With the help of "The Spirit of the Forest" ('Princess Mononoke') you can travel through time. There they meet a dorky kid named Sam, and the "conspiracy" begins. <br /> <br /> So Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) are thrilled by nature, become hippies and try to rid Celebi (the "ghost") of a weird hunter. I do not know what else was going on. Everything went by blurry. Ash's friends were barely there and all the fighting scenes were boring. After saving the day, Ash and his notorious friends had to return to their time, watching as Sam floated away with Celebi (this scene) was just scary. OO;) When Ash returns to his time, he learns that his new friend is indeed his rival's grandfather. And I think that's it. Pretty retarded, right? If you love your children, do not expose them to that. (1 out of 10)
