In this cult movie from 1977, two crazy lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) appeared in the home of wealthy celebrity George Manning (Seymour Cassel). But these two have different plans. When they find out that George's wife is not in town, they take control of the residence, tie up George, and kill an armor boy while they destroy the entire evening one evening. Bizarre and disturbing movie, but the two are rewarded there just as the movie ends. Most will either dislike it or get caught up in this ridiculous movie after about 30 minutes. In some cases, this is even a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
