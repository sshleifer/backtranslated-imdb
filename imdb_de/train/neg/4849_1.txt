I've just rented it, and I've heard a lot of good reviews before. IMPRESSIVE!! What a bunch of steamy poo this movie is !! Does anyone know the director's address so I can get back my five dollars? At last, someone came up against "Stop Loss" of # 1 on the "Worst Iraq Film" track. To be honest, I do not think there are any good war films in Iraq anyway, but that was really bad. <br /> <br /> I do not get technical inaccuracies, there are a hundred reviews from other GWOT veterinarians, all of which describe in detail. If the director took the trouble to consult even the slightest e-nothing about technical accuracy, he could make the movie a bit more realistic ... maybe. I think the author should get the "recognition" for this waste of a movie. Obviously, he or she has hatched the plot for this film from a vivid fantasy that is not fraught with the limitations of reality. Anyone except me wondered what the meaning of this movie was? Was there a message? Seriously, but ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised at all the positive reviews. This movie is hard to see because of all the glaring inaccuracies as a vet, but even if you overlook that, the plot is shitty, the characters are flat (to say the least), and the drama is bad at best. I suppose it's ironic that this movie is about disposing of explosives because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
