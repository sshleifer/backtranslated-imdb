With a story and a script apparently written by a high school student, "The Art of Seduction" fails to deliver the romantic, challenging experience he wants to be reckoned with. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female lead roles are "swinging singles (or in the case of female lead role)", but "The Art of Seduction" does not even try. In an honest examination of the personalities of these two characters, "The Art of Seduction" renounces something thin, as the basis for thin, slender stereotypes. <br /> <br /> "The Art of Seduction" is insulting - insulting to their characters, offensive to men and women and offensive to the expectations of the public. It takes the terribly beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them. Ji-wan is an immature, spoiled, manipulative bitch. It is expected that the viewer likes and forgives her mistakes because she is pretty. Min-jun, well, he's the same. Neither are nice people. The "humor" in this film is primarily about the unusual attempts of Ji-wan and Min-jun to surpass themselves in the honorable art of lying and manipulation. There is no character development and we never know why Ji-wan and Min-jun are like that. It is simply expected that we will take them as they are, and ask no questions - they are cute !, and that's all that matters. The numerous references to the celebrity of the main actors in the reviews of azn cinema scenester could lead you to "superficiality of Art of Seduction". <br /> <br /> If you're in high school, you like Grease or you're a yellow fever victim, you might like this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite his "Romance" tag This is not a very good date movie.
