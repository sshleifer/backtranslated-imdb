Many days after seeing Ada, I'm still impressed that each group spent so much time making such a vile movie. Nobody should see this movie in the hope of learning some consistency about Ada Lovelock, her colleagues or the product of her efforts. <br /> <br /> Likewise, nobody should see this movie in the hope of being entertained. <br /> <br /> As a sci-fi movie This would undoubtedly be a terrible failure. Somehow, the lead character manages to live and interact with the past on her PC with the advice and encouraging words of Timothy Leary. I doubt anyone could suppress his disbelief enough to make that seem absurd. <br /> <br /> As a drama film, this would undoubtedly be a terrible failure. Somehow the author / director manages to fill out 85 minutes with a constant, unnecessary, annoying and trivial drama about essentially nothing. I doubt anyone has the feeling that all the drama in the movie is just an irritating distraction. I find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for Conceiving Ada. The circumstances in which I saw it prohibit me from leaving the theater, but I have no choice. I'm still angry that I wasted the time I needed to see it. Only that I could criticize this movie more effectively, I wish I was articulated.
