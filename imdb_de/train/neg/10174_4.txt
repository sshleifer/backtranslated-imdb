I saw that in 1994, when it was finally released. Apparently, because Orion images were bankrupt, I think the film had not been released a few years ago. <br /> <br /> I have trouble remembering details, in part because I have not seen him for a long time, but I remember a very boring movie. I've always thought about going out. The store was not interesting or captivating at all. Was a third graffiti imitation of America. <br /> <br /> None of the performances is worth to be seen. One of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper expert rated it highly.
