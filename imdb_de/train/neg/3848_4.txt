The film is almost ridiculous when Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters work together as mothers of convicted murderers. With the awful celebrity after the trial, the two women team up and leave New York for California to open a studio for Shirley Temple-style girls and sing and dance. Reynolds made a mistake when he took Winters to California , Winters plays a profoundly religious woman who seems to be increasingly leaving her rocker. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the women who live together receive threatening phone calls. Reynolds, who wears a blond wig, is soon lovingly played by the wealthy father of one of her students by Dennis Weaver. Agnes Moorehead, in one of her last films, is briefly seen as Sister Alma Winters is a faithful listener. <br /> <br /> The movie really belongs to Shelley Winters. She is heavy here and the heaviness seemed to make her even better. Winters has always done well to test their roles on nerves. <br /> <br /> The end is macabre and who can forget that Winters pounding at the piano with that totally crazy look?
