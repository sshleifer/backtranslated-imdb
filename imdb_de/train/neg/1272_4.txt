If someone else has noticed, whenever he is in the car, when the camera changes to a new angle, he changes the road. As in a scene is a one-lane residential area with sidewalks, then they are on a multi-lane highway with a dividing wall, next to a two-lane highway with double yellow tracks. I can understand a low budget, but that was just a sloppy movie work. <br /> <br /> I also read the other reviews and do not think it was a bad movie. I think if you're a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy, you can enjoy this movie. However, if you find your work / not funny, I would recommend to move away from it.
