Anyone who has watched a few Lifetime Movie Network films knows that the credibility of plans is the first thing that gets struck from the planning table. As Lara walks into the house of Patti and methodically begins to drive her peddlers, I did not blink. When Lara finally extended her activities to the threat of poor Patti and told her to do something about it, I just nodded. On the planet LMN, for some reason people do not behave the way they do, they only do it to sustain the action. Only on the planet LMN could someone by his seductive powers have almost thrown the owner of a house out of his own house !! Poor Patti - she just trusted too much, and Lara picked up her medicine and then there was a big fight up on the stairs with a syringe full of deadly stuff spattered into a man's stomach and a body bag on the front door. The horror! <br /> <br /> But take it from me, this product from Planet LMN is a classic. You only have to look at it once, just for the great laughs you have. On the improbability scale I give this movie a 95/100. Make a large serving of popcorn and get some apple slices. You will understand it later.
