I do not often bother writing comments, but I just had to warn someone who thinks he's watching a comedy by watching. That does not come close. While the premise (change of color / gender / whatever) is bad enough (and has been, better, many times before), the actual conversion of two black men into two white girls is one of the least persuasive conversions ever shown on the screen. It would be bad enough if the script needed only a switch to white chicks. However, the Wayans brothers have to disguise themselves as two specific white women. As you probably guessed, they are completely failing. I've seen drag queens without make-up that make women more convincing than these two with the best special effects and make-up people Hollywood can offer. It is terrible. Add to the mix a basketball player built like a building, terrible dialogues and more action holes than a golf course, and this movie reaches a new personal low point. And I like bad movies! Avoid like the plague.
