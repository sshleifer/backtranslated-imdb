In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," a comic and poignant comedy. the best he has ever done. Ten years later, he has recycled the plot of "Home Alone" in this second sequel, which is not related to the other films, but is also unimaginative and sadistic. The four crooks? that's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series! ?? are electrocuted with metal chairs, kneaded with dumbbells and dazzled with color, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new child is even less sexy than Culkin. One might think that the withdrawal of almost all the main actors in the first two films would prevent Hughes from petrifying the same old routines, but the only surprise is that he did not even appear on "Home Alone 4".
