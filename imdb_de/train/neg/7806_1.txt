Poor Michael Madsen; He has to kick himself to know that people have learned about this horrible movie. I can not imagine anything worse than amateur porn. It's so bad and everything here; Wood drama, bad script, shitty moral end, you hate it and it's in this movie. <br /> <br /> My question is, "Who the hell put $$$ in this piece of Doggy Doo? I could have seen Michael's sister Virginia naked in one scene, but I do not think that would save that stinker ... <br /> <br /> For a cool guy who has made some exceptional films, I want to know what a crazy church has sponsored this piece of Crapola.
