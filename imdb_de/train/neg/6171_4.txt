Well. That was no surprise. Many people will tell you that this is bloody. But they all talk "shiztz", this movie is very slow. <br /> <br /> It starts with a guy who makes a brew to feel no pain. He calls it "my son". There are some bloody scenes, but I found them somehow weak. You could as well skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eyeball scene, which was surprisingly impressive and pathological. There are some really stupid scenes in this one. and they dub the hits and slaps with stupid fake sound that makes me laugh! I would not recommend it. look for bloody dogs. <br /> <br /> Look at this, if you want the 20 to 10 minute final scene, which is still not that great and has a random scene of the guy trying to rape his mother it's weird ,
