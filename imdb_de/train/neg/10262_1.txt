Now I just caught it out of curiosity and had to keep watching - just like you see a car accident ... <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that it is a parody, but that should not stop me from criticism God-fearing direction, acting and dialogue. Seriously, this was rated as one of the poorest movies I've ever seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and a paltry one ... Okay - a few points of criticism (1) If the doctor has his Heart attack in front of the monster had (we never see that the monster attacks him, we assume that it concerns a heart attack), then the army launches grenades, rockets and bullets on the monster - the doctor however by no rocket touches and still lives (2) the army attack from about 100 yards away, and we see that a flamethrower is used - my God, these things have a range of no more than 30 meters! (3) When the monster tries to grab the professor, the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling. the monster drops the child and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster? Come on! (4) The monster looks like it is something out of Power Rangers! (5) There is a scene in which the five "good guys" (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the child) all look shocked, and we get reactions one after the other (from hand to mouth) - so natural! (6) the general just runs away, over and over again (7) the general refuses to try electricity and does not stop (8) the acting is terrible (9) I mentioned the rubber comic monster ???? (10) this terrible music without interruption!
