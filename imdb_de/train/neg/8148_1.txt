Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything that Brookmyre's first novel had. Everything apart from the story, the laugh, the black humor, the political intrigue, the characterizations, the conspiracy and a sense of purpose. <br /> <br /> spoiler; Godamnawful, from beginning to end They made a mockery of the conspiracy, they had a romance between Parablane and a policeman, and what was that, dr. Slaughter was portrayed as a spectator, and who the hell was Annette Crosby? <br /> <br /> It looked as if they had made a three-hour adaptation and then reduced it to 90 minutes. (Even though the 90 minutes seemed to take forever) Please, please, do not do this with other books by Brookmyres (especially "Land of the Blind").
