Not funny - how can you relate that to Monty Python? This is absolutely ridiculous - there are no laughs. That's not funny. Above, but ugly, weird, just for weird reasons and it seems to me that these people had something all the time. Unfortunately something that did not make her funny. <br /> <br /> There should be some points for effort etc. Apparently there is a laugh trail - or is there one? Hummm .... Since there is hardly a laugh, that is a controversial question. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm doing it unfair - maybe it's some kind of exercise. Any kind of art - anything is possible in this case, no matter. <br /> <br /> But these guys play women with high voices and show noses. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There's only one heir to Monty Python's intellectual joke, Stephen Colbert and maybe Jon Stewart.
