Peeew that stinks! As everyone knows, it is based on some Geico insurance advertising. What nobody knows is WHY?! These commercials were amusing at first sight at best; Hardly food for a series. (The talking Geico gecko - that's another story.) Well, that would make a fascinating series!) And why on earth did ABC actually agree to buy Geico's caveman character traits, as the press reports ? After all, the notion that cavemen fight in the modern world is hardly unique to television; Phil Hartman had over a decade ago a recurring Saturday Night Live role as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer. And this is the best way to work with such a concept - occasionally. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A 1960s series titled "It's About Time" also used the cavemen in the modern world concept.) It lasted a season. <br /> <br /> One of the show's directors, also for Geico advertising was recently quoted as saying, "We were so excited when we shot our commercials because we felt like we had something special and bigger stories to tell." Not correct. <br /> <br /> In the annals of bad television, this is said to be taking its place as one of the worst of all times, alongside 1972 "Me and the Chimpanzee." The protagonist of the embarrassing chimpanzee fiasco actually fell into disgrace after being suddenly canceled. Our caveman friends will undoubtedly follow suit.
