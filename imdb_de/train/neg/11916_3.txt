Yuck I found it odd that her ancient book on curses was written using ordinary script instead of hand. The spectacle is sometimes so apathetic and at other times overly dramatic. Why would a "demonic" kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who made him immortal? Only the hell? And is it really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle when she's traveling somewhere? We understand it! They spent a bit of money to rent a three-rocket. That does not mean you have to show it all the time! The Faith's Cabin looks like an old-school Battlestar Galactica with some last-minute changes. There is a scene where we meet some people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before being killed for no apparent reason or meaning. Everyone is a disposable character. Unforgettable characters and an even more forgettable storyline make this movie one of the worst-conceived movies the sci-fi channel has ever seen. Stay away unless you're in bad movies.
