What's up with the actors who participated in this crap? Michael Dorn should stick to the Star Trek merchandise. John Diehl, does anyone remember him in Miami Vice? Did you like him there ... Well, whatever - what can you expect from a movie with one of Baywatch's lifeguards on top? Nothing and we get that. None of the characters is even sympathetic, the special effects are funny (but not funny). The story is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic for what happens. I had the feeling that the filmmakers tried something like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes". Especially in the scene where all the important people in a wardrobe were discussing national security ... <br /> <br /> If you watch it on TV, change channels - your TV will always be grateful.
