IMPRESSIVE! I did not know that someone would make this movie! it is terrible! I've written down 5 things that can explain why you do not want to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Number 1: "It's the biggest rave ever", where is the rave? I could only see a few people dancing. <br /> <br /> 2. When they are on the rave, they can ONLY see blood everywhere, no people, two ruined tents and a stage ... and what do they do !? they drink! <br /> <br /> 3.the worst actor I have ever seen! the captain and his crew .. terrible! <br /> <br /> 4. When one of the people fires a normal weapon, he fires almost 30 times without reloading! <br /> <br /> 5. I did not know that every person in the world can fight as a professional! must be a new thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder what the producer thought! "It will be a great success, it will be a classic" ... sure, you stupid thing not to see this movie anyway, it is a waist of time. My eyes are still bleeding!
