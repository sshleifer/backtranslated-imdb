if you have not lived in the 90s or have never heard rapper EVER !! This movie may be okay for you, but for any fan or person who ever heard rap, it was boring and there was no point in the movie where I said it was interesting or I did not know that. Another thing that bothered me was that it looked like everything in his life he was doing was very simple. There was no trouble in making the prison look simple, selling drugs, and even the knocking was not realistic. I think if the movie was released in about 15 years, maybe it could have a bigger impact !!! good rap films are haunting and flowing, becoming rich or dying and trying not to be notorious
