Am I wrong or is the 2007 version just a rip off of the original? I have to ask, because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ..... bad acting, bad editing, etc. ... the only aspect of "exploitation" here is As we were demolished for our movie money, buy this piece of crap. It's nothing more than a light porno movie ... no real horror, no scary pictures, just a cheap garbage. If someone wants to see an excellent movie without well-known actors, a few slimy streaks and a decent storyline ... Baby Blood ... also made for a cheap budget, but well done ... and a real story too! I spat a waste of money, but I'll just keep it for a laugh ... it's pathetic! New comment .... 3 september ..... I'll keep this movie forever just because it's SOOOOO bad, it's almost good .... in a really bad way .... the worst acting, that ever existed ... a real crap classic!
