This was a movie I could not wait! So I finally got it and was pretty disappointed. For starters, the movie has said so little about New York, just a few confusing shots of buildings, streets, bridges, and cafes. He is not really focused on New York magic. Another thing that changed my mind was the French movie in this movie. I know it's a remake, but it's not a French-style remake! In any case, you will notice elements that remind you of French films, such as long and messy scenes, no or little speeches and of course everyone smokes in the French style! The story tells a lot of lives (too many for my taste) and they seem somehow connected at the end. I feel like there is no devotion for the characters like the stories. The film was too short to describe every single fate to which everyone is happy. So we see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each. And there you have your 120 minutes! If you like active scene dialogs and the like, this is not the movie for you! I give it 4 just because I love New York and loved the cast!
