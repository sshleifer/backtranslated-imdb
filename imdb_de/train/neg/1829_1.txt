Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Ben anymore. How this man is allowed to make films is inexplicable to me. I can not understand how this happens when I perform at work the way he behaves in a movie. GOD! This movie was just a simple, steamy, stinking pile of POO that needs to be voided if that's possible. Something else I have to say, the guideline to 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What's wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I'll never understand why websites need a short novel, sometimes requiring only a quick comment.
