Christopher Durang must have been taught by a memorable awful nun because he just can not let go of the concept. The play "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains Everything to Her" was presented - at least in Hollywood - in exactly the same tone as the lecture scenes by Diane Keaton. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a fleet, a bitter satire of a quietly familiar, doctrinaire and highly judgmental nun. The movie insists, however, that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously - and, as mentioned, maintain the same tone in the "explain all" scenes. The two approaches meet headfirst and in the last twenty minutes the film leaves the track, crashes into the gorge and explodes. There are no survivors. It would have worked if the tone of the scenes with the four former students and their encounter with Sister Mary corresponded to Sister Mary's scenes. Or when the scenes of Sister Mary are depicted more realistically. This way just does not work.
