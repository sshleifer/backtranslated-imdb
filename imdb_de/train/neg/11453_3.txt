This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I have ever seen. I hate this Napoleon Dynamite rip-off. Just imagine, folks, the stupid humor has already been mastered. Do something new once. All these new comedies are just awful. And Andy Samberg is not ready for a starring role yet. I hope he can recover from this horrible movie. And Will Arnett's character is just bad. Hey Will, did you read the script? The plot is really the worst ever written. Now you tell me if that's funny. (This is the movie) Rod Kimbel's stepfather Frank dies and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery, so Rod plans this huge jump to raise money for Frank. Just so Rod can beat Frank in a fight and prove his manhood. Yeah, that's the movie, you tell me, would you spend $ 7.00 to see that piece of crap!
