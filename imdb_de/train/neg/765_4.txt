Seriously, what did you think? Over the years, the Columbo series has tried some new things and distracted from the usual formula for success, but this film really exaggerates it. This movie is basically different from any other Columbo movie, but the differences are not for the benefit of the movie. <br /> <br /> The main thing that makes this film different from any other Columbo movie is that it's there No murder committed? The overall premise of this film is totally different, putting the Columbo character in a completely different environment and situation. The whole thing is just totally different and 'modernized'. <br /> <br /> Director Alan J. Levi has made several other Columbo films in the past, all of which have stuck to the usual formula. It also makes a strange choice that he was selected to direct this movie. <br /> <br /> The character of Columbo itself also feels very different, perhaps because it puts him in a completely different environment and situation. when he helps his nephew, after his bride disappeared right after the wedding. The lack of good relief and Columbo Humor's trademark also makes this watch not a good or pleasing watch. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the movie does not start so badly, but the movie gets more and more ridiculous with its story as it progresses. It's such a stupid written kidnapping thriller with a story that's becoming increasingly unlikely. As a result, the film is always unsurpassed. This is a little interesting entry in Columbo, who also does not really know how to entertain his viewers. <br /> <br /> It does not help much that the supporting actors are not the most talented. Despite the fact that his character is in a completely different situation and the film is filmed in a completely different style, Peter Falk is still doing well and his presence saves this movie a bit. Can you imagine how this movie would have been without him? It would be an extremely bad and ridiculous cheap movie that I can tell you. <br /> <br /> A strange columbo entry that can be called a failed experiment to deviate from the usual formula. <br /> <br /> 4/10
