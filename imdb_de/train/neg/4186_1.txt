My comment has nothing to do with the political feelings of the film. In fact, they are quite congruent with mine. What moves me is the fact that it is stupid in relation to a movie and has no semblance of history, motives or dialogues. Perhaps someone should tell Neal that replacing lyrics with songs that inspire no-one outside a dwindling audience is not the same as creating characters that are motivated to speak because of events created by the author or director. A stupid story remains despite the iconic heritage of Neal Young. The most childish scene is the scene in which the devil dances his way into a bar and slides a tonic into an unsuspecting hero, who then walks onto the dance floor and whispers the words to Young Song. Somehow, these two dream of a plan where to look on the west coast ???? Sorry Neal, stay tuned and let Steven Stills do the filming.
