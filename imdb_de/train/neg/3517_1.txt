I do not know who wrote the script for this movie, but I was confused from the first moment. Why do you make the decision among all possible decisions in the mountains, which is the most dangerous of all? Why are the criminals stupid, even though they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it? Why does not the main criminal land by helicopter, shoot Stallone, grab the money and fly away with the chick as hostage? And there are more cases of illogical behavior. I would give this movie 5 points for beautiful action and great scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, I can only give this movie 1 point ...
