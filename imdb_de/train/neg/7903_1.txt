I think I saw this movie, but do not quote me because I fell asleep watching because it did not capture my excitement and imagination. At least I know that I have seen enough to know that I will not see it again soon. Or ever. <br /> <br /> Jeez, talk about lame ... Really lame. Totally lame. It would not even appeal to a six-year-old. Basically it had NO valuable dramatic effect. Zilch. Nada Nur Shlock turned to dirt. Comedy? That should be a comedy? You could not be fooled ...! <br /> <br /> Well, if the aliens had been voraciously carnivorous, as in the movie "Critters," we could have done the human characters a little deeper than being overly complacent ... like screaming and screaming and Run for their lives so that they would not be eaten, so that the story could be a little more exciting than looking at the paint dry. It is not worth. You can find something interesting. As if I were watching the paint dry. Or fall asleep.
