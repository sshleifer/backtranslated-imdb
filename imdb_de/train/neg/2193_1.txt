A denied scientist is beheaded and brings her head back to life. Honestly, that's the plot of the movie. He tries to get her another body, which he searches around the city to find that perfect body. For some reason he has ugly monsters in a closet in his cabin. The sleaze style of the film is ridiculous. Nobody in the movie can actually involve the head. The wardrobe monster is a man with a mask to buckle up and you can really say it. The plot is slow, weak and the end is so bad. Take a look at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this turn. Believe me, I would not watch this movie alone.
