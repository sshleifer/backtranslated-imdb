What have I just seen? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. The concept of a serial killer clown is quite scary indeed. There are many people who are afraid of clowns. I still wonder how the character Mark was not able to run away from the clown ... he's 300 pounds, he'll eventually get tired. The whole end made me stand up and literally say aloud, "What have I just seen?" Apparently, Brandon is the cousin of Denise ... and they had it in the middle of the movie, which meant he had sex with his cousin ... Yes, people * want to see * Shudders *. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I found funny was the opening scene where the clown stabbed a woman and she says, "What did you do?" Well, bytch, what do you think he has just done? The last thing that was stupidly funny was a second when the main character punched the hitchhiker and called her, then said 5 minutes later that violence did not help. Has the scriptwriter given the line to the wrong guy? Nothing of this movie makes sense anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie was more or less a stupid low-budget porn that I absorbed while buying (all 3.99) and had no entertainment beyond the sex scenes. I am surprised that the fat clown did not join the orgy, he could have passed. I was hoping that the movie would have some entertainment value that other B movies might have, but I was wrong. This is a moronic piece of garbage that is not even worthy of being viewed. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points
