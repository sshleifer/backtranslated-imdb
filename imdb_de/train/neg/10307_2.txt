The "mathematical" aspect is just a game to distinguish this TV show from the millions of other cop shows. The only redeeming aspect of this show is Rob Morrow, although his career after Northern Exposure (undeserved) must have weakened when he signed up for this strike. <br /> <br /> The Lameness of the "Math Aspect" The show is summed up in an episode starring Lou Diamond Phillips (which only confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned) To catch a refugee, the "mathematician" uses some theory about "bubbles". So he gives this long explanation that if we have seen the suspect in places A, B, and C, we can use bubble theory to calculate where he might be. He does it all on a blackboard or maybe with a stick in the dirt (I can not remember). <br/> <br/> When looking at the finished product, he basically took three points and picked a point in the middle of the middle and said, "Okay, mathematically, here we're most likely to find the fugitive." At another point, another character points out, "Oh, this point is also the cabin the guy lived in." Is this math? It is not even a connection between the F ** k ** g points! This show reminds me of the math major I worked with in banking. He had a mathematical analysis he could do to "assist" points that each other had agreed upon, either through less complex analysis or through common sense. <Br /> <br /> That's easy to see: If you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait for the NUMB3RS team to be on OSAMA ... They use calculus, call an air raid in the middle of the mountains, beat Osama and do not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields ... cuz hey ... it's all about the numbers. <br /> <br /> Totally ridiculous TV program.
