The fifth "Black Emanuelle" I've seen may have the most intriguing line of conspiracy dealing with the intrepid female reporter investigating the white slavery / prostitution racket that took her from San Francisco to Macao and back to her own brings hometown New York! The film is populated with veterans of the series who inexplicably play a completely different role, namely Ivan Rassimov (here as head of a United Nations committee for Third World countries!), Karin Shubert (as a feminist rival reporter) and Don Powell (as a chauffeur of Rassimov). Unfortunately, this movie, as usual (though shown in the middle of the night), is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene (described in "Stracultr") in which an Asian slave trader joins a dog Yet, a cruel sequence is late in the movie, as a sloppy politician cheats on a few girls (including, of course, Gemser and Shubert) into a midnight rendezvous under a New York bridge with a bunch of bums ( so he gets her votes, pick it!) - he seems to be pretty intact with his weak fellow-members. <br /> The most ridiculous element of this entry - aside from Gems Ers hang, every time she enters a house to undress completely (even before complete strangers) - is her excursion to India to interview a charlatan / guru (George Eastman, who looks like a Christian!) who found a way En has prolonged coitus indefinitely; Of course, when Emanuelle calls him to do that, he has premature ejaculation ... !!
