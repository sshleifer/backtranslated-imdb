Seeing "Speak Easy" is painful for fans of Buster Keaton. Such a phenomenal writer, actor, comic, director, and stuntman exposed to this humiliating spectacle looks as if one would see a Picasso as a drop cloth, or rather see the finest camembert that has been falsified with whey solids and processed into Cheez-Whiz. <br /> <br /> Keaton is poorly staffed as Professor Post. His overused vocabulary is the only thing stopping him from saying, "Tell me about the rabbits, George." (Post would have said something like, "Please inform me about the status of small mammals in the Leporidae family of the order Lagomorpha, kindly gentleman, who in my opinion is mainly addressed by the nickname" George ".") When Keaton created His they might be ignorant of their own characters, but they were not stupid. They were fast studies and became masters of their worlds. Not so with Post, who never stops tripping and bumbling and has no control over his fate as a Titanic rat rat. And while Keaton's original characters had a charming naivety and innocence, Post acts as such a profound sexual inhibitor that, if he was ever physically aroused, he put an ice pack on the swelling and sought medical help. <br /> <br /> There are a few small redeeming moments, such as Keaton's attempts to rid himself of Todd's vampire theme, or his proposal to dress appropriately for a Greek dance, but it's not worth the effort to endure film to see her. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch "Speak Easily" with friends, a "Mystery Science Theater 3000". But otherwise you stay with the Silents. Let her be 100% of what Buster Keaton is for.
