The ultimate goal of Big Brother, that we know what we should think before we believe it, has been achieved. Is it a kind of miracle or a sinister joke that people of their own will put on thought jackets, turn into distorted shapes and grin like monkeys? Films, art no longer risk the unknown, but no conclusions are drawn and life is drained. <br /> <br /> "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a boring case story suitable for a college feminism degree program. The lesson is schematic, rectangular, and linear: "See how women are objectified, exploited, abused, and then thrown on the dust by a male-dominated society." Bettie Page, allegedly the "pin-up queen of the 1950s", to which millions of men ejaculated. (All reviewers repeat this phrase "pin-up queen of the 1950s" like a monkey-choir.) Her story as an American bombshell is familiar: Southern, abused by her father, raped, etc. In this movie, she is a naive, an innocent who is unaware of what interests she served and shamelessly benefits from. Although she believes in Jesus, she enjoys joking in front of a camera lens - only the healthy male sex slaves of American men supposedly fantasize. <br /> <br /> From the mouth of author and director Mary Harron, Oxford-trained AND-ex-punker (do you smell the combined privilege trap and "hipness" like me?): "I feel like I'm without Feminism that would not do that, I do not do that. " feminist films in the sense that I do not do anything ideological. But I think women make my movies better. "What a cozy clique. <br /> <br /> The film simply goes through the movements that tell the story of a human life, its theme and purpose preached and buried long before the movie began a friend, but we are not shown anything about their relationship, in fact there are no intimate or detailed relationships in the film. <br /> <br /> One can not ignore his smug simplicity in New York, where Mrs. Page is her best The film is black and white, but down in Miami, where, to fit into a man's world and soothe her, tied in the bondage bondage and tightly clamped in the black leather boots and bodice of S & M she wants to escape from everyday life, she happily takes off her clothes and is photographed by a "liberated" woman.The film turns color in color. <br /> <br /> Like hell Harron does not "make feminist films", Does not do anything Ideological ". Ideology is so internalized, so accepted, so programmed that it is almost invisible. The big brother has to smile.
