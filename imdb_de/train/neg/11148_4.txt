This is the best example of a low budget that can win a good story. Let's bring Samaire Armstrong back (after seeing her work at the OK, I know she can do better) and then find a better script and budget. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so bad and mostly poorly generated by the computer. that it nearly lost me when the wolf was first seen on the screen. And Samaire Armstrong (Alert!) Was turned into a werewolf by first reducing her to a bad GCIF character before she even started to change (the people of Final Fantasys and Pixars made these people laugh) as Barbie Doll) , <br /> <br /> The story of was interesting, although the idea of ​​the bloodline in werewolves is nothing new. Since it was also in the balance between evil (maybe) not so bad and the possible end of human nature, the two lines should mate. The subplot of a "book of the werewolf line," which magically influenced some of the other characters for a while, was effective, but could have been extended to explain what had happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Bring a better script and direction, and I would come back.
