Greenaway's films are so clever, smart and innovative. However, his style and grammar are reminiscent of films filmed during the First World War: the composition of the image, the use of mid-shot, the static camera. It may be good to rub against mainstream movies with this style, but it's not new. Like this other "renewer" TS Eliot, he may draw more from the past than if he were or could look forward as an authentic innovator. <br /> <br /> But Greenaway's biggest failure is that he can not write. His dialogue and even action structure is mechanical and logical, but without the vitality of another dramatic logicist, Brecht. Where this weakness is most evident lies in his humor, which is unbalanced and logical. The joke is dead before being delivered. The result is boring: if it's not funny, it's failed: Ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience does not answer. Perhaps the read director of Freud could learn something about humor. <br /> <br /> Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones. They speak the lines with a bored, complacent air like narcissistic teens. <br /> <br /> Despite its design and lighting, this movie is extremely affordable.
