'Maladolescenza' looks like a dark fairy tale, with its protagonists, the environment of the forest and the discovery of the castle ruins. Essentially, however, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. The film begins with a dream sequence in which he uses the not-so-subtle metaphor of Fabrizio fighting his menacing hunting dog. He describes in detail his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who promised him her love, and his possible romance with the equally vicious Sylvia. The psychological complexity of the film gives credit to the film, but there is no doubt how unnecessary the film is portrayed in its depiction of nudity and sex. The movie's look depends more on its great locations than on its special cinematographic art, and the movie's biggest asset is undoubtedly the creepy, child-enhanced soundtrack for children. The film is at best interesting with its strange, dreamlike quality, but fades next to Louis Malles surreal and brilliant "Black Moon" from the same era. The debate between art and pornography is certainly deserved, because unlike many forbidden films, such as Pasolini's "Salo" or Larry Clark's "Ken Park," the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic point of view. The cinema is beginning to lose its ability to be shocked, so perhaps Maladolescenza should be admired to maintain this power thirty years after its release. The shock is, however, the only reason the film is memorable. <br /> <br /> The film has its defenders. But Nazism does it too.
