Dragon Fighter is the first sci-fi channel (though I think it's called Syfy?), An original movie I've ever seen. But I have since seen one or two others, and I can tell you that they were stupid, but this one really is scratching the bottom of the barrel. The CGI is badly done, the acting is bad, the script is ridiculous and what happens in the end is unexpected and inappropriate (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean, I did not want it a spoiler in my review put). There was also this one musical tune that was used in almost every single dangerous sequence. That was really stupid. They just played it over and over. And it's definitely not original; I know that I have heard this already somewhere (I just can not remember where). This is one to avoid.
