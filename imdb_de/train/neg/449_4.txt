I admit, I've only seen a handful of episodes, but each one seemed completely different. It seems that after the first season, the producers decided to completely retool the show, take down characters, introduce new ones and rewrite the entire show momentum. <br /> <br /> As you've probably guessed, the show is bizarre Things The unpredictable teenager Holly (Amanda Bynes) moving in with her raised sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) in New York City. Reason enough for a decent pair: odd pairs + fish out of the water + high jinx. <br /> <br /> Although I miss the sitcoms of yesteryear, this show unfortunately always fails to be funny and it is sad because they have a decent talent. <br /> <br /> In addition, they insisted on changing the show (Val lived in a squadron with one cast, then suddenly he was gone, so she opens a bakery?) What if things change? This makes you feel that even the * show * knows it's bad. I mean, completely new sets, advertised characters and new show regulars! <br /> <br /> By the way (this is just a joke), I know that this is a TV show and not at all real, but Val and Holly live in a GIANT loft duplex (there are stairs) with a terrace. .. in MANHATTAN! Are you serious!?
