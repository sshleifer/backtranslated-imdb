I saw this bomb when she came to the theater. I laughed the whole time. Why? Because stupidity seemed to drive me crazy. I look back and realize that there was NO funny thing in the movie. At least not on purpose. It's terribly fun that Lizzie can chew on a piece of Nurplex and become a gigantic, carnivorous demon ... and yet her sticky gown is perfectly intact, even though she's hundreds of times bigger than she was the first time Put it on. Or the kind of film in which a man with a defibulator can be shocked and only become unconscious and without any medical attention becomes aware again. And do not let me start with the ridiculous fate of the "bad guy" they've decided to create "conflict." Uh huh. <br /> <br /> To the person who complains about Disney targeting only children - The slippery parts of this film seem to refute this statement. Do we really need Daryl Hannah accusing Jeff Bridges of having messy videotapes? You do it if you're Disney and have no ideas to make the movie more attractive for over-8s without writing a smarter script! I firmly believe that Disney pays off for the rating so that movies get away with murder and still get family-friendly ratings. <br /> <br /> What a waste of DVD format.
