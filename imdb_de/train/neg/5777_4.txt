It's funny when you stop and think about it: terrifying movie fans tend to have a deep and lasting affection for those who fear the light of day. THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE may give us nightmares, but who among us (the believers) in BRUTAL MASSACRE or in Ken Foree, for ever and ever the determined hero of the original DAWN OF, had no real love pain THE DEAD? His cameo in the remake made me stand up and cheer (like Tom Savini's cameo); That's no joke. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you get my drift (if not, just stand against the wind ...). These are some of the heroes of the horror. To see many of them in a single movie is (as far as I know) virtually unknown. If only the writer had fulfilled this monumental task. Maybe someone else will try again somewhere in the line. Unless it's not another half-hearted effort (like BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD).
