There is a lot going on with Helen and nothing is good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play mothers of a Leopold & Loeb couple like murderers who move from the Midwest to Hollywood to escape their past. Reynolds, an avid Jean Harlow wannabe, opens a dance studio for children and Winters is their pianist. Soon, Winters (as Helen) begins to rip. It's all very slow and although there are moments of real scary (unpleasant phone calls, a visit by Timothy Carey), the movie is without any horror. Still, it's still a good conversation. The acting divas are good and the production values ​​are terrific. A music score by David Raskin, a cinematography by Lucien Ballard and Oscar-nominated costumes make a huge contribution. Does it make someone as crazy as Winter's, with A PLACE IN THE SUN and LOLITA? Directed by Curtis Harrington, a master of this kind of exploitation of the A movie. In addition to Carey include the unusual performers Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead (like Aimee Semple McPherson as the evangelist), Yvette Vickers and Micheál MacLiammóir (the Irish Orson Welles) as Hamiltonarr, apt Hammam.
