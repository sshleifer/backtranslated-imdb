Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and other countries. I looked at the full version of DisneyNature's Earth. I think how the automaker is trying to convince Disney that they care about the planet. Maybe they really care about the planet, I do not know, but I do not think that justifies a special entity with the word "nature". I know that my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who should I tell a one-year-old, what I personally feel about Disney? <br /> <br /> Apart from an incredible cinematography, it was a typical disappointment for Disney. Half a dozen Disney movie trailers featured a Disney clich√© ("cycle of life", "falling style"), overdramatic music, recycled footage (Disney claims "40% new material"). I even began to think that the story of James Earl Jones is getting a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman, who each make Warner Brothers narrative, is starting to scale down. I really believe that Disney bought a couple of BBC wildlife photographs that were made so spectacular that they felt it would sell selling orchestral music and recognizable sound bites on predators that hunt and kill mammals ? There were half a dozen such scenes, complete with bleating teenagers who were about to rip out their throats. I think Disney needs to realize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside the life and death struggles that appeals to action-oriented teenagers who have been implicated by their parents in this film. I also knew that Disney was not far off that the man had anything to do with climate change. Are they so frightened of the tiny minority of denials that they think it's still a controversial topic? <br /> <br /> I recommend skipping these and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. Nature films currently seem to be best made by the British.
