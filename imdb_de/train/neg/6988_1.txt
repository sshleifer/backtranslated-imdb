I was so excited to see this one of my favorite TV shows. I saw Universal's trademark with a new title and a theme song that still impressed me about a spaceship approaching an amusement park, and made this version great and fantastic. Shortly thereafter until the end ... I could not believe my eyes! How lucky I was that I could forget everything I had seen Tiffany songs and the theme of song in a new arrangement were in my head. In any case, I would like to see this family in space age (also The Flintstones and Yogi Bear) in all graphic computer designs as Toy Story or Bug's Life Hanna-Barberas in my opinion.
