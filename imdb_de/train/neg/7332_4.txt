Although it is a 2001 film, the direction is the art-house style of the 90s, which was considered "old" and outdated a few years ago. The cheesy cuts and effects were painful to look at. The script is decent, and a few scenes somehow intrigued me (as if the taxi driver brought them to the bridge at night). But the story of the detective, whose sister killed herself, and how obsessed with suicide, was just awful. The performance of the actor playing Selma Blair's married boyfriend seriously disturbed me. I've been through the whole thing, which is rare for the kind of random What's This movie you just find on TV and decide to watch it.
