Gods, I have not seen such a horrible movie for a long time. Maybe not since "The New Guy" or different Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes, that's amazingly awful. Mira Sorvino's stark and wooden acting must surely have been inspired by Freddie. The staging of the film was unpleasant (more like a play, and this sense of captivity does NOT work well in the movie). The actors had no idea what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was terrible and her sex appeal was nonexistent, so it was painful to see her "seduce" other characters and "fall" afterwards. And what about the occasional footage of a live audience on lawn chairs? Preposterous! I had to turn off the DVD player, it would have caused even pain to end this movie.
