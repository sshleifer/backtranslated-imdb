I will not quarrel with anyone who declares this movie to be outrageous, as is the performance of January Jones, but please review it in the AMC television series "Mad Men," which begins later this month. She is excellent. I suppose she took the taboo role for the money, and when she realized what a lazy mess it would become, she turned into a minimal drama job to avoid starvation. I know if that that's the case, but I (for now) know with certainty that she can act. <br /> <br /> First, when I saw "Taboo", I was convinced that their housing delivery was a wise choice that would later result in some significant revelations about their character or plot. No such luck. Hard to believe that the director did not even suggest to her that the expression of 17 consecutive scenes could not be changed. Her winning performance in "Mad Men" is a character that is very repressed, restrained and uncertain at least in her early appearances pretty colorless, no different than her "taboo" role. However, as the TV series progressed, she became a person questioning her traditional role of white-bread mothers from the early 1960s. I can not wait to see where they bring their character in season two. <br /> <br /> To summarize, avoid "taboo" like leprosy, but look at "Mad Men".
