Excuse me, did I miss something? I went out early The first ten minutes of unusual (and untrue!) stories made me think: "This is going to be a classic" But from then on it was all downhill! The acting was brilliant, because what William H Macy is worth is fantastic and gets better with every movie I watch. But it never seemed to connect. I've been waiting for the big moment when all the stories are connected and then suddenly ... it's raining frog ?? It was when the author said, "I've gone too deep, how can I cleverly bring all those stories together ... Oh damn, I'll just let it rain frogs." I like smart movies, I like strange movies, but that was just weird and boring. 4.10
