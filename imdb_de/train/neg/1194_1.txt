I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but not so many. It's a movie that makes fun of fat people, has no real story, has bad actors, is not funny and so much more. Is this a movie you would like to see? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> I suspect the creators of the movie have been trying to be original and creative, but it looks like it was made by a 12-year-old kid who has no cinematic skills at all. The so-called funny parts are as funny as rummaging through cakes in people's faces or breaking wind. Of course, if this is the kind of humor you like, then this is the movie for you! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money in this movie!
