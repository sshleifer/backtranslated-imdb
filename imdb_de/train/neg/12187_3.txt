The worst collaboration of De Niro Scorsese in this terrible, torturous, violent and lengthy mess. Scorsese is completely out of his element in this film, with the horror that suddenly rings loud and loud ringing gimmicks that seem ridiculous and embarrassing to such a master. The cast is completely wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie is the weakest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone! De Niro's psychotic Bowden is nothing more than the typical psycho killer of the 90s. The scene with De Niro and Lewis at the beginning is very uncomfortable and the climax goes on and on, and we should all be more than tired of the psycho-stalker who never dies. One of my worst movie experiences. Rent the original 100 times better. <br /> <br />
