I do not like The Pallbearer, it's not that bad, but it's very slow at the time. The film makes it more interesting, but nothing brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he is good here. I'm not a big Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but sometimes she does not bother me and she's fine. The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but if you like the leads, you might enjoy it.
