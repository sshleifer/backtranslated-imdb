I think the movie did not portray Smith historically. The goal of this film was to tell Smith's life in a way that is "comfortable" for the leaders of the LDS Church. The historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern. The film was conceived as a "Faith Promotion," not as a balanced view of Smith "as a man". My mission is to study Smith's life and read both LDS works and LDS works. The film, like most LDS projects, was beautifully filmed and played well. However, this was not a realistic account of the beginnings of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. <br /> <br /> It took a significant amount of time to replay an accident that Smith had at the age of seven. While this event was undoubtedly important to his mental attitude, the main reason for inclusion in the film seems to be a sympathetic view of Joseph Smith. Another point is the depiction of Smith's teenage years when the film is silent about Smith's involvement in magical practices in the 1820s. Another problem is that the film shows Joseph Smith good-naturedly taking part in wrestling competitions, but he does not show how he sometimes lost his temper and became violent. This film was in no way historical and should be considered as a fictional film about a man. I would not recommend watching this movie for anything other than entertainment.
