Absolutely one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time! It starts off badly and only worsens. Katherine Heigl is insanely miscast in a Lolita role, and Leo Grillo fights with his essentially cardboard-cut character. The only actor with enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who does it as a villain and completely surpasses his role. The script is awful, the drama terrible and it has big holes to drive through a double decker bus! It's also the sexiest movie I've ever seen! Katherine Heigl is completely unsympathetic. She is considered a wicked, wanton seductress who tempts the poor, innocent married man to cheat on his wife. Throughout the film, it is implied that she is a minor, and the message that accompanies this storyline is just a belief! In the end, she is not even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who obviously (ha!) Is angry with anger and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, all over the world Eyes of men to recover. Dreadful. Do not waste your time.
