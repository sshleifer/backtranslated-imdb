I read in the papers that W. Snipes was broke. No wonder he would participate in low-budget projects like The Contractor. Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he plays the lead role in a cheap action movie shot in Bulgaria (we're supposed to believe that the location is London, as only an idiot would buy). The story is that of 1000 other films: The retired special forces are good The guy is being recruited by the government to do a wet job - after the government wants to get rid of him - the good guy gets away after he has killed villains ( was that a spoiler?) (Eliza Bennett) surpasses all others in the cast !!! A star is for her plus a star for the feast of the eyes, Lena Headey, makes 2 stars. Only for diehard Snipes fans! All others: avoid!
