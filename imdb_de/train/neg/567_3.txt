This movie is one of the most horrible movies ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi be played in a movie? He is a singer and not an actor. Does he kill vampires with his guitar? And what about the terrible conspiracy? Oh my god, this movie is really shit. At the end is the Queen of the Vampires, played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade), surrounded by a vampire army, but when the "fantastic" Slayer arrive, only 4 Vampires are left !! What happened to the other 10-15 vampires? You walk in the sun ??? And what about the "Grand Finally" when Bon Jovi blows his head with a shotgun? This is really a "NOT". In "Buffy the vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with A SHOTGUN ??? This is really a lack of originality!
