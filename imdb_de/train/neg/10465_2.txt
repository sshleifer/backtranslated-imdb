I really wish I did not write this review. I am a Christian, so I waited anxiously for this movie. It seemed great - a Christian movie with some pretty famous stars and an action that was intriguing (not that I buy the Bible Code itself - you can say anything you want.) I do, but believe everything within the Bible). So I sit on the edge of my seat and enjoy the previews when the movie is on and my mood is destroyed within minutes. I had to bite my lip to avoid the terrible writing and acting during the theater visit (I would have been torn apart by the people who cheer for the rather awkward but fundamentally uplifting scenes and after the incredibly obvious and predictable gasps Air snap tension scenes, I'm sure). However, as soon as the credits started to roll, I could think. There were many parts of the movie I liked - some mostly unexpected twists of action, some effects that were really special (I do not count the visions.) These were done badly, and some interesting technical works - fades, sets kind of thing , Unfortunately, I had the distinct impression that if I read the Book of Revelation to a monkey and put the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour, I would have gotten a better script. And the music was cheesy (even for a Bond fan who likes kind of cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue). I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater - like the people who were crying and breathless because it was so incredible - but I'm not someone appeasing from a writer who casts a few words over a word becomes Biblical shell and suggests a Christian stamp on it. I need a good storyline and a credible dialogue before I can enjoy most of the movies, and nobody has. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And that's the tragedy. When will we see an intelligent Christian fiction? It has to be out there somewhere ...
