Wow ... what can I say ... First of all, IMDb says that this is the end of the 60s ... which means that Carlito is about to go to jail. They used a number of actors and a story that did not even make sense. They bring back only one actor, Guzman, and play a completely different guy. Why did it end with him and this Puerto Rican chick? Wheres Gale? He said that he was in love with her before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... They would think he was in this case. And if that made sense, where are Rocco and the black guy in the first one? It was just stupid ... This is an insult to Pacino and the first movie.
