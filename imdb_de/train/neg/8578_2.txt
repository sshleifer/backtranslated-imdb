One of the stupidest films of the 1940s, an unbearable ghost house comedy with music by Kay Kyser. Kyer, orchestra leader and radio star (and the eternal college fraternity), was something of the precursor to Spike Jones, who invited it for his guests and was eagerly supported by his jolly troupe of musicians. He is hired to play a birthday party in a sombre villa where poisoned arrows imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. The Shindig is filled with a scary judge, a scary professor, an ominous Swami, a lot of gigantic females and enough bad jokes to fill three Bob Hope images. The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are nothing special, and Kyser is also not very confident because he comes up with elbow-in-the-ribs material, which goes back in 1940 to ten years. * from ****
