It's curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a pair of movie stars who worked on the new medium of television and got even greater successes, and both got into the production of things and enjoyed the tycoon status on the small screen. Lucille Ball was not a big star, that would come with the television. As for Dick Powell, he was eager to get out of movies like "Meet The People" and his professional salvation would come in his next movie. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason Dick Powell made the movie was because a young MGM player got a special number, and he saw them back then. His private time with June Allyson was much better than what we see on screen. Powell looks excitedly bored and can not summon any emotion. <br /> <br /> He probably was tired of playing those musicals with stupid plots that he used in front of Warner Brothers. The original show "Meet The People" was not a bookshow, but a revue and ran on Broadway for 160 performances during the 1940-41 season. When MGM bought it, they scrapped everything except the title and the theme song. The rest of the score was patched by different and different songwriters. None of the songs is memorable. Strange, considering that some of the sources of Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen and Rodgers & Hart. These guys just have to empty the boot for the material. <br /> <br /> The plot is even darker than most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time. Powell is the author of a revue called Meet The People and he's a shipyard worker who wins a lotto date with movie star Lucille Ball. She is interested, he is interested, both are interested in the revue, but creative differences naturally keep them apart until the finale. That's the movie in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> MGM has given Powell and Ball some good musical acts, which are the main reason for seeing Meet The People. The big bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here and for me the highlight of the movie is Bert Lahr, dressed in a Commodore suit like Lou Costello in the dream sequence of In The Navy. The song Heave Ho was written by Arlen and Harburg, who wrote the courageous number of The Wizard Of Oz for Lahr. And since pretty much everyone in the world has seen this movie, you have an idea of ​​what Heave Ho looks like. Dick Powell's next film was Murder My Sweet, in which he eventually offers a not so popular adieu Musicals. And Lucy had to wait for the television before the world could see what she really could do.
