For me, this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst ever made. There is no tenderness or love or spirituality in this version, it's all macabre, Germanic, weird nonsense. It reminded me that the Nazis fell in love; who cares? <br /> <br /> This silent version by von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In it, we played John Gilbert and his rough relative, the Prince, for that stupid American actress, played by Mae Murray, obsessed with a modern perm and implausible feminist style that kept dropping me off. I like my romances light and beautiful, with slow constructions; not hard and sadistic like this one. And come on, the bee that licks its lips, let it go, girl! <br /> <br /> Watch a live performance of the show if you want to get a real idea of ​​the sweetness of Franz's original operetta Lehar Otherwise, wait for TCM to display the sound version of Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier , It's much better.
