When I heard this praise about this piece, I decided to look at it as I stumbled over cable. I do not see how this "elivates" women and their "struggles" by focusing on the subject. I think if you are interested in stories about the private realms of women and their implications for their lives, then this is for you. Otherwise, it is rather boring and boring. If anything, I found it a bit demeaning. <br /> <br /> I asked a friend who saw it and she also thought it was terrible. So it's not just a guy who does not understand.
