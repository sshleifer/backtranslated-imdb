I do not recommend this film because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story should be in the Algerian Berber area, it was filmed in the Southern Tunisian desert (totally different culture, I know that I come from both Tunisia and Algeria). The other shocking element was the character of her companion aunt. He speaks in the film with a very eloquent French French university student, while the character she plays should be of a disturbed personality that has never left her mountainous personality Bedouin with this type of education is not possible this context. The most disgraceful scene, which is disrespectful especially for the people in the region, is the "femme repudiee" segment, which is a pure invention of the writer / director. Such things will never happen to an Algerian society at all !!!
