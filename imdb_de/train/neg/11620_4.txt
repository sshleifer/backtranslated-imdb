I gave more than a 1 because I felt that there were some moral teachings in this story, and that has caused some thoughts and comments from my wife and I was struck with the God over the head, God and Christ our rescue stuff. The movie and the plot did not need it. If you are, as I am, a recovering Catholic or Christian, avoid it, it will make you sick. The film has the thin line between a good citizen and the question of how someone could become a potential stalker, focusing on what might have been.
