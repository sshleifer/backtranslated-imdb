I would like to warn you here: I chose the critics who said that this was not an action movie in the usual sense, but rather a psychological drama, so you should appreciate it on that basis and you'll be fine. <br /> <I am here to tell you that you were wrong. Completly wrong. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not quite; It's very disappointing if you're looking for an action movie, they were right. But it is also very unsatisfactory on all other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not so bad, I think, not worse than usual; but what did they have to do with Billy Zane? Was it a kind of death wish of the producers? A way to make her movie a flop guaranteed? In this case it worked. <br /> <br /> If they were really looking for success, why not hire someone who can act? Oh, and might as well choose a scriptwriter who knows how to write. Ah, yes, and a director who knows how to direct. <br /> <br /> As someone who has been through this mess and actually believed it would soon redeem itself, I can assure you that it never did. Too bad it could have been a good movie.
