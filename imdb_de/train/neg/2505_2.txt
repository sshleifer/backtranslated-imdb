I've seen enough of Little Richard both in interviews and in performances, and enough of poor Leon recorded in the '50s /' 60s to know that Leon was not the right actor for the role. Leon was as right as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but he could not capture the essence of Little Richard in this film. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Núñez, the Little Richard in "Why do fools fall in love?" It was a far more appropriate choice to extract the musician's powerful but feminine personality. <br /> <br /> If the performances are not convincing, the movie will be like that. And that's exactly what happened here. LR's forays into homosexuality and voyeurism are overlooked or completely overlooked. What made "The Temptations" so good at recording the rise of the group, warts and all that, missed this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> What happens to director Robert Townsend, who started so well "The Hollywood Shuffle"? He's a talented, funny guy, but he did not do anything near that first effort.
