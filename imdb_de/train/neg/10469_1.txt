Yes, I admit, I cried during this movie. It was so incredibly disappointing that I could not help crying. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) has done it again. First with the Million Dollar Man (former professional wrestler) on their program and now with this one. <br /> <br /> The Omega Code follows a flow of sketchy religiously oriented films. It was quite amusing, but at the same time it was disturbing that it was so biblically inaccurate. The film follows the so-called "Bible code" rather than the actual biblical script. This movie is extremely poorly made; from his writing to his directing to his incredibly horrible drama. It's depressing that people really get involved in this movie. It seemed more like a late-night movie someone saw on the USA channel, or a home-made video as a theatrical release depended on it.
