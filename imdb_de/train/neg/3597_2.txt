Well, there you have it, another disillusionment on my account. Two actually! First of all, although I am a little bit aware of the exploitation of the 70s and their richest contributions, I have never heard of Joseph W. Sarno. Here's a guy who made over seventy rancid and iconic commercials, and I have not seen one! As? Why? What happened here? Second, and even worse, just as you think you've found a new source for obscure cult films, the director's most famous and supposed "masterpiece" proves to be an irrevocably boring and irritating film. While lesbian vampire films make up a rather insignificant sub-genre overall, some of them bathe in an ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality (like José Larraz's "Vampyres" or Harry Kümmel's "Daughters of Darkness"). Joseph Sarno's film has nothing to offer, except plenty of nudity and even that gets boring quickly. The events take place in a remote old castle, hidden deep in the German mountains, where five centuries ago a malevolent and bloodthirsty baroness lived. Their faithful disciples still hold naked dance parties in the catacombs of the castle, illuminated by penis-shaped candles, and hope to revive the baroness soon. Suddenly (does not even ask how), the castle is full of young and sexy female guests, so that more erotic rites follow. Sounds delicious and entertaining enough, but "The Devil's Plaything" contains a tremendous number of sequences in which literally nothing happens and the actors' ignorant facial expressions are simply unbearable! Sarno is not able to create suspense or create a gothic atmosphere (or maybe he just did not bother), and the actresses' abilities are limited to standing in front of the camera and showing a really pathetic face , Please do yourself a favor: no matter how desperate you try to see all the bizarre lesbian vampire movies of the 70s, this movie is not worth a penny! Even the repertoires of Jess Franco and Jean Rollin are pure art compared to this guy.
