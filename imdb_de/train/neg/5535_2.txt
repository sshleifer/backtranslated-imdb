I think the biggest failure that can have a thing is boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It has the interesting fact that it takes place in Cambodia. Like many American films of the 1930s, they take place in Cambodia. Nevertheless, the conflict is a little difficult to find out. Even the troop movements are a bit confusing. What brings an overwhelming stoppage is the love story. Why these two guys are so fixated on the dippy blonde, I do not know. I thought he should keep using his zombies (as they are) and forget everything about them. The movie just trots on. The perfect microcosm is where one of the main characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphics (or whatever) that explain how to turn humans into zombies are kept. I thought they would never get there. A man takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy is hiding behind a few pillars. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some bushes. This is the movie in a nutshell. Then there is the bad spectacle and the threadbare dialogue. I really have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This one is unbearable. Incidentally, a more appropriate title would be Revolt of the Hypnotized.
