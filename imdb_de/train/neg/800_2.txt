In fact, this 1999 film has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive and reasonably talented. There is not a bunch of clowns running around and spending hundreds of rounds, but never tossing meat. There are no wild car chases in which worth billions of dollars worth of beautiful machines are scrapped. <br /> <br /> The interior looks architecturally modern and the equipment looks like snuff. Well, there is this high-tech computer room, which is equipped with leftovers from a 1950s electronics lab. And the pancake make-up on the corpses broke me. No pancake make-up in the traditional sense, but what dried pancake dough looks like on the skin. This is to support the idea that the bodies are calcified - although the way the virus would perform this transmutation remains a task for the student (onlooker). <br/> <br /> Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci-fi. I know about a horror movie, but I can not. A computer virus transmitted through a television screen (or computer monitor) that becomes a deadly biological pathogen? Give me a break. Warp Drives a la "Star Trek" are one thing, but photons become viruses? This is so stupid that the desired "shock factor" is simply not feasible. The strip could have used one of those dreadful dream sequences where the dead come to life, or let a cat jump out of the closet or something, because the viral thing does not do anything. <br /> <br /> It is believed that Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this mad music that Lord Oliver has given for some of his later, shabby settings. He needed the money. However, no other comparison between the two should be construed.
