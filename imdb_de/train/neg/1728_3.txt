**** Do not read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of "The Crater Lake Monster" to be a surprise. **** <br /> <br /> A Toning Plesiosaur rises from the depths of Crater Lake to wreak havoc on a group of local rednecks, not to mention your fast-forward button. To call "The Crater Lake Monster" amateurish is to overestimate the obvious. If you're not a fan of low-budget drive-in movies, you probably will not look here. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that there is no monster action, it's really shit and is not going anywhere. The script is very Ed Wood-ish, as it is fully thought out as it sets up the main action sequences. Nothing wrong with The Crater Lake Monster. It explains his dinosaur by a meteorite strike in Crater Lake that "overheats" the water to the point where it breeds a dinosaur egg that seems to have been resting on the bottom of the lake for millennia. Even if we could accept that the egg had lain there so long and remained uncovered and viable, would not the "water" at such a high temperature "overheat" that most of the lake evaporates? Apart from a few puffs of fog in one or two scenes, we see no sign that the water is hot, except a few lines in the script. <br /> <br /> The script is rather obviously replenished in some sequences, and it will do anything to bring the characters close to the lake so that they can be threatened by the clay dino. A couple just going through car problems decides to rent a boat and drive into Crater Lake. Hmmmm ... do you think these strangers in the story could be there to catch our title monstrosity? In a sequence that is just bizarre, a drunk man robs a liquor store and decides to kill the cashier and a spectator instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of brandy. It is followed by a chase, and you would not know ... They land directly on the lake. Snack time for Cratey! Yes, it is not difficult to find out, and you are so far ahead of the script that you are confused when these scenes take another ten minutes to unfold. <br /> <br /> The shamelessness of everything is adorable and I really want to like "The Crater Lake Monster". I just can not do it. There is not enough here to keep going, and this is more like a movie that can be shown during a party because you could talk about it directly and it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The film contains a small list of things for which it is intended. The most important thing is the dinosaur itself, which appears in three forms: a shadow puppet, a large model head pulled through the water wooden, and a fully realized claymation insert that looks really good. There are also some lovable hicks and they carry most of the intentional humor in the movie. After a downbeat-ending we mourn for the death of both the monster and one of our beloved Hicks, so that all the best of this movie is dead in the end. Why was I so affected by this conclusion? Was it the sad song played in the credits? Or did I only cry inwardly for the time I wasted such films?
