I write this review after seeing it a few months ago. The trailer looked so promising for me that I could buy this lame excuse for a movie. It's a complete joke ... and in the true sense of the word a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), with whom they could even compete on the back cover art. The producer who played Brandon should turn over burgers and serve greasy hamburgers. Hell, maybe he's not good at it! The lighting was badly bad and a big hassle during the movie sometimes you could not even see the faces of the actor. I do not even remember the rest of the cast, which is really sad, bad, that they never impress anything to make them memorable. That's all the time I'm wasting for this review. PLEASE stay as far away as possible from this dump, even if you can get it for 25 cents. Do not do it, buy a piece of gum, at least it would entertain you! br /> <br /> If you want good quality on a low budget, this is way better than this ... then watch a Jeff Hayes movie ... because it takes talent to make it into horror, and the child has it! br /> <br /> I gave this 1-star just for the cover cover. That's the only thing that's worth taking part in this so called "movie". <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
