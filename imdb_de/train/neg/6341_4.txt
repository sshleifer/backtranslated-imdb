East Palace, West Palace reminded me a bit of The Detective, starring Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. I think it's a progressive movie for China, but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men: Much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The film focuses on a man who desperately wants to be dominated and hurt by a macho man. He crosses the park without fear - he hopes the officer will take him to the station house. And that actually happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while he is subjected to mild torture: crouched down for a while, handcuffed, beaten. That's what the gay man wants, and implicitly the gay man challenges the policeman's self-image as a male man. The story about the life of the gay man (including flashbacks) is bearable, but when he begins to describe ancient Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes unbearable. China's gays, who only want to play a traditional role in Chinese society, are becoming sympathetic. Sorry, I can not relate.
