Blow !!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was there. I was disappointed to find that she had two short scenes towards the end. Apart from that I basically pressed the fast-forward button. A teenager goes to Romania with his father, is bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf at full moon. He kills his father and his friends. About 30 years ago, but he does not age much and enrolls in a high school. There he meets a shy teacher whom he bites and then has children with him. This movie is shitty and I can not recommend it to anyone. Instead, read War and Peace. Only Mrs. Hartman has done a great job. Look at a very young Bob Saget in this !!
