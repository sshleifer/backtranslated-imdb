Of course "Flatley" is not exactly the ideal name for a dancer, but I think Michael really pushes the irony cover with this new title: "Feet of Flames" I recommend Desenex Foot Spray to the reserved (and clearly offensive) Flatley. <br /> <br /> I could add, much like the cheering London crowd (see below) live performance. <br /> <br /> "Flatley is cheered on by his enthusiastic London audience." ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide
