After his wife had gone their own way, in 1972 Elvis Presley began meeting with Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a cheerful, long-haired, pretty, statuesque beauty queen, is drawn for a void in Elvis's life. When Elvis's divorce became final, Linda was already in use as a live-in-girlfriend and travel companion to the legendary performer until 1976. <br /> <br /> This is a tricky look at her love affair and camaraderie. Linda cared with all her heart for the needs and desires of her lover. And even accept his swallowing medication from the handful and introduce her into her own love affair with Valium. Sometimes this movie is hard and dark; A very unattractive look at the "king" and his queen. Don Johnson is absolutely terrible as Elvis. To work over the handle is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist is missing the class of Linda, but she does the job pretty well. The cast includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz. Seeing this twice is more than enough for me, but do not be deterred by this review. For most Elvis fans I've talked to, this is not a preferred presentation.
