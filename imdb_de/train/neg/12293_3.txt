This is only beaten because it leads David Hasselhoff. Well, let me beat it. Compared to the garbage they call horror today, this movie is not that bad. It has the beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super hot but can not speak very well. There is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped. She shows her beautiful body. Linda Blair is doing nothing as good as Hasselhoff here. 3.10
