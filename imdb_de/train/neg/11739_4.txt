The often reliable Leonard Maltin says that this is a "delightful romance" and that Sanders is "outstanding". Maltin must have mistaken this movie for something else. Sanders is averse as usual and gorgeous ?? one can imagine that he has delivered the line in relation to adultery: "Sometimes the chains of marriage are so heavy that they have to be carried by three", but boring, wooden and dated describe this film more closely. The storyline itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a loveable jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes head of the police, but barely able to oppose the lure of his jewels, is entertaining enough, but has the same kind of historic Hollywood treatment that is damaging Epochs became like * Marie Antoinette * and certainly the unfortunate * Forever Amber * (crying for a stylish remake). Although Sanders tries to give his character some depth in his defense, this is all in vain. I am an incorrigible Douglas Sirk fan, but this is 1946, and it is one of Sirk's earliest American efforts, lacking many of the signature accents that would characterize his bustling, chest-swinging potboilers. Sirk is getting wet here and made a series of memorable movies over the next decade, until he struck gold with * Magnificent Obsession * and took his step, bombarding us with estrogen celebrations like * All That Heaven Allows *. , * Written on the wind * and * imitation of life *. But * Scandal In Paris * is hardly his best work? a relatively low budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costumes.
