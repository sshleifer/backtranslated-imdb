I declined to see this when it was originally aired, and appreciated the memory of the late, lamented 1960s series with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can never resist a challenge. I should have known better. Not just a remake and more a parody than a tribute, this show did not quite know how to play it, and was overflowing with infantile comedy and comic plots and characters. The three main characters were little more than cartoons of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer is painful in a clear role). The supporting actors were just comedian acquaintances of Vic and Bob, who wanted to be part of the joke, and were far too aware of the situation to convince. And although the CGI could not improve the effects that were available 30 years earlier, it merely dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work and did little to obscure the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue. All style and no substance. (And while the 1960s show is mocked for a lot of time, this "update" is now also very outdated, with "Matrix"-style fashions, compulsory "Girl Power" scenes, and low tension between the two living. )
