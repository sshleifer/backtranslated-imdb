You must see my comments on many films under Evren Buyruk. But I'm ready to comment on a movie that's not even worth a minute of conversation. This movie basically consists of two hours of Dafoe's character drinking almost literally - to death. The only surprise in this movie is that you did not have enough clues or drawing knowledge to be surprised. It was just a cruel, sad waste of time. Willem Dafoe is a great actor. Peter Stormare is a great actor. But this movie was just shitty. Slow makes the movie not bad, it was just bad. The sketchy plot, blended with artistic alternations of anamorphic details, is not meaningfully drawn coherently for an action, unless there are some highlights that are presented in the end from multiple perspectives. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as a conversation I fell asleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to watch the movie again - which was even more disappointing.) In general, I do not want to make any negative comments or reviews on the work of others, even if they suck, but this movie has a justification. It is a pity that these great actors were ashamed of this end result.
