After watching Awake, I came to a conclusion: director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake want to laugh at the audience because the film is full of ridiculous elements of absurd and ridiculous elements (eg the hospital uniform, the the spirit of the main character used ... did the mind of a doctor let him in the ground?). The concept behind this movie is a bit ingenious, but all the plot holes and the absurd things make this movie a stupid and crappy movie. With the exception of the great Lena Olin, all actors perform poorly. Hayden Christensen has zero expression and the same goes for Jessica Alba role. Awake makes the audience laugh. It's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it's impossible to take it seriously. My recommendation is: skip this crappy movie.
