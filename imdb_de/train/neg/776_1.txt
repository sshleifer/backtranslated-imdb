I remember seeing this cartoon when I was 6 or 7 years old. My grandfather bought the video for free in the mall. I remember that it was really shit. The story had no meaning. I hated the fox who became Casper's friend. He was so stupid! Casper cried his head when he could not find a friend. So what? Get over it! The only good part, and I do not want to be mean, was when the fox was shot and died in the end. I laughed my head out because this cartoon sucked so much. The bad news is that the fox is revived and becomes a ghost. I wish he had died. I think I even gave the video to someone because I hated it. No wonder they offered it in the mall for free. If you have a child, do not allow it. You'll probably agree that it's shit.
