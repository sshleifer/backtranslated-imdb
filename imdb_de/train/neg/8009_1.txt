In The Lost Son, a private gaze looking for a missing man stumbles over a child prostitution ring. This movie contains all the worst stereotypes you can imagine in a worst-case scenario that exists only in Hollywood, the press, and AG John Asscrap. If you get the chance to see this, you better get lost yourself.
