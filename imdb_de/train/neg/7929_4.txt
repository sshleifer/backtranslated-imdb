I think if you're into science fiction and horror stuff, it might be interesting. The acting was okay, but not great. The two pregnant girls are said to be fifteen but are obviously played by older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twenty-one at the time. The plot is alright, but the story jumps around a bit, suggesting you're in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the warp speed between the two. The Catholic Church is portrayed as having a mysterious sect to study events that happen only to those of the faith. What if the two girls had been Protestant? Would the Catholics care? So some, what has done. Who knows, maybe someday the Catholic Church will even learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this, you do not feel that you have lost something.
