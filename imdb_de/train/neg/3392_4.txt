What about Indonesian music films? I have never seen Indonesian music films like in Bollywood. They miss the spirit of the story and only a few "as they call it" poetic lines. <br /> <br /> This story about the love of two children, who are separated and meet again after a few years of change, has no particular comments. It's a simple plot (albeit fairly focused) with musical storylines that should be here and there. <br /> <br /> Bewildering characters who should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected. The lead actress may try to live the character, but it's the best she can do by trying. As for casting, I do not have the need to include a Balinese student in this story, and of course that's not the only unnecessary character. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is, why would I want to watch this movie? Maybe because of the mangoes ...
