Before I start, I love Eddie Izzard. I think he's one of the funniest stand-ups today. Maybe that means I'm over-expectations, but I did not find Eddie funny on this trip. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Eddie is trying hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic, and we all love him for it. But in Circle he seems to be more irrelevant than funny and has lost me in some places completely. He's already covered many of the issues he's reported on - I even think I've seen some recycled jokes there. If you buy the DVD, you'll get a look behind the scenes of Eddie's tour (interesting in places, but not very funny) and a French version of one of his shows. For die-hard people, it's a pleasure to see Eddie in another language, but the comedy with subtitles is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Eddie, you either already have it or you go there and buy what I say. If you just go through, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill, you will not be disappointed. You probably become with Circle.
