Spoiler? Maybe a few details, but nothing that relates to the plot. Not as it would be important in this film. <br /> <br /> Air Rage blatantly breaks the mid-air infiltration premise of Executive Decision. Ice-T leads a team of four "elite" commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine hiding invisible body armor because of their idiotic tactics (similar to those used by third-grade students use them while playing Star Wars on the playground) make them absorb a hail of shots <br /> <br /> What kept me most entertained about this movie was the use of looking actors. You'll immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once played in a movie you really liked, even though it's been so long since you probably can not place him (it was Porky's). Here Cyril plays a decent knock-off of a Bill Paxton character. The funniest thing is the pork merchant Gil Gerard, who is so fat you'll never see him as Buck Rogers on TV. Rather than recalling his mildly heroic character, Gerard gives us a decent performance of the crusty, fat, hard personality that John Goodman clearly envisioned. Finally, Alex Cord as Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas-type gives us a nice hybrid performance. In the 10 years since New Jack City, the spectacle of Ice-T has deteriorated noticeably. It's not so much a regurgitation of lines that he actually learned by heart. <br /> <br /> One of the elements that will be played in this movie is a CD-ROM with classified information. It is worn by hand and is apparently incredibly encrypted, despite the security-conscious aura of Gerard's NSA character. What a joke. I strongly doubt that the information supposedly contained on the CD will ever be summarized in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite what happens in a closed plane without a muffler, the gunfire is about as loud as the air from the can, causing hardly anyone to shrug, so obviously no budget. The selection of weapons is pretty funny. The use of a coffee pot by the flight attendant is the most realistic portrayal of violence in film. If it's intuitive to the mini-Uzi gun, which must be one of the worst gun designs ever made, that's just too stupid. A real elite team would wear MP-5 for these kinds of things or maybe SOCOMM .45 or even Hi-Powers, if they were really old schools, or maybe FN 5.7, if it's a new school. The Lame-o Standard Edition 92Fs It is absolutely unbelievable that after Lethal Weapon I they have lost most of their coolness. Function extension, which is not a silencer. <br /> <br /> There was a touch of realism in which I wanted to correct the other reviewers: the flight attendant and Ice-T lowered the vehicle to 10,000 feet for "breathing air" before opening the door. And I also had the impression that the flight attendant could NOT close the door, that she basically just gave up this point. At landing, flaps were not mentioned until about 2 seconds before touchdown. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only the Dukes of Hazard who have escaped Roscoe P. Coltrane on the "Pass" could shame this movie because of the use of footage. They obviously opted for the incredible (and retired) SR-71 because they could not get hold of F-117. Apart from the fact that they were mothballed in 2001, we forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth plane in the spirit of the B-2, up close. I'm not an expert, but I have doubts whether radar would be invisible. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, the repeated references to "F-15s" when they showed F -16s were ridiculous. Details of the 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would put the few passengers first on a 747, not to mention anything else idiotic. Watch out for exposed electrical wiring. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a performance. Catch it on stars or something. Do not pay to rent it, but make sure it laughs. In the competition for the worst movie of all time, topped with No Holds Barred, who had at least some originality.
