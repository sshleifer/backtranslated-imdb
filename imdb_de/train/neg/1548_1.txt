Lorne Michaels proves once again that he has absolutely no business in producing films. <br /> <br /> You'd think he'd have "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads" after such bleak spins. Start with the idea that he may not know what he's doing, though it's about films (and many would say that he does not know what he's doing when it comes to television). Trying to make feature films out of skits that have been welcomed by SNL for the third time makes no sense. <br /> <br /> I personally like Tim Meadows and think he would be great in the right movie. It's a shame to see a talented man wasted in a movie that is detrimental to an inglorious situation and ends with a terribly bad song and dance scene. Every laugh here will be because the movie is so bad, not because it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired SNL characters who never make films about it. It's just too bad that this movie made it to the big screen.
