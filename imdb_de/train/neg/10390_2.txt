I only rented and watched this movie just to see what the hustle and bustle is all about. So here are my reactions. It's easy to see that this is a movie with low budgets and poor actors. The main feature of this movie is that a woman takes revenge on her rapists. If this concept is done right, this could turn out to be a really provocative film. However, the movie does not shock or bother me at all. It just bores me. This movie can easily be shortened to less than 45 minutes. All the scenes are mainly meant to fill in time, like these scenes and some scenes that I have described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains Spoiler ***** ******* I find the rape scenes pretty tame. I do not know if I saw the cut or uncut version, if there really is such a version. I have also found many action holes in the already poorly written plot. Here is a list at the top of my head. <br /> <br /> Why did not the rapists rape Jennifer during the night, when she went out to find out what these sounds are. That would be an excellent time. <br /> <br /> Why do not you simply rape her, instead of stopping some rapists from doing so and prolonging Jennifer's agony for so long? It would probably be shocking and disturbing. <br /> <br /> I thought it was really stupid that the rapists left them in the forest and returned to their house. Maybe to show that these rapists are really morons. <br /> <br /> These rapists should at least know that if they want to do a dirty job right, they should not send cowardly idiots to do the job /> <br /> Why did not Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left? Which should be the first for most people, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why do not these rapists smell danger for miles when they saw Jennifer alive? <br /> <br /> I find it really amazing that a slim lady like Camille can pull up a man tree and hang him up. ************************ Ends the spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But hey, Camille Keaton is great and I can hear one of the funniest lines I've heard recently when Matthew protests to go back into the house and kill Jennifer, "Why me? Why me, me I did not even come !!! '
