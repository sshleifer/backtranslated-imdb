Jeff Lowell wrote and directed "Over Her Dead Body" badly. First of all, the idea is as outdated as my jokes and the execution is just a whiff. <br /> <br /> Minus Eva Longoria Parker There is hardly anything appealing in this film. Eva always looks great and delivers a nice performance. Paul Rudd looks dejected and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete failure. She looks male and delivers a strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted, as is Lindsay Sloane. <br /> <br /> I expected more from this movie with entertainment. Unfortunately, I was not entertained.
