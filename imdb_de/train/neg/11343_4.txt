1. viewed 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): Drab and unspectacular alleged successor to the originally animated "101 Dalmatians". Yes, the movie continues where it ended in the first, but the problem is that it looks very much like the original. One of the great things about the original was the tempo of the story that it does not have. The animation is also very unspectacular for Disney and all we get is that the same characters go through the same kind of story again. When will Disney stop boring us with sequels and re-do's etc.? If we stop renting or buying that mediocre price they have spent.
