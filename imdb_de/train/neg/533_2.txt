I knew that 'Evening' was a girl's movie, so I expected it to be boring. An angry taunt on IMDb had said it was a "chick movie" but that your companion would survive. <br /> <br /> Survival? Yes. I'm still here, but when we both came out, we were amazed that it had only taken two hours - it seemed like a much longer evening than that! I suppose it's probably uplifting or intriguing to Yanks because they're rich people living on the beach - well, on the beach, in a house with a wide porch and a lawn, but no apparent lawn mower. If you are impressed by something like this, this could be a pretty short film. <br /> <br /> There's a Monty Python movie about a knight who just will not die. It ends with a jiggling torso (why does Yanks add a third syllable to that word?) Threats against his nemesis continue on the street. This movie is also about a kind of dead death. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for the fool pictured here) dies of inappropriate guilt. She does not worry that she was a big-eyed bimbo, but introduces herself as a murderer. Of course, it's a girl's movie that should have a Mr. Darcy / Heathcliff character. I'm not a joker, so I can not claim to be a good judge for such things, but the boring weakling used for this role seems to have only the title of a servant in his favor. He is a bloodless cipher. <br /> <br /> As you may know, the main characters are not much cop, but the smaller ones are surprisingly much worse off. There is a man whose only job is to respond to the news that his girlfriend is Preggers. Fair enough, but it's not the role of Hamlet - why is it so bad? I forgot it was a girl's movie and thought he was going to be thrown out because a decent friend told him that Fungus would not flatter him, but then I realized that she must have encouraged him to grow, "Bart "because he looked worse without him. <br /> <br /> I stayed awake when I discovered which actors and actresses had their ear lobes attached or had vacant, and noticed interesting scenes from the landscape - if you're dragging along, see If you can see the stuffed buffalo head, That's exactly what you would expect in a beach house. Apart from the obligatory wedding, there is only a single piece of action. They would have thought that they had understood correctly. Unfortunately, the accident is carried out by a car that could not be there. When the accident is discovered, the performers wander off calling for a character they do not know is nearby. If they have no idea that the person is only a few miles from the place, why are they wandering aimlessly towards him? I suspect that the apology of the director is that it should be a half-remembering dream sequence. <br /> <br /> Another scenery object that caught my attention was a copper pot. I did not think the technology was developed until the fifties.
