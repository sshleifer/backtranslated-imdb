First of all, I am not an American or Middle East. Second, I have no religion. What comes closest to a religion I have is sports and movies. From now on, I believe that I could best serve to give a neutral and unbiased opinion. <br /> <br /> Most of these shorts are a shame. This terrible event was to be used to commemorate all those innocent people who were murdered by "some" barbarous and uncivilized idiots. Instead, most of what I saw in these short films was imaginary attempts to rate different political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) The segment of Ken Loach. Sure, we're all sad that this guy had a hard life in his country, but what does that have to do with the innocent victims of 2001? Two mistakes make no right? What ever! This movie should have a subtitle for those who have difficulty hearing a partially incoherent Chilean-English accent. <br /> <br /> 2) Most disturbing is Youssef Chahine's segment. It is obvious that he has problems with logic. He justified the murders because America was a democracy and because some Americans had elected the politicians in power. All Americans are ultimately responsible for the actions and decisions of their leaders in the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this guy real? Some Americans do not even vote! Some Americans do not even know where the Middle East is. Some do not even know what religion is practiced there. and the majority do not know the real political problems that are played behind the scenes. Mr. Chahine, the reason why we have all these problems in the world is that too many people are working with their kind of logic. The innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from around the world. The murdered firefighters, rescuers, office workers, bystanders and passengers have nothing to do with politics. And yet we can not live in our lives because "some" people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion. We are perceived as a fair game for extreme politics. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed its own bomb victims. Another filmmaker used this event to push his own political agenda. Sometimes it's not about you. Some people always think of "me, me, me". Sometimes they are other people. <br /> <br /> 4) Idrissa Ouedraogo's segment is a joke and another political point writer. They obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> This film belittles the memory of the victims of "Sept. 11, 2001". <br /> <br /> The best thing is the TRASH CAN.
