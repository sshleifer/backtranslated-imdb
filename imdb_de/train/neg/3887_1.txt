With MST3K I have looked at this, and oh man, even with the riffing this movie was painfully bad. Imagine someone whose competence could be done with a camera from a monkey. <br /> <br /> The highlights (which gave little of it) came from the special effects that were "OK". The play was for the most part also "OK"; Although nothing special, it was of higher quality than other B-movies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is extremely bad the cameraman on roller skates and pushed him along. The story (if you can call it that) is so full of holes that it's almost funny. She never really explains why she has survived for the first time or needs human flesh to survive. The script is poorly written and the dialogue borders on stupid airplane. The highlight of the movie (if there is one) is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you can not find the MST3K version, avoid it at all costs.
