I recently saw the first Guinea Pig movie, The Devil's Experiment, and I have to admit that I'm disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie is invariably included in every list of "mean movies" and maybe I expected more of the hype. The truth is, I do not rate it. <br /> <br /> If I had thought at the sight of the opening text ("I found this band ..."), maybe I would have done a bit of bothering that it was real. Even if I did not know it was not real, I would have found out that it was not really the case. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, the girls react to what's being done with them, not what they should be. She should scream like a banshee in pain. The fact that she is not means that it is obviously not genuine. I would not like to see it if it were real, but if she was more convincing in her acting, the movie would be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> And then there are the notorious scenes: Nothing touched me at all until scalpel in hand. The hot oil, the maggots and the innards did not bother me. I do not say that I am "hard"; Except that I could not suspend my disbelief, also because the girl was idle. The scalpel made me wince a bit, but the hammer on my hand just made the hand look like rubber. And the last scene with the eye was a bit twitch again, but nothing more. I did not want to look away and I was not bad either. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because the movie is about twenty years old or because I'm just dull. The truth is, I did not find this movie disturbing at all. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of things you'd expect on a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise in removing characters, history, etc., and just leaving the torture, it works on some levels. As a disturbing piece of the movie it did not work for me at least. <br /> <br /> I saw Guinea Pig with my wife bent over by "It's just a movie" and she wondered what that all was about the fuss was going on. We discussed why I watch these films, and there are many reasons for that, but also the desire to be influenced by a movie. She said she did not think a movie could be so convincing that it would bother her and told me to do just that. I played her the fire extinguisher scene of Irreversible and she was actually disturbed. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure I have a point except that we were both disturbed by a scene in a non-ghastly state genre movie than any previous movie that bothers.
