Herbie, the Volkswagen who thinks like a man, is back and is now driven by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman hoping to become NASCAR champion. The only thing in her way is the current champion Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop her. <br /> <br /> The original love mistake was not so good. Already as a child I remember that I did not like it very much. However, I had hope for the sequel. I mean, the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it look like a pretty funny movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is no better now than before. The film is defiantly weak for people over 12 years. He'll probably entertain the kids, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I realize it's a children's movie, but everyone could have made the movie more interesting. There were very few laughs and in the end it got boring. Most actors seemed dead in their roles as well. Lindsay Lohan was fine as Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances like in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon has shown the best performance of all. He was very good as a villain, even though he did not have much to do. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and do not do anything special. Angela Robinson is directing and she is doing a good job. She tries to keep the movie interesting, but works with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the script and would you be surprised that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make light films, but do not make the stories really interesting or enjoyable. It's not entirely their fault, but hopefully they'll try harder next time. In the end, Herbie is a safe, predictable family movie worth seeing when you're a kid. Everyone else should do without it. Rating 4/10
