Let me first say that I'm not a fan of horror movies. I never look at them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw this movie was that my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see it Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> ... I've never seen Happy Feet before, but I'm sure it's better than this ... movie? Anyway, we did not expect it to be good ... we just just ran in to laugh about it. Cool with me ... I have a problem ruining the movie for other people in the theater, but since it was just other couples talking, it did not matter. After 15 minutes the 2 other people went to Borat, a movie I would have liked to see again. The movie was not scary and not stupid so it would be funny ... it was just boring. It was not as horrible as "Baby Genuises", it was awful like ... not entertaining at all. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not an expert, but it seems like the problem of the horror industry nowadays is that you can have a PG-13 horror that is boring and not scary horrible horror movie for people are either too bloody or too disgusting. <br /> <br /> You want a PG-13 horror that's annoying but funny? See "The Grudge." Avoid this movie like the plague ... because it literally bores you to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
