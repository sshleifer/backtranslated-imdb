Power Rangers, the foolish 1990s merchandising television program for children, must be the most meaningless and ridiculous television series ever created. Do you rate plastic nonsense for kids? There is nothing that redeems in this show even remotely or interesting. <br /> <br /> Look at the costumes that look like spandex. Fashions of the early 1990s look ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show at all costs!
