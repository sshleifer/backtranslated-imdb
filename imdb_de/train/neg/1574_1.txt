There is no story! The plot is hopeless! A movie based on a car with a stuck accelerator, no brakes, and a stuck automatic shift lever can not be good! I would have stopped the car within a minute, whether I was there or in the police car that was constantly following it. I'm sorry for the actors who had to endure such a bad script. The few scenes in which there was a certain resemblance to the action were heavily over-dramatized and as far removed from reality as possible. There were also many mistakes, for example the hood of the out-of-control car, which was popped at 100 mph. At first it simply folded over the windshield as in reality, but then it blew off. The car was later seen in the movie with the hood .... <br /> <br /> This movie was nothing but annoying, stay away!
