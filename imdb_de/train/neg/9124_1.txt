This may not be the worst movie Peter Sellers has ever done (I think the Laurel goes to "The Prisoner of Zenda"), but he's certainly the most depressing. Salesman, especially without makeup as Nayland Smith, looks like he's just had chemo. As a Fu Manchu, he looks barely better and spends most of the film (with the exception of the oddly disconcerting scenes of being shaken with electric currents) about to collapse under the weight of all that make-up. The supporting players also look tired and run-down, and Sid Caeser's presence is also without his constant references to "Chinks!" (A ray of hope: This would be one of the last times a big movie would make Asians so offensive ... or, in that sense, a non-Asiatic like one!). The film seems surprisingly cheap, with lush photographs and gritty sets - even the Whizz-Bang-Elvis number at the end looks low. Only the breathtaking Helen Mirren and the tall, thin, nervous man who wet his pants do not give this sad affair a spark. All in all, this film offers an uncanny foreshadowing the death of a big comic and even more sinister documentation of his dying.
