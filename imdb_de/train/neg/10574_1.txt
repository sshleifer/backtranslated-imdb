With the exception of FAMILY, this new season is worse than in the first season. I can not imagine what they think. As a fan of horror, he can tolerate loads of gore and thoughtless chaos, but this series gets worse with every trip. I can not imagine how daunting it must be for the actors and the crew to go to work every day and work to bring out such crap. HISTORY! Is that too much? CHARACTER! How can we think about the fate of EVERYONE in these stories? If we are not engaged, who cares if they are carved or whatever? Almost every episode ends with mindless bloodshed, without the impression of revelation or conclusion, or the reason why we were exposed to an hour of bloodshed. Even Dante's efforts this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered to a pointless conclusion. Ironically, the production values ​​and performance are up-to-date, while the content is absolutely crap. I have high hopes in Garris' VALARIE UNDER THE STAIRS of Exec Producer, but we'll see.
