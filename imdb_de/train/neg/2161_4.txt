The Broadway hit by Ira Levin comes to the screen with barely flesh in the bone, a mysterious plot with just a few tricks and twists, but no one worthy to care about. The frustrated writer Michael Caine pleads for stealing the work of a brilliant young man and spending it as his own; His insidious plan could include the murder of the talented child who holds Caines fleeting husband in his arms. The first act in which everyone is introduced is painfully dead. Caine does everything an actor can do to keep up the pace. Dyan Cannon is a mishap as his wife (she's too smart and clever to turn herself over as Ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle part of the film) seems to be extremely uncomfortable in the role of a better writer. These three characters and Irene Worth's annoying neighbor are so undefined that what happens after the lineup is barely registered until the second act begins. Sidney Lumet's direction is unconventional and blurry, the set design is unconvincing and poorly lit, and the finale is a total disaster. The actors have a hard time adding substance to the script, but with such thin footage, we only see their painstaking efforts. * 1/2 of ****
