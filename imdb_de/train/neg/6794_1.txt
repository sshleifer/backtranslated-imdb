Friday the 13th step over! There is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there. I won this movie in a college competition, and it was a waste of money, even if it was free. Jack Jones plays a really terrible singer trying to find killers or something. At least Friday, the thirteenth, never bored me. I would rather have pulled my fingernails than to see that again.
