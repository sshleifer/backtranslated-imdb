The invasion of the Star Creatures would definitely be in the category "that's bad," if the movie were not quite as sexist or racist. That it is so, it just makes it bad. <br /> <br /> It has the same kind of stereotypical sexuality as in Queen of Outer Space and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this case the Native Americans) that you would normally find B Westerns in your thirties and forties. With regard to the non-funny, the same passage through the cave is repeated more than ten times over the course of this rather short film. Ray makes a good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but he can not do it for two impressions of Cagney in a row, nor can he deal with Peter Lorre if he tries). There are really no production values ​​to talk about, as the "Star Creatures" look like Robot Monster or Tor Johnson's Ro-Man in Plan 9 from space, like Industrial Light and Magic creations. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely one of the avant-garde of what you would call a formerly independent cinema ... not artistic enough for these theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of a nocturnal drive- in. <Br /> <br />
