Too many secondary plotting lines without primary. Too many hot buttons are pressed for no reason, and they managed to stuff that boring movie with every drama element that exists: death, divorce, money problems, parenting problems, suicide, mental health problems, drug abuse, acceptance, rejected love, Travel problems, sex, misunderstandings of generations, robbery, legal issues, weapons, medical ethics, "deep real love"? You'd think it would be an interesting movie, but hell not? All these events are secondary to something primary that is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the "super-deep" (and super-length) lecture to the child at the end of the film is a complete nonsense. Too bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention: The actors are all pretty good. That stopped me from turning it off. Too bad that their talents were wasted. The movie is also well shot: the light, the movement, etc. of each episode - it's all there. Only the meaning is missing.
