After seeing Versus before, I had high hopes for Alive. The description of the film on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising. Alive did not deliver. VERY slow development. Lots of potential for the cast and the cool visuals. The premise was fascinating, but the win could not compensate for the build. Could have done so much more in the end. The main part of the movie consists only of "sitting". To put it simply, three of us kicked off watching this movie, and at the 50-minute mark we had trouble getting through to the end. It really needed more shock elements. Looking for Ichi the killer or Versus bouts will save you a few dollars and a lot of disappointment.
