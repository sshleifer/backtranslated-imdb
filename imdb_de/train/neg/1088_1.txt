Rarely have I seen such an unfounded talent waste. There is almost nothing constructive to say about this hopeless swamp of a film. The few interesting strands that the movie seems to promise turn out to be little more than red herrings at first. Actors of Stature - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are cast in roles that go nowhere; a director of occasional geniuses produces a film that looks like he's being filmed through a coffee-stained camera lens; A writer (John Grisham), who never produced anything of merit, discovers new depths of under-motivated incoherence. The film has a cheap, cool feeling - but hardly at the commentary level - is actually part of the aesthetics. Usually I come to the IMDb to write balanced, generally acknowledging comments. This monstrous catastrophe of a movie makes me produce an endless Gallic song. I will not, but only because I no longer want to deal with this garbage.
