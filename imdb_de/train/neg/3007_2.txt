Well, in the endless search for horror, we'll come across this movie recently re-released on DVD for some godless reason. The transfer is terrible and the quality is shit. I do not think this is due to a bad remaster or anything, I just think the movie was done badly. <br /> <br /> Obviously in an abandoned school with a budget that was undoubtedly wasted on cheap beer No talent hacks, "Slaughter High" starts slowly and accelerates after about an hour. First we will see a "nerd" who is from a group of ... you do not even know what they should be ... jocks? The ringleader with his ultra hooked nose is so ugly that he should definitely be cast as a nerd. Then there's a "big guy" and a few dumb losers and chicks who are supposed to be "hot" but are not. It's a mystery why picking this group of deniers from one of them, but I think the viewer should assume that they are "cool kids" picking on a Dweeb. The casting decisions are horrible as most high school students are played by 30 year olds. As other reviewers have already pointed out here, the actors (if you can call them that) are a lot of Britons whose accents slip off several times in this whole bitch. We have to assume that this group of "children" were the only students at this school, as their "reunification" is just them in the school that is now abandoned, just them. <br /> <br The killings are lame, the Gore is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; Lines like "This place gives me the goose bumps ..." and "Someone give me a beer" are highlights ... It just is not good. Skip this one if you do not want to be wasted with some friends and laugh at a really lame attempt by a slasher. If you want to see something good, take care of Bava's "Bay Of Blood" 14 years earlier and much better. If you want to see a good BAD Slasher, read "Just before dawn" or "The Burning". 2 out of 10 children.
