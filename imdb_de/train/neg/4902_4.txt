Almost in the same league as Yonfan's rather vile Color Blossoms, Spider Lillies brings the point that you can make a state-of-the-art cinema without cutting the edge or much. It is a Taiwanese film that is becoming an innovation at an alarming rate these days, but we can hardly find anything more remarkable here than this delicacy. <br /> <br /> You should know that spider lilies are supposedly also a lesbian story, but in every way this is nothing more than a plastic trick to lure the easily seduced and gullible. In several ways, here's a repeat of the recently released Taiwanese publication Eternal Summer. Then gay men got the shortchange treatment, now we have the same with women. Zero Chou presents a story that can not be more than fifteen years old for your nonexistent edification. They did manage some of the Art House attitude, but in the end this leads to an insane, simply uninteresting ramble. The Hong Kong Angle comes in the form of Isabella Leung's (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diary), here with her most butch look. Although Isabella in Spider Lillies is somewhat sympathetic in her previous jobs, she is listless in most departments. Either her heart was not on it or the whole lesbian Dramaschwanz did not quite meet her feelings. <br /> <br /> She's doing a Taipei tattoo artist who is shy, withdrawn, and in charge of a mentally handicapped younger brother, played by John Shen, who thankfully has the film as the sole spearhead on Spit "distinguishes. Isabella's character, strangely referred to as Takeko, but allegedly from Hong Kong, soon connects with the dissatisfied Youth Jade (Rainie Yang from the lovingly recalled Meteor Garden). The latter lives with her grandmother and has a whole host of complaints because she has been left behind by her parents and life in general. Sure, the grandma component works well and is touching, but otherwise Jade is as immobile as her protagonist as her counterpart Takeko. The two women share a past and an insufficiently hidden fear, while Jade works as a webcam girl, while Takeko keeps her father's legacy alive with a unique tattoo of a spider on his arm. Jade wants to acquire exactly this design, which causes Takeko to explore the inner feelings of the problem through flashbacks and a rather minimal discourse with the stuffy jade. <br /> <br /> Well, if there is little discourse that Homebase writes about, is at least sexual intercourse memorable? In a word, no. They kiss and fool before the end, but just as Eternal Summer reminded us not so long ago, in Lightyears there is a gap between viewing sexual content and buying ticket buyers that they will soon see sexual content. <Br /> <br /> This cynical image of expectation seals the fate of Spider Lillies. With a weak history, loud actors, and a general lack of relics you can take with the theater, Color Colossoms makes you look good in this way. At least we got a bit of Teresa Cheung's mammals there. No, Spider Lillies is not an AV masterpiece and should be removed from the playlist of even the most banal and fearful GLB film festival. <br /> <br /> For a pseudo-indie release, not surprisingly, not even the soundtrack and cinematography create moments of inspiration. That's a good thing, because it makes the transmission of spider lilies much easier. Believe us, avoid it and you will not miss anything good. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
