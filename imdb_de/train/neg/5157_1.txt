I really despised this movie when I saw it when I was about 6 or 7 years old because I was a big fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was bad. Until this one, this complete rubbish has ruined Robin for me for a long time. I recently recovered with his fun but serious part on Father's Day, but then he made another mistake, Bicenntinial Man. Robin should now get much better jobs and now he has again the mucus, which was created with this "classic".
