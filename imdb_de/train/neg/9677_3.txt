I read somewhere that this movie is meant to be a comedy. After seeing it, I did not call it anything else. the point of this movie escapes me. The dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd, many of the sets seemed to be retroactive, and despite all the nudity and the implied sexual content, there is nothing erotic in this movie ... everything makes me wonder what this thing is about! The title premise could be the basis for a funny (albeit politically incorrect) comedy. Instead, we have cheap, amateurish, unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for ourselves. if I want that, I buy myself a grace jones cd.
