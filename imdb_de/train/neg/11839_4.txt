"The Cat's Meow" contains some scenes that are characterized by intelligent dialogues, and some good performances, some of which have surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin (thanks in part to some excellent hair and makeup jobs from some talented designers); Joanna Lumley is convincing as a writer Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst wins as Marion Davies (though why movies never use her real stuttering is hard to explain). However, these elements do not contribute to a successful whole. The scriptwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes - the meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well done - but by and large not so hard. Several smaller characters do not have to be there and do not behave consistently. The basic plot is full of illogicality (why, for example, does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to tell Hearst what he really does not want to hear?), And the party scenes are repetitive and tedious. I would like to think that a trip on Hearst's yacht is more fun than the movie suggests. Davies is referred to as the standard flapper type, who is not really accurate, and the writer's ideas about chaplin and love are not plausible. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Bogdanovich, who seemed so connected to the Thirties in "Paper Moon", lacks a similar affinity for the twenties. He insisted that the excellent costume designer used only black and cream, giving the partygoers a very artificial look, and plays only the most stereotypical songs of that time (eg, "Yes, We Have No Bananas"). If Hearst insists that everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" It looks like the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene. <br /> <br /> The life of silent film stars can make fascinating films, I'm sure, but not this time.
