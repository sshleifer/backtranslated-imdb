The above title seemed to be a much more appropriate title as me and my suicidal subordinates decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit. <br /> <br /> Erotic, Scary, Exciting, Thoughtful, these are all the things this movie does not do. <br /> <br /> However, it's hilarious, the slow sound effects and the bad dubbing make this one of the biggest comedies I've seen in recent years. And yet, this movie does not even try to be funny, and that's one of the great achievements of the movie. He becomes a comedy without having fun. <br /> <br /> An Old Guy Who Looks Amazing Throughout the Movie Santa Claus goes around zombies and smashes vampires into the ground. This did not make me believe the movie title, if this vampires vs.. Zombies were, why did not the vampires and zombies fight? Well, apart from that, there were more flaws in this rental than the title. Like this one; There was a virus that swept through America, creating zombie-like creatures that behave like an average tourist. And yet there are only four zombies in the entire movie. Another problem is that a shop is left everywhere. Surely you would see zombies walking around in the woods or in the background. I think they just drove around in a forest circle over and over again because they did not have enough budget to film in a different location, or the director did not want to waste his precious time on other films. Wood surfaces were too much for him busy sitting in a trailer, jerking off to deal with such inconsequential things. <br /> <br /> In fact, the director had so much fun that he did not have enough time to hire a large enough cast or even an editor. And so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to behave inconspicuously, assuming he changed his name and started flipping randomly at the film reels. "Editing is not a heavy job, right? " The only reason this "movie" found its way into our pockets was that we somehow confused it with Freddy vs Jason. Strange how these things happen is not. And the only way we did it was by putting on gas masks and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stench of that foul-smelling confusion. Oh yes, we laughed in the end, but I'm sure you often do that when you've lost your mind ...................
