How sad that there is no option to set a grade below 1. I looked at this nonsense and could hardly believe what I saw. Every single part of the movie was awful. Music, acting, directing, history, everything, everything. Actually, I laughed a lot at different places in the movie. I especially loved the piece where our hero rushes through the hospital in gentle sharpness slow motion and slaps the clipboard from the hands of the nurses. Only because. Product placement? Crucifix (crucifix?) Everywhere. If you have a Christian conviction and are very easily satisfied, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to get more out of it.
