"Boom" has earned a reputation. With the heavyweights Taylor, Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey you might think how bad it could be. Well, it's a lot worse than you can possibly imagine. <br /> <br /> The sad and disturbing fact of "boom" is that it seems to signal the descent and fall of the above heavyweights. It was the only director Joseph Losey who plunged the depths with "Modesty Blaise" and "Boom" (some may wish to add "Secret Ceremony"), recovered and created his best work in 1970, the wonderful "intermediate man". , <br /> <br /> The saddest thing is the work of Tennesee Williams. From the mid-forties to early sixties, Williams wrote a series of pieces that had achieved classic status and remained in the repertoire of the theater around the world. Many have been much-lauded movies. When Williams Muse failed him, probably because of his infamous drug abuse, she left him forever. Williams at his best is the dream of an actor who offers many memorable performances. (Were Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr always better than "Night of the Iguana"?) Especially Taylor shone in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Suddenly Last Summer". There is an anecdote in which Taylor allegedly asks John Gielgud if he would teach her to play Shakespeare. He replied, "If you teach me to play Tennessee Williams." If Gielgud had seen "boom", he would have held his tongue. Taylor has never been so bad that he caused a terrible performance. Although her face is well photographed, she is extremely plump. Aside from the physical decline, from now on she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a number of completely forgotten (and worse) roles to her value. <br /> <br /> Something similar could be said of Burton. After his short-lived theatrical star, he won fame and fortune in Hollywood. But from that time (1968), the body of his work would be inconspicuous, to say the least. Noel Coward had long ceased to be a force in the theater, where his comedies in the salon had been replaced by comedy, like Williams and the British "angry young men." He seems to enjoy it when he camps, but he hardly manages to amuse that man who has claimed such a talent. <br /> <br /> The only cast member to preserve her dignity is the young Joanna Shimkus, who in a few years' time would forego a promising film career to become Mrs. Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> "Boom" stinks of self-interest; it's just out of control. A rather sad indication of wrong careers than on a camp fun festival, as some have suggested.
