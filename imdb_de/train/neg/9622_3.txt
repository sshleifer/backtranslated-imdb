When I saw that this movie was being shown on TV, I was really looking forward to it. I grew up in the 80s and like everyone else who grew up in that time, I've watched every 80s teen and summer camp movie. So I could not wait to see this movie, which totally falsifies this film genre. What a disappointment!! The movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gag, with little action and no substance. And the filmmaker's dark humor attempts had failed completely - some of these so-called jokes were nothing but absolutely cruel and offensive. The only good thing about this film was wardrobe, music and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgic journey and see all the 80's summer clothing styles, and so does the music. And the acting was consistently first class: almost all the best comedians of Hollywood were present. Too bad they did not have any better material to work with.
