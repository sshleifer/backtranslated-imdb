Honestly, I can not understand why this movie is rated so well here and why Bakshi himself thought it was his best movie. I'm a big fan of Bakshi's previous work - especially Heavy Traffic and Wizards, but to be honest, Wizards (1977) was the last good movie he made. He then turned to the mainstream, starting with the devilish "Lord of the Rings" and then with the sword and wizarding heavyweight Frank Frazetta for "Fire and Ice". <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is pueril, the animation is in TV quality - I insist it's way worse than its '70s stuff - and while' Wizards 'have real imagination, bizarre, some beautiful background graphics and an underground adult sensibility,' Fire and Ice ', had. Designed only for 14-year-old boys and has the intellectual power of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you like the Gor books, you will like it. However, in my opinion, this was just another cut in the quality of the 'Wizards' film that Bakshi never recovered from (although he has recently done some decent TV stuff). 4.5 out of 10 points
