Once upon a time, there was a science-fiction writer named H. Beam Piper who wrote a classic book called "Little Fuzzy," about a man who discovered a race of adorable, small, fuzzy humanoids in another world , Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's writers plundered his grave before his carcass became cold. This is the book you came up with for Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Skullduggery is such a blatant rip-off of "Little Fuzzy". I wonder why I'm the only one who ever noticed? <br /> But do not take my word for it. Here is a link to Project Guntenberg, where you can download a free version of "Little Fuzzy": http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
