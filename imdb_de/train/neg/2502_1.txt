Yet another Die Hard directly to the video with cardboard rogues demolish ?? How many of these God-fearing minions, cheap (and evil) from the more popular action movies of the late 1980s and early 1990s, still lurk there? For the record (not that you'll really care) this is another blatant rip-off of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 with a full selection of clichés and predictability. <br /> <br /> The blank villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out shooters sent by various means throughout the film. The hero is of course an ex-cop or something that has problems with the family and attitude and of course does not bring to the party just the usual emotional baggage, but also a fitting piece of eye candy and his annoying son. <br /> <br /> The supposed luxury cruise ship operating between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry ?? that explains why they seem to be walking around on a rusty cross-channel ferry? in New Zealand! The acting is as wooden as the deck, the script is wistful, the one-liners predictable, the villains completely unfit, and the plot has holes through which one could sail a boat. <br /> <br /> There never seems to be a flood of this kind of rip-off ends with video waste that pollutes the late-night slots of television and the DVD bunkers of all supermarkets (though this movie is so bad that he has not seen a DVD release yet, but take your time!) Is there any chance of something that is at least halfway decent, half believable and the most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I did not think so.
