I've given four stars to this show (I've only seen seven episodes) because most of their jokes / setups seem to fail. Some are not exactly funny, but some are amusing - in a way that is 12 years old. It reminds me of this New York painter who throws paint on a canvas, calls art and sells for a lot of money. Silverman throws out what she has, including the kitchen sink, while she prays that some things hang on the wall to be funny, but different. <br /> <br /> However, what she often "has" is not always enough, as if she lacks the follow-up that a good comedian needs to succeed. <br /> <br /> The whole company is like a submerged potato.
