This gets a two because I liked it as a kid, but it got so superfluous that I started hating it ... I can not rate that descriptive because it would irritate one thing at a time, probably I would not say that Do not do anything that everyone else has not yet said. <br /> <br /> The only other thing about this show is that it's rather uncomfortable, with the kid that brings the damn babysitter, the stupidity that runs around and in there. I have a cousin who loves this show and he's the strangest and stupidest person I've ever met. This show should be pulled from the air. It's always the same over and over ... you have to show Nick better. I'm getting really tired of stuff like that.
