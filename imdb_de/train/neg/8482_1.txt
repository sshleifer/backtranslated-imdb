Some of my old friends have suggested watching this movie, but I only recently got a chance. I had high hopes to see something interesting from Kamal Hans, which I saw mixed a heap of garbage camera angles at high speed. I could not understand what the message was, except to humiliate Hinduism. I am more like many other religions, but I felt that Kamal Hasan is a low-spirited man who has staged this kind of thought. He could have made a horror movie than that crap. He tried to add Hollywood genre for viruses, and God forbid that he did not turn that guy into a mutant and ultimately seek world domination. This is a very suitable film for a film school compared to the regular audience. Be ashamed of him for not sticking to his talent. Beginning of the story, Chaos attempted to lend ideas from the Butterfly effect, then intellectually between little religious harmony at the expense of insulting Hinduism this movie.)
