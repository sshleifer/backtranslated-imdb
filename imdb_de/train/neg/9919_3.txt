In the opening scene of "Malta Story," Mr. A. Guinness was so startlingly similar to Noel Coward that I absolutely expected his first words, "Certain women have to beat regularly - like gongs," or such a world fatigue. Unfortunately, his dialogue is hardly immortal prose, and even the master would have had difficulty bringing it to life. Mr. Guinness wanders through the picture as if searching for a central point and not finding one. In him lies the fatal weakness of the entire film. Mr. J. Hawkins also gives up early and eventually gives a "Jack Hawkins" performance without a bit of individuality. It could have been put together from a dozen British war movies. Many of the early fifties dive into their business for very little purpose. The Air Force did not bomb Malta in the same way as it brought London to its knees. The courage of the Maltese in the face of perpetual danger was recognized by the king, and the island was awarded the George Cross a worthy theme that you might consider a movie, but "Malta Story" does not even qualify for the term "worthy" his condescending meaning. It seems like it has been hastily cobbled together to make an appointment, perhaps before the actors have lost the movie's will to live.
