The Space Camp, which had the unfortunate luck of being planned around the time of the Challenger accident, deserves such luck. The "Stars" make fun of acting, Lea Thomson was actually turned aside when she was asked for more than her usual, innocent, wide-eyed smile. The movie is sometimes funny when it demands far too much from you. A little boy holds a millionaire robot in his closet, which breaks if he gets too many orders from the horde of clich√©d roommates. This crazy and unwelcome machine, "Jinx", is a major player in the ridiculous premise of the film, which is part of the Short Circuit, part of the 2001 Airplane Team. I will not bore you, suffice it to say that you can only laugh when you are confronted with it. Despite all this, it's nice to see in a SeaQuest that was saved by the Bell Art. Attention, the romance and the technology are as incredible as each other. If you are a freak of the eighties, this is not to be overlooked for the amusing performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie of Temple of Doom) and, of course, Lea Thompson. As a kind of would-be Goonie who befriends Jinx, Joaquin Phoenix takes a dodgy turn. Do not go near this movie if you are not a fan of garbage.
