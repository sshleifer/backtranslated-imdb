These and immoral stories both left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted before sex, and these two films are cautionary tales of what happens when one has sex. As a film, that's not very well done - some of the plays are really epically bad (like the "American" woman with the French accent). The sudden flip-flop of the young woman from concern for marriage to interest (if it looks as if it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret makes no sense - she 'is not explained at all. Nor did I like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was portrayed as a sign of her family's perversion or preference for bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there is this "sexy beast", if you will, that lives in the forest, could have been the basis for a perverted but funny story, instead being used only as the basis for a nasty sex life , negative, play morality.
