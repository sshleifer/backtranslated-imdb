I've never seen Spike Lee films before because their trailers never caught my interest. I have seen and admired Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster's work and have several of their DVDs. However, I was completely disappointed with this movie. If this movie is an indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice would be "get a job" and stop wasting the time and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators saw the same movie I saw. I can only guess from their sappy Lovelorn reviews that their worship of Spike Lee has blinded them to the banality of this work. I paid only $ 2.50 in a Second Run theater and still felt like I was wasting my money. <br /> <br /> The IMDb "Trivia" page says it all ....... <br /> * "Shot in 39 days" - How can you expect that in such a short time Time a big budget "blockbuster" (as the media hype has promised) is turned? No wonder there was such a poor performance. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard wanted to direct the movie first ..." - Maybe he did some justice for this project if he had more time for it so naturally. Although the writing was cruel, the premise had some merits. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. I am sorry! This movie was so full of pitiful stereotypes, implausible scenes, and lousy characterizations that maybe he did not make much of it. (Hey Ron, thank you, Russell, good call!) <br /> * "Jodie Foster filmed her role in three weeks." - And it showed! Her portrayal of a "fixer" that makes people's problems disappear was as incredible as the script she had received. Did she even want to be there? <br /> <br /> Other Peeves: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers would bother to come to the door and inform a uniformed policeman that they are robbing the bank inside, and he better stay away ... or else? <br /> <br /> * When "Detective Frazier" (Denzel Washington) comes to the bank to check that there are no corpses yet, how many bank robbers "guided" a policeman without a gun (much less "Do you" let a policeman go back to the front door for the policeman to walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Frazier later claimed to have given the robber "every reason to shoot me." Why did he try then, not even to expose the robber's face, maybe he got the answer he was looking for ... A robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification and why did it need "Steve, Stevie, Steve O "(the robber's accomplice) so long to help and help? <br /> <br /> * I understand that these were not your typical bank robbers, they had a different agenda and wanted nobody to get hurt But the cops had no reason to believe that they were not It was a desperate situation for them. Why were two villains kicked outside to pick up the pizzas? (First, how many robbers would have come out without a hostage as a shield?) Is this the version of NY City by Spike Lee or SNL?). Killing them would have reduced the number of bad guys and messed up their plans, and the remaining robbers would probably have given up more. If not, at least fewer bad guys would be in it. (Give SWAT something to do or send her home!) <br /> <br /> * What police department in this country would have allowed Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to just march into the bank and discuss a cause with the robbers she would not reveal to them at first? She had no authority, no government papers; and besides, this was "already" a hostage-taking ... add another one? <br /> <br /> * Why would not the bank chief (Christopher Plummer) simply destroy the incriminating documents? a long time ago? Screw sentimentality! He could have sold the diamonds. <br /> <br /> * Who was this "jewelery" (the character, not the actor) with the jersey accent who volunteered voluntarily and said he knew the shot was "100% Albanian", but he himself could not speak it ... SIR! TAKE YOUR HAND DOWN! And his ex-wife! What a "slump" she was !!! Both were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> * Why did Det. Frazier constantly harass the individuals who were obviously not part of the robbery? (ie - tell the older woman she could go, and then she could not, then could not she, then not?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * After the bank robbers demanded that the hostages put on jump suites, could not they forgo their escape plan, which came out of the bank and pretended to be some of the hostages? <br /> <br /> * Towards the end of the film, it was revealed that a false wall had been erected in the storeroom, behind which Clive Owens hid for a week. Where did the materials come from? from? (the Drywall & Stollen). It was also believed that they cut into the sewer, so it can relieve itself. The bank employees had not complained about the smell all week? Hello! <br /> <br /> * After such a debacle; Since the documents had "fallen into the hands of the robber," Mrs. White expected what kind of "references" the chief of the bank would expect. She saw that now because of her failure, he should be a target of blackmail. <br /> <br /> * And last but not least, what about the "Electric Glide" that Denzel did? HOW STUPID! Does that indicate his "determination" to bring these guys to justice? He looked more like a man hopping a ride on a shopping cart while trying to prevent a bowel movement! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Other than the mediocre conspiracy; lousy script; bad behavior; and altogether pitifully directed ...... Yada, Yada, Yada. <br /> <br /> Hopefully this will give you enough insight into the movie to help others decide if they are wasting their money or not! <br /> <br />.
