I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the worst movie ever made. When I saw the trailer on TV, I knew in the second second that this would be ***** and it would be best to avoid it, but somehow I was forced by some friends to see that, me went to the movies with low expectations, but I hoped there would be some cheap laughs that would keep me awake during this movie. The so-called "jokes" in this film bring a lamentation in the face, they usually consist of people who hit on face and balls, the baby looks strange and behaves like a horny gangsta, and the typical racing jokes that we see so often in today's garbage comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and boring. The characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped. I would never have to see this **** movie again, I'd rather take a bullet to the foot than to ever be exposed to that piece of fucking wood again. If someone I see says he liked it, I'll physically hit her in the face
