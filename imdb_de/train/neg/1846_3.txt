Well, I'm honest with all the viewers I bought for Kira's sex scenes, but unfortunately I have not seen much of it. All the sex scenes were short and random, along with the weird and hackneyed background music as in all the other B movies. Toward the end there is a tiny plot - Kira's new lover is a murderer. Whoa !!! how shocking !!! Why do not we nominate this film for the Oscars? I can not imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were R-rated (Mine is imported from the UK, rated 18). Conclusion? Put it down and go away so you do not end up with an idiot like me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
