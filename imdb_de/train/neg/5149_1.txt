This movie is about a female rape victim / comic writer from New York who decides to escape the dreadful big city glamor and move into a filthy, rundown town where she finds refuge in a single wide trailer on a filth deal in the middle of the 12th and nowhere. The citizens of the city are mentally ill, but it is she who has invited crazy men in their caravan. Annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do the right thing to get into dangerous situations after dangerous circumstances. The performance of DB Sweeney was at best the high school. He is one of those cute young actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, the career was not good, and nature was at the right moment. I agree with the previous commentator, who states that the drama was "so real". Actually, it was not a spectacle. The two main characters are truly pitiful, weak and unable to make mature, healthy choices. In short, this movie is like no other shit, hire it to laugh about it. The real crime scene? The cruel wood paneling in the trailer - enough to kill me. And finally, she's an artist / writer, so she could not afford a double-wide trailer and anything other than a sun-yellow Chevy Chevette out of love for God!
