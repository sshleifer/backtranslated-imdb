This is the biggest piece of Lamo I have ever seen. It is cruelly boring, I would rather have played through a seminar on creationism than would have seen if I had known it would be as boring as it was. Not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big Tas tas this a little less than a 1. The reviews of this film, which claim that this film is "unintentionally funny", are absurd and just WRONG. There is not a funny thing about this movie. The first 50 minutes they walk through the woods to talk about things you neither understand nor care about, and it's just as lame when people start to die because they do not even know who the people are because they do are uninteresting. Honestly, I did not see it to the end, but that should say something about how awful it is. WORST MOVIE EVER. <br /> <br /> Immediately after throwing this dirt out of my DVD player, I started scratching it against the cement in front of my house, not wanting other blockbuster customers to make the same mistake, I had made like renting this movie. Then Zach has peed his pants. Thanks for your time.
