** SPOILERS DOWN !!! ** <br /> <br /> cabin fever has my damnation for the worst movie of the year ... I saw that. This movie is just trash! There is so much wrong with the movie that you can not help but be amazed at how bad it really is. This movie had so much potential to be good, but ultimately did not work. The characters were as stupid as you can; For the whole movie, you just ask yourself, "Why would you do that?" or "what is your point?" ... so illogical and stupid are the characters. We have NO background in them, so of course you do not really give rats any money for their fate ... they could only laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - The 'Slut' (Marcy) for example ... was she so horny that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? It did not make sense ... it would be almost as if the filmmakers needed an excuse to voila their virus! POOH. <br /> <br /> - Would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin WITHOUT looking at it first? <br /> <br /> - Why did not Bert just shoot the sick guy? from the beginning? The movie would have been over this way ... besides, they killed him anyway. <br /> <br /> - Why did it take them so long to decide to leave the cabin even if they had to leave? "No, I'm just waiting for two of my friends to get infected (one is a blink of an eye off), finally deciding to leave the hermit's body there, just to fall into the contaminated reservoir and recover to infect with the virus? Pure stupidity! <br /> <br /> I swear that common sense was not a friend, let alone a connoisseur of these idiots. I do not think a movie ever had a worse ending. In the beginning, the kids ask the cashier at the Hick Store what the rifle is for, and he said it was "for the niggers." At the end of the film, 3 young blacks (dressed in baggy clothes, one of them in a du-rag no less) go to the store ... and find that the cashier has cleaned it up for them to hunt THEN shake them all the pounds and shake hands and joke around with them as if they were his homeboys. <br /> <br /> Okay, what was hell, where was this?!?!? How tasteless can you be, what did the filmmakers think when they put that into the movie? As a black man, I was offended by the first comment from Nigger. It was a tasteless, meaningless remark. My question to the filmmakers: what was the meaning of the end with the black kids? Was that the reason to force me to forget the initial racist commentary? To smooth things out with black spectators by making a joke out of it? Well, I did NOT find this pathetic humor attempt in the least funny way. The whole movie was a joke ... a PATHETIC attempt at filmmaking that should not give the time of day. Peter Jackson really thought that this movie was so good? Which movie did he look at? <br /> <br /> ZERO * out of **** stars .... if I could give a lower rating, I would do that. Please, other IMDb'er, do not waste 1 Â½ hours of your precious life looking at this horror of a "movie". This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
