If you really need to see this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let him be a boy. But be prepared by bringing your HP with you if you have a radio. <br /> <br /> After seeing such a good movie as Arisan (2003), it's terrible to see what's happening in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is to make money, but nobody seems to seriously work on Indonesia's image in the entertainment world. That this is a "global" world does not seem to be happening to those who shoot films in Indonesia. And as the Indonesian public swallows everything presented to them as "Made in Indonesia" with Western flair, they get away with it. <br /> <br /> OK, the story is beautiful at first. And it could have turned into a beautiful movie. But has not the director ever considered that a musical needs live music or at least good playback and good choreography? In this movie, the playback is so bad that you want to cry directly in the cinema. Every single word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or the person who sings the replay, and it is extremely annoying when you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> But in the end I thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical ... They just forgot to change the choreography. It's hard to dance, you see, they jump here and there, throwing their legs in the air, and that's all. <br /> <br /> Well, at least there's a happy ending ... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is more romantic, DO SO!
