Amy Heckerling's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of gangster films from the 1930s, filmed in the tradition of the Warner Brothers. Michael Keaton plays the lead role as a middle-aged gangster and looks back on his life with hard blows when he catches a kid who in 1935 tries to steal something from his pet shop young age about Peter Boyle. In the meantime, the Fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival criminal Lord to Boyle and Keaton finally climbs through the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a funny twist on Danny Vermin, yes, right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is the younger brother of Keaton, who became district attorney, Glynnis O'Connor, his wife, and Marilu Henner plays Keaton's minor. As you know, the movie looks cheap and looks like a TV show instead of a theatrical movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off great and slows down as expected after the first half hour. Through the combination of dialogue and gags, the film can hold its ground in the first half, but quickly loses steam and falls off in the second half in mediocrity and vulgarity. Keaton chews the landscape with his best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are just disgusting and not funny. Piscopo makes the "once" too much. Several supportive actors are trying to uphold the fortress, such as Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale Jr. as a desk sergeant and Sudie Bond as a ruthless cleaning lady. The second half is turning into a hit-or-miss television never to be restored. The final scene featuring The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism, as is the movie "The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable," which was previously featured in a marquee. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the target audience of The Roaring Twenties would be known for sure in 1969. * 1/2 out of 4 stars.
