What this movie fails to answer is how wrong this war is (and most US wars have just oiled recently). <br /> <br /> How many innocent civilian casualties were there, how many lives have been killed and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators are. <br /> <br /> So, let me ask you - if American soldiers are killing women and children except their enemy, it's fine, but if the government kills its own troops by accidentally killing deadly chemicals and kills many civilians it's fine Not? Your logic fails, gentleman. <br /> <br /> I give 5 for the solid performance and 1 for everything else, 3 in total.
