Robin Williams performed excellently in The Night Listener as did the other members of the cast. However, the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered "must-have". I think the problem occurs because there is no strong relationship between the caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to write it that way because IMDb automatically wants to correct the correct spelling to "nobody"). The movie is about 1:30 and within the first 15 minutes, it seems, Noon begins to search for Pete Logande, the young caller. This happens after talking to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. The conversations are not too profound, mostly how are you ... I'm in the hospital ... why did you move out with your boyfriend ... etc. In the book, the boy is almost turned into Noon's downsizing and vice vice versa Readers understand why he goes in search of this boy as soon as he finds out that the boy disappears and thinks he might be a hoax. The audience wonders why? Since there is really no strong bond between Noon and the caller, why bother? Who cares if the caller does not exist? <br /> <br /> I know that there is a difference between a book and a movie, but these calls and this relationship were absolutely necessary on the screen as they form the basis for the rest of the movie. Since this is not the case, the film falls apart. <br /> <br /> This is surprising, as Maupin's other work is Tales of the City. When it was made into a mini-series, it worked wonderfully.
