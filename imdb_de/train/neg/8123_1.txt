(Spoiler) Wow, that's bad. When I saw an old Star Trek episode the other day, I made a double take - it was the one that infected everyone with this space sickness and then went a little crazy - and there was Stewart Moss aka the Unusual Hero "By It Lives at night! He played the first infected crewman dying from an endless depression. I could only think that he had too often seen his own movie, that caused the depression. This movie is full of really unlikely people. There is no redemptive character in the movie, no. It's very hard to feel bad if Dr. Beck turned into a bat (or whatever he actually did) because you just do not like him. And you do not like his shrill, bony wife or the nasty, sloppy Sgt. Ward or dr. Mustache Love ... So why spend time or energy on this movie? Where there is no empathy with the characters, there is no need to worry about it. Not to mention the horrible cinematography that had filmed the film through urine, and the five-cent bat special effects, many of which seemed like scraps of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of flying bats. Not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but at the bottom of the lower ranks.
