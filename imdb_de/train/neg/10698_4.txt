The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while F. Murray Abraham was there. Spoiler: About half of F. Murray is zapped, because The Darkling is a kind of demonic beings who likes to live vicariously. He takes bums and losers and perverts them on and gives them everything they want for success. He feeds on their enjoyment of the seven deadly sins. But part of it is that he has to find people who are flawed but are not completely evil. Otherwise, he can not "twist" her natural goodness. That said the little man with his Barry White voice, which I found both charming and amusing. Mostly amusing. Imagine Barry White if he was a little dwarf and he told Aiden Gillen: "Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Bos, Here we come, Dee Plane!" Throughout the film, Dee Dwarf (actually a robotic cherub) talks to Aiden Gillen in Barry White's voice and says things like "It's alright to be angry, you know you want it." "Now you've committed a murder, you're really moving in the world" and other remarks that sound like commercials for "Being Evil" stores or something. It's really funny in a sick way. <br /> <br /> Aiden Gillen is not F. Murray Abraham, and the movie is armored once Murray gets the ax (or a knife?). F. Murray gives his role in this film a certain happy malice. He is a good actor. On the other hand, Aiden Gillen has a steady, happy grin on his face, and he looks like his English remedy comp. The class had never met the mythological characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about. The end is really scary and almost weird. If this movie was a parody, the ending would be perfect. If it was not a parody, it was scary; but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross-out that the film itself could not deliver. The people who made this movie lost everything they wanted to do somewhere before the end. It just ends up as if they realized that they had run out of money and a quickie end had to be turned.
