There's a big moment in Surviving Christmas that's almost worth the pain: James Gandolfini hits a shovel over Ben Affleck's stupid head. <br /> <br /> This film serves as another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini proving something. He is a great actor while also spoiling his career by playing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck), a young and affluent copywriter, believes you can never be alone at Christmas. (And right from the start, there's the underlying problem with our suspension of disbelief in this idiotic film: How many people of Drew's social status in 2004 are really interested in one way or another, whether Christmas alone or with half the family or Storyline finds Drew, who spends a family for Christmas, on the condition that she pretends to be his own. <br /> <br /> For $ 250,000 A cautious truck driver, Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and his distraught wife Christine (Catherine O'Hara), Drew's ad hoc family counter protests from their members to son Brian (a very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter Alicia (a very gently oriented Christina Applegate). Drew spends the rest of the movie allegedly retaking his youth or something else. The messages in this film are as twisted and illogical as the story of the dry mouth. Offended by obvious psychosis, Drew puts a false smile on his face and refuses blindly to any vilification he allegedly bought from the Valco family to avoid. <br /> <br /> What raises the question: If Drew pays these people to regain a semblance of joyous family emotion, how psychotic must he be to do luck under their barbs and emotional torments about his presence? It is not the case that the Valco family hides their true feelings and pretends to be happy with Drew - three of the four members make it clear that they despise him. Is he so unrecognizable that he can not realize that his money does not bring him into the "family" atmosphere he felt he was at all a truth? As with all films that are so disgusting, one wonders how * four * scriptwriters could become so involved in their own narcissistic dreams of appearing in a sequestration sequence that they overlook any semblance of plausibility or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Director Mike Mitchell, who is responsible for * Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo *, is right there. 'Nuff said. <br /> <br /> Gandolfini and O'Hara somehow manage to shine and prove that they are in this mess. Christina Applegate is voluptuous and blond and fiery in all the right places, Drew cuts most of the movie into small strips of carcass, then she makes a round face and falls in love with him because the script challenges her to do so. <br /> And I would not say that Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider should better look over his shoulder. There is a whole new level of desperate searching in the city.
