The show repeated a "bubbling" sound effect that made me sleep. A very calming show. I think I might have slept through the parts that were in danger or danger. I also heard that some shots for a sponge-diving show were shot in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I would assume that Lloyd Bridges never dived there. I only remember the series in repetitions. Although it was never exciting, we made our own underwater episodes in the lake with my grandmother. I thought, "Flipper" would have a better underwater action. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.
