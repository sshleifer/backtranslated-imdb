When I was younger, I really enjoyed watching bad TV. We've all been guilty before, but my excuse for looking at things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" is: I was young and naive; I do not know what makes a show really valuable. <br /> <br /> Luckily I appreciate the good stuff now. Stargate SG-1 is not good. The 12-year-old I would love any hackneyed piece of it, any set of dialogues, any unnecessary technique. The writing is beyond fade; so bland and uninspired is Star Trek: Voyager. If your show craves me for the worst trek show, you're in trouble. <br /> <br /> The film Stargate is a wonderful guilt, anchored by two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, wonderful music and cool sci-fi ideas. Apart from a bit of the original music, this show does not show anything that made the movie funny. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver observable and made Legend interesting, seems to have most of the episodes half asleep. <br /> <br /> The budget must have been very low as the sets sometimes look like a cellar. The cinematography is not much better, as vanillig and boring as the scripts. It amazes me that shows with much more style (like Farscape) and substance (like the reinterpreted Battlestar Galactica) have smaller, less rabid fanbases than this daddy. It just does not deserve it.
