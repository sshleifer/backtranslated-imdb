Typically terrible garbage from director Fred Olen Ray about a female cyborg hunter (Teagan), who was tasked by overseer Jan-Michael Vincent to find and execute the escaped alien condemned Ross Hagen, who planned the course for Earth. Soon, ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of disgusting college kids headed by Richard Wiley, who has run Hagen on an uncompromising camping trip in his motorhome. Soon the cyborg will burn with an arm laser burning an innocent alcoholic doctor (Robert Quarry of Earl Yorga Vampire) who proves that no one stands in the way of finding the skin of the condemned man whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his Body. Law finds an ally in Leo Gordon, an old Vietnamese war veteran with far too weapons in his cabin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps purposely made terrible, this shows what fans of "rancid cinema" crave for a terrible special effects, drama and premise. At least the movie has PJ Soles for a feast for the eyes. Even in '89 she smoked quite a bit. This laser pistol is certainly funny. It can destroy some houses, but when the cyborg shoots Law, it hardly leaves any clues as to the location being fired.
