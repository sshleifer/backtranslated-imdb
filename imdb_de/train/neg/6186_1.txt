Abuse happens. Susannah Yorke is a bright young Jane Eyre, and her performance is impeccable. However, Edward Rochester is said to be 35 years old. The white-haired George C. Scott looks and behaves like an arthritic 80's. He creaks and growls, disgusting and grim. He looks like an ax-murderer who has sent his ax to be sharpened; We are not surprised that he keeps a woman in the attic! The great love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare. There is enough darkness in the novel, but Brontes Rochester is relatively young, athletic, powerful and charming if he chooses to do so. He has a beautiful speaking and singing voice, good sense and a conscience that he tries unsuccessfully to suppress.
