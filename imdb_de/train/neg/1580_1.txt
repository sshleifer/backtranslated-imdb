This movie became a cult movie in Chinese college students, though I did not watch it until it airs in Channel4, UK. The "spirit" it wants to impart is how independent artists "resist the commercialization of the music industry" and maintain their "purity of an artistic soul" and "not sell themselves for dirty money." that is really dizzy and superficial; The diologues are mainly pathetic. Acting is bad. sceenplay is full of pretense of art. It's a fantasy movie for kids and that's all <br /> <br />
