What do you get when you act badly, have bad directing, scenes that are unbearably long, terrible lighting, painful editing and terrible effects? They get Jessica: A Ghost Story Seems to shoot at Betacam, which is fine, but the lighting must complement this medium. Not in this case. There are some CUs where the person's face is completely in the shadows. A scene is especially the scene with the psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could easily be cut in half ... but I think then they would not have a feature film. The main character is incredibly flat. He is the LEAD man, so he should have some "hero" elements in his character, but he does not. He laments and is afraid of the whole movie. I could go on, but I do not want to waste my time. Although the lighting was terrible, I have to say that they had nice camera movements. Too bad that the lighting did not praise it. The cover of the DVD is beautiful and ends there. Just terrible.
