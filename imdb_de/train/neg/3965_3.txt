I think I agree that many comments here have to be wrong. Although the movie is not necessarily bad, it is definitely below average. "Dark Remains" is basically a ghost movie with a premise of its own spirits and bad emotions. The film already begins with two stories that are loosely connected and later not connected. A couple loses his child who is found slaughtered in bed. They move into a country house to escape their past and guess what ... the house is a haunting, somehow. From here, Dark Remains starts with some terrifying moments very slowly (The first ghost appearances are nice and the flash sequence worked very well too). OK, then ... woman sees spirit of daughter, other spirits of people died in accidents or suicides, man tries to solve the mystery of the houses, wife will be depressed, foreign neighbors appear. It's been pretty much everything there, but the premise that it's their own emotions is nice, so you wait for the turn. There is no twist, you are just confused by the story of a haunted house, the strange neighbor, a completely meaningless creepy prison and the dead daughter who was remembered along with a photo idea on "The shutter". The end is ridiculous, because when you start and end a movie so slowly and with slow music, it's pretty lame to have some ghost clumps all at once that look like a zombie jump, of course, just to return to slower tactics and piano music. <br /> <br /> In short ... Dark Remains could have been a nice spooky ghost story if the script did not try to go anywhere and get nowhere. Too many stories grumbled together, which simply did not make sense and contradiction in the basic atmosphere of the movie. And besides ... please never use abandoned prisons again. It's so worn out and in that case it makes no sense at all. "Hey, there's this scary prison, we can shoot there." I think a lot of ingredients in Dark Remains have been thrown into the mix.
