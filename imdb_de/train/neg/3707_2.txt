This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen (yes, it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and every movie with Kevin Costner) did not even look like they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian, but he can not transfer his talent to this movie, which probably has only two tense laughs in the picture. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, avoid it like the plague. Do something constructive and interesting, like watching the weather channel or watching the paint on a wall. <br /> <br /> For Chris' efforts I give him 2/10! <br /> <br />
