I tend to like character movies. I also think that Hope Davis does a great job, so I had high hopes for this movie. These hopes were soon disappointed. <br /> <br /> The main flaw in this movie is the direction. There are many scenes that are daydreaming. The film often uses the character of Denis Leary as the alter ego of the character of Campbell Scott. It does not work for me at all. This would have worked better as a play than a movie. <br /> <br /> There are also problems with the plot. It's important that the characters in a movie travel and land somewhere other than where they started. I did not feel that the characters grew with the experiences that are presented in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the editing was not good. In the middle of the movie, there was a huge pull, which was exceptionally boring. Apart from acting, which in my opinion was consistently strong, this film failed in almost all areas of cinema.
