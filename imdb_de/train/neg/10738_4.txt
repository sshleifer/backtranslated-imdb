This was a blind used DVD. It cost a nice buzz that I had when I clicked on play. <br /> <br /> It's a bubble comedy, but it's um. squalid The plot is ZANY !, but the characters do things that are so petty and disturbed and comfortable that I found it depressing to watch uneven, goofy foil. (I know, I know, the quotes on the box and the Oscar nomination mean nothing.)
