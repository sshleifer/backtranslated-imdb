I sincerely consider this film to be yet another weak effort by the Dominican film industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are a bit funny, but when they change their role in society (men who do what women usually do, and women do what men usually do), the movie falls. Be boring and not funny at all. They leave much without explanation and the end of the film is predictable. I did not like the way when Roberto Angel played his character and also his little one. I went to the movies and hoped for a good job, but I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie.
