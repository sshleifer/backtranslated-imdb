This estimated production has fans. To describe the classic bad review of "Mary Reilly", Moby Dick is like a painting, only slower. <br /> <br /> This is because the philosophical reasons for a movie "Production" never make a great movie. It's more about the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case for the transfer of books to the film) to replace it with a list of hopelessly atomized, undynamic but dazzling ideas to make viewers believe that they have seen greatness. As viewers and critics tend to fall for it, Oscars follow and feed the whole stupid equation. <br /> <br /> I do not share the pleasure that all these reviewers have found. Moby Dick is amazingly unshakeable. Actors dutifully recite essays on Jonas, Moby Dick, The Sea, Moby Dick, Moby Dick ... all things that can not answer, and none of them absorbs in the least. It is dramatically lethargic. It does not build. In narrative terms, Moby Dick (as a movie) is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story. After half an hour, I muttered, "Oh grandiose ... another oath ... another 4-minute soliloquy!" <br /> <br /> In the failed attempt to involve you, this is a rather overactive showcase. Here are many gray hairs. Starbuck is supposed to be a golden god. (!) <br /> <br /> You know you look at a great director as you make the medium your own, instead of trying to copy the feeling of someone else's paintings and colors, or to reverently appreciate a classic embalm, as Huston does here. Pictures and books are nice, but they are different media. A movie like this does not understand that an honestly entertaining piece of crap (Village of the Damned) is in many ways better than an unbearable piece of culture. This is the film school for Eat Your Vegetables. <br /> <br /> You appreciate the work that has been done to make the film, but not the narrative. Only a few segments that reflect maritime research are interesting. the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work and various sea activities; and the technology of whaling. And that does not require a two-hour movie.
