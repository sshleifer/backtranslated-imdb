Nobody goes into a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and expects the second coming of Citizen Kane. The same goes for the majority of low-rent horror movies, especially those Roger Ebert called "Dead Teenager Movies." The Hills Have Eyes 2 definitely qualifies as the Dead Teenager Movie, only here teenagers have received the superficial appearance of military trainees. <br /> <br /> Some will address questionable facts with the line "It's just a movie" I've always been convinced that all good fantasies need to be rooted in reality to be effective. In Hills Have Eyes 2, we think the main characters are military who attend a training exercise, but they look and talk like schoolchildren camping in the desert. The dialogue is awful and often too exaggerated. Although the films are not nearly comparable, I kept imagining that these "soldiers" are in Platoon and shudder with fear. <br /> <br /> Very little about the characters evokes a different soldier than guns and fatigue: radio transmissions are possible carried out like teen phone calls; A colonel is referred to by a home user as "Hey, asshole." And nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do or a sense of command structure when things go wrong. I think of the soldiers in James Cameron's Aliens, a film of pure fantasy, and how even these futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations. Fantasy rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to watch a movie as 5 on a scale of 10, and appreciate its strengths and weaknesses from there. You must allow concessions for the material; There is no way that Star Wars is a movie that is on the same terms as the godfather. But both are excellent examples of their type. <br /> <br /> In this regard, Hills Hills Eyes 2 is a pretty dreadful exercise in amateur and immature writing, but in this respect, it's only a little worse than the typical Dead Teenager movie. Technically, the film seems to have good production values ​​and is pretty well done from that perspective. Scenes that are designed to shock or trigger urgency or tension generally work. While watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 is indeed a fate worse than death, there are certainly far worse horror films in circulation. Normal fanboy luggage or those who do not think that any movie, they see is either the best of times or the worst of times. If you do not "get horror", especially the Dead Teenager variant, you probably will not have a good time with this one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
