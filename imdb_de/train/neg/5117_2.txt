First, I want to say that I'm a Christian (and that I work in the film and television industry). So I understand what it's like to work on a feature-length film that supports the filmmakers in this regard. I am for positive, uplifting messages when they are true to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world and that things do not always work ... even for the followers of Christ). I am glad that others have such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt Christian message. for me, it was just that during the execution of the film fell on his face. A movie lives and dies according to its history, and there are one-dimensional stereotypes, expositions galore, and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicable, to say the least. I believe that a movie does not have to beat you with its message to convey the point. I'm sure the Kendrick Bros. will improve over time as well as their storytelling methods. Maybe they could direct the script of someone else as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not exactly my first love, but a good one (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.) can inspire in many ways. If you're interested in a PG rated movie that inspires, take a look at Steven Soderbergh's "King of the Hill." All truth is God's truth ...
