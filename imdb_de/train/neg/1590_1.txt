HAH! This is the movie that the "Next Action Stars" got into. Well, I am glad that I did not participate and did not win. <br /> <br /> Is not it funny how to watch and decide the first 10 seconds (!) of a movie? I mean, come on! Just look at these titles!? I saw this movie (or part of this "televised" because it was produced for television and we could not bear to see it) when I did my military service, and the audience with me was the typical hodgepodge. Podge of the average guys who now and then see shows like Las Vegas just for the girls on the show. So, the bar was not really high, the most watched movie in my group was Girl Next Door (and not because of the great script, D.) But in this movie, there was a lack of originality, acting, scripts, and just about everything else good to switch the channel to Las Vegas (or CSI? do not remember ...) without the rest of the group complaining, and that's rare (!) For God's sake! Not through this movie! If it's on TV, then look at it and think about it. My conclusion: Well, since Joel Silver has actually produced some of the best action movies ever (Die Hard, Matrix 1). I can only say that the producers do not give the film the quality, but give money to the directors and sell the film Just because it's a film by Joel Silver is just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious flaws of the crew that really made it.
