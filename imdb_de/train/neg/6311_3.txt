It's a bad, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> Well, for people, a realistic movie is a good thing. It's not like that for me. Life is also predictable, bad, evil, trivial, sometimes meaningless. Maybe that's why people say this movie is real. Too many ordinary places: They are black, you are criminals, you are doomed and cursed, whatever you do, you will end up shooting or being shot by someone; Do not let the children play with their weapons, it could be dangerous. and then there are those who go to church, and then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Before that, I had not seen such a bad movie. Maybe that's why I've never realized how important photography is in a movie itself. In this scene, every scene taken outdoors during the day is clear and disturbing blue. They did not even want to correct the color balance. Oh! So far, I've "rated" more than 300 movies in this database, and this (3/10) is my lowest score so far.
