I felt like that when I saw that ... but it seems that the reason for the madness in the family is in this movie. That does not make much sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's latest films, and only his screen presence gives him credibility. It is sad that all the great legends of the horror movies of the sound era were eventually reduced to substandard garbage like this one. By the way, Boris was a little better than poor old Bela Lugosi, but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best and appreciates him for trying to keep this mess together. The strict background music does not help and distracts from a clear moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast is recorded in a strange, short-cut English monotone reminiscent of the type of pornographic films of the late seventies. <br /> <br /> I guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'Usher's house', which you refer to, but it will be hard to find a lot of Poe in the finished article. <br /> Still there If you are looking for much better films with Boris Karloff at your best, choose them and avoid them unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!
