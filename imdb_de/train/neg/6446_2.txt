Western society has gotten ideas that India is a poor country. Movies like these only make this belief stronger. Such illustrations make it even more difficult for Indians to be accepted abroad. Agreeing that there are poor and homeless people in India, but why is there no representation of educated people, if not successful ones. <br /> <br /> I hated the idea that the movie shows Patrick Swayze as another mother Teressa. In my opinion, this film has shown India in a very bad light and shown wrong ideas. It is unfair to discuss only one aspect of society. That's why people ask me, "If we go to India, can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so we do not have to walk the streets full of dirt and snakes?" <br /> <br /> Those who want a second opinion on contemporary Indian society should see "Monsoon Wedding".
