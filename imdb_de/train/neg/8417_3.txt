I expected the release of the movie as well as any fan of the Broadway game. I've been waiting and reading for months about the award-winning achievements. I mean with the star power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the movie could not be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? NOT CORRECT! The finished product definitely disappointed me. The film did not live up to the commercial hype it had given, and the only saving graces were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose, and Jennifer Hudson. Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque performance saves the movie as it comes in. Several lulls and the performance of Jennifer Hudson force you to be alert every time she appears on screen. Her performance of "And I'll tell you" was the only time I felt the hype was earned. They flinched when she asked her not good husband to let her stay in the group and in his life. As many critics have said, she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she gets for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles went through their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to be in front of his extraordinary "Ray" performance, and Beyonce Knowles was in a lengthy fashion photoshoot or video tape, posing and fluttering through the film. Her performance was not strong enough to interest you at any point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was too hot, 30 minutes and 1 song (Beyonce's "warm" solo with Jamie Foxx) too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
