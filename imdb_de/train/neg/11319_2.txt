Vampire Cyborgs rule the world and use human blood as fuel, but thanks to a rogue android (Kris Kristofferson) and a warrior (Kathly Long), they will shift to power as they battle Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (who plays the Cyborgs in this ridiculous movie) Of all the questions left unanswered by this horrible movie is the most glaring idea. Who wanted to use country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior as good as he can. Do not get me wrong, I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something else, but not as a cyborg. Strangely, it is believed that this was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren must have had the wisdom not to do it. Despite the catastrophic casting Kristofferson is by far the most beautiful thing about the movie. He gives a much more human performance than the expressionless Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson plays a robot) Kristofferson offers the few moments of interest despite the miscast. Lance Henriksen slumbers and Gary Daniels is wasted, but basically Knights is a mystery. You stand back in horror and wonder who the hell thought that on paper was even a good idea. (This is a movie in which a fragmented Kristofferson battles robots in a backpack.) Worst of all, he ends up in a what-if episode that fortunately still materializes, though I still have nightmares about the likelihood of it suspect such an event br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bad)
