What a joke. I look at channel 1 and find that drying color is much more entertaining. What happened to Caspar Van Dien, who led him into this nightmare? Terrible acting, very boring plot and terrible direction. It's so awful, it's funny. It is believed to be full of suspense, but it's more of a comedy. If you want to see horrible drama, ridiculous script writing and a minor plot, watch this movie. If I were Van Dien, not only would I demand my 10% of my agent, but also fire the bastard. What a turkey. It is not even suitable for MST 3K !! It would be a good movie to cure insomnia. I especially love the part where Van Dien is thrown overboard and makes it back in minutes! I can only imagine that this was written by non-union scribes who took advantage of the writer's strike. What a horrible movie !!!
