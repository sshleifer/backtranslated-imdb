Several months ago, I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this movie. The poster insisted that I would like to give Flushed Away a chance. Because of this argument, I agreed to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> "Flushed Away" has good intentions (at least from Aardman), but it lacks the power to pull it all together. The best asset is Rat / Boat Captain Rita (played by Kate Winselt), who should be IMO's protagonist instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, tough and interesting while Roddy burns most of his screen time. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothered me most about "FA" is the repetition of jokes that are not funny with. When Roddy is hit in a squat, the movie makes him hit five more times immediately. "My name is Shocky," says one of Rita's brothers who electrocuted Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gags that bring pain is at an all time low. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste time packing Katzenberg's kleptomaniac tendencies towards Pixar (a similar movie is a coincidence, five are a rip off) but I'll say I'm disappointed with Aardman. You can (and have) done so much better. Try harder next time, guys.
