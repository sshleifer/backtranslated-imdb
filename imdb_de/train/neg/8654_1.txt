The movie was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a rip-off of Joeseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. The river is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a jeep and Walter Kurtz becomes Osama. <br /> <The allegations that were made on the outside of the DVD box were blatant fraud to accept this fabricated death of a journalist and portray him as facts, while some parts have Muslims I support the September 11 attacks for the treatment of Muslims in the US around the world. <br /> <br /> I warned the video store that the film should be removed from the Documentation section and placed in the War Drama section for quasi fictitious reports of actual events.
