I think this movie is one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so boring that I could not remember anything, 20 minutes after the movie was over, and even tired of writing a review. Okay, # 4 was a joke and Freddy was the joker. # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is basically a good thing. They tried to make a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately, they forgot to add tension and fear. That's why Nightmare 5: The dream child is neither funny nor scary. What we actually get is a boring movie with the usual bad actors (maybe with the exception of Lisa Wilcox). The plot (Freddy, who killed Lisa's friends with the dreams of Lisa's unborn child) has a good impression, but it's not enough for 90 minutes of filming. Sometimes the story becomes very confusing (maybe because there are none) and you can not stop wondering what the filmmakers are aiming for. The script must have had more holes than Swiss Cheese, so the film itself was very cheesy (let me say that I do not like cheese, even if I'm from Switzerland). Not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4. <br /> <br /> Do not bother to borrow / buy this movie, if not for the sake of completeness, it's pretty chaotic. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (getting used to, # 6 is also messy ...)
