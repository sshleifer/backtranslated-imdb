This movie was awful. OK, my favorite movie is "The Wicker Man" (1973), so I was always a bit biased. <br /> <br /> The plot snakes its way, throwing out so many key elements of the original that the term "remake" becomes highly questionable. (He's not a virgin, but he's allergic to bees.) WOW! There are so many things happening that make no sense and are inexplicable, which is why I'm afraid Mr. LaBute is not making horror movies. (How do two people who were clearly blown up in a car at the beginning of the movie become alive and well portrayed?) Cage looks confused through and through and his character tends to "Rowan !?" at the slightest noise. The "nodding" of the original is irritating as it looks sticky rather than smart homage. For example, certain incidents reflect the original (the girl falls out of a closet pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage scans the island) and several lines of dialogue are picked directly from the original script by Anthony Schaffers and hammered in it. <br /> <br /> I am sure that others will provide a better and more detailed analysis. I really can not bother to write more about this movie. There is no substance. Throw it away with all the other remakes that put the good names of the movies they were "founded" on (in this case very loose) to the trash.
