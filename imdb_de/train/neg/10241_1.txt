This is an incomprehensible, terribly cheap part of the horror. <br /> <br /> I do not even have the vocabulary to say how terrible, clumsy, boring, confusing and just strangely this effort is (Hey what d 'you know that I do that ... .) In a post-apocalyptic America, some men meet on a beach and it comes to battles and chaos - it was so incomprehensible that I could do nothing. <br /> <br /> Seriously, as picked up by National Lampoon, it defeats me totally: it's really awful. <br /> <br /> And not so bad it's a good cult art. <br /> <br /> It's just awful, terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly. If you still do not believe me, then look at me with every intention to love it, then come back and tell me what you think. Even gerbils on acid could not understand this. <br /> <br /> Avoid or destroy even better ...
