"The Omen 4: The Awakening" is a TV sequel to the original film "The Omen". Instead of Satan, who owns the body of a little boy, he owns the body of a little girl adopted by wealthy parents who is bullied at school and eventually gets revenge on those who do it wrong. The movie seems to be fighting any horror factor, and many of the events are just stupid and not terribly scary, and it's hard to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all the events that surround him. I just did not find this movie very exciting or scary, especially when compared to the original.
