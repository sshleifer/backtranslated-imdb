Philip K. Dickian movie. And in this respect a decent one. Better than the paycheck (Woo) and this abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But let's be honest, the end and the end of the cheese kernel were a little too much for me. Halfway through the movie, I was already scared of such an end, and unfortunately I was right. That does not mean that the movie is not worth its time. No not at all. The first half (as many commented here) is fantastic. In some places, one begins to doubt whether the director has intended to convey the message that showmanship is very important in the future (we'll do that kind of idiotic thing because we CAN) or it's just a combination. But the paranoia is there and feels "out of joint". good
