I have never read the Bradbury novel on which this film is based, but from what I have collected, it will be interesting (if I finally read it and I'll do it). My comments are only for the movie. As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew I needed to see it and was so excited, but when I finally did, I was so disappointed that it hurt. This is because the film itself felt so amateurish. The actors were not well staffed (although Robards and Pryce are both good actors - just not here). The little actors were apparently just asked to show up, put on the characters' clothes, say the lines and make faces. The set and the props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised how horrible it was that I had to go online and see who ordered it, just to see the work he had done. The cut was cut and pasted, and the storyline (the script) was just that (although the author himself was involved, irony?). The build-up of tension, anxiety and tension was so mild that it was ineffective when the climax finally came. <br /> <br /> I read some comments on this movie and find it hard to believe that people really like it. The most painful thing is that the content is interesting and entertaining and fascinating. It had so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was so technically bad that he can not harm the brilliance of the story.
