I needed an excuse to get out of the house while the paint was dehydrated. I left the movie after an hour to return and see the paint dry I really tried to stay. The script was not suitable for the cast and just kept going and went bad - come on! Uma Thurman does the stuff? Pretty lame special effects. These were older characters and actors who superficially made horny 20-something-lives - just kind of annoying and wrong. <br /> <br /> This review is only based on the first hour - it could have been better. I just had to come home and see if the color was darker than if it was going on.
