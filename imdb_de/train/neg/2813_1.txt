Normally I would never rent a movie like this because you know it will be bad if you just look at the box. I've rented seven films simultaneously, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home, I learned that the video gate guy gave me the wrong tape. In the box of Wes Craven's New Nightmare I found this lame movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly boring, acting is bad and the plot does not make sense. It's hard to write a good review because I have no idea what the movie really was about. At the end of the film, you have more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> On 'Max Power's Scale 1 to 10' I rate this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS I'd like Corinthians Review (right below mine). He says Robert Englund tears off lingerie, rides horses naked, and so on. The guy who did these things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not Robert Englund.
