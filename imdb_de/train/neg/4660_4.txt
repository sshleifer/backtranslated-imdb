At first glance, this gives the impression that it is a ridiculous Blaxploitation film that contains moments in which it turns in that direction. However, the basic idea of ​​the story is much stronger than expected and is a considerable effort to portray racist issues in the Army of World War II. The recognizable cast is a hit and miss, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and understaffed Billy Dee Williams doing the best. However, Stephen Boyd stops short of twirling his bushy mustache in excessive indulgence. <br /> <br /> The apparent low budget leads to inconsistencies in production values. The locations are great, the impact and measures are weak. Imagine if "Saving Private Ryan" had insisted that half the train had been killed in exactly the same way as Vin Diesels Caparzo (unless we see the shot because the effects can not handle it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns around in a jeep and shot five Germans for the climax. Still, the dissolution, as the heroic soldiers receive no respect for their performance because they are black, and Boyd's racist captain is affected by it, as well as the sequences of Turman's character he wrote in a diary of his imagined explosions writing soldiers were fighting, instead of digging latrines. <br /> <br /> In short: "Black Brigade / Carter's Army" has no success. But it's a respectable failure, not a bad joke. It could be restored as a very good movie, and it looks like an interesting effort.
