I watch a lot of bad movies, many !!!!!! It's really a hobby. Almost every Saturday a group of friends and I meet and look at garbage from around the world - EVERYTHING. Turkish superhero movies, Brazilian vampire strips, Italian gorilla transplant movies, Kevin Costner movies, EVERYTHING (except maybe Raising Helen), but I've never seen a worst movie than THEODORE REX. Never. And in a way Ed Wood is not even entertaining - it just SUCKS. The film was famous in Hollywood at the time, because Whoopi took off his gloves and told the press and everyone else who heard that she hated this piece of CRAP: she was trying to leave her contract, she moaned, she moaned, but nevertheless, she poured her fat butt in this futuristic police uniform made of leather, which is terrible to see, yikes !!!! And you can see her seething during the shoot - she does everything instead of looking for her agent for the camera to scream at him. The dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the script is so horrible that a third grade could do a better job of promising cookies.
