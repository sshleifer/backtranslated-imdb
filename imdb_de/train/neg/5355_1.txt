Now I do not hate cheap movies. I just do not understand why you should be wasting money on a movie that you could shoot with your dad's camcorder. If I'm lending a movie, I want it to be a FILM, not a group of people who think it would be a good idea to waste a few MiniDV tapes. The guy in the video library said it was great and that was not it. Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, the stupidest act of all time, the most unrealistic characters of all time, and the really, really, really, really worst show in the history of movies of all time. Even Tom Savini can not save that. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a complete waste of time.
