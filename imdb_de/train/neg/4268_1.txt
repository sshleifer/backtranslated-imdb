I remembered this show from my childhood. I could not remember much, just a few things about the characters. For some reason, it occurred to me that it was really intense. Also it was really very early in the morning in PA. After looking around the web for a long time, I found an episode. the first episode no less. Criminey! This show was so awful. It was obviously just made to show kids how to play a Lazer day and have a great time. The show begins with Bhodi Li, who tells his mummy: "My name is not Christopher, I am Bhodi Li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" We are then forced to watch children playing Lazer Tag to play the footless footage. and not just a little bit, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it. oh yes, and as if I could not get worse, you can not even see the laser beams of their guns. It's like they're just running to the entire "footless" song. later, after bhodi went into space or wherever, a shitty laser pistol fight takes place with the Phil Collins song "su-su-sudio". Ah, trust me, you do not want to know the rest. what shall I say ...... THE LIGHT SHINES !!!!!!!!!!!
