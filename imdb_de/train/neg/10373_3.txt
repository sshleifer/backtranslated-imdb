This is one of those movies I could only go through once. Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, the dialogue, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Granted, that was in 1933, but it really creaked. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are unrecognizable (they were asking for recognition that was not in sight). The film clumped together without cohesion. There is a lack of Lewis Carroll's spirit, humor and continuity. What a shame! It's such a great book. I would recommend Disney's 1951 version.
