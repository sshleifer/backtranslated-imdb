<br /> <br /> When I saw this movie for the first time on Cinemax last night, I was shocked that it was made. Cruel Intentions was, in my opinion, one of the best films for teens that have been produced for years. This prequel had certain things that did not match the original. (Sebastian's father married in wealth, so why does he have a rich aunt on Long Island?) Then I found out today that it was not really a new movie, but a TV show, Manchester Prep. Having heard that, it made sense to me that it was not the same as the movie, just as Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in TV form. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble probably added the end of this movie AFTER the show was not taken up by Fox. It just seems to be something that would happen too fast (Sebastian becomes the male version of Katharyn), and I just do not know where they would go with the next episode as this would not lead to the 1999 movie (What's new The end is directed straight in.) One thing I did not like was that Sebastian and his dad got married in the riches, which usually does not look good in this part of New York Kathine's mother was just an adult version of her. It did not seem like a woman in her position marrying a man who was not part of her social class. <br /> <br /> As a prequel it's pretty lame. But I would like to know where this went as a series.
