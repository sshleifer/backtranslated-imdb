Whatever anyone tells you, the word "possession" in film circles is just a fact - like "What did you have to make this movie greener?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense. That is, if your head is clear and you have a sound judgment. <br /> <br /> On many levels I tried to explain where this movie would entertain ... or even the average consumer. The star? The history? The unique idea? A palsy movie kids would love with a dinosaur and a black woman? On my goodness! I'm sure if this was an "idea", it sounded good. But somewhere in the course of development, someone should have pointed out where the idea could not be turned into an entertainment object that everyone would like to see or pay for ... unless they were heavily under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something that the Rest of us could not see. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this is a complete mess. Chaos, chaos - sin and chaos. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the plot (what action?) Et al. Whoopie got a paycheck, but I would have been embarrassed to take it. I hope she has fired her agent / manager / publicist about this career move. Obviously not, she made more bad movies. And more bad movies. Sad.
