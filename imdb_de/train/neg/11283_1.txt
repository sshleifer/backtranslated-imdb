I thought Rancid Aluminum was a complete waste of two hours. The plotting line was thin and confusing. The prestigious lineup of players had some terrible dialogues and very questionable accents. The camera work was somewhat experimental in some places and although you could see what the director was trying to convey, it was even harder to see. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the excessive use of narrative throughout the movie, almost as if the entire plot were dictated to audiences. The best performances had nothing to do with acting. The most convincing performance came from Dani Behr, although he admittedly plays the stereotypical secretary. Do not go into this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on lost sleep. There are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned money.
