After Mob boss Vic Moretti (later great Anthony Franciosa) killed his wife, who cheated on him with Derek, her new chauffeur / Vietnam veterinarian, and blames the poor guy, Derek is in jail, The Corrupt Guard, Vic's Prisoner Leading the Prison, and, oh yes, illegal experiments conducted by a dodgy CIA agent (big genre mainstay and first-time director John Saxon) to turn various prisoners into superhuman invincible zombies. Of course, things get out of hand and it's up to Derek and the rest of the unchanging prisoners to save the day after the infected have taken over the prison. John Saxon is a great talented actor. as a director, Saxon is a ... great talented actor. To say that this film (John's only directorial tour) has a certain visual flair would be a bit understated. The film is not without merit. The dialogue, though idiotic, is simply bad enough to be humorous at times. Unfortunately, that's not really enough to get through the movie on its own, and it takes forever for the movie to come to its very core (which is pretty late in the movie). So I can only recommend this movie if you say that if you're a fan of Saxon (which I really am), it's worth taking a look. Just go in with low expectations and you should be fine. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure become topless <br /> <br /> My Degree: D +
