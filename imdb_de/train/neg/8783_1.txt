I do not think the sheer absurdity of a movie in my life ever impressed me as much as it did when I came out of that bitch. NOTHING makes sense. None of it is wise or thoughtful. For lack of really exciting moments, they use this total cop-out trick over and over again, where you build the music before the character opens something like a door or pushes a curtain aside and then there's nothing left. That's alright, maybe once to do it, but I counted three times. There are things for no apparent reason, characters, semi-formed storylines ... the characters were not well developed at ALL. the end was .. bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every component of this movie is terrible. and I'm just here to warn you.
