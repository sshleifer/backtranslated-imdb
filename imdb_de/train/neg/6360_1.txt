May I get my $ 13.00 back? I would rather have seen "hydropower to North America". Once again. This is a one-voice movie. The same voice that comes from every mouth of a character, regardless of age and gender. To hear that voice again, I would have to charge at least $ 150 an hour. And I do not do insurance. It was scary how Will Ferrell turned into Woody. But I do not think imaginative casting is enough. You should wait until you have a story before you make a movie. Unless he does it only for the money. And if that's the case, do not just release an all-rap version of "What's up Tiger Lily?".
