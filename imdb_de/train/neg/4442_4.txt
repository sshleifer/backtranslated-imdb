I do not know ... maybe it's because I'm Brazilian, but all that was too much. Too much love for the music, too many parties, too much contrast between the beautiful life of the main characters (well, it's not so sad) and the aspect of the city that the director shows. Everything seems to me to be unreal: the families, the relationships, the music, the "happiness". It just sells a little taste of fake Latin American culture. To be honest, it seduced me a little, but who would not be seduced by this false life of beautiful music, sex and parties? I'm not so stupid: In what kind of world is this world where people do not suffer from diarrhea, deep sadness and sexually transmitted diseases? I liked the scene with Caridad's mother talk and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spaniards.
