I rented a lot of Blockbuster movies last night and this was the first one I saw (it was late on a Saturday night, I wanted to fix a "horror movie") ... WOW that was terrible, almost embarrassing ... Stupid story I thought films like Scream had come to an end; Amateur actors who provide clich√©d and bland dialogues that are hard to believe are actually typed and read from one side; and Gore scenes that are nothing exciting (especially if they appear in such a poorly scripted movie). <br /> <br /> But I've always believed that no movie is 100% worthless. Here are the few good things I can say about this mess: <br /> <br /> # 1 Bobbie Phillips: I love this actress. She is the only member of the cast showing every acting talent. The only reason I rented that is because their name was on the front page. She releases her presence in this filth with professionalism, even though she sometimes looks confused that she is behaving in such a stupid story. <br /> <br /> # 2 Unintentional Hilarity: This is the kind of movie I can remember when there were still troublesome home theaters all over the country and they crap the third movie on a triple bill with prestige Thriller movie that eventually found its way into the hinterland. Unfortunately, in this age of video video, most viewers have to endure these turkeys on their own, without having the common experience of being part of an audience that throws ridicule on the screen because the movie is so awful. Which results in - <br /> <br /> # 3 porn stars trying to act !: Mostly at hand because producers do not have to force themselves to undress or plead for longer sex scenes, but this is a compromise Usually This means that they should actually speak a few lines to drive a story (except "ooh yeah baby" or "harder!"). And they are all proud when they try to look foolish. I would almost exclude Ginger Lynn Allen from this group if her character was not an Irish mother, and in fact she sometimes tries to put an accent, which keeps the smile going. <br /> <br /> It's great to be on the lookout for all the positive experiences, and that's what I take of this cesspool called Evil Breed.
