I am very surprised by the positive comments, because four of us saw this at a show and we all went out. We felt that it was painfully slow not to endure the whole movie. And we really tried to stick to it. In particular, the people who really wanted to like it because of their personal experiences with the sexual orientation alienation in the illustrated school years, did not like it at all or did not identify with it. :( <br /> <br /> That said, it's great to see this movie resonate with many people here on the boards and reviewers, which is the beauty of the film's subjective art form :)
