I could not rate or rate this movie badly for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller, and there are a few minor disruptive factors that are based on the psychological that the film could focus on. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a night hunter of the story who is having personal problems: his lover is undressing, and Gabriel has an apparent case of a storyteller. One day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered through his parents. He lives with his adoptive mother and social worker Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and starts a friendship with Pete, but it seems strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and discovers that Pete Boland may not even exist. I will not go into detail because I do not want to spoil the movie, but I'll tell you this: it's quite predictable. Fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances by Robin Williams and Toni Collette, who in my opinion were the key figures in the film. Without a doubt, Collette is one of the most talented and beautiful actresses. Her ability to unlock the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very scary, and I hope she wins an Oscar (Hell, I think she might be able to nod a Best Supporting Actress, if the script was something better). The film begins as a psychological thriller, but also as a predictable. If you're curious about the end and twists of the movie, then watch the movie or I'll rent another predictable thriller called Hide and Seek.
