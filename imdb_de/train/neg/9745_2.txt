This movie is fake in a sequel to Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was best when they ripped this movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible spectacle, bad make-up, bad effects, chicks in short (1960s) underwear. I give him a second. <br /> <br /> The villain is hard to understand because of the makeup. The assistant says things like 'not you' that sound like NACHOO !! (think sneezing). It's just a bad speech. The long eyebrows are funny on one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still do not know what the planned man means in relation to the plot. I missed something from the beginning. <br /> <br /> What about this minimum of 10 lines when posting?
