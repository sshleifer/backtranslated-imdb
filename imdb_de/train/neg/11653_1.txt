The first one was different and funny. This attempt should never have left the studio. This movie will not make you laugh. It is a weak attempt to exaggerate the humor. The film selects current and old films to rip off. This time, the jokes seem to be used and exaggerated. The audience with whom I saw it only responded to Hannibal's dinner scene and otherwise slept.
