This is far worse than those terrible 60s Laurel and Hardy cartoons. They were horrible, but at least they were simple rip-offs of a then resurgent Stan and Ollie. The new audiences had rediscovered the couple's comedic genius, and the cartoons were an overwhelming garbage that interested children. It was to be expected. But how do you even try to rationalize this work ... I can not even imagine a word. I'm sure the creators hoped it would somehow inspire another revival of Laurel and Hardy, but you can not get excited about the past with a flat and out-of-round caricature, which made the original so appealing. The Impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) do a Vegas act and that's where it belongs. The plot is even more unpredictable than the one used previously, and tries to extend the ideas for two roles to one feature. If this movie was REAL Laurel's and Hardy's first encounter, the viewer would surely call the original duo's reputation as a bum. The only movie I hate is even worse: I spit on your ditch. And you know, these filmmakers basically did the same thing with Stan and Ollie.
