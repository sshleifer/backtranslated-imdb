This Drummond entry lacks continuity. Most of them have their elements of stupidity, suspended wedding and so on. However, this has an endless series of events that take place near darkness as the characters walk from one place to another. The house looks more like a city. There is also Leo G. Carrol, who is such an obvious suspect nobody seems to look at. He is a stranger and looks rather suspicious, but Drummond and the people seem to understand nothing. Still, it's a pretty good action and a pretty good ending. <br /> <br /> I know that Algie is supposed to be a cartoon character, but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies, he's so buffoonish. It's hard to imagine someone close to him with taste or intelligence. Is there a story behind him that will explain how he and Drummond became associates?
