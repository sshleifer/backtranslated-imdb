Chris, an adopted son of a moral family, a loser working with Kate in the school paper (Christine Lakin from the terrible sugar addictive "Step by Step" look at the now gratefully disbanded ABC TGIF series), finds that he does is just a porn empire inherited from his birth parents. He loses his eyesight of true friendship and love and blah blah another nonsense. He also has to deal with an uncle who wants control of the family business and a shady lawyer (or not?) A slightly below-average teen comedy stealing better teen comedies (HIGHLY American Pie-esquire is the only opening) You with every moral chance on the head and wasting the only star talent that it has (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye), and if I really pronounce the starword, Martin Starr of "Freaks and Geeks" and Justin Berfield of "Malcolm in the Middle "). It's not bad, but it's far from good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a few extras received topless <br /> <br /> My Note: C- <br /> <br /> Where I am saw it: Starz on Demand (available until 29 September)
