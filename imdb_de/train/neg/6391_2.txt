hg is usually exploitative and never really bothered me before - I loved "bloodfeast 2", but I do not like pseudoscience and heuristics. The whole movie is based on a man who was caused by an electrical accident and a witch. I'm not against witches, and I liked "Carrie" (the novel and the movie), but it bothered me. I think it's up to the main character, who is developing from an electric wire. even the university professor wasted his time studying special cases. I was not alive in the '60s to know firsthand whether esp was a common fallacy or not back then, but I'm assuming that any such theory would simply be discredited. What really bothered me was the way the police described schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains, 99% of whom look like ordinary people, and then just snap. Nothing is further from the truth. I detest such concepts because they contribute to public stupidity. Many people still believe that schizophrenia is a dissociative identity disorder. Whoever wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> The film had some decent concepts. I liked the way the witch used men. It was a nice change. I liked how she could make herself attractive, but she did not, when she was near her forced lover. I found it interesting how her second lover burned his face. If the screenplay had been reworked for a few weeks prior to production, and was not just designed to stupefy audiences, this might have been a decent movie.
