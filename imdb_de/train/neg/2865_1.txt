In general I'm not downsizing and if this site could be me, I would give this movie -3 out of 10, which means I really hated this movie. I thought Uwe Bolls alone in the dark would be the worst thing I've ever seen, but in my opinion I gave him 2.5 out of 10 (Stephen Dorff, who shot nothing, made me laugh, so I raised that Reviews a little). Hell, if it were Bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win an Oscar for Best Picture if they went to compete. <br /> <br /> Well, for the story, this movie is about the BTK killer did it better. The launch looked okay, but I had to go through most of it because death is boring. I like kill movies and even if they suck, they could still get cool deaths. I'm not an extravagant movie expert, but believe me he would have shot himself if he saw it. I'm sorry for the hike, but there's nothing good to say because it looks as if someone had taken a camcorder and made this .. disaster. Uwe Boll, your films are no longer on my list of the worst films that have ever tasted the cake. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I could not explain the story (if there was one), but that was the best I could. If you do not mind, I'll crawl into a corner, go back and forth and remember how bad this movie scared me for life ... OK, not for life
