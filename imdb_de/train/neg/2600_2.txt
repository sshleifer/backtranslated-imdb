Here we have a movie that fails in almost every way that a movie might fail. Terrible script, bad drama, amateurish directing, ridiculous special effects ... it's just an extremely horrible movie. Not to mention the fact that in the end you will realize that the whole thing makes no sense. After you've studied the whole movie about what's going on in the world, when things are finally explained, you realize that the story was built on a foundation that's ridiculously impossible. In one of those vile "villain explains the whole movie" sequences we are told that our villain has done something that just is not possible and makes absolutely no sense. Oh, and then we see that some kind of jello is involved too. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would like to pretend that this movie never happened. If, for any godless reason, you're tempted to sit down and watch this movie, I'd recommend that you take the time to bang your head against a wall for 104 minutes instead. That would be a much more enjoyable experience than sitting through this trash.
