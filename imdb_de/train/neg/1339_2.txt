A sad, sad sight is indeed The Munster's Revenge. The Munsters are brought back one last time (Fred Gywnne got a big paycheck to return to the role of Herman Munster) in this TV movie about a pair of wax replicas by Grandpa and Herman, the robots "terrorizing" the city in preparation for one Robbery of a mummy at an exhibition. With the police at their heels, the two older TV icons are trying to figure out who's behind the crime to clear their names. We see her pulling in drag as waitresses (a minor highlight in the movie), Grandpa turns a few times into a bat with attached cables (once even flown to Transylvania, with Herman somehow calling his frequent flyer miles, I think), and an annoying relative "The Phantom" sings and breaks glass and Nausium! What is saddest is hard to determine: is it the case that Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis look so skinny and so indifferent to the material in each scene? Is it the crazy costumes of the robots, where the school production values ​​affect them? Maybe it's the ridiculous script. Sid Caesar's crazy, mostly listless antics. Or maybe it's something that has brought me joy and fond memories when a kid became a super K-Mart fashion makeover. The result is absolutely disappointing and stupid even for the Munster standards. Regarding the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo is in a very empty role appropriate (although she has more split for a woman of her years and experience than usual). K. C. Martell makes the always unfriendly Eddie Munster. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings as the previously mentioned phantom acts and acts in the most absurd way. The film even feels very cheap for a TV movie.
