Someone has actually given this movie 2 stars. There is a very high chance that they will need professional help right now, because if you do not have 30 seconds to see if you can not award stars, it's scary in the truest sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This movie is ... well ... I think it's something of an attempt to make a terrible porn / snuff movie with no porn or no really horrible parts (apart from acting, plot, Story, sets, dialogue and sound). I falsely assumed it was zombies. <br /> <br /> It's pretty scary in fairness. You are afraid that someone will come by and you will never be able to describe what it is. They assume that you are a freak watching self-made amateur torture videos or something similar. <br /> <br /> I am so amazed that I am writing this review on my mobile. I do not forget to lower the rating further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same terrible fate I suffered only. <br /> <br /> I have the worst movie I have ever seen, and I can say (with my hand on my heart) that it will never, never be crowned.
