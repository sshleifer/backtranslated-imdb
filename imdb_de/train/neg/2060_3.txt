An oppressed housewife (an annoying Lisping Angie Dickinson whose body treats / horrifies us twice with an extreme close-up of her delicacies) becomes sexually bored with her husband and decides to branch. This leads directly to a series of murders that will soon involve a first-class prostitute (Nancy Allen, clearly I'm in the wrong business if SHE can bring $ 600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you're going to watch De Palma being torn down (sorry, "homage"), Hitchcock, look instead at "sisters". "Dressed to kill" is equipped with style and technical skill and one of the scariest thrillers I've ever had. The plot is absurd and tired. It offers some surprisingly effective jump scares and unpleasant graphic murder sequences that should satisfy any horror fan as long as they pass the stupid plot that even dates back to 1980.
