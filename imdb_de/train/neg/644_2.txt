We all wondered, "Why do not they re-make the Slasher movies that were just OK, rather than the already great ones, that way they can only improve it?" Well, with Prom Night they have re-done the average but trashy 80's Jamie Lee Curtis movie and made it even worse. It is a film by numbers that clearly tries to attract young teenagers (hence no violence, etc.). The knife in this Slasher movie is dull. The director is so focused on making the rather attractive killer look a bit spooky. The performers, including Britney Snow (who was excellent at Hairspray), are doing their best, but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared. Even more annoying is how to deal with the death scenes (we will hear the attack, but not see). It also looks like the knife in this movie is the only place the knife has worked, in the editing suite, because it looks like it was slaughtered (assuming anything remotely scary) landed the bottom of the tailor shop so as not to scare the children) pours the money from Americans who send this movie to the box office to number 1! Slasher movies are a lot of fun, but in the case of Prom Nights, I wanted to download the original. I've seen frightening OC and Dawson's Creek episodes
