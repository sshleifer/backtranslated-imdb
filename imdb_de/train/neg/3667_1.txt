The opening scene 'explains' why Hurt is later immune to the 'contaminated man'. Too bad that it does not explain anything else: how did he get what he "caught"? What was it? Why does it work so fast? Then we go to "Present Day Budapest". OK, was the opener in the past or in the future? It turns out, of course, as a past, but for a minute it seems just as likely that the movie has moved to the beginning. Sorry, I should have taken more care, right? Or maybe it's just done badly. Then much confusion about the various professions he had in related fields, and finally a mention of how he would have died from the original experiment the NSA had done to him. Aha! So, private industry and private industry met to poison one of their top guys to see the effects? He must have been one of the top guys, he's friends with the chemical company's CEO, for God's sake. Then there's the substance itself: technically a poison, but it mutates into immune carriers so that we can have what we want. a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, it is not contagious from one dying victim to another, just from the wearer. How convenient. Then there is the protocol: you jump into a situation without knowing what is in stock or how you prepare for it. Did not the producers have enough money to do a proper dishwashing after the crew left the site of a deadly unknown substance? I always thought Hurt would die from a bad cleanup, and the open scene would turn out to be closer.
