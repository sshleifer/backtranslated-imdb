Young and attractive Japanese people are back in flight, this time around mobile phones. Different people die until the angry spirit emerges behind it. So if you've seen more than two Japanese horror movies, you can plot this movie blindfolded in the dark. <br /> <br /> The most important attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike stands behind the camera. So far, I was rather impressed by his unobtrusive works like City of Lost Souls. As One Missed Call stumbled around with me, I longed for his better-known envelope, the Dead and Alive, or Audition's all-pseudo-Cronenberg style. Although many of his films are essentially empty, they have at least merits like these or at least something to get their attention, like Tadanobu Asano in shiny suits embodying Johnny Depp. There is none of this in One Missed Call; There is very little credit: Acting is boring and average, there is very little (not honestly) about fear or tension, and in some places it is just boring. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments when Miike's glittering humor flows through the murky commerce. This is particularly true of the television program that is meant to film the downfall of one of the accursed subjects, and the television programmer is more concerned about his assessments than about the girls' lives. Apart from that, there is nothing to suggest that Miike is behind the camera; most of all, his usual visual flair has disappeared without a trace (and that includes his famous Gore), even though he did not have much enthusiasm for the project and I can understand why. A missed call is not offensive bad. It's just frustrating on average. Miike obviously loves directing. Because of his huge annual performance, it's obvious he's not going to be 100% involved in all his projects. But in this sense One Missed Call had the feeling of having to pay only the bills.
