Really bad shot on video "movie" of not one, not two, but three amateur Videomacher. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a bad horror movie, at least throw some blood, blood and blood into nudity. There is some blood provided by latex-cut armrests purchased in a Halloween store. There are lesbians and hookers, but no nudity or sex. The lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but they only talk. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no editing effects - blending, wiping, etc. Occasionally it seems a little black to separate scenes. <Br /> <br /> Terrible music from evil heavy metal bands whose sites make up most of the credits. The werewolves are represented by rubber masks, which are only assigned to the face of the "actors". They did not even bother applying brown make-up to their necks, arms, or wrists. <br /> <br /> I guarantee that a 10-year-old with a video camera can put together a better movie. borrow or watch this movie, except as an example of how you can not create a low-budget video.
