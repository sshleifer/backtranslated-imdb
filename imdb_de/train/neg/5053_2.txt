I read another review that expressed the view that Platoon was a never-ending cycle of marines that killed people, were killed, took drugs and garbage talked more, but it's a way I can see what that person is trying to say: this had no real conspiracy - that's one point I agree with. <br /> <br /> It's selfish Stone in his best. He really wanted to show, not only how war leads to death, but also how it is extremely traumatic for the survivors. Unfortunately, the film seems to "glorify" this aspect and the grand finale is just too champagne, terrific, Oscar Hunt "let's create a lasting image" for my taste. <br /> <br /> The Problem I've spoken with Stone and other filmmakers about not understanding this simple concept: the horribly bloody, deadly waste that is the war is not shown or refuted. We have seen that the same thing is happening with Iraq at the moment. If you miss the point, let me bluntly say: If you saw how bloody World War II was and how destructive the lives of the surviving soldiers were, would you think it was an unjust war? If this fact alone can not convince you that it was an unjust war, why should depictions of the horrors of Vietnam convince you that in this case, it was wrong to go to war. <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not support America's decision to go to war in Vietnam, but I disagree with the theory that "this war is wrong" because people have died and suffered. I do not think the motivations are always wrong by default, just because war is awful in itself. <br /> <br /> This does not say anything about the fact that the end or the last big "twist" was a bit stupid. However, this is not the first oddball departure from Stones. Wall Street was a great movie, until the last 30 minutes, when it made a terrible "wrong turn". JFK is probably one of the few films that Stone actually finished very well. <br /> <br /> But it does not matter in this movie because there was very little conspiracy up to this point in the movie. And that's why I rated it so low. It was virtually storyless and ultimately boring - unless you fell in love with the established dignity.
