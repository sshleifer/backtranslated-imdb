When I see a movie about zombies, I do not expect any Oscar performances or write on The Godfather level, but I expect the actors at least do not look like they're reading their cue cards and their dialogue that does not sound as if it had been typed into the camera 10 minutes before the actor's reading. This movie was just awful, I actually got up and stayed for about 25 minutes and walked next door to see Cold Creek Manor, which was not very good either, but it did seem like Citizen Kane was being compared to that bastard. On the positive side, the girls were very pretty, that's probably the only thing that kept me in place longer than the first 5 minutes. I left after the hottest was killed, there was nothing that kept my interest after.
