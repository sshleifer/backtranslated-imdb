The biggest national lampoon hit rightly remains "Animal House". It was funny, rough and good-natured. The exact opposite of any other National Lampoon movie. Including "Class Reunion". <br /> <br /> PLEASE do not be fooled by Stephen Furst ("Flounder") from "Animal House". Or by the fact that John Hughes wrote this mess. This reunion is about as weird as the root canal and twice as painful. <br /> <br /> A star, and that's generous. On the other hand, I always thought that most of my old classmates were also demons, vampires and serial killers.
