Seeing Tom Hanks as a hitman for the Irish mob is a bit like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist, it just does not work. It was really hard for me to accept this. Not that I do not think Tom can not act, that he can. I've been following his career since Mazes and Monsters, but for some reason that did not suit me well. Maybe because I'm a fan of the cartoon character and run the risk of sounding like a fanboy (the only life form lower than a fanboy is a cockroach). The movie as a whole fails for me. The additions to Jude Law and the prints of everything else left me cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a great thriller more akin to Bonnie and Clyde Mendes, tearing everything out of the story and leaving us nothing but the bare bones. There are some things that please this movie, but the cinematography is breathtaking and the screen is filled with beautiful pictures. Paul Newman is outstanding as usual and I really enjoyed the score. But Tom as "angel of death" Sullivan was completely flat.
