These 2 points are dedicated to the proper performance of Akshay Kumar. I know that Bollywood movies are not necessarily realistic, but PLEASE a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. The father dies and does what every good father does ... throwing his son off with his pregnant wife. A few things that were too hard to swallow - 1. Priyanka 'cool indoor pool in the bedroom' and hungry to live in her garden house for in-laws ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the job as a stuntman, was bitten by rabid dogs and then just walked away. This movie is an insider tip for our intelligence. I really can not believe that I made a financial contribution to the "people" who made this film by taking my family. We left the cinema with a frown. This is my advice and do not waste your 'waqt'.
