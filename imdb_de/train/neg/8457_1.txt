I only saw this movie because I was so impressed by Olivier Martinez in SWAT. This is not a SWAT. SWAT had an action and some sympathetic characters and made sense. Bullfighter had none of it. <br /> <br /> I should have known it could not be possible because Michelle Forbes, always painfully bad, had a starring role. <br /> <br /> A poster called the film incoherent here. Another called it the worst movie ever. Both gave the film way too much recognition. I'm so glad I got it for free from the library, but I still feel attacked. <br /> <br /> IMDb must specify a "0" in the "Rate this film" quotation, only for movies like these.
