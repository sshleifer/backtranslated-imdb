I have not read a Lincoln biography, so maybe this was an exact representation ...... <br /> <br /> And maybe because I'm used to using the equally alienating and unrealistic worshipings that unnaturally idolize Lincoln as a brilliant, honorable and the savior of our country ...... <br /> <br /> But why should they make a movie depicting Lincoln as a buffoon? While Henry Fonda did a superb Lincoln, his portrayal of him as "shit, I'm just a simple guy" seemed a bit offensive. <br /> <br /> [Granted, that was Bushie Jr.'s Whole Campaign so we think he's "just a normal guy", so we do not mind being a rich and privileged idiot - but that's a whole different story.] <br /> <br /> Not just the movie shows Lincoln as a kind of simple (almost foolish) guy, the movie says Lincoln just happened to get involved in a law and that he was Not even so interested in the law - only with the wrongly simple idea of ​​the law is about rights and injustice. In the film he is not a very good defender (he sits with his feet on the table and makes fun of the witnesses), and the result is mainly determined by chance / luck. <br /> <br /> Also, partly because it was funded by the Republicans (in response to a game sponsored by the Democrats) and partly because it was just the feeling of the times, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time with this movie!
