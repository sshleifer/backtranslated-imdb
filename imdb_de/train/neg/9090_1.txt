A propaganda film for the Palestinian "cause". If you've been expecting an unbiased documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you'll have to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or just an anti-Zionist - nothing is wrong when you campaign for the destruction of a country, right?) Or uncritical in support of Palestinian goals (eg, mass murder, destruction of Israel), then you are here the documentation for you. Should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses in the UK and US. Any informed and intellectually honest person, however, would be outraged by the sheer number of lies in this video. I only hope that those who really do not know the situation will not be corrupted by this anti-Semitic filth.
