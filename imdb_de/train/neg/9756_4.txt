Despite the title, this seems to have little to do with devils, and much more with a power-hungry ruler who seeks the philosphere stone and wants gold from lead (and virgin blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little to do with the fact that people are killed if he believes that they threaten his position or if he needs virgins for their blood. Basically, he is driven by his dear wife and an alchemist whom he hired, and there is more greed and madness that seem to be his problem than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least something exciting, like the wrestling and adult men trying to beat down with big sticks, and the movie looks good at least, but otherwise there is little to recommend. Little bruise and nothing to be afraid of, and most unusual for a Molina / Naschy movie, not really an unintentional humor. Therefore 4 out of 10 points.
