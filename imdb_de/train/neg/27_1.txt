Terrible movie. Nuff said: <br /> <br /> These lines are just filler. The movie was bad. I do not know why I need to expand that. That's a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. Acting is shitty and writing is just stupid. Bad in every way. The only nice thing about the movie are the breasts of Deniz Akkaya. Even that was ruined by a terrible and no longer needed rape scene. The film is a badly invented and totally unbelievable piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> OK, now I will just minimize to IMDb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text. First, I waste my time watching these innards. Forcing myself to warn others, I create an account with IMDb just to find out I have to write a frugal essay about the movie just to express how bad I feel about it. Totally unnecessary.
