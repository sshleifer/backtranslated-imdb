Well, you know the rest! This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had to pay some bills if she took on this role. <br /> <br /> The main role plays (for me) a completely unknown and I imagine that she disappeared right back into the darkness. This turkey. <br /> <br /> Bruce Lee led the martial arts task in the early 1970's, and since then battle scenes must be either martial arts based or at least brutal when using street fighting techniques. This film uses fast cuts to show the martial arts, but this can not hide the fact that the lady does not know how to throw a punch. An average 8-year-old boy would take her apart at this show. <br /> <br /> The only secret shown here is that this has not won the Golden Raspberry for their year.
