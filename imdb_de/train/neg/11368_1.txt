This film convinced me more of a Zionist conspiracy than of a Muslim one. And I am a Jew. <br /> <br /> Anbody goes to a journalism school? Read an editorial? Freshman rhetoric? These alarmist claims, presented in a savory way, may prove convincing. However, by failing to acknowledge possible contradictory arguments or workable (or even any) solutions, few sources, and dubious origins, the argument becomes an ineffective debate. <br /> <br /> And thank goodness - I do not want anyone leaving the theater. BELIEVE this racist claptrap. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me - and hopefully a warning story for you - to actually read about a movie before you see it.
