Why?!! This was a bland, unimaginative and embarrassing movie. The embarrassment comes from the city where they did it ... Pittsburgh, PA! Why did they let these people make such a BAAAAAD movie there? <br /> <br /> When this movie was originally released ... it was more of a romantic comedy ... and not ROBO anything. It all changed with the cuteness of Disney. WHY???? You have interpreted this classic cartoon character terrible. Watching Matthew Broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either. Sheesh !!
