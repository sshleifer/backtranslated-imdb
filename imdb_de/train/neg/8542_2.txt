I'm working through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack collection and THE MOUNTAIN OF THE WITCH (El Monte de las Brujas) is something of the 17th movie in the set. <br /> <br /> The movie had nothing to offer Keep my attention at all. The action was incoherent. The dialogue seemed to be improvised. The acting was bad. The characters were unsympathetic. <br /> <br /> The best scene is the beginning, with an angry woman driven to burn her seemingly brutal daughter. The only connection that connects this scene to the rest of the film is the main character Mario, who has the most amazing mustache ever. But that was it. <br /> <br /> The film was not effective at any level. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so some scenes are almost completely black. It is really hard to see - what else can I say?
