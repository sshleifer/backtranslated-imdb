A phenomenal performance in the horrible. It's really terrible. <br /> <br /> First of all ... Nicholas Cage must now have made it to the over-emoting category in his acting class. If you wear new hair plugs and your face is raised so many times that its pierced ears seem to be touching your back, it not only bumps into a guilty conscience, but also creates a "heroic" character that you are not interested in. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Neil Labute and female characters are. He makes females totally deviant and evil ... and pays them back by having Cage punch several of them right in the face and calling them all "b ****" a few times. I enjoyed the first films of LaBute and a few of his pieces ... but it's a strange fascination he has. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a 2 out of 10 score based solely on Ellen Burstyn's performance. When she finally shows up (brave through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead), it seems as if all hope may have been lost. She deserves an Oscar here and now because she said her lines with a straight face, and when she appears on The Wicker Man with a white mumu and blue, white, and gold face painting, you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin is her really prepared This role hung well. <br /> <br /> This movie is so wrong and the cuckoo that you have to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Highlights include: Nicholas Cage runs in front of a flock of bees falling down and then falling down a hill. Nicholas Cage steals a bike and looks like Mrs. Gulch is riding around The Wizard of Oz. Nicholas Cage walks around The island kicks doors in search of the missing girl. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a once promising acting career in a "brawl" with Cage. Ellen Burstyn dances around here a said while mumu. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage screamed, "Who burned it, who burned it, who burned it, who burned it, who burned it, who burned it?" for no reason. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage in a bear costume (I'm not joking) running through the woods, taking off the costume (but leaving the bear feet on) and then making a few karate moves rogue. <br /> <br /> And you did not live until you saw the last 15 minutes of the movie and its horrible epilogue, which looked like it was shot in your cousin's cellar yesterday. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you can go through this movie without laughing out loud, you deserve a medal. There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped giggling to wonder if this was not a lavish broadcast of "hysteria" movies ... just to remind me when Cage screamed his dialogue / call / whisper that he really spoke I took myself pretty seriously. <br /> <br /> I think this movie will be a cult movie again ... just because it's so awful.
