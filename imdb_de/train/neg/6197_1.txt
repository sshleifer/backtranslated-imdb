At the end of the movie, I was just wondering, "Is it the worse movie I've ever seen, or is it the worst movie I've ever seen?" And the answer is ... Actually, after watching this movie and thinking about it a bit, you just can not find meaning and you can only remember the two rape scenes that are incredibly brutal and useless. It seems to me as if the director had tried to push this question into the head of the crowd: "What are such crimes compared to war horrors and extermination?" because I've noticed that the two terrible scenes were directly related to war and terror (in the first scene, you can yell the girl being raped while listening to one of President Bush's speeches about the need for war) in Iraq and in the second scene follow the pictures of the three criminals who put a sword in the vagina of a woman, immediately archive images of the Second World War. But actually, I could not think about the relative severity of Iraq. These two different types of human horror expression were when I was finished, I was too shocked by what I had just seen and felt. (Sorry for bad English)
