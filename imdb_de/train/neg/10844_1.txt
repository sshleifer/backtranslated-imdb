Unfortunately, this is not "the best British Gore movie since hellraiser," though the DVD cover claims this, which led me to buy it. However, it is a tribute to many of the great horrors of old movies from the Amicus stable. <br /> <br /> Cradle ... is shot on mini-DV, which, although we all know, more of it has a TV feel than a movie, so much better can be done. Each scene, set and shot looks like it has been lit in the same way (default button, fill, back side adjustment), which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece. The Gore content is, frankly, ridiculous. From the opening shots, which obviously knocked foam on a man's head, down to cheap propeller hammers, the creature effects, and the awful kg, there was nothing to impress me. <br /> <br /> The acting is disgusting, from the almost comatose detective to the bratty dwarf over Dani Filth, the least convincing horror movie I've ever seen. Each of the sub-stories is more formulaic than the last, and the sets get worse as the movie progresses. Look out for the "mental asylum" - a Georgian dwelling with a poor CG shield and a bizarre (and not in a good way) padded cell that I've ever seen four attempts to reach the end of the movie without my attention deviates at every available opportunity (no running). In fact, I actually compressed when the movie was playing. <br /> <br /> However, it marks one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth's breasts, which is probably one (two) things worth it. Once this is no longer possible, it goes downhill. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon, and I'd like to believe them, but with this evidence, I'm unlikely to. If you want a decent homage to Amicus, avoid this and opt for the League of Gentlemen Christmas Special instead. <br /> <br /> Currently fighting with Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of my worst movie ever seen.
