Monica Mitchell's showbiz satire has some laughs and deliberate violence. I would not say blood-soaked; but there is insult and injury. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is a character actor who has an eye-catching, customizable presence on screen, but he has a terrible track record of being picked for the parts he goes after. There is always a nephew of a producer or a seemingly trivial reason that he does not get the role he is looking for. Well, the best you can do is get rid of the competition ... Max is obsessed with such thoughts. The rewarding career is just a swing, a push and a shot. Other performers include Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and Cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, that's show business ... or is it?
