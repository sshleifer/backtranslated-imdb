I watched this movie and knew it would not be great. What I saw, however, was terrible for words. I do not want to be tough, only the movie was terrible. All in all it was bad, I mean GAMBLED special effects, the acting was not so bad, but not good either, and Sasquatch himself was like ... well, not Sasquatch. In my opinion, the best Sasquatch movie is Harry and the Hendersons. It's not violent or horrible, but it has the best look of Sasquatch. At least it's a suit and not some half-length CGI rip-off. Watch this movie only if you are desperate or really appreciate someone in the movie. or look at the Saints of Boondock, it's MUCH better.
