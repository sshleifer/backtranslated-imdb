I was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in The New York Times. Besides, I'm also Shanghainese, so there was more than a passing interest in the topic. After watching, however, I was extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The tempo of the movie was painfully slow and monotonous. The director stayed far too long in certain scenes. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. There was hardly a dialogue. The dialogue was urgently needed to compensate for the lack of action. At the end of the movie you did not feel sorry for the characters. This movie was missing everything. The script was weak, the acting was bad and the editing did not exist. The director tried to imitate certain Noir film styles, but failed miserably. A good movie is one in which you attract, sustain, and successfully complete your attention without feeling that time has passed. This movie felt like it would never end. Do not waste your money on this movie.
