I saw most of the RMFTM episodes as teenagers at the Cliffhanger Theater a few years ago after midnight on a local station, and then, when the Mystery Science Theater riffaced at the beginning of the 90s. The time was not friendly. <br /> <br /> I can certainly consider the special effects that were quite impressive for a low-budget series of the '50s (IMO Commando Cody's flight scenes were better than George Reeves / Superman's in his TV series). And I can also consider the anthem, "act" and combat choreography -. except the guy who plays the Lord of the Moon People. He is incredibly miscast. He looks and behaves like the guy who fixes your plumbing, not the despotic ruler of an alien race. Even the crazy dialogue works well - everyone rattles like firecrackers from his ranks, without wasting time or pausing for things like "thought" or "introspection." As everyone does, the viewer finds it immersive after a while and even for my modern sensations, it does not bother much. <br /> <br /> What really irritates me is writing and plotting. I'm not talking about the sunny weather on the moon, the baking of soda-powered rocket ships, or a flight suit that has the "up / down" and "fast / slow" controls. The cheesiness of resolving the cliffhangers that finish each chapter does not bother me. I'm talking about the fact that our alleged heroes are stupider than fence posts and have no cumulative memory. By the fact that the dialogue claps like an express train, but the plot always performs the same movements. <br /> <br /> Dig it: Commando Cody and his buddy are spearheading a top-secret hi-tech science laboratory designed to protect Earth (or at least the US) from an insidious alien invasion. But his office has no guards or security checkpoints. They do not even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys go to the right and beat the crap out of Cody and his co-workers ... not even (maybe understandable), but several times. On the second attempt, they even kidnap his assistant. And they never get smarter. To further prove my point, let me point out the way Cody jumps in his flight suit and flies around and gets into trouble and never manages to catch anyone. He does that over and over again. Cody also flies his ship to the moon (the assistant comes to a boil), stays about 30 seconds and turns around immediately and comes back. Cody intercepts one of the Atomic Ray weapons ... and immediately loses it to the bad guys because he should not bother locking them up. And so on. <br /> <br /> And if Cody had tried so hard to save the US from the Moon Men, he might call for a couple of soldiers with carbines, a pair of helicopters, and a tank of two to support him instead only to cooperate with the local police the whole time. This was supposed to be a military operation, but they seem like another episode of Gangbusters. <br /> <br /> It's all pretty hard to bear. I estimate that creators have been severely limited in their history by budget and time constraints ... and I guess Cody is a pretty tough hombre (though he loses half his fist fights). But I can not help but say "DOOR! LOCK THE DOOOOR !!" If the gangsters just go to their lab or try to blow up the ship, there's NO safety measures at the landing site ... not even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless it is OK. Of the three republican series I've seen, "Phantom Creeps" had a better storyline, and "Undersea Kingdom" had more atmosphere (hah!) And a better hero than "Radar Men," but it's an OK waste of time. <br /> <br /> By the way ... why "Radar" men? They did not use radar, they used Atomic Ray Guns. Should not the title have been "Atomic Ray Gun Men From The Moon"?
