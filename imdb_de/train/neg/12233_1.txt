I just do not see a movie by Concorde-New Horizons, directed by Jim Wynorski, which shows the acting talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet, might be bad. It just baffles the mind, right? <br /> <br /> Well, we do not make a mistake. "Munchie Strikes Back" is indeed a bad movie. Munchie is a puppet that has been around for centuries. For reasons not fully explained by the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The mother's problem (at least her main problem) is that she has to pay a balloon payment on her mortgage within two weeks ... to the not-so-tiny amount of $ 20,000. Ouch. She can not get the money because she was just fired. OK ... JUST is the keyword in this sentence. What the...? Did she want to pay it off with a single paycheck? Maybe it would have been a good idea to save the last few years ... you think that Munchie has magical powers similar to those that a genius would possess ... but there is no limit to the number of Wishes you can do! Munchie gets the boy a lot of fancy stuff for one night, but then the boy asks that he be sent back to the mall Munchie "borrowed" from. The annoying Furball also uses his otherworldly abilities to help the boy win a baseball game by cheating. A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the earth several times. Unfortunately, those stupid parents who watch the game do not think it's weird at all. Hmm. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would like to summarize this once again, as this has taken away enough of my vitality. You will be really moved when Leslie-Anne Down, the mother plays, kicks a dog shouting at her. Her heart will melt with her charm as she notices how dollar bills flutter on her front yard, and she wonders how it's snowing in the summer. "Munchie Strikes Back" promised another movie titled "I believe Munchie Hangs Ten." To date, the public who watched movies has been robbed of a robbed power. Heh. 1.10
