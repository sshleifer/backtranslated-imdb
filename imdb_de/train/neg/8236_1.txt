I can not believe it's on DVD. Even less, it was available in my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some argue that this is a good movie, considering it only had a budget of $ 4,000. I think that is funny. I would find it very bad whatever the budget is. <br /> <br /> I read even more funny in another review: "Drama aside, if you love horror and love something like Duel (1971) With a bit more history and some pretty girls thrown into the movie, will you love this movie. "<br /> <br /> What?!? That's a shame when I compare these two films. <br /> <br /> I give a "1" because I can not give a "0". I just do not see any way that this movie could be entertaining.
