Tromaville High has become an immense desert land due to the accidental release of toxic waste near the nuclear power plant. <br /> <br /> Carefree chaos full of absurd violence and rude behavior. Rather awful, obviously intending to mess up a movie in which the filmmakers cut loose the reins, which can hinder the uninvolved cast by the free casting. Craft was far down Troma's list of goals for this bloody Sleazefest. The honor society is punks with scary make-up and crazy outfits. The German teacher, who becomes a member of a "poisonous kiss", has on one side of her face the streaks that really made me horror. The poisonous monster that sent the ANNOYING punks towards the end, however, is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> This type of garbage collector will fully embrace.
