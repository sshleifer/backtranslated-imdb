There are some things that are not right with this movie. Brenda Song is one of them. I do not think the girl is a lousy actor - I honestly do not. I think she gets bad lines. She's just supposed to be "that vain, rich girl," and while it's funny in the TV shows she plays in, there can not even be a dry laugh here. <br /> <br /> Either I should have known what to expect when I sit down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was not that horrible ... at first. Wendy's reaction to Shen was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel if a man who claims to be a born-again monk has chased you around and ordered you to wear a medallion, insisting that they be needed to "the big evil"? fight and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know this movie is just fiction, but it still has a foundation in Chinese culture. It seems all the "warriors" in Wendy's family have been women. Correct me if I am wrong, but I doubt the monks were in agreement. Sure, maybe they could have somehow learned it, but they did not provide any explanation. In this way, they only contributed to the many cheesy attempts of women's empowerment that Hollywood and the media had made. Nevermind, that, however, let us continue. Wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the movie continues. Yeah, she's a teenager and it's close to homecoming - I mean, who wants to fight the evil on homecoming? The problem is, when "evil" manifests, Wendy does not seem to be as freaked out as she should be. She is extremely careless - even for someone like her. She still does not care about her education. I will use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you do not win this fight, evil will take power, and all good will disappear." Wendy: "Whoa, talk about pressure ... well ... let's talk about something else." Yes, let's Wendy. Let's go dancing too, if you should rightfully train. Of course, Shen leaves her, but his character has an excuse. Better that he works with her than he does not, and she does not train at all and kill both of them. Oh, when we talk about it. Shen also told Wendy that it was his fate for him to die in the fight for her, as well as for her great-grandmother (I accept this part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's actions unforgivable. As the scriptwriter wanted, Wendy's homecoming and this "big fight" are the same day. Do you know what Wendy is doing? Do you even have to guess? Yes, she eventually went into battle because when she tries to return home, the monks (who kept Shen trapped in the corpse of her trainer and her teachers because she "felt strangely against an old man") Shen has been alone in the battle, so she saves him. <br /> <br /> At first we see half decent fights that are actually entertaining. Until finally the great evil comes from Wendy's rival for the homecoming and from the broken parts of the bodies of his old warriors the actual embodiment of himself creates. <br /> <br /> Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Wendy gets all "panic". Then Shen goes to her and defends her from this guy - forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name - and manages to kill himself. Wendy catches Shen as he bumps his long descent into the sky from an uncomfortable high. <br /> <br /> She exclaims the title of the article mentioned. <br /> <br /> Well ... it was bad enough that Wendy became powerful too fast. No, I will not apologize because it was her "fate" and she had "the power in it". <br /> <br /> Since when did she learn to heal? No, worst ... since when did she revive people? This is how Shen is raised from the dead. Then Wendy and he fight against the guy. <br /> <br /> He loses his way too easily. The worst thing is when they jump together and kick him at the same time, and he is banished forever. Then the monks recommend Wendy to their victim. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: Do not the scriptwriter and the director know that a fight needs more "finesse"? # 2: Which victim? The fact that she did not go home? Because the girl did not sweat or even bleed. I mean, come on, this movie was TV show, I wanted to see someone hurt. <br /> <br /> Ah-hem ... keep going. <br /> <br /> I know, it sounds Maybe I should have given the film a one based on my comments. Part of the criticism, you have to know, is to break one thing though. They do not necessarily try to look for evil, but when it's there, draw attention to it. This movie has done a lot of bad, but weird, stuff when you do not expect anything to be too great. <br /> <br /> I think it was fine. Not that I did not say it was not okay would have prevented anyone from looking at it.
