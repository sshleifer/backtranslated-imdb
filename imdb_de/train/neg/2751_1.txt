I even hate wasting the time it takes to write 10 lines about this cruelty. Hyung-Rae Shim is happy that bad filmmaking is not a felony, or he would have to die twice for writing and directing this disaster. I am amazed that this film had a budget of $ 75 million, but actually glad in the sense that it was such a huge flop that hopefully hopefully Shim will never make another movie and therefore waste no more of the movie viewer's time. I think the actors have teamed up and lynched in the meantime. <br /> <br /> With the available effect resources you could have made a great movie with this budget. As usual, the failure with the terrible script and story would have to be seen right at the beginning. "Transformers" was another visual party with a weak script, but that makes it look like "Citizen Kane".
