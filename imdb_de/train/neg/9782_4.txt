This movie had such a promise !! What a great idea, an inferior paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose speed through bad dialogues, bad editing and a half-written story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, only to lose steam halfway and become one-dimensional people who spat out tired one-liners. <br /> <br /> Maybe if they spent a little more time on the story and dialogue that they had, it was a great movie, rather than an almost belated effort.
