Lee hosted 100 years of horror for Ted Newsom and talked about cinematic werewolves. He said something about the effect that his only hint of lycanthropy was The Howling II, then joked, "The less said, the better." In fact, he was right, because this movie is possibly the worst in his entire catalog of screenings. The first howling of Joe Dante was a groundbreaking werewolf movie with its incredible special effects and combative sense of style and themes. It was a serious movie. Like other good original films, filmmakers thought, for some strange reason, that even more campaign sequels were needed than what worked the first time. This movie is miles and miles from the first on every front. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It looks cheap and is pitch black in most big scenes. Lee is the only actor worth mentioning (okay, I'll leave Ferdy Mayne too). Lee looks embarrassed as he says the crazy dialogue and does ridiculous things (look at this end with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what a shit it is, which is a bit more revealing than the two leaders who leave America to go to Romania. The story is not really worth it here, and you can bet there is very little to mention if you have to play Stephen Parsons and his band Babel at the beginning of the movie and end up with that awful noise. Sybil Danning is here and yes, she undresses, and then this scene is shown over and over again - a reviewer said 17 times (I counted ten - but maybe I was so bored). I gave the movie three stars, but it really deserves a zero - the three I gave it are 1 for Lee and 2 for Ms. Danning's contributions. Yuck!
