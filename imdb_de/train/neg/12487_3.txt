This movie was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I have the opposite view of the critics. This is not the case if the material is not at the level of the actors. Here are the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) just not on the level of the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were just as tall as Davis and Cagney and look like It Happened One Night turned out to be an eternal classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves she has no talent for the comedy (good for her, that's just the only comedy she's ever tried!) Davis's one-note performance gives dizziness, but none of the nuances Colbert plays It happened one night. Cagney, a great comedy actor, just does not seem to be in sync with his Costar Davis. The script contains some decent lines and gags, but delivery seems to be better for drama than for comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which like the delivery of Davis and Cagney is more appropriate for a light drama than a comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who has played similar roles throughout his career, has dealt with a lot of similar material. In a rather typical supporting role, Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance. In a slightly different role than the old Western relic, Harry Davenport is very good. In one of his poorest performances William Frawley is quite irritating. His constant reference to fictional policemen is a feeble attempt at irony. <br /> <br /> I really like each of these performers a lot, and it is a pity that they do not have more chemistry and no better results than The Bride Came C.O.D. as an ensemble.
