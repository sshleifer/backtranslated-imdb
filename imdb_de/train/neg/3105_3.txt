I can not believe how anyone can make a comedy about homelessness. Of course, Brooks did not make a comedy about real homeless people. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. The people we meet in this movie are homeless in Fantasy Land. The only difference between them and us is that they do not eat so often. Brooks films have become worse over the years. This is just another nail in the casket.
