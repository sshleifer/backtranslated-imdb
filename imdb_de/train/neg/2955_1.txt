Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine her at a friend's dinner party and add a comment to the lengthy political discussion. People just look at them and say, "Oh, what would you know, you were the star of 'Theodore Rex'". How could anyone take her seriously after settling down to be the star of this dreadful bitch? Even small children would shudder in horror at this thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of Sigmund And The Sea Monsters. Actually, if you think about it, 'Sigmund' was far superior to that. <br /> <br /> And yet it was done? By entrusting the manufacturer with an illegal substance before you tell him about it? Watch this abominable abomination at your own risk.
