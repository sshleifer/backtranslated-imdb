I saw this movie for several reasons, mainly Mira Sorvino. It could not be so bad with her at the cast. And it even seemed like a mystery, and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good in "Unfaithful". The story is set in Spain, so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses. If you think about the same, let me warn you: this is really terrible, uninteresting, boring movie. The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The story is marked by negotiations that add nothing to the story. They try to build a slasher / thriller with a view to fascism in Spain, but they fail terribly. The twists have no credibility and the so-called investigation leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> The characters are paper thin! I was not interested in anyone. More than that they are irritating and pretty hateful people. <br /> <br /> The acting is awful. Mira, what's wrong with you? Why Mira? You are an Oscar winner! Keep some dignity! Her character was weak, but that's no excuse for such a terrible performance. She seems to want to sleepwalk the whole movie. When I think about it, I actually believe that I saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes. I always thought this woman was sexy. Well, she is not here. If you want to see something skin, try Romi and Michelle, because there is nothing to see here. And this accent? My God ... Olivier Martinez is even worse. It's too painful to remember his accomplishments to describe them here. I'm sorry, but I can not. I have had enough of this garbage. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is depressing! It's so bad in every way, it's a miracle how it was done at all. A lousy team that produces a lousy script and earns some money with the actor's name. Do not fall for it. <br /> <br /> Avoid it! <br /> <br />
