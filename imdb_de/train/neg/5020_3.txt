This is the most confused entry in IMDb that I still need to stumble over. All previous reviewers behave like this movie. This is NOT the movie. Rather, it is just a feature that can be found on the DVD of the movie "The One". Nor is it nearly the 90 minutes that it's listed here. In fact, it's barely 13 minutes how cool Jet Li can do martial arts. and his reflections on the film. Yes, this IMDb entry is pretty fubar. Do not listen to any of the other reviews because they are ALL wrong. You can trust me because I never feed you, dear reader, BS. <br /> <br /> and that's the truth. I think you can say that I'm the "only" reviewer that matters.
