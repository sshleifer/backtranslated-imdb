In his short 40 years on earth, author Jack London managed to stuff as many adventures and incidents as he could. This 90-minute film, which is supposedly a life biography of the man, but apparently fictionalized, does not scratch the surface and remains a story very ripe for a modern retelling. Here, Michael O'Shea, portrays London in one of his first roles, and his performance is both robust and sympathetic. He is not the problem here. It is also not a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, who plays his future wife Charmian, whose London biography is the "basis" for this film. London's life has been divided into a series of episodes that the film easily skips. So we have brief incidents with London as an oyster pirate, a Sealer in the Bering Sea, a gold miner in the Yukon, and a correspondent during the Russo-Japanese War. Deep treatment. And Alfred Santell's direction (he directed one of Susan's first films in 1939, "Our Leading Citizen") is at best liar. To make it a little rougher, it is a DVD of very poor quality, with a bad-looking pressure source and a hissing sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental was one of the extras of the DVD: a catalog of all alpha video films with hundreds and hundreds of color posters. Let's just hope these films are in better shape than "Jack London"!
