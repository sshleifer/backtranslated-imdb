Depending on your personal attitude, "Christmas Evil" can become either an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller or one of the most miserable and lame holiday themes ever made. Personally, I'm tempted to opt for the latter because I did not bother researching anything at all and just expect a cheesy and unpretentious slasher of the early '80s with a nut box in a Santa Claus costume slaughtering people. Not correct! The film is actually about a guy named Harry Stadling. Those who are obsessed with Christmas work in a garbage toy factory and consider it their responsibility to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves gifts and who is punished. Harry's problems all started when he testified to Santa Claus? his dad in a costume of course? tender young stroking his mother's bare legs. After that, he just became a social outsider, much to the irritation of his younger brother, who has to force a (holi) day. I fully understand why some fans appreciate this somewhat eccentric horror movie, but did it really have to be so boring? There are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the brevity of the blood and the tremendous bloodshed, but this movie does not even benefit from a disturbing atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists (with the notable exception of the finale, I have to admit). I would have taken the concept seriously, too, if the crazy protagonist focused on mortally punishing the naughty children! He does not kill and only kills adults who misbehave. How should you take seriously the would-be controversial and original Christmas thriller if Santa does not even commit a miserable murder of a child? That would have made "Christmas Evil" a classic, while now it's just an unforgettable and unfortunate trash.
