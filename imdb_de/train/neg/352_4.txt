The cast should at least guarantee an average film. So I sat in disbelief for 102 minutes. Nobody seems to have the ability to act in addition to Ed Harris. Even Sean Connery, whom I usually adore, must have had a day off during the entire shooting of Just Case. Not even during the whole movie could an actor convince me. <br /> <br /> This made the movie cheap and unreal. <br /> <br /> The story is a little bit different. It's exciting and the story is unexpected. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Look at this movie only if you really have nothing more useful to do.
