It happened in 2005 with Assault on Prescient 13, 2008 with The Lost Boys and now with another classic from the 80s. Why, oh why, oh, why does Hollywood never learn? Alone ...! They can not be made new ...! They suck ...! We all hate them ....! <Br / > <br /> Those of you who have not seen the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick & Ally Sheedy, now rent / buy .... !! The hardware looks outdated, the special effects are not a new millennium, but they Undoubtedly down this rubbish .... <br /> <br /> For those of us who experienced the 80s when hacking was sexy, the Internet was a mystery and your hard drives were an 8-inch floppy disk Well, we have the wisdom to avoid this movie like a Thermonuclear War! <br /> <br /> Never before was "a nice game of chess" the better choice.
