I have seen other Guinea Pig movies, like Mermaid in Manchole & He Never Dies, and although they are pretty sick, they have at least some humor (no matter how dark). Devil's experiment, however, is nothing more than filming a lot of punks who subject a young girl to many methods of torture and violence, and there are no conspiracies and no redeeming values. It's not a bit scary, except maybe the mindset, but it's definitely disgusting and I would not call it entertainment. Well, I'm not the forefront of good taste in movies and I like my trash and sleaze, but that was really too much for me. I'm all for the disturbance, actually I'm looking for things that bother whenever possible, but that was a bit much. The young woman is kicked, beaten, exposed to constant noise through headphones until she drools, then tossed with raw meat and offal and dumped somewhere in a hammock in the forest. If you think that sounds great, do it, but it certainly makes me see even more Guinea Pig stuff. 1 out of 10, absolutely disgusting.
