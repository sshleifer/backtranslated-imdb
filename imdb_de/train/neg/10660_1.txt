I sympathize with people who call Kamal Hassan 'ulaganaayakan', maybe Ulagam is Tollywood! comeon guys..this movie is a Thriller with no thrill .. <br /> <br /> Come out of your Ulagam and just look at some high class thrillers like The Usual Suspects or even The Silence of the Lambs. <br /> <Technically good, but the style looks good. Kamal does not look like a policeman. There is no thrill that is slow and boring. By the end, you could save 3 precious hours of your life if you do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> Kamal at its best is the best in Tollywood
