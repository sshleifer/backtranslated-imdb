Honestly, where can I start! This was a low budget, a horribly named movie, it was so cheesy that we all burst with laughter at being left behind! The sword fighting scenes were not even sword fights, they played with plastic swords they bought at Wal-Mart, and all they did was just moan to make them look like they were fighting. One day my family and I were in the mood for a really good action movie, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there was the movie The Sawtooth Island. I mean, it looked so great, but when we saw it at home, I practically died after the first scene. Oh and the plot of the movie, the storyboard, the script, etc. were a lot I do not even know why the director and producer wasted his time with it !! But if you happen to stumble across this movie, you will not get it !!!!!
