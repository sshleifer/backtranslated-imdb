Exactly what we need! Another remake of vintage-style Hollywood cinema, with Eddie Murphy miscasting for the second time after THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996) for the second time! This shows why we go out in the creation of a quality movie, the special ideas, ladies and gentlemen! There are some signs of hope for his sympathetic and adorable animal pictures that can act and talk with people. Unfortunately, it can only get worse. Bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of "family" people immediately. Even parents and children saw the trailer ad on The Family Channel, which was followed by intense fear and disgust in the cinema. It is sad to say that this is the more progressive time before the millennium, but enjoy it as long as it lasts, because things can only get worse over time. The brand new DR went more wrong. DOLITTEL It's absolutely devoid of meaning and feels too flat. I also hate that irritating voice of Chris Rock !!! We need more talented speakers than a group of overpaid celebrities who do not want to go bankrupt. I have to agree that my local paper gave this among the five worst movies of 1998. The original version was not good either. Murphy's next project could be PATTON if he's not careful!
