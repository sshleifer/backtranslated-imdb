Where is it written that sequels have to suck? Do not cry 2! Others not! But that was for sure ... problems were terrible actors (only Christopher Walken could play in the whole movie), bad writing (you'll never understand what's going on and I've even searched for Nephilim's idea before), and just terrible decisions for the casting. Eric Roberts makes the dumbest Archangel Michael I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague if you do not really want to see Christopher Walken. In that case, you can just fast forward to the spots where he's in the movie and avoid the others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
