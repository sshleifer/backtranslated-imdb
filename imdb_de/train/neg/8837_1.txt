This movie is awful. I was really looking forward to it because I thought that "Lantana" is great. <br /> <br /> The following review may contain * spoilers * <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> <br /> First, the good things: It looks good, some ideas are in order. The bad things are everything else. <br /> <br /> The story, as you may know, is about some guys who go fishing and discover a body, with the turn they find on Friday, but continue to fish and eventually report on Sunday when they do come back to the mobile sector (mobile phone). However, the film needs its time (boy takes time) to get to this central event. <br /> <br /> Of the ensemble of characters (about a dozen) no one seems to like another. I think, consistently, because they are all unlikely). I was extremely frustrated that I could not sufficiently explain the relationship between the characters. It was not until the end of the film that I was able to construct the pedigree vaguely. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of a movie that is relentlessly bleak. This is a failure in the structure of the story as the character's character before the fishing trip seems as bad as it does afterwards. If you've raised the bar so high, it's difficult to kill all those who commit suicide. <br /> <br /> There are stupid gaps in logic. The killer throws the body into the lake, and then he drifts miles into the mountains. The fishermen leave on Sunday morning, but for some reason Byrne comes home late at night after his wife goes to bed. The next morning, the cops knocked on the door first to take him to the station. Um, they have not heard anything from the phone yet? Down at the train station, the media knows the whole story, less than 24 hours after they've reported the body. <br /> <br /> Completely missing in the story is the debate the guys certainly had after finding the body. This is a mystery - everyone asks them "how can you do that?" and the audience asks the same question. (The debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in "Liberation"). I know exactly what I would do in their situation. Someone has to go to the car, drive to the mobile range, call the police, wait and drive them back to the village. If the others are waiting and fishing in the camp, who cares? <br /> <br /> Much of it just seems to be wrong. The only thing that proved correct was that, since the girl was black, the aborigines had seized the racist acts of the fishermen - "would not have done it if it were a white girl." <br /> <br /> There is a strange indifference in the whole country about who might have killed the girl (I think the topic is mentioned once) and there is no secret as the audience sees the killer in the opening scene / > <br /> So at the same time I am bored and confused when there is a turn - not in the plot, but in the subject. Suddenly, it is about the quiet dignity of the bereaved, which leads to a ridiculous ending with incoherent witness to black and white reconciliation. Huh? <br /> <br /> This is the Australian film at its finest, according to The Age.
