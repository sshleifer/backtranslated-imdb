Before I saw that, I had seen pretty bad Christmas movies. But when I saw that, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than "The Godfather." "Santa Claus" is a funny movie about Santa helping some kids, but it feels almost demonic. Santas happy ho-ho-ho is replaced by a wicked, diabolical laugh that I believe has rejected many children of Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange, which fits all performances and dialogues. Santa lives high above the earth at the North Pole, where he and children from around the world prepare for Christmas. But Santa has an enemy called Pitch or Satan. Pitch tries to ruin Santa's Christmas by making three boys naughty and creating distractions such as moving the fireplace and making the door knob hot. When Pitch attacks Santa by a dog, it's up to Santa's helper Pedro and Merlin, the wizard, to get Santa out of that cucumber. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is so bizarre that it is absolutely bad. Satan dances a lot and he actually seems much happier than Santa Claus. Santa talks about delivering gifts to all boys and girls, but he only seems to deliver to five children's homes in Mexico. The reindeer are toys to raise, and when the reindeer laughs, I'm amazed that it does not make children cry ... it's scary. Everything is terrible. The first 10 minutes are just Santa Claus playing the organ while the children sing to it. Probably one of the strangest scenes is that Santa shoots Pitch in the butt with a mini cannon and laughs laughing as Pitch dances in pain. I think parents can tell their little children better where babies come from than show them. The only positive thing is that you have to laugh hysterically when you appreciate bad cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 85 min.
