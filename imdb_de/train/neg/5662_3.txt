When I read most of the other comments, I felt that they were too glowing for this movie. I have found that the spark that was found in the former Zatoichi films, has been completely lost, and only proves that it is best after a long absence from the screen often to let things be easy. I agreed to the Star Trek analogy of other reviewers to complete, which compared the FIRST Star Trek movie with the original series - waited millions of enthusiastic fans and waited and waited for the return of the show and were forced to a bland and sterile to see approach to the original. <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes incomprehensible, it is terribly bloody (although the new NEW Zatoichi by Beat Takeshi is much bloodier) and the heart of the originals is missing. The blood did not bother me at all, but some can be turned off (especially the scenes with the severed nose and severed heads). In addition, the time for Ichi was not good - he appears in this film a broken and sad man to be (much, much more than usual) - and want might not actually see the fans of the series. <br /> <br /> This was a very sad return for Zatoichi. If you are not like me and want to see EVERY Zatoichi movie, this movie is very skipped. See one of the earlier versions or the ALL-NEW version of 2003.
