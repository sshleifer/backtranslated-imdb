This film is intended for the Asian / Chinese market and is aimed especially at fans of Jay Chou, one of the biggest music stars in Asia. Jay Chou is a very talented songwriter / singer. He is mediocre as an actor, although he has appeared in several major productions ("Beginning D", "Curse of the Golden Flower"). Amazingly, he won both Golden Horse (Taiwan) and Hong Kong Film Awards for "initial D". <br /> <br /> The understudy is very well chosen, which basically appeals to everyone from China. The cast consisted of many famous film / television actors, singers and even sports commentators (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they did not have enough time to show their talents. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw is that Chu took both the position of director and scribe. He has a reputation for making superficial and mindless films from non-coherent scripts. With his bad director and Lam story, the entire talented cast, the fancy vision effects, and the sounds of production money was wasted. <br /> <br /> However, the horrible movie could bring in over $ 10 million, maybe even more in Asia, making it one of the biggest box office successes in Asia. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: You can only see this movie if you want to see how money and talent are wasted, or if you are just Accompany your kids who are fans of Jay Chou.
