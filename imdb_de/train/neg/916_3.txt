Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry in this 1945 film. <br /> <br /> There is a good story about the Axis trying to win coal for the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we're dealing with a supposedly blunt Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> The real kudos go to the experienced Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. As with her memorable Pilar in the Oscar winner of 1943, "For the Tolls," Paxinou once again plays a Spanish revolutionary, but this time she is a double-whistle-blower for the Franco group. She's a pretty vicious figure, especially when she throws a 14-year-old child out the window. She believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide.
