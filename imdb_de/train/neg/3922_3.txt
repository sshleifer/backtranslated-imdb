Predictable parody that almost did not manage to impress for eight minutes. The only thing that was worth it was the DO NOT COLORIZE line on the credits. Too bad that something more entertaining was not shown on the DVD, like Jonathan Ross' delightful Romero profile in "The Incredible Strange Film Show".
