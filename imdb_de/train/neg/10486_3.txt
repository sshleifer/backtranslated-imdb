My main commentary on this movie is how Zwick could win credible actors for this movie? Impressive cast? even for the minor characters of whom this film does not really help. I have to admit, though, that Tom Cank's cameo was almost worth it. What was that with Tom? Did you lose a bet? However, the best cameo of the film was Joe Isuzu - far and away a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, who struggles with being a pink lady, goes to the motel in Vegas. This happens when Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to motivate his soon to be ex-wife motivated Elvis suit. What else? Blackmail. Along the way, they have numerous clashes with Elvis impersonators heading to an Elvis imitation convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what he considers an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately, the premise does not mean that the movie was good. <br /> <br /> Imagine being in first grade when watching this movie? when storylines and continuity are not really important. It's much more fun to make Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit than to wonder why what she's doing makes no sense. The film is very hard-working, but ultimately falls much short. Ultimately, it's filled with ideas that could theoretically have been funny, but were not that funny in practice. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst, but you may feel like you're leaving the building when you leave ???? Do not say I did not warn you!
