I tried to track down this film by letting off bad sentences about "teenagers and killing the guy in his house" and so on. I think I saw parts of this movie for the first time when I was about 10 years old when he was using cable. It made a pretty impression! It's a kind of movie kids know they should not watch, and change channel when their parents come in. When I saw who the cast was, I could not believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. However, if you want to see men cheating on their wives murdered, then this is an interesting movie. If I recall correctly, there are also some interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the stupidest end of time, but still ... memorable.
