I'm glad I saw this movie after Mr. Sandler became famous. <br /> <br /> It's bad ... bad, bad, bad. There is no action. It's like watching a painfully boring home movie. <br /> <br /> I really like his other films ... but if you're a fan like me ... stay away from this one. It can change your thoughts about Adam. You may never recover from the horror that is in this movie ... I had a better time when old people saw Scrabble playing in a house ...
