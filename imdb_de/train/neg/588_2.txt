I am forced to write a review of this IMAX feature to warn others to save their money. Almost every episode of Desmond Morris's "The Human Animal" or David Suzuki's "The Nature of Things" could have surpassed the material presented. Not only can the director take advantage of IMAX's unbelievable film stand of 65 to 70 mm and the gigantic presentation space of the IMAX, but everything on screen is extremely inconspicuous in view of the aforementioned accessibility of such programs. Viewers are introduced to a pregnant Heather, her husband Buster and her niece and nephew. We follow them for an endless forty minutes as they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. While we gain access to the scenes in the human digestive path and learn about babies' natural immersive reflexes, do we really learn more than just most high school graduates? Are we even entertained remotely by the transatlantic heathland? Let's take care Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see an IMAX feature, I recommend the beautifully photographed "India: Kingdom of the Tiger" or the technically exciting "Space Station 3D". Trust me.
