I was very excited to see that they had ever made a movie from my favorite book. I did not know it was Disney until it was too late. I was appalled by the many omissions in important parts of the story. It was as if someone had made a film from the fourth student's account of the novel. Meg was doing well at school, and neither she nor her father wore glasses. Mrs. Murray (Meg's mother) was not so much a scientist at all; They skipped their kitchen lab and replaced it with the Internet. And that is just the beginning. Halfway through the movie, I screamed at the screen, much to the annoyance of the other people who saw the movie and did not read the book. I wish I had more thumbs so I could push four thumbs down. The only good thing I can say is that this movie is somehow alright for a person who has not read the book.
