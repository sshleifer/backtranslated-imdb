Tierney is an authentic, tough guy, but this film failure of the normally competent RKO undermines its effect on every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson's at a Ten Cmmandments Dinner. Just count the times when Tierney's incredible rider swallow a lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old stereotype that "only happens in the movies" applies to everything here. Then there's the guy who plays the guard, who apparently came from a fiery WC Fields comedy and ruined the threatening atmosphere there. The static one-room sets also do not help, and also director Feist obviously has no feeling for the material. Then add a final chase that lacks both fantasy and profit, and the results are pretty shallow. In fact, the film picks up only in the scenes of the station house where hardened cops discover the hidden forces of innocent-looking gas stations. Too bad that Tieney's career has never really gone. I guess that was mainly because he was as big a guy in off-screen area as shown on the screen and was in a bad scratch after another. His icy nature and his clear feelings sometimes remind me of Lee Marvin, who shows his tough guy best. In any case, this project could have worked as a radio play, but as a film with a promising Noir title that's a disappointment.
