A particularly vicious example of an Italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title (if anything, the alternative THE MARK OF Satan is even less relevant to the plot!), Only this mixture of Gothic horror and Giallo (with a heavy dose of erotica) creates a flat atmosphere throughout ?? Actually tuned to the handling, which is downright terrible! Here we get the usual group of people (an acting group) stranded on an island (to which they were invited by a count since he fell in love with the lead actress who killed a dead one for his missing spouse)! The characters are quite a few clichés: medium but dashing heroes (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart, whose family history is more than violent tragedy), degrading heroine, sloppy companion (reminiscent of Mae West and the most annoying of the lot!), A gentle one but dedicated stage manager (forever chafed at all for his unmanly behavior!), a few lesbians, a mysterious gardener (the omnipresent Luciano Pigozzi, who exceptionally goes into the action if you know what I mean), a jealous housekeeper (nominal star Femi Benussi, but it really is an ensemble piece for that), a religious fanatic of a butler, an impressive chambermaid, etc. The film is not unsurpassable by any means, the cruel synchronization, the snail's pace, the modest production (with the scenes , in which the roaring sea of ​​black-and-white films is shown!) and the fact that The murders only occur within the final half hour, do not help. In addition, Marcello Giombini's score, though pleasant in itself, appears inappropriately modern under the circumstances; However, the revelation turns out to be surprisingly expensive (considering that there are certainly no suspects here).
