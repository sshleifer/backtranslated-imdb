The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released on full length as a full-length video / DVD) about the treacherous 1960s seen from the eyes of a white and a black family. The first half of the film is powered by Dutton's outstanding performance as Reverend Willie Taylor, distributing the action equally between the families. But Dutton's character is killed halfway and the black family is completely forgotten in a boring, incoherent and terrible second half. EVALUATION: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated as PG-13 for video / DVD release).
