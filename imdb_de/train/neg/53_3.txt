I'm studying Catalan and was happy to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogues, in my art house video library. Br /> Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well done and beautifully photographed. Although the children's opening sequence is shockingly violent, it looks good and convincing. (For the most part this means ... Would the mallorquins take off a body in the middle of the market square before the funeral, within sight of the 10-year-old boy of the dead?) Small detail. Up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, also playing in the Spanish Civil War. Fast forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident came of age. Francisca is a nun working in a tuberculosis sanatorium, and both boys Manuel and Ramallo are both patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen. <br /> <br /> The problem, as with so many Spanish films (apologizes to Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca), the characters are just as * funny *. Their motivations, personalities and dialogues are often simply incoherent. <br /> <br /> It also falls into a terrible, miserable abundance. Be prepared for MUCH pain and lots of blood. The critic who called it "Potboiler" is well on the way. If it had been done 40 years ago, the poster would have said: SEE BANS LOVE !! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! BIGOTRY!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! TREASON!! <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is far from sufficient to make the personalities and relationships of the characters credible. To work, it would have needed several flashbacks to refine the characters. As it stands, it seems to be a bizarre and depressing mix of "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction". If that sounds like something that you absolutely must see, enjoy it by all means. I think I go with something that does not make me feel like taking a shower to wash off the hustle and bustle. <br /> <br /> Among the Catalans, it is the Mallorqui dialect, which differs quite a bit from Barcelona dialect, although I was surprised by the comment that said even Barcelonians apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.
