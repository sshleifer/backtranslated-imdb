Judging by the hype and other reviews on this site, I was ready for a great horror movie focused on junkies. What I got was total crap that focused on junkies. I wonder if there is another movie called "Cookers" that these people have reviewed? There are only three main characters, and none of them seemed well-written or good-natured. Basically, I just shook the whole movie and wondered about the stupidity of those drug addicts. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not rent this movie Rent "Cabin Fever" or another decent horror movie. Hell, hire "Mary Poppins"! The animated penguins are scarier and more convincing than anything you find in Cookers.
