If you have a disembodied skull, an empty mansion, a schizophrenic woman, a disarming kad, and a useful gardener, throw in a minister and his wife - what do you have? <br /> <br /> AIP's answer to insomnia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The Screaming Skull" earns points of boldness and offers free caskets to anyone dying of the sight of the movie. Pretty sure bet if you're stunned by people who think they're in a production of Suspense for Dummies. <br /> <br /> But Peggy Webber was a sweet guy anyway. She had a few good moments of acting here and there (especially when she tried to communicate with the gardener), and nobody else fills a nightgown like her. But that scared face makes her scary. Whoa. <br /> <br /> As a whole, however, there is little tension here and everything is telegraphed by a mime. You can not be afraid of this movie, that's impossible. It has its moments, but not enough of it. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, thanks to some Mike Nelson and his two robot friends, there are some moments of pure joy, especially in the copy YOU got ("The movie jumped and it was really scary ! "). <br /> <br /> A star for "The Screaming Skull", eight and a half for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Talk about a "screaming" bore ....
