I'm terribly sorry, I know that Cooper is still described as one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and most of his films are considered "masterpieces", but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, 2004, I wonder What everyone is going to do about this movie! Acting is just terrible - Hanna Schygulla smiles like an idiot! - The changes between Nazi glamor and battlefields are ridiculous, the whole movie looks like it was made in an attic in two days. It's probably the same, and many people seem to think that's "real art," but for me, this movie is just bad and cheap. Compare this to Visconti's "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
