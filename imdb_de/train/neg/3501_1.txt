I understand the jokes quite well, they are just not good. The show is terrible. I understand it and that's another terrible thing. The only cool character there was EVERYONE in the show that had a hobo in this one episode, but then I see the other episode including this episode and the show is awful. It's not funny, not funny! I do not want people to say, "Only smart people understand it," because if they are smart, why do they judge people they do not even know and say that they are not intelligent or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying "The sky is red," but never looking outside. But in any case, this is the absolute worst show I've ever seen in my life. The jokes are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they're just terrible, their controversy is very lame, their fart jokes and other physical jokes liquids are really stupid and usually consist of really bad acting. I'm not sure what those "smart" people see on this show, but judging others, if they do not know anything about us, is not exactly a wise comment.
