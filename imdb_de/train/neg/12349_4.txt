A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott. G.I. Jane tells the story of a first woman who completed the infernal training at the Navy SEALs. The training is the hardest and most difficult, as the teacher in the movie says to the main character O'Neil played by Demi Moore. There is no specific message or point in this movie or I could not reach it properly. It may be some kind of statement about women's rights and abilities, but it sinks everything under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand why Ridley uses it so much zoom in the aforementioned last shootout in the desert ?! It looks so stupid and irritating and is almost amateurish, so I would really like to know what the director has seen in this technique. When I look at his newest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the fighting scenes (which are abundant), and they are very intense and skilled and skilled. The whole finale in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing but stupid and mindless shooting and killing. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, the worst movie by Ridley Scott and there are no significant touches known by this great director. I'm still glad that I saw this in widescreen format, as there are still some great scenes and examples of Scott's abilities, but there are only a few in this film. <br /> <br /> A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien etc.) of this talented director. So I am forced to G.I. Jane 4/10.
