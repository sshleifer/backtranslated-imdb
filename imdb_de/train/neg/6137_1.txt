Angry. What can one say about Gymkata, what has not happened yet? This is nothing but pure calmness from beginning to end. If you want a movie that makes you laugh on the floor, this is the perfect movie. From Cabot's wild mullet / sweater combo to Parmistan (and his four billion different ninjas), everything about this movie stinks of crap. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Clouse, the notorious ghost who brought you the mirror scene. In Bruce Lee's Game of Death, he once again shows his utter lack of directing talent. A few other faces you will most likely not recognize appear for your enjoyment as well, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, though you will not remember or care about it after the movie. <br /> <br /> Supposedly based on a book called "The Terrible Game" which, if I could find anywhere a single trace of its existence, I would be interested to read it to see where that thing went wrong went. Instead, the book seems to be a fantasy of Gymkata. Probably something that Clouse invented to sell his lame idea. <br /> <br /> Take this one and Yakmallah for yourself. It's easily one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that says a lot.
