A man discovers that his parents were involved in an atomic experiment in the 1950s and now have the power to go down in flames! <br /> <br /> I was really prepared for this movie with the great Toby Hooper and the stiff-headed Brad Dourif. Unfortunately, it did not rise above the average movie with individual violence. Spontaneous combustion has an interesting premise behind it, unfortunately it never seems to reach its full potential and extends its conspiracy too much. The special effects, however, are not bad and help to bring the film to the final. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad, Dourif is stealing the show. <br /> <br /> All around, Not a classic, but it's not the worst of its kind. <br /> <br /> ** out of ****
