Kris Kristofferson, who reached his parched climax in the mid-1970s, can barely stand next to La Streisand's immeasurable ego and discounted feminism. <br /> <br /> None of the characters is really a sympathetic; I was also glad when Kristofferson's Ferrari crossed this hill and crashed. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie about the Rock'n'Roll star, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (only about one and a half years old) after this filth).
