This is not a very good movie, but also no stinker. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long, so rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My GF and I found out this movie (we think), so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** IMPORTANT SPOILER DOWN *** <br /> <br / > First of all, this movie is actually quite simple after you have removed the confusing unconscious dream state garbage (95% of the movie). <br /> <If you ignore the garbage, it REALLY happened: A group of school friends go to a rave one night. They go and get into a car accident where everyone but Cassie and Sean die. This is the simple reduced version. (That's right, I said, Sean, bear with me.) Right after the accident, Cassie lies in the hospital, between life and death, until the end of the movie. This is where the dream begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's mind and soul continue after the accident and interact with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, the 2 Crazy and the Jew) along with pictures conjured up by their minds (Sean, the school and everything else around them ). The souls continue to do what they have defined as: Annie, the Avid Woman, the 2 Crazed Murderers (from the opening scene), Father Jude, who is still helping people. <br /> <br /> We are then treated very persistently long drive, many pictures shown (many of which my GF and I still can not make), but it all boils down to it being not Cassie's time, too to die. In the end, Cassie awakens after a while "dead" in the hospital. Her family and Sean are there. That's a reality again. She is fine. <br /> <br /> Then the director adds a little more, trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the strangled wheelchair. But this part is really just a nightmare and she wakes up next to Sean, obviously with her traumatic experiences. <br /> <br /> We did not cover everything for space, but we can do it.
