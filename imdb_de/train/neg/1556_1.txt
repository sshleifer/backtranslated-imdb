I was in this movie China. I choose the name Sheeba Alahani because I worked as a model in Italy at that time and they could not pronounce my real name properly, so I chose Sheeba and then added Alahani as it resembled Alohalani. I had never played before (and that shows it), but filming was so much fun. They gave me "acting lessons" every morning (which obviously was not useful). They sounded my voice (thank god). <br /> <br /> David and Peter had a great time on set, full of humor and jokes. This film should never be taken seriously, it was a tax write-off according to inside information made. <br /> <br /> I give a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun I had "acting".
