This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I saw this movie with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there was not a single sympathetic character. I could get more entertainment with static look. I only gave this movie a 1 because the scale was not negative. Avoid this movie at all costs.
