This movie is incarnated phoniness, a straight 11/10 on the phoninity scale. The spuriousness of the accents and the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are simply stunning. Although true Scotland can be just as colorful, you should not go there if you go there, and do not expect much opportunity to "dance" controversy with the locals. Also, do not try to influence local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing. <br /> <br /> There are a few infectious vocal and dance scenes, but the plot is too cheesy and linear Dialogue is often too weak. I also doubt if anyone would rather be trapped in a Scottish eighteenth-century village in the Boondocks than in gay New York City. Maybe it was not such a big sacrifice for this priest to leave Brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of this dump. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to what the alternative of reality is in reality A Christopher Streed Day parade in Scotland would look like on LSD. Apart from that, I would only recommend it to Hollywood musicians.
