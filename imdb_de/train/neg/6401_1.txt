Can I do it until I need glasses? At least the point proves that everyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. The people who unleash this wretched heap of spitting vomit into the world lack the talent, taste, or intelligence. The target audience must be the recently labotimated children who play with their own feces. Anyone else would be too worldly wise to get out of this movie. It consists of a series of sophistical skits, where the punchline does not reach to the obvious. It ends in the ridiculous. The jokes made are the kinds of jokes that elementary school children say (usually potty or sexually related) if they do not know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know how about Daddy's car and Mama's garage. Using any stricter method of criticism would be pointless, since the usual standards of acting, writing, governing, and the like have never been heard by the creative "ghosts." behind this mess. In order not to be judgmental, but who has enjoyed this movie should seriously consider its purpose on this earth. <br /> <br />
