Okay, that's stupid, they say they do not make another nightmare movie, that this is the "last" ... and what do they do? They make another, and not the next (Part 7) was bad Why do they play us? Anyway, this movie made no sense at all, it was extremely boring, the characters were very one-dimensional, Freddy was another joker who is very stupid for such a good show. The plot is very, very bad and that's even worse than part 2 and 5. I did not get the movie, it's a silly story in 3D, pointless! I would say. I hated this movie so much that I still get all the parts I did not like. This was basically the whole movie. Again there were no death scenes, though they were different, they sucked bigtime. How could they have gone so far? Did not they see that they made the biggest mistakes in sections 2 and 5? And yet they do. It's all about the money /> I got a Nightmare on Elm Street 6 (6) 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Good points of the film: had potential with action. <br /> <br /> Poor points of the movie: Terrible Drama / Lack of Deaths / Too funny to be classified as horror / very confusing.
