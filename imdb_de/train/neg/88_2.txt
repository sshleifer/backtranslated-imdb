I was really looking forward to this movie. It's a good family movie; However, if the editorial team of Michael Landon Jr. improved the editing, the movie would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I hope there is another movie from the series, which are all very good. But if one more is done, I ask you to take care while editing. This story was everywhere and did not seem to have a center. Which is unfavorable because the other films in the series were great. I like the story of Willie and Missy. They are both great role models. In addition, the romantic side of the audience always enjoys a good love story.
