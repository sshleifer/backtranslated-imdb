Well, I had to be generous and give this a 2. This was mainly due to the unused holes cut in that lady's shirt where her breasts are. I found the mild amusing. Apart from that, this movie is nothing but a few good laughs with a friend. Funny if you're ready to throw "Mystery Science Theater" comments with someone, but it's no better than a 2. And a 2 is really shit.
