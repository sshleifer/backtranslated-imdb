A thematic main theme of cinema has always been the genre, which includes seductive women whose habits and means lead to vulnerable men not only hugging but also getting into grim circumstances that are usually only a threat to the male Sacrificing victims and causing or not depressors will be forced to take their medications, and here Susan Lucci appears as a siren, though her theatrical blows from a genealogical pedigree made of soap operas are not enough to make her performance believable. Isabelle (Lucci), the unstable wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), begins a love affair that's just a joke with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), a trivial matter for them, but a serious affair for Richard, apparently fascinated by his lover, exploits his enthusiasm by involving him in a risky conspiracy that will turn into a scheme of murderous intent. When Davis is convinced that Isabelle is a victim of physical abuse by her husband, he desperately tries to free her from the marriage that he believes is a marriage trap so he can marry her and come to her own conviction That this is the only clear solution His plight will be in a rudimentary essay on the hiring of a professional assassin who will have the allegedly violent Stewart. In the aftermath of the batsman's assault on Collins, a pair of police officers led by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott become more and more curious about Isabel's possible involvement in the crime, while at the same time discovering the disfigured Richard who may have kidnapped Richard an expensive one To pay the price in return for maneuvering his Inamorata. Lucci and Kasnoff are neatly cast as viable conspirators, each giving a reading that triggers a boring rather than a charming set of love birds, but O'Hurley and McDermott provide strong twists in a movie that also suffers from a fraudulent scenario, not inventive Direction and design elements. Released on a Fremantle DVD, this largely lust rose affair, which depicts a man under the influence of a temptress, benefits from superb image and sound quality. Although there are no additional features, the above-average production quality enhances the efforts of cinematographer Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.
