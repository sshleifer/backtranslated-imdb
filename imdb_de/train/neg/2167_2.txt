To Die For (1989) was just another d.t.v. Feature that appeared on Cable ad nasuem in the early 1990s. The only thing noteworthy about this feature was the last movie in which Duane Jones appeared. Besides, there's no reason to look at this vampire movie unless you like pseudo-chick strips masquerading as a horror movie. A tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of L.A. Will he succeed, or will Vlad just strike again as in the last centuries? <br /> <br /> This movie must have been big, because some sequels are coming soon. They are so bad that they look like a classic. I know this is a movie about vampires, but the filmmakers might have got used to the lighting. <br /> <br /> Not recommended by me because I did not like it. <br /> <br /> 'Nuff said?
