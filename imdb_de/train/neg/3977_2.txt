The identical twin sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen became famous in sitcoms like "Two of a Kind", I'd never seen them before, but I had a clue what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically, Hunter sisters Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for a summer internship, but not long after they start working, they are immediately fired for a series of mishaps. But the man who owns the company they work in, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them back their jobs, and they are slowly proving themselves to be useful capital and talented (fashion) artists, helping to take over a common man the enterprise. With Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. It can be said that this film was made to go straight to video, the camera work is totally inappropriate and it does not help if you want to admire the sights of Rome. In fact, the background is the only good thing you can look at. The twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities in the area. I knew that they would not interest me at all (their not even so pretty) horrible garbage of garbage. Pretty poor!
