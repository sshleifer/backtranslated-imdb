I suppose that any novel so downright down-to-earth as Moby Dick would not be much of a favor to the onlookers of depression, who had had enough of their own problems. But any resemblance to the classic novel by Herman Melville is a sheer coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the movie is a prequel to the main story as we know it, not that too much was kept for the movie. We meet Ahab Creely (he has a surname and a brother) as a happy happy soul with two legs and the intention to marry Joan Bennett, the daughter of Father Mapple. This brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. John Barrymore is Ahab in an outstanding performance. Barrymore had not quite mastered the sound cinema and released all the hot films of the silent film era and a stage voice that would have shaken the rafters of every movie house in which this film was played. His leg to the great whale Moby Dick and I have to say that the amputation scene is pretty cruel was. Of course that was all before the code. I am sure the audience of 1930 shuddered. <br /> <br /> After that came the story of Ahab's hunt for the whale, which he thinks made him unsightly in Joan Bennett's eyes. This is not necessarily Melville's motivation, indeed there are no female characters in Moby Dick when he wrote it. <br /> <br /> One of the things Melville did was give personalities to the crew of Ahab's ship, the Pequod. Apart from Queequeg, the cannibal Harpunist, the names are present, but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs might as well be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I would just watch this version of Moby Dick out of curiosity and nothing else.
