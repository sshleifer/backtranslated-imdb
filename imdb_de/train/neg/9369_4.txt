Although I had heard that this movie was a bit dry, I look whatever Scott Bakula contains. At the beginning of this movie, I had high hopes for the classic cheesy but enjoyable Scott-gets-girl ending and it's going to be great until 20 minutes before the end. The plot was crazy and unexpected and very clever. I kept my fingers crossed that it would work and there would be a terrible misunderstanding until the credits rolled and I realized that there would be no happy and happy ending. Unfortunately, I regretted having seen it and quickly made a quantum leap to restore my belief in the goodness of the Great Scott.
