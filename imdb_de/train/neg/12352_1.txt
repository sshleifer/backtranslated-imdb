<br /> <br /> I do not care how this movie has ever reached an average of 6 stars. The script is so banal and frankly an insult to the life on which it is based. The cinematography comes straight out of the smooth world of advertising, and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. However, Demi Moore does not come as a surprise when you take part in this movie, looking at their tracklist. All in all, a high-concept movie that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of.
