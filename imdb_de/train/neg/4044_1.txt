In terms of plot and movement, this movie was awful. I looked at the clock in the theater and hoped that it would end. After 80 long minutes, I was relieved that it was merciful. Basically, the movie features five characters, A Son & Father, the boy's girlfriend, and two male characters of the son's age, who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The film and the scenes seemed to suggest homosexuality, but in fact, nothing happened that revealed one way or another. There were some brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the movie, her son's friend shows up in front of a room in front of his room and they talk in a strange way. The photography and the acting gave the interaction between the two an incredible seduction and ended with the fact that she had admitted that she had another "older" man. End of this story.
