I'm a fan of the show and have read all 7 books. I just wanted to see it to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only people who should watch this are the ones who have already read the series and are curious. It's pretty bad and will read you to read it. Not mean, but Lucy is so ugly that she distracts from the movie. Was she the daughter of the director? Seriously, I'm sure the beaver in the movie was jealous of their teeth. She had an overbite that would shame every beaver. The movie loses so much in the translation. CS books do not translate as easily as the Tolkein LOTR books or even Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing they did right! Aslan! very well done. Although the other human actors with painted faces (beaver, wolf) look stupid, Aslan was really well done, as it was not just a human actor who was walking around. (I think it's like the old horse-drawn car? 2 people inside?) Besides, I'd be curious what the kids think about this movie. Maybe they would enjoy it? But as far as the adults are concerned, it is certain that they are safe, even if they are a CS fan.
