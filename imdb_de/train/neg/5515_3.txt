There is a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon; The backgrounds are rich, lush and full of pretty art deco details. The animation complies with the usual studio standards of the time, which are undoubtedly higher than those of today. However, I find it boring for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> The music: It definitely does not meet the usual standards of Scott Bradley. Although it is probably a "Great Gatsby" setting, it becomes bleak, drowsy, repetitive, and monotonous (repetitive and monotonous are not the same as Beethoven's 5th Symphony testifies). Since most people (including me) close their eyes while yawning, there are many visual elements of the cartoon that the average viewer misses. <br /> <br /> The Storyline: That's not me giving away secrets that are not already included in the plot - land well, town bad. This is a common theme in films from this period, both animated and live. It is a misguided nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll that is reflected today in a similar nostalgia for "values" that never existed.
