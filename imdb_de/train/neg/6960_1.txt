After looking at Blanche for the first 20 minutes (unfortunately I could not take it anymore), I have now confirmed that she does not. <br /> <br /> Basically, this "movie" is an insult to the real French actors who take part in this nasty piece of garbage. It is based on a concept that has been used successfully in French comedies ("Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): a historical film with anachronistic sound / dialogue. This can lead to brilliant results when supported by brilliant actors and a "finesse" of direction that avoids the dreaded "heavy comedy" stigma. Unfortunately, the horse-riddled Lou Doillon does everything and Blanche wrecks comedy, just becomes a horror movie. Horror for Cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors like Decaune, Zem or Rochefort fighting in the midst of this gaudy burlesque Kitchy-Prissy farce.
