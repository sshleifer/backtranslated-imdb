This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Let me say it again: This is the only worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It had all traces of a bad movie: continuity mistakes, bad writing, bad acting, bad production value, bad music. I thought there were a few points to horror movies. The first is that it should be exciting enough to scare you. This movie gets and F in this category. The second point is that if a character dies or something bad happens, we should take care of it. This film also gets a F. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman is maltreated by wolves after she fears this might happen to her. The next story, an OCD guy, dies of not being careful and talks to a dead friend of his. Oh, and then there's the terrible, cracking story of a bad roommate. Come on, could you pick topics that are a little more interesting and less common than being alone in a house, staying decent, and having a roommate? It turns out that all these stories involve hallucinations, virtual reality induced by a doctor who uses them again. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something, I like to watch bad horror movies and laugh about how bad they are. I could not do that with this one. It was very painful to sit and watch. Do not look at this movie in any case. You will regret it.
