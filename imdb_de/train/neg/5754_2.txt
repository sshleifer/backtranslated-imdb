I've been looking at Mask in the 80's and it's currently being shown on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was sort of cool that day and had some toys as well, but looking now bores me to tears. I've never realized how boring and bland this cartoon show really was. It's just awful! It is not far in the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats and was quickly forgotten by almost everyone once it was discontinued. I only look at Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 comes right after that (if the mask does not turn me on first). One of the smaller 80s cartoons that I hope you will forget when you air on Fox Kids!
