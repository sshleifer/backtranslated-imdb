Provided that this will not be a direct release, I must say that this title will be invalid at any cost. Unless you are bored of good, well-executed films. I saw it last night at AFI Dallas and left with 20 minutes to go, just because I did not care about it (because of the plot, not because of the insult of the director ... that's uncomfortable). If you can see a crap just five minutes into the movie's beginning (a shot-out window shot before any shots are fired ... and then the window breaks with the first shot), it gets bad. Let's just say, this is just an indication of what's to come ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I'll spare you all the details, but this is inferior in every way, even the half-hearted acting of Michael Madsen is disappointing when one expects half-hearted action from him. And the rape scene ... Christ! "Shut up and take it" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER. <br /> <br /> 3/10
