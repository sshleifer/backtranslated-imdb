That was not funny in 1972. That's not funny now. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I do not cheat the movie because it's incredibly sexist - I quote this piece, or rather, I enjoy the reaction it gives to annoying pc people - I joke because it's badly written and traded. <br /> <br /> The only truly memorable character is Blakey, whom the 25-year-old Briton will immediately recognize was for a long time a favorite with Impressionists. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
