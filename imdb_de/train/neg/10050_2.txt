A big disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante. Her previous collaboration on first season Homecoming was twisted and incredibly funny in the right way. This bad handling of a fascinating premise has confused me. The alleged "payoff", in which generic aliens took something from the infected psychopaths, was completely unsatisfactory and did not explain anything. If the story was an alien "cleansing" of the planet of human infestation, why did they make it so sadistic and misogynistic? Why not unleash a deadly virus on Stephen King's The Stand instead of letting the male population slaughter the females? I had always hoped the episode would improve as I continued to watch, but it just became more presumptuous and absurd. The religious subtext seemed to be easily enforced, but it was clear that Sam Hamm had thought he was profound of the weight he gave him. I like Dante and Hamm very much, but that was simply unsurpassable.
