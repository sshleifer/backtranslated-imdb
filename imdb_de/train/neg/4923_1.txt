This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie has nothing positive. Some of you really like this movie! I've watched a lot of Dracula movies and I've liked everyone I've seen, but when I saw this movie, I said, "What the hell is this?" What a stupid movie. Now they have Dracula who he is because he is Judas. For those of you who do not know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ and then felt so guilty that he hung himself. You want to kid me. That's the dumbest reason I've ever heard why Dracula got angry. Who has asked for a reason? What a piece of shit this movie is. Anyone who has found this apologetic apology for a movie should be beaten. Even the Dracula is terrible. If you've ever seen this movie, you would not believe it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Should this title impress me? Do not waste your time or money with this garbage.
