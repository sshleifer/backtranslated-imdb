I got TRAN SCAN out of the library and brought it home. We considered moving to the East and thought we would get a feel for what it was like. The movie was a total waste of time, if I bought it, I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw it cost $ 49. The DVD ran for 8 minutes showing a rollercoaster ride Throughout Canada, my stomach felt sick as they moved up and down with the movie at high speed. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of footage that they probably shot on, and you'd think they could've made a better product. If I did this project, I would have provided more material, stopped on street signs to let people know where they were, and stay in places to see the landscape. To make a movie like this, it should take between 60 and 90 minutes. Oh yes, the case said it was stereo, the whole movie was a hissing sound of accelerated car sound that could at least add some music to it. <br /> <br /> If you want a good cross-Canada movie, check out The Railrodder / National Film Board of Canada with Buster Keaton (the last of his latest films) in this comic movie. Buster Keaton arrives in Nova Scotia to a railroadspeeder and travels to British Columbia
