Apparently, Hollywood only gives money to anyone who has a camera and can talk. This movie was stunningly bad. The casting was awful, the acting ineffable and the story full of holes. Script? Who needs a script? I was surprised that the movie was not as verbally vulgar as I thought, but I had enough footage of T & A to survive for a lifetime. The movie was like telling a story to a 19-year-old street racer with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to university). Since I was so poorly scripted, I thought that the two brothers in the movie were first lovers. The scenes on the racetrack together with the lead actress of the film made me think again and again of Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is the kind of movie Grindhouse used to model himself ... only the writers thought they were serious.
