I would like to have written about the story, but there was none. I would have liked to cite some hard-fought dialogues from the movie, but "Hinglish" is only funny for 5 minutes, after that is overkill. I would have liked to override the 'keep-u-rate tension', but it was as predictable as ... um mm, a Yash Raj movie (?). I would have liked to talk about the seat edge, but I do not like cartoons very much. <br /> <br /> * sigh * <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is perfect for: 1. Suicide - I promise you will be marginalized. 2. Sado Masochists - This movie is much more effective than the barbed wire that Silas wore in Da Vinci code. 3. People looking for alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed in the mood to kill someone. 4. Movie Piraters: More power for them. If a movie does not deserve the audience's lack of money to watch, that's the case. 5. Estimates, most types of plankton and green algae - Because almost all other living beings need an IQ factor that is slightly larger than the movie. After thinking: The director of the film is obviously a separate species. (And I hope to God that he is the only one of his kind ... one is enough) <br /> <br /> Things that could have made this movie a better movie: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A Scriptwriter 4. A Stunt Coordinator 5. A Story (Did I already say that?) 6. A director - preferably one who is not mentally handicapped (though one who has been challenged could have done a better job ) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubonic Plague - Avoid at All Costs 8. A Legal Warning - "Watching Yash Raj Movies Degrades Your Mental Health"? <br /> <br /> Things I liked about this movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 The English subtitles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" become - "My heart is in the void", "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya "turns into" I'm a flirt, I'm a lover, I'm a tramp "..first of all, Tashan is for me like the opposite of a rubric cube - the cube is supposed to be the Increase IQ of the player, Tashan promises to lower the IQ, in just 2.5 hours! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh * .. but that's just me. I could be wrong. You were warned anyway.
