Before I started these films, I thought it might be a good movie, but when I started the movie, I really thought it was awful. They said the film was filmed in Afghanistan, but I think that 95% of the film was filmed in India. You can see Indian cars. You can see how Lars Bisleri (an Indian watermark) drink, Hindi is written on the street, you can also see temples in Afghanistan. I think you should not waste your / your time looking at this movie ... a waste of time
