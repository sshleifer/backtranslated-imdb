Working comedy has I.R.S. Agent Tony Randall examines eccentric farm families in Maryland who have never paid their taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of the gamekeeper, who pushes the not so uninterested helmsman. Debbie certainly made her share of defeated theater sitcoms during this time. The picture starts bright, but the flags are halfway and become hectic and funny. Randall is not a bad opponent for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself defeats the chemistry. Based on the novel "The Darling Buds of May" by H.E. Bates, with a bad sound mix, all actors sound as if they were stuck in an echo chamber. ** from ****
