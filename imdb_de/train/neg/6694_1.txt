I've really had hope for this movie since I saw Kari in a few other things and think she has talent. Unfortunately, this guy is a case study, which is not to do in a script. Very undefined characters without a hint of sympathy and without any conspiracy. Is it a street / buddy / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers have no idea and we do not.
