Murder happens in a desert town in Texas. Who is responsible? Slight novelties in terms of mystery and racial tensions (the latter really does not fit), but otherwise only for Slasher fans who appreciate the blood and nudity, the two conventional elements of these films are Kimmell (played by FRITAY THE 13TH PART 3 Infamie) starring as a brave, quasi-detective teen. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of **** MPAA: Rated R for violence and Gore, nudity and some language.
