I can not say much about this movie. I think it speaks for itself (as well as the current ratings here). I rented it two years ago and I totally regretted it. I even tried / tried / liked it by looking at it twice, but I just could not. I can say with certainty that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time over and over again. And I'm not the one who puts a movie in the bin, but I really think that was terrible. It was not funny at all. The only thing I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken. I think this movie ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think of when watching one of their films today is this horrible movie. He reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is also very annoying. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think you understand my point. Incidentally, the stars are for walking.
