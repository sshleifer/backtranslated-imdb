a very good story, good excitement ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the entire movie ... what happened? extremely well done and a good story destroyed in the last seconds ... sorry, but a 1 in voting ... that's what it deserves, I think Chris Shadley could find a better ending ... but maybe next times :) all these meaningless blood herds in vain? The end would bring the story down to a decimal, but not ... the end destroyed the whole story, I think most people are not lame, and when they attend a movie, they want a good ending, even if it's complicated ... but the only thing lame here is the end ... sorry
