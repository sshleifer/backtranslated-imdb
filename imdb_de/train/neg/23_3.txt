I borrowed this without any prior knowledge on DVD. I was suspicious when I saw Michael Madsen in a movie I've never heard of, but it was a giveaway. So why not look? Forget that he ever participated in such a shame of a movie. <br /> <br /> Even if your script and dialogues are awful, even good actors can not save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors who flood this movie. Too many non-native English speakers play parts of English-speaking native speakers. They read lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not turned into a movie. It's unbelievable how incredible all the lines in the movie sound. The music is terrible and out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a bad school piece. <br /> <br /> I recommend you just watch it, so you would appreciate other, better movies. That's why I gave him a 3 instead of the 1 that deserves it.
