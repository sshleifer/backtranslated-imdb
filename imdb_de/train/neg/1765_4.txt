OK - the helicopter shots are awesome and the director has used some of Barcelona's best sights. Otherwise ... the production value was blown up in the first few minutes and the rest of the movie felt like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun to see, Abel Folk had the greatest depth and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He was allowed to use his martial arts training well and be a serious action figure. The rest of the cast at best consisted of wood, mainly paper. So if you're nostalgic about Spain, it's a postcard with an action twist and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.
