Sergio Leone turns in the grave ... If there was a movie that tramples on the life's work of a man, it's this one. The "lonely wolf" bravo of the main character is boring and lame, and the script was apparently written by an eight-year-old monkey. Whoever came up with the idea should be whipped on horseback. The only reason I spend time is because there is a minimum of 10 lines. The family of Sergio Leone should complain, not because she is a crap, but because she is now immortalized as a crap by MST 3000. Too bad. Disgust. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey is a crap that insults anyone but cocaine users and gun experts ... this movie is blasphemy.
