In sixth grade, every teacher I chose was a great idea to use that movie as a syllabus for a whole semester. Every class had something to do with this terrible show. We saw it in English and wrote it in magazines as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics we talked about charts and other sea craters. In science, we talked about whales (which was actually interesting, so not a 100% waste of time). The whole day was torture every day. Not only that, but they would expose us to this horror twice a day by forcing them to see it in the study hall as well. I could see if this was a new series or something, but it was '93. I'm still trying to block that.
