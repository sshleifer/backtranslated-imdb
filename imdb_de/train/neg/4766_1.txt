It can be said that they spent $ 5 on it. This is a waste of your time ... ugh ... there is nothing remotely about this movie ... I do not know why I have been watching it all the time Chick is not hot. terrible spectacle .. you could do anything and it's a better use of your time .. such as. When watching TV, playing crappy video games. I feel deprived. just robbed .. my time. I've never written a film for a movie before, as you can probably say, but in this movie I felt I had to save the poor souls watching the movie and looking at IMDb to see if he is decent and looks at the comments. - There was no action - no hot chicks - - no budget - - Shittttttttttttttttttty - it is screaming a bad movie. **** The WHOLE movie is in a room. ***
