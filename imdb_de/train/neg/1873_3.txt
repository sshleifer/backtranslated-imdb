You're kidding !!!! Let's talk about the possibility that Parker Posey really is an actress, and not just an entry into the "Quirk of the Month Club" of actors. Really, unless this is a funny satire on David Mamet - a terse, confusing dialogue window alternately in machine gun speed or monotone (think of Ben Stein) fadheit - or a dried-up, dry comedy; This film has to run for a Rotten Tomato Award - or worse. <br /> <br /> As if the stiff and uncomfortable Posey was not enough, we have the stiffer and even more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. There is more wood in this film than a toothpick factory. <br /> <br /> In addition to this bizarre casting, there are a few other roles that are all populated by forgotten actors and how escape from America's Next Top Model, Don, looks like Pardo or even the boy who calls the word " was "as" bean pronounced, which only draws our attention to the fact that there is so little to like about this film, we analyze its accent to guess whether it is Canadian or not !! I think I have laughed heartily in places that should be serious, and taken serious sections that are supposed to be humorous. Even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of Alarik Jans music for Mamet's "The House of Games". If you look at it as a parody, the movie is almost droll; taken seriously, just a self-assured drek.
