I did not know if I should laugh or cry about this misrepresentation of Canadian history, especially the bad service in the story of Mounted Police in the Yukon. <br /> <br /> Leave it to Pierre Berton Born and raised in Dawson City Yukon and author of the definitive history of the Klondike Gold Rush, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899, my desperation with this stupid movie Express: <br /> <br /> The American idea of ​​an untamed border, suppressed by single heroes armed with six cannons, was continued in The Far Country. Another story about a cowboy from the American West - this time Wyoming - who drives his herd of cattle into the land of gold. The image is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the real incongruity is the main assumption on which the plot revolves. that throughout the Canadian Yukon, at the time of the gold rush, there was only one Mounted Policeman and he could not handle the lawlessness. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan reach the Yukon border with their cattle, the customs hut is empty. "Where's the cop?" Asks Brennan. "On the Pelly." River. "Chilkats," replies someone, "He has a really tough job, this cop is patrolling about ten or twenty thousand square kilometers, and sometimes he will not come home for two or three months." <br /> <br /> The historical truth is that during the Gold Rush, the Yukon Territory was closest to a police state British North America has ever seen. The Northwest Mounted Police was stationed on the territory well before the Klondike strike. They controlled every path in the Yukon and did not do nonsense. They collected tariffs, often on the announcements of newcomers, made arbitrary laws about river shipping and rejected men when they did not have enough supplies or just looked bad. In true Canadian fashion, they have established moral laws for the community. In Dawson the Lord's Day Act was strictly observed; It was a felony punished for cutting wood on Sunday. and fat young women were arrested because the stern-faced police called "a sensational performance in the theater", generally nothing more than dancing in excessively open tights on stage. <br /> <br /> In such a community, a gun belt was unthinkable. A notorious evil Tombstone man trying to grab a gun at his hip was disarmed by a young policeman who had just thrown him out of a saloon for speaking too horribly. The evil man went away like a lamb, but protested when the policeman discovered he had a gun with him to hand over. "No man has ever taken a gun from me," said the American. "Well, I'll take it," said the constable mildly and did so without further resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated in Dawson that they were auctioned by the police for just a dollar and bought as souvenirs to stay on the mantel. <br /> <br /> 1898, the great year of the Stampede, there was no serious crime? let alone a murder? in Dawson. The contrast to Skagway on the American side, a lawless city run by Soapy Smith, the Denver trust, was remarkable. But in The Far Country, Dawson is considered a community without laws, which is a Skagway Soapy Smith character. His name is Gannon in the picture? can control easily. (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border had confiscated all his equipment and was immediately chased back by a mounted police sergeant.) <br /> <br /> {in the movie, Lonely Mountie says} " Yes, I am the law, I represent the law in the Yukon Territory, about fifty thousand square kilometers of it. " <br /> <br /> "Why are not you anymore?" <br /> <br /> "Because it was a wilderness yesterday, we did not expect you to come in by the thousands, and now that you're here, we'll protect you." <br /> <br /> "When?" <br /> <br /> "A post will be set up here in Dawson in early May." <br /> <br /> "What happens between now and May? Will you? be here to keep order? "<br /> <br />" Part of the time. "<br /> <br />" What about the rest of the time? "<br /> <br />" Choose yourself a good man Swear him in. Does he act as a marshal? "<br /> <br /> The movie Mountie leaves and no longer appears in the picture. His amazing proposal? that an American city marshal, complete with pewter star, is sworn in by a group of British citizens under British jurisdiction? is accepted. Of course, they want to make Jimmy Stewart a marshal; he clearly fits the part. But Stewart plays the role of Loner, who cares about number one, and so another man is selected to be shot. And he does it. Others are shot. Even Walter Brennan is shot. Stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he has to finish all the shots with his own shots. He puts the pewter star on, and he and the tyrant, Gannon, shoot each other in the inevitable Western climax. <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows the north of Canada, this bleak repetition The story is rational. <br /> <br /> - Excerpt from Hollywood Canada, by Pierre Berton, 1975.
