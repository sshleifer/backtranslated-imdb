I'm a big Porsche fan and the car was the best star in this movie. <br /> <br /> Haim, the now-dehydrated child star of the 80s who abuses drug abuse, is as boring as usual and commented by little characters / actors would be pointless; Needless to say, they were all very average. It's a cool movie as a trip into the 80s - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the scenery of Colorado and a very harmless, if awkward plot. <br /> <br /> All in all, please don 't waste your time watching this, unless you love 80s movies, Corey Haim or, like me, Old School Porsches (this one looks especially good), because life is too short to watch shitty movies.
