"True" story of three girls walking in the wilderness of Connecticut and being chased by a maniac in the forest. This is the kind of movie that would have been played in mixed recognition in the United States thirty years ago. Not much of the film works with its low budget to mixed results. The movie can be viewed but is not scary at all (blame for how some of the attacking scenes are for it). It's the kind of movie you'll probably forget once you're done with it. Chances are that you will never think to see this unless someone gives you and says, "See this," what happened to me. When you return a copy, return it. The movie is not worth seeing, even if it can be seen.
