When I was a kid, I remember seeing that when I visited a friend of our "uncle" Phil. We are back! A Dinosaur's Story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur named Rex (spoken by the wonderful John Goodman). He tells a little dinosaur the story of how the dinosaurs came to earth to live. He explains that he was part of the thing she has brought back together with some friends. The Doctor / Professor villain of this movie, which I believe was responsible, was her, but I'm not interested in him. The kids like that, but personally it's just too cheesy. John Goodman was probably the only decent one. Poor!
