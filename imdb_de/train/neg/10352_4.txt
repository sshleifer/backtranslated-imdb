Just recently, I found out that Madeleine L'Engle's novel had been turned into a television movie by Disney and ordered the DVD. The book was a favorite of mine when I was a kid, and I read it several times. <br /> <br /> Although some of the children's actors do not resemble the characters, as described in the novel, the Murry family is well staffed. with a sympathetic (if too pretty) Meg in the center and a Charles Wallace, who convinces as a child prodigy, without irritating himself. <br /> <br /> The first half hour promises enough to establish the relationships between the main characters and set the scene. Unfortunately, as soon as the non-human characters appear, the adaptation begins to unravel, and as soon as the children leave the earth, the whole falls apart. Alfre Woodward looks too youthful and is far too majestic as the eccentric woman Whatsit (think instead of Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright). Kate Nelligan's face is so mask-like and expressionless that she must have visited Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years. For some reason, they make her Mrs, who looks like Glinda of The Wizard of Oz, as if she should have resembled a benign Wicked Witch of the West. <br /> <br /> In the end, the horrible specials can be the worst deterrent to effects and art direction. I understand that this is a TV movie, but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years ago. Mrs. Whatsits' centaur incarnation is a disaster, as is the Chewbacca suit for Aunt Beast, who in the novel is a velvety, elegant creature instead of the awkward big foot, as shown here. I could go on, almost every artistic decision is a disaster, presumably because the budget is not enough to achieve this justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgment. <br /> <br /> This really needed the feeling of miracle that Spielberg brought to his early films. What a shame that with the current popularity of adapting literary fantasy series for children, no one has thought to adapt A Wrinkle in Time and its consequences for the big screen to match the volume it deserves.
