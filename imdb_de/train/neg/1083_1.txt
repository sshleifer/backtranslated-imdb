This movie is like real life, which I mean - in the available 2 hours does not happen much, and not much schedule or plot is occupied by the often invisible cast (their invisibility due to the "experimental" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /> <br /> A big hole. Not a big surprise that Altman governs this - he's a very variable actor (yes, we all loved "Gosford Park," but "Pret A Porter," Kansas City.) The raw material is a story by John Grisham, and the excellent Casting, which you will perceive by collecting negligence in your persistent slumber - makes this a masterpiece of the bad movie and no, it's not "that bad, it's good". <br /> <br /> It is simply bad.
