Oh oh! Another gay movie. This time it shows the black side. Bet your last dollar, it will have an unfortunate end! But why? With less than half a dozen exceptions, ALL gay movies must end with death or an "Addio" finale. It's like all European film noir releases in the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s. The head or male must die or be forgotten alone. Why, in the name of God, do writers, directors and producers have to leave the audience depressed? After all, it should be gay ... not gloomy. Maybe the category should be changed into a 'dull' movie. A large percentage of gay relationships continues and the couples ride together in the sunset! No matter who writes or produces, he only shows the disadvantages of gay life and gives the wrong impression of a gay lifestyle. This movie just proves my point. If you borrow the DVD, take an antidepressant, because here comes another "gay" movie! That's wrong!
