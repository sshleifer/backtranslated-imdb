I saw this amazingly bad piece of "Anime" at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you need to see this thing, do it with a large audience, preferably after a few beers, and you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue hilarious, in my mind is the introduction of Cremator. The animation is terrible. It is poorly designed and poorly executed. It may have been a good idea for the producers to hire at least one person who was not colorblind. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to say, this film is a failure at every level.
