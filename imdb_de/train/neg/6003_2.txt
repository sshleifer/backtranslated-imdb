Sundown - with the weakest, stupidest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most unsuitable, presumptuous notes ever written - and with Shane the vampire, who was every move and every word spoken, it was so ridiculous that I broke loose half laughing and my role turned eyes the rest. <br /> <br /> The vampires seem to have no special powers at all - apart from the power (sometimes), the ability to turn off a lamp (once), and .. that's it really. Can you ever imagine Dracula being anxiously thrown back from a fight because he runs out of bullets? Neither do I. Virtually any other movie - Dracula would eat this for breakfast, skin his followers, and use their bones as toothpicks. <br /> <br /> The main principle of the film is that a four-headed human family gets caught fighting vampire gangs - Dracula against an old geezer. It could have been a good old B-flick fun, but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a little too seriously and ruined the rest of the movie, which was not ruined by mud bats and the ridiculous script. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just too stupid to be funny. Sure, it has some amusing moments, but they are few and far between.
