If you like movies like American Pie, Road Trip & Van Wilder; Avoid this cinematic rubbish at all costs. It's an unobtrusive, mean, bland resource waste that should never be discussed aloud. much less actually absorbed and sold to unsuspecting consumers. The worst movie I've seen in the last 18 months. Staggeringly bad for the entire 86 minutes of the runtime. If it had been much longer, I could not have written this review without profanity. Consider yourself warned!
