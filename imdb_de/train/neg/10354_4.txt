I rummaged through Netflix and stumbled across this movie. Since I liked to remember the book as a child, I decided to look at it. This is a movie that you should really pass on. <br /> <br /> It just is not worth seeing. It is very boring and uninteresting. I feel like it would be so for little kids. It has no magic that contains the book. This movie is not terrible, but you'll find that you do not mind after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> There are moments that just seem funny. The witch character is not very good. The family behaves as if it were no big deal for these strange things to happen. I know this is a kiddie movie, so as an older audience we should not look too deeply into things, but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any experience with that Filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Instead of trying to fix it, I simply turned it off and sent it back to Netflix for the DVD I skipped in the final moments of the movie. I really did not care how it ended. Skip this movie and read the book instead.
