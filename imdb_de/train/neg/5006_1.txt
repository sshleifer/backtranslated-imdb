Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only dislike each other, but also have little or no salvation qualities to make an audience or empathize with the characters. There are films that are so bad that they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter movies), and there are just bad movies (like 99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). This film is hard to take, even if you are a brilliant MSTie Riffer (eg Mystery Science Theater 3000). Luckily I'm quite talented in this regard (that's how my mind works "All The Time"). For those who are not naturally talented MSTie riffing, finally in "this * movie," you just want to take your own mind off. The movie "Taboo" painfully robs you for about an hour and twenty minutes and you will never return. Even my MSTie talents were barely equal to this slow, boring waste of time. The most puzzling thing about this movie is that * someone * is lit up and / or financed in green ... I only rented "Taboo" for the normally talented Amber Benson, who must have been blackmailed. I have another, lesser-known film of mine in my lending queue, the reviews I should read first. Ironically, the best aspect of the film was the imposing labyrinthine mansion for its inner location.
