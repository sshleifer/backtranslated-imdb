The fact that I saw the entire movie says something about it ... or about me. It is not a good movie. Terrible indeed. But terrible in the way that kept my attention in this perverse way that resembles a tragedy and can not look the other way. It would have made a great MST3K theme! <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make a horrible movie enjoyable are: bad dialogues, inappropriate music, fictitious action sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. They will be amazed by the slow death sequences, the poor open-mouthed and waaaaaaaaay too much time to consider their imminent doom, and face the outrageously born Redeemer of their death. Their hearts are warmed up by old clich√©s from the action scene, as if two women are fighting for a weapon, and it starts, but WHO IS SHOT? Both look at each other, then the others, then themselves, then (apparently 15 minutes later), one finally goes down. They sing (in Latin, of course) with the street-length characters who turn into a terrible death-song who for a moment threatened to turn the movie into a twisted musical. <br /> <br /> So if you think so, I think that as films get worse, they get better. Then this could be a decent choice for you. It's not as funny as my current science fiction hit "They Live" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch lukewarm movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 out of 10.
