This film raises a series of urgent questions in my mind. First, how has Jennifer Tilly managed to maintain a film career over the years based on that ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited spectrum of malicious facial expressions she uses? Second, what did people blame for thinking about this offensive and deeply repulsive movie? And third, given that there were people who were so perverted that they could choose to do such a mess, somebody should not have been in the system - the studio, the dealer, or somewhere - reasonable enough, to prevent it from actually being completed and released. You really need to go a very, very long way to make another movie that is as uncomfortable as this one ... and it's not even billed as a horror movie - which is considered legitimate in that respect. It certainly is. The film rolls from the beginning to the end in the sickest kind of insanity, violence and abuse and essentially has no redeeming qualities. I do not really support censorship (which I do not believe in) ... but I really can not see how anyone from such a movie could do anything positive.
