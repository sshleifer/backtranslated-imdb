Cold Blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. Capote coined the term "Nonfiction Novel" to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of this form was included in the script he co-wrote. Despite the fact that we were in the era of color film, Richard Brooks decided to present this film in black and white to underline both the clarity of the landscape and the grim story. This is the first problem with the TV remake - color changes the tone of the story. In addition, limiting filming for television reduces the possibilities of framing and focussing the recordings. As a result, we lose the dramatic conflict that makes the second part of the original film (interviews, trials, detention and execution) so claustrophobic. On the small screen, it's just another version of Law and Order spinouts. <br /> <br /> Hollywood's search for scripts continues to return to films that have been successful at another time. Usually this is a mistake, and this is no exception. <br /> <br /> All actors are competent. The script is fine. The director does not bother. It's just that the movie does not work as well as the original precision instrument. It does not hook the viewer into the ambivalence towards Smith and Hickock provoked by the original film. At the end of the TV version we have the feeling: "Ho hum, who cares?" <br /> <br /> First, watch the original on as large a screen as you can and then watch the TV version to easily understand why the first movie was such an important 1967 movie. <br /> <br /> It would not hurt to go online and read about Capote and the original book. It will help you to understand the extraordinary efforts he has put into the material, as well as some controversy surrounding the book and movie real bomb rankings - the kind that infuriates you into being sucked into the semen
