I do not know if this is one of the original movies from the SyFy channel, but that's exactly how it feels. A cheap, low-budget action movie that was probably shot very fast. It contains ridiculous effects, lame dialogue and a slightly faded star that gives it a degree of fame (funny how many 90210 kids are making cheap TV movies right now). <br /> <br /> Ian Ziering plays Cortes, whom we know from history as a researcher who eradicated entire indigenous populations while conquering parts of North America. Here he is not played as a hero or even compassion, but as a slimy opportunist; His character would probably be killed if it was not based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes is on a short survey mission and is trying to find something valuable to prove he deserves funding to explore America further. He and his men find a small tribe of Aztecs plagued by dinosaurs. The real hero of the story turns out to be Lt. Rios, who proves to be honorable, resourceful and wise. He knows how to do the right thing in every situation, which puts him against both Cortes and the young, ambitious shaman of the Aztecs. Of course, the native girl, who is supposed to marry the wayward shaman, falls in love with Rios and intensifies his anger at the Spanish outsiders. So it's all a clich√©. The dinosaurs are handled relatively easily. Although it takes place in an area that seems to be wide open, 95% of the story is played either in the forest or in the Aztec village, so it's not visually exciting either. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent, and somehow he disappeared inside. He does not look or does not listen to Spanish, which makes the casting choice wrong in every way. If this movie had been theatrically released, it would have been chosen for a Razzie, no question. <br /> <br /> All in all, unforgettable.
