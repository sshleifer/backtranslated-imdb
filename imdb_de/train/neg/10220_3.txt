First, this movie can be divided into three segments. A promising opening with the ambush of some Cheyenne cavalry. It follows what can only be described as a boring midsection, with the completely failed Candice Bergen and Soldier Blue traveling together to secure the security of an army garrison. Every time she opens her mouth, Miss Bergen spits out unsuitable four letters and looks like she's just come out of a 1970s Jack Nicholson movie. I mean, she has no interest, no credibility. The third and last section includes the totally voluntary slaughter of an Indian village. Obviously, it's obviously exaggerating to rely on anti-war propaganda to make it seem long, outrageous and invented. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's an idea. Why do not you really watch the movie you're commenting instead of twittering your liberal nonsense? This is not a political site, but for reviewing movies. - MERK
