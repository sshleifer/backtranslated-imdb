The wonderful "Z" channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora movie about six months after "Butterfly". I had such great hopes for the actress, and then she turns from bad to obviously bad in this film. <br /> <br /> Again, it was the 80s and I have to tell you that Harold Robbins work has been eclipsed by wiser writers. Jacqueline Susann nudged him (she hated his way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work attracted many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late '70s, early' 80s, and then Jackie Collins, the women's stronger and equals made men more than anything in their books, even more so. That's why this work smelled. Harold Robbin's work in the 1980s simply did not appeal to the audience. Pia Zadora, acting in one of Robbin's works, was as if throwing kerosene into a fire. The supporting cast was also no help. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... that was terrible to see and even 20 years later it looks even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and everything was shot when it was done. It would be hard for Pia to redeem herself as an actress (though John Waters cast her in "Hairspray"), though she has a beautiful singing voice. Hey, Pia, wherever you are. ..Hairspray can go on tour! Join the show. They are perhaps the biggest comeback story ever. <br /> <br /> I just hope they burn this movie for you if you do.
