I did not expect a movie to be as good as "In The Line of Fire" or an episode of "24", but it looked like this movie was made for television and at best did a mediocre job. The (good) cast could not hide the fact that the conspiracy was too predictable and the actors had to fight their bad scripts (they really try their best) by giving their rather flat characters some extras. When I saw the movie, I felt I had seen most of it in other (better) movies. In it there were chases, large shootings, romance novels, action changes etc. etc .; This movie has no. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see a woman talking to Cuba's character, you know who's behind all this and all the clues you're given ("You're too close to the president , see it from my point of view .. ") sounds stupid. <br /> <br /> If it were up to me (and maybe it is a good thing that it is not), I would describe the act as follows: <br /> <br /> First Lady ordered the murder to her husband because she is tired of constantly writing checks to Cuba.
