I should explain why I rated this ... "artwork" with 1 star of 10 points. Simply because it is difficult or almost impossible to evaluate it without bias. probably it would have been the same if I had given him 10/10 - explanations would have followed anyway. <br /> <br /> I do not like those pointless gore movies like HOSTEL or something like that - I think that's disgusting and pretty awful (in all sorts of contextual meanings), but as I found out when I saw this movie - There is a genre called "historical drama" - and probably it would have been the case of 10/10, as it has much of that and Tarantino would have been more than pleased (and made Kill Bill 3 shed even more blood on the screen than here to show that this is possible). The genre of "historical drama", however, is that it is a sub-category of "trash films" in which John Romero is the undead Gory emperor of the good and therefore can not automatically be classified as a standard movie - since this is movies that are purposely done badly and you can not really tell if that weird moment should be like this or just plain bad. It's for the people who like bad acting, bad script and everything else bad. And with a certain twist of faith - I am one of them too. There are days when I feel like seeing a really bad movie, looking for garbage and off you go - the day is saved! But that's definitely an opinion of me and does not agree with anyone else. <br /> <br /> What I meant to say is that if you want to watch a horrible movie, Casinova by Fellini is the right choice. but pay attention to my advice and do not rate it by default.
