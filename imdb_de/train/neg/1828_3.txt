I saw 'Envy' on DVD with a friend two nights ago. The premise of this film is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential, which, however, completely fails. I saw it with about five friends and nobody laughed throughout the movie. The jokes (which are very rare) are in no way funny ... the plot is crap and they never answer the question ... WHERE ARE THE SH * T'S GOING? Of course the answer is NO CARE. This film lacks comedy values, and as some other users have said, the only thing worth looking at is Christopher Walken as J-Man. None of the characters is developed, the actions are so thin that they are almost transparent - and is this song supposed to be funny throughout the movie?
