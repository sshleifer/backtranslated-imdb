I have no idea which director George Schlatter wanted to sell this comedy. With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to bring the entire 70s to the carpet, "Norman" plays like a blaxploitation image, combined with a series of silly sitcom episodes with weird misunderstandings, all too keep silent about an extended cameo of Waylon Flowers! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this story about an alienated couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) has learned how hard it is for their son to be secretly gay - and if he lives with a hoeing, prancing white homosexual - he has weakened enough jokes that embarrass any early episode of "Three's Company". Bailey retains her dignity, and Foxx's sheer confusion is good for a few giggles, but the rest of the cast is humbled. * from ****
