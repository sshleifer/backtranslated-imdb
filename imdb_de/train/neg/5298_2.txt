I rented this movie because in the horror film section I was looking for those films that nobody has heard of and that may be a gem. I saw that and because I'm a fan of violence and gore, I got it. It received the rating of EM, which means: Extremely mature. I thought that this rare and high rating was meant for violence and everything else. The warning on the box said: Extreme Violence, Extreme Long Eye and Nakedness. The "extreme violence" occurred to me. The film ended with a rather docile Slasher movie. It had one or two bloody scenes, but I've seen worse in a PG-13 movie. Of course, not only the amount of Gore in a movie counts, right? You also have action. Well, the plot was boring and nothing special. Do not rent it. I'm telling the truth. I can not imagine how anyone can really enjoy it until he says, "I'll rent it out again." There were moments when it kept you going, but I'll never see this movie again.
