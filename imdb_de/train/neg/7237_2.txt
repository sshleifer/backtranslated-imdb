Life is really too short for such films. I knew it could not be good when I realized what I had already guessed - that David Schwimmer would play exactly the kind of person he plays in Friends. <br /> <br /> Let's say that too The guy can only play a nerd, or he'll never be offered other parts. I feel like it's a mix of the two. <br /> <br /> And I have to say that it's extremely difficult to like a movie that totally wastes the considerable talents of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol Kane !!!
