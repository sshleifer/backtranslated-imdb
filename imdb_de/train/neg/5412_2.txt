Pyare Mohan can surely be included in the blacklist of one of the worst films of humanity. The film, one of the many disabled people who emerged after the phenomenal success of Black, makes the disabled community a mockery. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are caricatures of disabled people. While Black portrayed the emotions and emotions of a disabled woman and gave us an insight into her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being disabled and crushing half of the world in defense of their love interests. Anu Malik's music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi, who has made a promising start with Saathiya, loses his eggs quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan has never been an acceptable actor and deserves to be excluded from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty girls in distress who had nightmarish times in Thialnd and had no one to save them except for the desperados mentioned above. Boman Irani is reasonably acceptable as a malicious Don Toni. Avoid the movie if possible.
