Now is not it? With all the good work done by danzel, Clive, and Jodie, the movie never evolved into anything more than a dreadful Diecat / Heist movie imitation. Yes, a few jokes, no, absolutely no unpredictable twists, to be honest, the only unpredictable moments are there, because both director and publisher have made some stupid mistakes, it's a shame on them and a waste of time for us. If anyone can tell me why in the world a hole was dug in the vault, who the hell is the vine and how the hell did they know the diamonds were in that particular cell? Make a day, but it seems like Spike asks us to take too many things for granted in this case and not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid ... it's just another studio-contract movie, relax and enjoy ...
