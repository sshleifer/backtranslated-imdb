I never saw the original version of 1954 with Judy Garland, so there is no comparison. It has been a few years, but I found this story neither exciting nor fascinating. The film tells the story of two lovers whose musical career goes in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a worn-out, disillusioned rock star who is dying. He starts a romance with a fresh, talented new vocal, Esther Hoffman. Her dramatic success only underscores his decline. <br /> <br /> The main actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are appropriate in their roles, but neither their chemistry nor the plot left a big mark on me. The film is remarkable for one aspect only, Streisand's beautiful interpretation of the Oscar-winning song "Evergreen". She really has a powerful and great voice.
