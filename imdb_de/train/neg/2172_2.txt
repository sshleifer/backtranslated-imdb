Bottom of the barrel, unimaginative and virtually unsurpassed remake of THE ROAD WARRIOR. This film follows the exact plot like the Filipino movie STRYKER and is far worse! Bad action, dialogue, effects, dubbing, tempo, action sequences ... The list goes on and on. Italy made dozens of Road Warrior prints in the early 1980s, some good, some bad. This is by far the worst, not a competition. The mood of the film was not only bleak and miserable, the experience of sitting through this film is one and a half boring. At the beginning of the movie, there was 1 (a) good chase sequence, and a cool shot of a man exploding a hand grenade. But everything else about this movie stinks seriously! To really enjoy Nuke fun, look for a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER THE NEW YORK case, or ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX. They are much more pleasant than this garbage.
