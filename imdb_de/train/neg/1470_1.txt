I was looking for something in our DVD tower last night. We were between NetFlix mailings and it was a quiet Saturday night. I pulled out one I'd never heard of and realized he was being lent by a friend. From the jacket it sounded like a rip-off of "The Big Chill", but with the All-Star-Cast believed it was worth seeing. Boy, I was wrong !!! It was not just like "The Big Chill", it was a rip off, almost a sign of signs. The figure of Bill Paxton was a copy of the role of William Hurt ("Where have you been all this time?") - Spoiler Warning - and lo and behold, he stays behind to take care of the old place (cabin / warehouse) , Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; Jerk Womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc. etc. I was wondering why I even watch these people. There was not enough character development to interest me for them. How did "Unca Lou" find these characters after 20 years? Besides, it was not even funny, except when Perkins fell out of bed on the first morning, it was a sign and I missed it. After it was over, I asked my wife, "Was there any lovely characters in this movie? ... Do you sleep there?" She replied, "No, I still think ... no, I can not imagine any."
