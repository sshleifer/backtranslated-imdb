First To The 2003 <br /> <br /> First I admit my mistake: I did not know it was a TV movie. I was "dropped" by the "R" certification. The plot is strong, but the movie is about 40 minutes too long. The direction and continuity were excellent. The cast was mostly extraordinary and did a good job with their characters. The disadvantage of the movie is that it definitely falls into the genre "Chick Flick". Although there are some violent scenes, none of the violent acts should require an "R" rating. There are no nudity or unintended sex scenes. Actually, there are no sex scenes. Ona Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies were all guests of the SG-1 series, but this film has done nothing to advance their careers as they have all served as low-level actresses. Robert Patrick was amazing as he usually is, and Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern Lee Marvin. The very talented Megan Gallagher, whom I respected as an actress in the Millennium series, had no challenge to show her skills. The biggest disappointment with the cast was Tracy Pollan. Apart from being a below-average actress and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I muted the TV during their conversation. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in Lifetime TV programs. I would not recommend paying any money to watch this movie. Considering that I did not find anything that could trigger censorship, this is a movie that is only suitable for watching television on television, as nothing is cut out. As a TV movie, I would rate this as 5 out of 10 points. As a feature film with "R" certification and strong cast I rate him as 2 out of 10.
