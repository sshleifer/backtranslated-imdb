I had high hopes for this movie because I thought CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first film) was absolutely terrific, the safest low budget movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> But much of CLAIRE DOLAN is completely pointless and shallow. Scene by scene seems to be arbitrarily thrown into the mix without thinking much about narration or character. <br /> <br /> Is Claire trying to escape a prostitute or not? Hard to tell. Why is she taking the trick at the airport if she wants to escape this life? Why is not she getting tricks when she needs money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her dye her hair with the same color? Why does not Claire accept some underpants and others? The filmmaker does not seem to know. <br /> <br /> It feels like everything is improvised (though I know that was not the case) and the filmmakers just kept a camera on it as if they were making a camera Verite documentary. <br /> <br /> After the screening, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative decisions by condemning the film count as politically conservative. It sounded like learned rhetoric. I think it was a cop-out. <br /> <br /> I am sad that the creator of such an exciting film as CLEAN, SHAVEN would make such a lame film as this and then defend it with fatigue old "political" clich√©s.
