That may sound crazy, even for the people who remember this show ... But I remembered live action. I do not think I've ever seen the cartoon. but movie? could be. I remember that very well. The guy was in a building like a showroom. He even had the red jacket. It was dark outside and he turned into a red car, and this guy in the second level looked down at him. The car / guy turned around and rushed through the big shop window onto the street. And then drove off. That's all I remember. I really hope someone else remembers it. If not, I may still be crazy. But I hope I am not.
