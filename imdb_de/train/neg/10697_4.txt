At first I thought it was rude of them to say in the bracing that the story and the screenplay by Preston Sturges were. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until his talent waned and he retired. However, it was not the Preston Sturges, but Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was largely based on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story "The Bottle Imp". A good man comes into possession of an evil object that granted his every wish, but ultimately condemn him to hell. It's good. Nobody said screenwriters had to be original. The actors are generally quite competent, given the mediocre writing that she had to translate to the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the end. The hero believes he has found a way out of his dilemma, but tries to solve the problem in a slightly different way to save an innocent person. At first, this seems to have worked, but to be faithful to the code of the modern horror film. They feel like they have a final horror at the end of the movie. That's a stupid convention. The older horror movies did well that the hero could win in the end. There is nothing wrong with the fact that good triumphs over evil, no matter what the filmmakers' recent successes are. They can give the audience a good, healthy fear and still make the audience feel happy in the end. I think it's preferable.
