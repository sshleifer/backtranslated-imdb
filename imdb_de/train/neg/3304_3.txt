Greenthumb Grace has remained destitute after her husband's death, so she turns to Ganja cultivation to pay the bills. That sounds promising and the overly reliable Brenda Blethyn does not disappoint, but the material is sitcom-thin. There's actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener, "Give me one" (a tenth), and he thinks she's asking for sex and behaving awkwardly. Yes, it's humor, so a nun would get bored. Saving Grace does not seem to know what it's all about: breathtaking cinematography and stately tempo evoke memories of Ryan's Daughter, while the carefree whims of the country dwellers could be lifted from any episode of the Antiques Roadshow. It accelerates after the first hour, but until then it's too stereotypical to interest. The climax succeeds only by the introduction of the most shameless Deux ex Machina, which I have ever seen, unpredictable.
