That sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb. Nazis, occultism, conspiracies of the government. I was expecting a low-budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or the boys from Brazil or even shockwaves. Instead, you get something very different from David Lynch, more psychological. That was actually a plus. But the way the story is told is terrible. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is casting. Andrienne Barbeau's character starts a little motionless and anxious. She just does not do it well, even at her age, though she certainly tried. The actor, who was cast as a son, apparently took this as a comedy. Most other actors also seemed to believe that this was a combat movie, or at least that was what they did, rather than just being quirky. The only one I thought was really good was the daughter Siri Baruc. <br /> <br /> Another big part is the pace. It starts very slowly. So slowly you might be tempted to turn it off. But then it becomes captivating for a while when you come to the daughter's suicide and the consequences of it. But soon after, everything becomes a mess. Some of it was deliberate, but much of it was just unnecessarily confusing, monotonous and badly focused. It's slow, boring, none of the characters is sympathetic. Overuse of pictures and sets. In some movies that you see, characters are tormented. In this case it is the viewer. There are a few scary moments, especially the creepy Nazi images and the credits, but the rest of the movie is usually boring.
