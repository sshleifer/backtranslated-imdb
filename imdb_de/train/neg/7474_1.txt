This program did not do it for me, even though I'm a fan of the genre. The main factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene that was not dominated by the main character. This made it a bit two-dimensional and I gave up before the program was over. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to leave my criticism there because I'm not a film critic. However, the IMDb policies indicate this. You must insert 10 comment lines. It reminded me of Hudson Hawk, as the main character in every single scene, and I hope that the authors of this program can use a bit more diversity to interact with the audience. I do not doubt the talent of a cast and crew, it's just that after watching things like "The Wire," I'd expect great things from a police drama.
