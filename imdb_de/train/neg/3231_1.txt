In this movie, many people seem to say it's one of the most brutal of all time. Having just looked at it, I can say that it does not live up to these demands. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is indeed crazy. But overall, the execution was not worthy. Even the last scene (the eyeball thing) is not really bad. I had expected something crazy, instead it was of lower quality than films like the extremely low budget Violent Sh! T. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a real movie will be disappointed there is no story at all (though most people will surely know that). Gore fans will be disappointed, as the blood and guts, contrary to belief, are rare. Not to mention that the actress who plays the victim could be one of the worst in the story. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what people say, this movie is not so shocking, it's just crap. Avoid it.
