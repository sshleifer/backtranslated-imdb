Do not let this movie borrow you. It has nothing to do with a death row escape, despite the title. I can not say anything good about the movie. Bad acting, bad editing, bad directing ... ridiculous "action" and the sound / music were so irritating, it's a miracle that this movie is not provided with a warning. The only way to go through and enjoy this film is its historical cheesiness. They just do not make movies that bad anymore.
