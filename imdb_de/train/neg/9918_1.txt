Another British movie flag. Here is real garbage again. I can not understand (and I am British) why this was exaggerated, patriotic nonsense. Eight years mark since the end of the Second World War! Other commentators here have reported editing and seemingly seamless use of archive material. This is extremely poorly observed. The archive material is in abundance. Model airplanes swing from wires in the action scenes like so many children's kites in the wind. The usual map room sequences tattoo the film to us supposedly into the whole Malta event. Guinness has to have his worst acting performance. The shocking Back Dog fight scenes are ridiculous. Hawkins bores us to death in the card room area. Ealing has made many great films. This is clearly not one of them. They should have kept away from such unconvincing rottenness!
