I own almost every Seagal movie (yes, even those on a low budget), and I have to say that this can be the worst, not just of his films, but of all the films ever made. The only highlight of this movie and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it's Seagal, and B. Seagal has some cute action sequences, especially in the store, and even if he does something takes a whole army out with a knife. Next time, give me 90 minutes to kill people in Seagal, and do not care about a story, because the action did not only stink, but also the acting, the fact that F-18 and F-14 somehow in F - have transformed. 16s, and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an F-16. Even the stealth never had to refuel ??? And since when is Afghanistan from the point of view of the Air Force as enemy territory. When I last checked, Afghanistan has no air force, we (USA) control the sky. This top secret mission was also played through the speakers of the entire crew in the room. The admiral still whispers to the other that it is secret. And how did Seagal get from the truck bed to the truck bed? Please tell us why they detained him. Since when are Air Force pilots large commands (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since when are their drunks in Arab countries when Muslims do not drink alcohol? And besides, since when do Arabs hear orders from women like the # 2 officials? The highlight of the film was definitely Seagal, who killed the people in the shop, and the other 50 people he had killed with a knife, and the very short and completely random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere.
