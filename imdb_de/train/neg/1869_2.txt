Veteran Sleazeball Bruno Mattei is back with this erotic thriller that clearly reflects Joel Schumacher's 8MM. But as expected, Mattei makes his film on a tiny budget - so it already appears dark at its release. <br /> <br /> After her daughter was kidnapped, a mother enters the dark world of underground pornography because The Kidnappers is part of an international organization that manages snuff films as long as the exclusive customers pay well. The search for her daughter not only leads the mother across Europe, but also into prostitution. She goes to bed with some boys to get her hints. When she finally gets in touch with the snuff organization of the mysterious Doctor Hades, she herself is in grave danger. <br /> <br /> There is not much good to say about them, even if they are promising. The problem is that the movie is not nearly as bleak or explicit as one would expect from the director who made films like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (first released in Russia!) Is neither bloody enough nor does it contain the amount of nudity and sex to really hold the viewer's attention. The plot is not special, except perhaps for the surprising number of different locations across Europe. The end is very disappointing. Acting is not really remarkable, with the exception of Anita Auer, who plays Doctor Hades: She looks very scary and behaves like that. You do not want to meet her in a dark alley (or in your bedroom). <br /> <br /> All in all, SNUFF TRAP only appeals to collectors of Bruno Mattei's films. But it's nice to see the man back at the wheel: it was his first thriller since 1994, Giallo GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
