The British heritage film industry is out of control. There is nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why do they all have to be filmed by talentless nobodies? This film breaks Orwell's hard novel and turns it into a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. While "aspidistra" may not be Orwell's best work, no one who reads it can forget the great portrayal of poverty. Orwell stresses not only the cold and the hunger, but also the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a bleak, gray, cold, heartless city, and Comstock prays for it to be destroyed by a bomber squadron. However, this movie ironed out anything that might be offensive in any way, and instead creates a fun nostalgic trip to charming 1930s London, where everything is lit up with golden sunshine and even the slums of Lambeth are scruffy and freshly scrubbed happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems about the sharp wind blowing through the garbage-strewn streets seem out of place in this world of chocolate boxes. Worst of all is the ruthless bonhomie of the script, old jokes and clapping dialogues. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the movie is full of great actors. But it's not about anything. This movie made me so angry! British literary history is proud of its wealth, its complexity and its power. And what do we do with it? We use bland nobodies to turn it into soft-centered, anodyne pap for people who want to feel like they're getting some culture while drinking their horlicks and quietly nodding.
