Despite a sizeable first season, this series could hardly recognize their potential. A precursor to the original "Star Trek" series, he was almost doomed to failure from the outset by an executive producer, Rick Berman, who was forced to artificially add the definition of what a "Star Trek" series might be limit and limit This futuristic show is becoming increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic point of view. The actual show runner, Brannon Braga, did not help with his uninspired and tired repetition of earlier Trek episodes and the negligent disregard for the franchise's internal mythology (it was painful early on that he was only there for the paycheck). I've never seen a series that has served a cast of talented actors (except Jolene Blaylock) for so long. It's as if this whole series had been produced in a bubble that exists outside the contemporary television landscape, where the audience (even a trekker audience) is more demanding and demanding in their dramatic desires and desires. Unfortunately, it seems Berman and Braga have succeeded in convincing the Paramount elders that "Enterprise" has suffered from "franchise fatigue" and that the core audience has not gone away but been driven out. Produce a quality offer that meets the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they (the audience) will come. <br /> <br /> Simply said, in a TeeVee universe where we get shows like "Battlestar: Galactica" and "The Shield," the rulers have to give the watching audience a "Star Trek," the is measurable and dramatically competitive, it's just so straightforward and easy.
