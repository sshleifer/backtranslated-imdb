Ok, here's the basic plot. It's 1933, Peter Sellers is Dr. Fu Manchu, a 168 year old Chinese who has lived for a long time. The movie begins with his birthday celebrating by drinking a special elixir that (even the movie never mentions it) prolongs his life. On this occasion, the Elixir is awkwardly dropped by an assistant (Kato, if you remember the Pink Panther movies), and he orders his henchman to find 6 rare items to make the elixir. This leads to a worldwide hunt for humans, in which his followers steal museums of diamonds and go to London to meet Dr Fu's Nemisis, a retired Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith, to be a funny comedic adventure. <br /> <br /> This was apparently the last full-length feature film by Sellers that he shot before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he was there. Vendor who is such a gifted comedian and has played a memorable "funny" role in the Panther films, and especially in the movie "The Party," is anything but film-based. This movie was an absolute ordeal to sit through, and I could not even finish it. He absolutely has DIES and I flinched while seeing Sellers performance. After coming from the great work of 'Being There' a year ago, how can I say, HOW can he do that and HOW did this thing actually work? As mentioned by one person, the first 10.15 minutes are fine, but then it's ALL ON THE ROAD ... <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Rating 1 from 10.
