I was looking forward to this ride and was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I am very much amused at rollercoaster and amusement park rides. <br /> <br /> The roller coaster part was just fine - and that was about 30 seconds of a 90-second ride. <br /> <br /> It was visually boring and badly executed. <br /> <br /> It desperately tried to be a mix of the far superior Indiana Jones and Space Mountain Rides and Disneyland, and failed in every way. <br /> <br /> It was neither exciting nor exciting in the least.
