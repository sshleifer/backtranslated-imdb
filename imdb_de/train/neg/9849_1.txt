This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It's bad, even on TV movie level. The plot is devilishly flawed and the familiar names in this movie are wasted on confused, insecure characters. I do not know how the director could hold this excuse for a movie together - that's how bad it is. Billed as a "Psychological Horror Thriller" - it's certainly terrible. There is nothing exciting about it. And it could do you mental harm! The first opening scenes were so promising - a possible assessment of whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain, but the ultimate confusions that followed the car accident scene are unimaginable. No matter how hard you try, you can not care less about the characters. There are so many sprayed ideas that the film is at best a collage of disparate phrases of Chinese philosophers, and in the worst case, the movie would actually lead to Brain Dead! <br /> <br /> I bought over 300 movies on DVD and this is the FIRST to get my money back. STEER CLEAR.
