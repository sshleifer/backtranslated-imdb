American films about war and Nazis just can not be good. You can not refrain from becoming an idiot and following an agenda. All Nazis are evil, crazy, too proud, and the Americans are so modest, yet so capable and reasonable and humane. Come on, stop this bullshit. The main character says something like "through this process we have to turn the aggressive war into a crime". Is America a peaceful nation with a "defense" budget of $ 420 billion (# 2 China with only $ 51 billion)? Is it simply issued without ... ROI? Why should America be portrayed as a peaceful nation if this is not the case? I deeply hate films that have an agenda - they throw art to hell and try to convince us to believe something. Hollywood should give films a label, just as record companies have the "parenting advice label." We should have a Bullshit Advisory, Propaganda Advisory, or a Politically Correct Advisory label in some movies. This is one of them.
