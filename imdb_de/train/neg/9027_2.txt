Revenge on us the audience maybe. I sat through this 2-hour movie and waited for the second act to make the movie live up to its title. But Costner never avenges the fate of his lover, she dies and the movie ends. I wondered where the rest of the movie was. If a movie is called "Revenge," the hero should get some at the end of the movie. I had the choice to see this or Black Rain in the cinema. Luckily I saw the movie of the other brothers in the cinema instead. There was a good thing about the movie and it was the beautiful theme tune. Listen to the CD. See how awful this is. 1 out of 10
