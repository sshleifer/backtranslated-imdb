Every knee should bow under the name of Pinter - especially after his Nobel Prize speech, which was little more than a rebuilt, anti-Americanism of the sixth form produced according to the numbers. But that is worse; It's not just a tour-de-force of non-talent, an excellent example of how you can enjoy your decades-old reputation, but also the slaughter of a superb piece. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theatrical make-up, and it's easy to see how the central plotter would work better on stage than the screen, but it still worked well. This is a Michael Caine vanity piece, but let's face it, Caine is not an Olivier. Not only can he not fill Larry's shoes, he can not even fill his bathing shoes. The appropriately named Caine is after all a decidedly average actor whose only real recommendation, like so many British actors, is their longevity in the business. He was a good Harry Palmer, excellent in Get Carter, but that's your lot, buddy! Give it a very wide bow and stick to the excellent original. This is more like a half pinter.
