To be as honest as I can, is The Devil's Plaything (or Veil of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or Black Sister's Curse or The Movie has a good prerequisite behind it? The resurrection of a long-dead vampire by the Body of a descendant with the help and support of a group of black-clad women - but the execution is terrible - there are big, long screen-time moments when literally nothing happens Characters are just standing around and have nothing to do There is no mystery, no Excitement and no plot points to worry about, the drama is just miserable Acting is usually a group of below-average looking women who dance naked while staring at the camera, which they do over and over again. And what a bit of conspiracy there seems to be to nude more of these less than attractive women come so they can join in the dancing. It's not as bad or meaningless as dancing or doing something like Orgy of the Dead, but it's getting closer.
