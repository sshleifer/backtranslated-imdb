I only gave this movie 2 stars, because Dominic Monaghan really did his show. Everything else about this movie is extremely amateurish. Everything that had to do with directing this movie was done very badly. The director should not only think about what makes her a career in life, but maybe she should also watch a few movies. Since Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, the movie makes him terrible in this movie. Who the "actor" was who would have played, Jack's best friend would never have been allowed to step in front of the camera. I did not expect much from such a small movie, but maybe a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their environment. Do not waste your time or money on this movie (as I did), you will be very disappointed.
