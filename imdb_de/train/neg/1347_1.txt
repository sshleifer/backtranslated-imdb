Inspector Gadget was probably my favorite cartoon of the 80s. I enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series and the 1992 Christmas Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas. Some gadget fans are quick to criticize the show's second season (1985), but have to compare it to DiC's 2002 release of "Inspector Gadget's Last Case: Claw's Revenge". You'll find the second season is absolute gold. <br /> <br /> As a gadget fan, I could not resist the opportunity to see the animated Inspector gadget in something other than Gadget Boy. I bought the film and swore I was objective. I knew that sometimes artistic freedom was taken from the original series. I was not even prepared for what I wanted to see. <br /> <br /> There was hardly any part of the original show that was still intact. <br /> <br /> Here is a short list of some The disadvantages of this film: * The humor is absent in the original series. <br /> <br /> * Penny and Brain (originally as a gadget almost equal part of the series) are missing in the action for fifteen to twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> * The original music by Saban & Levy is missing, and the score is below average. (Mind that Saban now has his own production company, but at least "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" had good music, even without Saban.) * Do not expect to see gadgets that make the show as appealing as gadget - copter, gadget-brella, gadget mallet, gadget coat (which was actually used but not even named the same) as well as his usual other caps and handsets. In this film his gadget legs were telescopic instead of feathers. Such things annoy true fans of the show and are simply not necessary to change them. <br /> <br /> * The Gadgetmobile from the original series is now a fast, supposedly "hip" convertible. All fans of the original series enjoyed the gadget mobile, which turned into the gadget-van, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * Chief Quimby is now very much throttled and even mean for Gadget. He was always grumpy in the original series, but that pushes the situation a bit. <br /> <br /> * Penny does not have a computer book anymore. <br /> <br /> Are there any positive effects for this movie? ? OK, here we go ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche does a good job as Inspector Gadget for the great Don Adams. <br /> <br /> * In one scene, Chief Quimby plays To a real villain from the animated series: The Great Wambini (classic "gadget" fourth of the season, voiced by Louis Nye). <br /> <br /> Are you looking for other redeeming factors for this film? Well, you are out of luck. Life is about making decisions and living off those decisions. Most situations in life have meaning, even when it comes to teaching a lesson. The lesson we learned here: stick to the original formula! "If it is not broken, do not fix it." Real gadget fans should stay away from this movie. You will surely be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hopefully DiC and Shout! Factory will release more series from the original series following the release of "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" with the first 22 episodes of the 2006 series. As a true gadget fan, lover of 80s animations and many DiC programs, I'd like to encourage you as a viewer to buy "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" DVDs are excellent and sure to return good memories.
