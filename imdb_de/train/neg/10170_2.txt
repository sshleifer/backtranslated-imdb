The championship game is only a few days away, but things in New Orleans are not what they should be. From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to deadly killers, life stands in the way of a memorable, wonderful time. Can things be fixed and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined? <br /> <br /> Despite what you think when you read Superdome for the first time, this is not a football movie. In fact, football is nothing more than a plotter and reflection. Instead, Superdome is another of those lousy soap operas made in the '70s populated with Hollywood, and those that will never exist. The Cast Sleep goes its way through it without anyone looking really good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role, which is generally lost, why he is there. The plot is boring, uninteresting and unbelievable. Donna Mills as a hit "man"? Yes exactly! It's about as believable as the affair she has with the drink soaked in David Jansen. The movie also lacks any tempo. Attempting to bring all four or five storylines into the film zaps the flow possible from Superdome. Without drama or excitement Superdome is a bad example of a television movie from the 70s. The only highlight for me was the voice-over work of the late Charlie Jones - a sportscaster I miss. The eloquent way he overestimates the intrigue and outperforms the New Orleans atmosphere is pure cheese at its best. Like most of the others who saw Superdome, I did that with Mystery Science Theater 3000 as well. It may be one of the KTMA Public Access episodes, but it's one of the best examples of the early start of the shows. Even though I only rated Superdome at 2/10, I give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
