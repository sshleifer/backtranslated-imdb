I start to see a pattern in the movies that I give a 1. It's almost all the movies that my wife showed me. Maybe I should stop trusting her movie taste. In any case, this is a typical dizziness that is aimed at older girls, but even worse than usual. Once again, the author broke the cardinal rule of a movie. He / she has made the main character unlikely. She begins by initially having a complete relationship with her friend, and then, when she turns 30, she learns that she is basically a nice person (with affairs, etc.). Why do we feel for this person? OK, let's say that we can overcome that. Jennifer Garner is so far from being attractive without having any form of deformity. I do not know if it's up to her or the author, but her character goes way beyond my threshold. Here is a tip for future filmmakers: 13-year-olds are NOT entertaining, they annoy. The most embarrassing moment of the movie was by far, as they danced to "thriller". Holy crap that hurt. It showed how she practiced this dance in the beginning. That explains why she knows, but a whole club full of people?!? Argh !!! The Macarena would be more believable! Suddenly she is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do her job, and nobody notices it? At least Tom Hanks's character on "Big" had a job that made sense for a child. These Body-Switching / Child-Aight Movies are getting out of hand and this is by far the worst.
