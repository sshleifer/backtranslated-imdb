It was 1974 and it was Martin Sheen in the lead role. <br /> <br /> That alone tells you what to expect from this movie. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the film Slovik had reformed, got a good wife and did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik was perhaps a naive innocent or he just wanted to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> Whoever Slovik was or not decides on the story, but this was a movie that dealt with dessert, when a country questioned why it was fighting and the movie took pages. <br /> <br /> Regardless of soldiers who were in Vietnam in 1974 (as Willie Nelson would say, let's tell the truth, it was about the Vietnam War, not World War II), EoES was as propagandist as Gung Ho was in the forties. <br /> <br /> According to this film Slovik explained his position quite simply. He had a nervous problem. Heck, I have a clinically nervous disease and trust me. Had I done a military service, it would not have been a problem for me either to let go of my nerves and fail my duties and cause a downgrade or take over KP or latrine duty without any problem. <br /> <br /> If we believe in the phone, Slovik did not have that option, no doubt because of its criminal history. Whatever the viewer wants to believe lies with the viewer. I've learned that movies from this decade or decade are always taking the same stance on service or military service. The 40s and 50s serve your country /> <br /> 1960s and 1970s, mock your country. <br /> <br /> This is the story. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seemed to me to be predictably Hollywood. He refused to serve and only when he was arrested for execution, he shows feelings. <br /> <br /> Such an emotional outburst could easily have led to his advantage in determining his nervous condition, but obviously the movie was about to show him as a human and only when he wants to die does he become sad. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Catholic, but I thought of the recital of Mary, of Ned Beatty and in the end, Sheen was weird with the Lord's prayer because it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster. I do not see how this movie can be viewed without knowing that this is the case addressed to Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope it has paid off for Slovik and everyone who wanted to follow his example.
