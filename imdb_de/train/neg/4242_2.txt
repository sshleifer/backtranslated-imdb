Men, I love police films full of action, shooting, chases. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed after seeing this short and unsatisfactory movie. We've seen it all before, the hostages, the bank, the area ... Two bad guys firing off several officers and innocent people who just stay in the line of fire - without being hit by Kevlar. <br /> <br /> Not just a few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Back to the bench where the mute hostages barred neither the safe nor the doors as the bad guys went out. How stupid did the director think we were. <br /> <br /> Okay, the interim recordings of this fake documentary were good, but after watching the movie, the only thought that came to my mind was, why did not the police get a decent shooting class? And why were there so many policemen and SWAT was on a really long break. Really bad.
