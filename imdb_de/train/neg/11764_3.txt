I have to say that I was really looking forward to watching this movie and finding a new life in it that would separate it from the most boring and over-built Mexican films. I have no idea why, but I trusted that Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas are the ones who bring freshness and confidence to our nonexistent industry. Maybe it was because the soundtrack (which I saw before the movie) sounds different from others, maybe because he dared to include and, more recently, newer faces (aside from Demian Bichir, which is always a favorite with Mexican movie directors) In his script of modern social behavior, the photography I saw in the trailers might be bright and realistic rather than theatrical. The film proved to be a big crowd pleaser and a big flop. What Serrano actually treats here is the very old-fashioned "Battle of the Sexes," as in "All Men Are Equal" and "Why is it that all women ...?" bla bla bla. Nothing new, not even that, it uses so many similarities and clichés that it eventually mocks itself, without the female / male state is reflected valuable. Many usual trample on the audience, like safe gags about the clichés that I've talked about before (which always work, always) and screaming performances (it's a well-rehearsed movie in its context) .. and by screaming I mean literally. The initially more convincing characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turn out to be the miserable ones after Serrano. I do not completely agree with Serrano. They should not have been treated like that just to serve as a puppet for his lesson ... He made sure we got his message and completely destroyed their roles, which was the only reason this happened. In any case, it is sometimes a very entertaining movie, and you will probably have a good time to see it (if you agree to be manipulated by it).
