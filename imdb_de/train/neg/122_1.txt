I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category "unbeatable garbage"! There are movies that are bad, but the worst is the ones you can not beat, but you like them because they are good for you! The sex sequences, which were so shocking back then, could not even arouse a rabbit. The so-called controversial politics is the amateur Marxism of the amateur night. The film is self-consciously artistic in the worst sense. The photograph is held in a coarse-grained black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or shot from a wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art? <br /> <br />
