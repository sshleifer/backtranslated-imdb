I saw this movie at its premiere in Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hope for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. From countless films I've seen in nearly a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I wanted to go out of. <br /> <br /> Towelhead's Worst Problem Is Obviously, there is a collection of "provocative" concepts that relate to cultural stereotypes, rather than an organic human drama. The script comes from the novel by Alicia Erian. I remember the famous quote from Edith Wharton: I never knew a novel that was good enough to be good, even though it was adapted to the author's political views. This observation is particularly devastating for Towelhead because their political views are so outdated and simple. If there was ever a time when Towelhead's white male villains, condescending blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc. were fresh, then it's long gone. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed description, see one of the many professional reviews available online. Almost everyone rates this film badly and exposes the superficial and manipulative fabric it is based on. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, hobby reviewers seem to be more confused. When you read the reviews on this and similar websites, you often come across superlatives: "breathtaking", "breathtaking", "profound", "shocking" ... It embarrasses me to read them, but not surprisingly me. In fact, I have met many people who seem to regard any book or film that deals with race, culture, gender or sexual issues as deeply moving, thought-provoking and with deep insight. If you are such a person, definitely hire Towelhead and be moved by it. If you set higher standards, you can safely pass them on.
