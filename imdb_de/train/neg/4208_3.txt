Below the surface of the layers on the cheeses lurks a really good movie that is "Pagemaster". <br /> <br /> I found this out when I saw it again this morning after years of neglecting it. I remember that I hated it with a passion when it first came out, but this time I found out that the special effects are pretty good. The storyline is simply "the never ending story" with a creative endoscopy, but for anyone who just wants a really great eye candy, it's a good little movie. The animation is amazing, and I especially liked the animators making their characters seem more surrealistic than usual. I give him a grade of three because * I * (for parody values ​​only) would have given a two, if I'd ever decided to watch this movie, expecting him to absolutely destroy me in terms of story.
