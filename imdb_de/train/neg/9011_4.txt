Pretty normal B-movie. Anyone watching with Dean Cain's "Dragon Fighter" and a group of people making their first movie should know better than to expect real quality or even moderate intelligence. There are B movies to revise formulas that are popular. If you even give them a token analysis, ruin the movie for yourself (and maybe write an important, libelous review on IMDb). <br /> <br /> I liked the female lead, Kristine Byers. She had charisma and I found her remarkably attractive. It was a memorable B-movie appearance. Unfortunately, I do not see where she has filmed since then. I will take care of her again.
