I saw this movie while I liked the action. A group of strangers are held captive to find out how they are connected. <br /> <br /> The setting and premise were obviously influenced by the first (and best) influence. I saw a movie and although there was not much action, the story moved at a relatively good pace. <br /> <br /> There was a comedy relief in the form of the two quarreling "Alpha Men" and it was a welcome surprise (for me to see anyway) Melissa Joan Hart has not given up acting yet. <br /> <br /> A few things have personally disappointed me; 1. The pedophile was far from stimulating anything, from children to dead bodies. <br /> <br /> 2. MJH's line about her ex-cop who made her enter the cause, even though he was in fact the least-deserved person who had been there, and he did not knowingly admit it contributed to the events that led to her arrest. The end ..... what kind of movie is ending in the middle of the action? There was no resolution, no cliff hanger, no obvious ending ... it just ends. <br /> <br /> And for that alone I have taken two stars from my rating. The first 2 points I would slide but not the end!
