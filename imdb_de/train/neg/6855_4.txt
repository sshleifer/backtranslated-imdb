Why can not a woman be a strong figure in a movie without sleeping with the captain? The campaign manager in this movie dreams of leading Tom Sellick to the White House. It's all she can think about. So why on earth did she have to have an affair with him? She added nothing to the plot and served only to humiliate successful women. The only value of this treat was the cute scene "We all slept with your husband". <br /> <br /> Did not the people who made this film also see the national conventions they spoofed? The charisma between the two major political conventions has only shown that they are completely unaware of the nomination and selection process.
