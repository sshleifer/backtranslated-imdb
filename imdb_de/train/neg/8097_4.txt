Considered by many critics as one of the greatest stinkers of all time (certainly the biggest stinker of the career of director Brian De Palma). Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a self-satisfied, rich boy whose life goes to hell when he and his lover Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a hit. His story is recorded by another complacent guy, reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). Well, as I said in my summary ... What's this movie about? His? It seems to combine comedy, drama and satire, but it certainly does not make much difference. It is undermined by unimaginably horrible, one-dimensional characters you never want to meet in misfortune. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of the novel (I started to read it once, but I could not finish it because I did not like it), but it's obvious to me that those who have enjoyed the novel, consider this film a complete travesty. <br /> <br /> I've never been! So many talented actors are trying hard to give a substandard movie a touch of quality and failure. What a waste. <br /> <br /> The problems begin with the casting of nice Tom Hanks in a role that is clearly considered a UN sympathizer. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a Briton. Bruce Willis is bad, BADLY miscast in the role. What was the thought there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even Morgan Freeman can not escape the movie with its intact dignity, and after the climax, has to hold a lame, lumbering talk about 'decency'. <Br /> <br /> This movie becomes an absurd farce. <br /> <br /> I liked the accumulation of talent; I'll give four out of ten for that, but I'm sure some people will say that a MUCH better movie could be made from the source material.
