In some ways, it's like "The Wizard of Oz," with Paris in black and white and the Riviera in color. Presumably, however, it is about possessive love, destructiveness and moral decadence. Actually, it's all about designer clothes, recordings of the Riveria, many expensive big cars, and music and dance interludes that suggest Vincente Minnelli at one of his off-days. Watchable, but a notable example of desperate, dark plot material and glittering style that moves in opposite directions. (Was this the model for 'The Talented Mister Ripley? Does anyone have an affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
