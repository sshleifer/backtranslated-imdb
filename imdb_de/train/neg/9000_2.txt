When I rented it, I was hoping for what "Reign of Fire" did not deliver: a clash between modern technology and mythical beasts. Instead, I got a standard "monster chasing stupid people in a secluded building," with bad script, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad drama. Bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him a 2 was that theoretically worse movies could exist. In theory.....
