I had to see that, because it looked like a big eerie premise - prisoners who find a magic book, oo err! Claustrophobic terror ensues, etc. <br /> <br /> but there did not seem to be any story for the great idea. Instead of calming down / physcological horror, it was based on outdoor effects and on OTT body horror that were not afraid of your over 12 year olds. <br /> <br /> The logic in the end is ridiculous with characters being killed for nothing more than body counting. Waste of good characters - that was the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously low budget, which does not bother him, the movie is really going nowhere, and I think I'll say it needs a Hollywood remake. You simply lose interest in this version. definitely not in the same league as other French films released in recent years, such as purple rivers that were at least watchful / entertaining. Malefique is not visible until the end, to be honest. and I bet you can guess the end before you've seen the movie. Really disappointing - impossible to recommend.
