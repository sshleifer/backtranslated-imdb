Dick Foran and Peggy Moran, who were so good at THE MUMMY'S HAND, return for this very small Universal Horror offering. But this time, instead of having Wallace Ford as the comedy buddy "Babe," we get Fuzzy Knight as a stupid buddy named "Stuff." But the results are far from being so charming and the level of anxiety is virtually nil. Dick is a businessman who comes up with the idea to lead a treasure hunt on a remote island within a creepy old castle. Peggy is a gang who comes along on the journey. But there's a big, skinny John Carradine lookalike with a black cape and a big hat known as "The Phantom," who throws down the party to pursue the buried fortune himself. This "phantom" is not very secretive, and no effort is made to even try to keep his rather average face in the shadows to create tension or haunting. It's always nice to see the cheery Moran, but otherwise you can see this as one of Universal's immediately forgotten dropouts.
