Although the actors work convincingly at the losers moving across the screen, I could focus on my watch only 20 minutes after the movie (and more than once after) due to the fact that these characters can not be identified. The plot's development is incoherent and slow, the verbal diarrhea of ​​the main character's only friend is virtually unbearable, the basic quality of most of the character's actions and the carefree manner in which they are treated is annoying. <br /> <br /> It's typical for Ventura Pons to produce stark, mentally handicapped characters. However, this sociological faux analysis is a big step forward from CARICIAS or Caresses, where the characters abusive and despise for well-founded reasons that arise during the film. In AMOR IDIOTA, we are forced to follow the movements of a truly subnormal intelligence, while pursuing a severely depressed and distanced woman. It's probably because of his own depression, but the script does not support that. I will not pass on the rest of the story just in case there are masochists? Is he healed by his obsession or is the woman shocked by her unwavering attention from her own depression? Although I looked at the whole thing, I was not interested in one of them for a moment. <br /> <br /> If you have all these prejudices, ignorance, betrayal, BAD dialogue, weak philosophy, etc ?? The camera work was pretty good and seems to be something of the DOGMA group. The make-up also seemed to be aimed at showing these players in a rough and crisp light, as the worst thing is that I have not seen Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of her films (while she's personally attractive). <br /> <br / I think if the idea is that we will be forced to see the lower layers of society so that we are grateful that we are not part of it, then Pons has achieved its goal. The flood of almost identical sex scenes was a real waste of film (if the actors had been filmed, but once in blue-green clothes, the background behind it could have been altered for a taste in the Special Effects Studio). While it is true that I have heard the male audience rolling in their seats, an objective consideration proves that this was not the actual goal of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Save and look at something else.
