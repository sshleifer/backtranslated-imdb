Although THE FLOCK has a pretty good drama of veteran Richard Gere and some good shots that some can trace back to the time of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, the film takes credibility to the limit and destroys a conspiracy that really Nowhere Goes br /> <br /> The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere), who works for the security department preparing for retirement. In his office, he encounters his successor, Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, STARDUST), who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his job. And that's no fun. He oversees hundreds of sex offenders who are on probation in his jurisdiction. Allison makes many calls with Erroll to review his "herd" of criminals and learns that he needs to retire urgently. But Erroll is good at his job, even if his methods are not. He mocks sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. Erroll justifies his actions by addressing the past of these deviants. It is this "good justification" that challenges audiences on some level to show us how brutal Erroll is and how notorious he has become (being too close to his job). <br /> <br /> When a young girl disappears into Erroll's "field", he immediately concludes that she was abducted by one of his herds. But how could he know? Is Erroll so good at his job? Allison challenges him and Erroll pushes back. Their battles become as violent as Erroll's need to find this missing girl. <br /> <br /> Although the set-up for the story was alright, it did not have a catch! I owe Richard Gere, who plays the Erroll character very well. Fight retired. Worried about anyone who is near his herd. Disgusting with those for whom he is responsible. Disgusting about himself because he has to do some things he does. A fairly different character representation for Gere. But behind him there is not much else. Some of the sets are fine (dark and dangerous), but there are so many other problems to be laughable. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit that the lifting of unbelief is a prerequisite when watching movies. But this suspension has limits. The biggest step against these borders is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital crime scenes. Someone as meticulous as Erroll would KNOW that moving a body would be a big no-no. Or trample through a crime scene. Or move evidence. It went beyond the film and hurt the movie without end. <br /> <br /> The other damaging part of this movie is that we never get into the role of Clair Danes, Allison. She almost fell by the wayside at the end of the film, and we never know what her intent might be: Will she stay or go? Will she end up like Erroll if she stays? This is not a horrible movie because it touches on some uncomfortable moral reasons, but the story as a whole had to be streamlined.
