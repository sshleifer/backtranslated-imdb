Heather Graham could not play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who are the producers of the film? the ABSOLUTE WORST, the most UNREALISTIC movie I've ever seen, as long as I can remember. This movie is so bad that I felt compelled to sign up to IMDb and make sure that the rating for this "movie" drops. <br /> <br /> I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a drunken chick, so while she's passing out, I'm really going to and fro in my room for hours, wondering desperately, "What have I done ?!" ... Jesus gets over it and grows up ... and I want to share the same feeling for the idiot producers ... and while I'm at it, rather than acting in this movie for a pathetic apology for an upcoming story, it might be better suited to focus the action on a figure who is mentally unstable. .. as your so-called "lesbian" character ... after all, I know that I had gay sex for the first time, when I left the next morning, I jumped excitedly in the middle of the road in the sky ... honest b * tch, get a grip ... <br /> <br /> WHAT A JOKE! and please note that there are many, many more mistakes and dreadfully stupid aspects of this lame movie, but I'm so tired of thinking about it at all. The bottom line, if you're a smart person, you'll hate this movie, and if you're not a smart person, you'll love him ... it's so easy.
