The Japanese feel of tempo, cut and music must be different from the American taste, but this movie could certainly have been more with more post production. <br /> <br /> Somebody in Hollywood has to do this movie and I think it would be a great success. The story is interesting and scary. There is something on the outskirts of the city, stubborn policemen, earthquakes, sanatoriums and mysterious saltwater killings that are enough to be fascinating. However, this story just needs to make sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the "sixth sense" effect came into its own in this movie. and that was clear from the beginning. <br /> <br /> It looks like only hardened Japanese movie lovers should watch this oh so boring movie.
