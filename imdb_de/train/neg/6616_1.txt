I have to tell you right now, I'm definitely NOT in charge of Bollywood movies and have only seen a handful. However, if you have never seen one, DO NOT start with it! I really enjoyed the ones I've seen so far, but I just could not stand it. I have to tell you that I could not finish this movie - it was so annoying. Why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character in the movie called 'Rambha'. He is even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks, whom I never thought would have been possible. He is so # @ ^! # Annoying !! He spoke in a falsetto voice, and I think that should be comic relief. Instead, he rubbed me on the nerves and wanted him to die slowly! His voice, his demeanor and disgust - he just did not seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in - and he had to die! <br /> <br /> 2. The heroes had the amazing ability to dodge AK-47 bullets with ease. I do not shit you - there was a scene where several unarmed men attacked a small army of men with these assault rifles !! And over and over again, they avoided taking a single ball and beating the vermin !!! This made Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" sophisticated !! <br /> <br /> 3. The movie was so damn loud, in your face and intense - it practically blew my brain !! It was as if the movie was made by people under the influence of meth !! Crazy Camera Angle, INTENSE Music and Action, Action, Action ... This movie is clearly meant for someone who can not record a movie with action and wants almost 100% action. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations made no sense ... absolutely no! <br /> <br /> If you're the most passionate action and Bollywood fan, you can endure this movie, but for me, I can see why he's on IMDb's infamous bottom 100 list. Wow ... this movie is bad and very bad !!
