Beaudray Demerille (a weak Peter Fonda, who was also a director), an aging player, wins the young teenager Wanda "Nevada" (pretty, but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. The unlikely couple, of course, set off in search of Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is the story and there is really no need to look for a deeper meaning. It just is not there. Acting is also very weak, which was quite surprising given that Peter Fonda was in the lead. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this movie, take a look at the beautiful scenery and some beautiful views of a young Brooke Shields. Her character is so irritating and stupid, especially at the beginning, that she never looks sexy or appealing. Too bad, but in the face of the story, I doubt it could do more. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed this movie. He must even have persuaded his father (Henry Fonda) in this ridiculous mess to a (useless) cameo. Unfortunately, this was the only movie together. Could not Henry be in EASY RIDER, for example? 3.10
