I just rented this movie (yes, I paid money!). OH MY GOD. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As another reviewer puts it, Ms. Colagrande, out of the movies, PLEASE! Please never make or appear in another movie! The lady has the charisma of a cantaloupe. No, that's not fair for the cantaloupe, which probably has more to offer. She does not know how to behave. She always looks disgusting (reminds me a lot of my always disgusted young sister-in-law from Europe). She is not charming. She is not pretty. There is no real story. And the editing! There were none that I could see! It's pretty bad when you watch a movie. To get through, press "Forward" on the remote, and nothing is happening! I mean! .... I screamed involuntarily: "Cut! Cut!" What did they think? Well, obviously they thought they would make a movie together and make PAID love on the screen! Pretty good business for YOU; Pretty raw offer for the audience! I think I will hand over now ...
