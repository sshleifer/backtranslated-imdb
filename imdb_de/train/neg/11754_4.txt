I have to admit that I'm a big fan of this show, so you have to know how disappointed I was when I saw this movie. At first the conspiracy was terrible, I thought it would be more interesting, such as what happened to Arnold's fathers, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house among many other places. So many people are trying to end this. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the conspiracy was not so bad after all, but what really shit were the steps that Arnold and his friends take to stop this maniac friends of a spy; They drive a bus (based on a video game, for God's sake), and to make matters worse, they make super-moves on the bus, things that many people have tried and died before, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga They are experts for a video game. Honestly, my mother, sister, and even I really got disappointed after the movie, because the worst way to make a really good cartoon was to finish it. I have to admit that I used to say "Hey Arnold!" Comrades, it was one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon, but after that crap of the movie I'm not sure if I'm "Hey Arnold!" I saw it earlier. <br /> <br /> Other thing Nickelodeon, with that enormous amount of dynamite I can assure you that no simple street would explode, I think the whole city could explode with it, oh, and please, if any future movies Become good cartoons like that, do not make movies anymore. They give bad reviews of cartoons that used to be good. Honestly, I think this was the worst way to end this show, a good show that turns into this whole movie.
