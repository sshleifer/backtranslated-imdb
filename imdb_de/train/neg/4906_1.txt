I do not know where to start. Obviously this was a TV made movie so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the general direction of the second hour, but everything before or after the movie seemed to be like a movie of the numbers. <br /> <br /> And talk about bad chemistry between the two detective. I would go deeper, but this movie did not really deserve it. Grade: D + (IMDB Rating 3/10)
