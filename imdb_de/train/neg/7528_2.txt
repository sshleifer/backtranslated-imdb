This is even worse than the original Game of Death. A jumbled, incoherent story causes "Billy Lo" to fall from a helicopter and kill him as we have to follow his younger brother Bobby Lo. So, not only are we starting to follow a Bruce Lee clone, the movie kills one and brings us another thirty minutes into the story. The main reason is that Bobby Lo fights a lion, which is obviously a guy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty great, but his screen time is considerably small. I mainly saw this and the original Game of Death because they are part of the Bruce Lee Boxing Set. No wonder they are included in Lee's finished works. Nobody would buy them otherwise.
