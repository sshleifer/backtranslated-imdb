How many centuries will it take for the Japanese-Asian horror movies to give up the long-haired ghost-woman-shit? Granted, they've managed to "tear down" Ringu a million times, and it has often worked well - which shows that originality in the horror genre is not such a big requirement (or that I am very uncritical to satisfy easily?). This time, however, I was a bit restless, a bit bored. It's not a bad movie, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be, with its absurd 110 minutes. Compared to many other Japanese horror movies, OMC lacks atmosphere and excitement. Besides, the end is confusing: it makes no sense at all. As for the ringtone: Miike could have come up with a tune that is more effective than the forgetful little thing. Although played a dozen times, I can not remember it - it was so scary. Speaking Miike, for him this is a commercial venture. So, if someone thinks he's going to perish the "Bijita Q" or "Audition" version, they're wasting their time.
