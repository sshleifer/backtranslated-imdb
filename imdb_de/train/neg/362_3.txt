Not to be confused with the Madonna movie "The Next Best Thing", "The Last Big Thing" is a stupid, rickety, off-the-wall comedy about a man who wishes to see a magazine called "The Next Big Thing "to start the reviews of various emerging artists. This low budget indie makes "Chuck and Buck" look like a masterpiece. "... Thing" has been verbally abused with lousy plays, bad sets and costumes, etc. and has received some terrible reviews so far and has only been nominated for a Fringe nomination. Pass this on.
