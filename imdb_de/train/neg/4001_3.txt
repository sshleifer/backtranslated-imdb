After hearing so much about the crackers series of the 1990s without seeing any of them, I was looking forward to it. The combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane certainly could not go wrong. How was I wrong? <br /> <br /> The polemic, aided by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, was overwhelming. The production tried to be very modern, but the flashing boxes and even the childish writing irritated. Robbie Coltrane slumbered through the two hours and came up with inexplicable and improbable "insights," and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional limping idiots. As a result, the tension was never built and the next scene (no details for fear of spoilers) was just as ridiculously bad a piece of TV drama as I have not seen in a long time. > No, I do not want to see any more of it, but I'll go back to the 1990s series DVDs to see if they fit their reputation.
