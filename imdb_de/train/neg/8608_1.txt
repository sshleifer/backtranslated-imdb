This movie shows two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. It also has the always enjoyable Larry Miller in too small a part. Nevertheless, I found it almost unsurpassed. Michelle Monaghan may be pretty, but she's almost charismatic, and the reasons for Downey's character's obsession with her character are completely incomprehensible in terms of the information the movie presents and the way it is portrayed. The end seems pretentious, and although the intention seems to be that the public winks at the nod and the film after failing to put us on the side of its protagonists, we are unwilling or unwilling to do so do. <br /> Fans of the film say those who disagree simply "do not understand". I do not think so. The plot was not complicated or incomprehensible. It was just unwavering and awkward and obviously made. I just got it. "I just did not like it, Paddy Breathnachs's" I Went Down "and Guy Ritchie's" Snatch "and" Lock, Stick and Two Smoking Barrels "are far better-exemplified examples of filmmaking, director Shane Black does not succeed. <br /> <br /> I have a birthday with Shane Black, but a look at his credits (mainly as a screenwriter) makes me dissociate myself from any other connection.
