Demer Daves is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and "Broken Arrow" remains in everyone's memory. As for melodrama, he should leave the knowledge to people like Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk. The script is so predictable that you will not be surprised if you see such a lukewarm Wepie. The character of Natalie Wood was inspired by Fannie Hurst's "Imitation of Life" (see Steel and Sirk), but who could believe she's a black man's daughter anyway? Susan Kohner was more believable in "Imitating Life") and Sinatra and Curtis are so stereotyped that they can not do anything with them: the poor officer and the wealthy, handsome and mean sergeant. Who will Natalie fall in love with? France is a country of tolerance in which interracial unions are welcome. At the time (around 1944) it was doubtful, it is still for petty-minded people you can find here and everywhere.
