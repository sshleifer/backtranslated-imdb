Although I have to admit that I've laughed this movie more than the last comedies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The budget must consist of a change of bag of actors. The production values ​​are so low that it is actually fun to see them. Reminds me of the Robot Monster from a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet. In one scene, an unfortunate victim's arm and leg are cut off. Gosh, hard to believe, but the scene of the Black Knight of the Holy Grail was more realistic. I wondered again and again why the victim did not start shouting "None Shall Pass" and "it's just a flesh wound, I had worse". It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the last year. <br /> <br /> The "gladiator / demon" was also a sting. Between the terribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy, the end result was hysterical. <br /> <br /> Really a movie bad enough to be seen. A bit of a slow motion car accident on film. <br /> <br />
