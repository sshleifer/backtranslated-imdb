That's the only question that stays with me. Why was this movie so shitty when it had such a good cast? Why was the writing so bad that the audience was completely unconnected with the characters? Why did not it make any sense at all? Why did the studio take a perfectly good precondition and take "Hollywood" out to hell when all it took was a good, smart story? Why? I never understand why movies that start off well turn out to be a crap at the time of their release. I hope for Freeman and Spacey, who are Oscar WINNERS, that this never appears on the big screens in America. <br /> <br /> As someone who has a bachelor's degree in journalism, the whole story is simply ridiculous. I just think ... the script had potential, but the execution made it a clich√©, and a terrible one. Just. No.
