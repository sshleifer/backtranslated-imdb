This sequel is totally incoherent, incoherent and wandering in "plot" (if there really is one) and tries too damn hard to be modern (ridiculous, time-and-character songs of the 21st century) and cute (yawning) are too many established, besieged jokes with animals.) The actors in his film are subordinate to the juvenile plot. Even Glenn Close (and she's usually very good) sweeps through this movie parodying herself as the original De Ville and the lead from Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that is not even good to look at. This is a very good example of a bad and meaningless sequel. Even the Basic Instinct 2 had an action, characterization and acceptable action. That will not do. It's bad.
