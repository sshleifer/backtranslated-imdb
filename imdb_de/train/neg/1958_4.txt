Where should I start? This movie started out as something that seemed like a rip-off of "Darkness Falls." An old, disfigured woman who lives in the forest and gives children gifts for the teeth. Sounds familiar? Then it changes. In "Darkness Falls," the Tooth Fairy only killed you when you saw her. The tooth fairy in this movie killed you, no matter what. Why did they need the rocker, his hippie girlfriend or the Bubbas and her sister? I think the movie would have been good without them. It seems like the producers are sitting and decided to bring extra people into the movie just so the tooth fairy can kill people. Nevertheless, it is nice to see that a pretty blonde girl is not presented as a bubble for a change. Okay to rent, but I would not recommend buying it.
