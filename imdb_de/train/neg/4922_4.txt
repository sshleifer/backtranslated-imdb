DRACULA 2000 is a horror movie that has been shown on Sky Movies in the UK all the time. Considering that he aired three times a week for a year, I do not even know how I missed him until he was broadcast on the network watching TV this evening. Since I'm not really a big fan of horror movies, the reason was probably in my theory that this would be threefold. My theory has proven to be correct for the most part. <br /> <br /> !!!!! MINOR SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of stupid scripting. For example, at the beginning of the movie, the bad guys fly Dracula's coffin from London to America (in a twin-engine turbo propeller plane!) And one of the bad guys stays in the hold where Dracula comes to life. A fight breaks out, there is a lot of noise, but the bad guys in the cockpit hear no sound until the script demands it. It also seems at the peak of this segment that Dracula can control the weather, but this seems to be forgotten in the course of the movie. Sloppy scripting, and there seems to be a problem with the structure, where there are numerous scenes featuring characters in the New Orleans Mardi Gras. The characters are in a different location, z on the Mardi Gras is the scene after that, which means that the lack of credibility in the plot is improved. <br /> <br /> There's something else that ripped my chain - product placement , There are countless scenes where the logo is fully visible to a particular record label / retail chain. I will not dare to publicize the company's brand (other than, they also run a railroad company that's a national joke in the UK), but I got the impression that this type of ad was against British Broadcasting Guidelines and I'm surprised that the BBC showed this movie if this is the case <br /> <br /> There are some positive aspects in DRACULA 2000, such as the visuals. This is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast, and the guys were hot at these vampire girls, but it's something we should expect from Hollywood in the last few years - a very handsome movie that is very stupid
