For the record this film is fascinating, but hardly original. In 1998, a film starring Talia Shire entitled The Landlady had almost the same story, but with younger characters. etc. She has finally been released from the happy home, under the guidance of her perverted doctor ... she maltreats and kills poor guy anal. The doctor had financed a villa for her before she had killed him and buried the jerk in the backyard. After moving in, she falls in love with a stallion named Richard, who happens to be married to a blues singer. If you have seen that the landlady knows the rest, she kills or tries to kill anyone who comes between her and Richard (including a roadie). <br /> <br /> Many of the ideas come from the previous film. the same idiot who puts his nose in his mouth, and the guy spied with a bowl of popcorn, the same a bodypress. There was some original material, the beer bottle thing was brutal. The highlight of the film were Amanda's beautiful breasts in the hot top scene. A little rip-off, but not a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
