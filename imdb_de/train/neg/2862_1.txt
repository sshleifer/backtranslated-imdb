Someone has to send this Uli Lommel guy back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever told him that he knew how to make a movie? Can EVERYONE just make films in these days? In the past, it was always TALENT NECESSARY before anyone could make a movie. After watching this lame BTK movie and the other he's done, it seems obvious that the poor guy has about as much business as me. Actually, I think I could do even better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the BTK killer except the names of the victims and the killer. THAT'S IT. Where did this guy get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other absurd crap in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to persuade people to watch their movie because of the fame that comes from the term "BTK". Absolutely pathetic. The only serial killer movie I would consider WORSE is the lame "DAHMER" movie. This kid smoked so many cigarettes that I felt sick. Anyone who has done that must be shot.
