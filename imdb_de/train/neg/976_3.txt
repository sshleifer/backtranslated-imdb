I'm generally more willing to be open minded to Rome's coms than many, but this was not a very good attempt. It has nothing to do with comparisons with the British original - I have not seen and doubt it. It has a lot to do with a meandering conspiracy, lack of chemistry between the leads and an incredible performance / character from their alleged male lead (Jimmy Fallon). Fallon enters the screen and wears the clothes and a haircut of 15 years, which is a decade younger. He's supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course, school districts around the world love to engage people who are less mature than the children they want to teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I doubt any actor could have made him sympathetic, but old familiar people like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to do it. Not Fallon, who is neither funny nor an actor, but he seems to think he is both. Throughout the film, you do not even believe in Fallon's role, or believe there's a way these two people should or would be together. At the end of the film, there's a scene where Barrymore (who, as always, was cute, but could not wear it alone - it's hard to have a one-person romance) tells Fallon that it's over, too much is happening is and she moves on. And instead of feeling bad or apologizing to Fallon, you actively fire her - after all, she does what she should have done months ago. But of course, the plot mechanic does not allow that to be the end (an ending that could actually have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we see the rational career girl throwing everything away to track this childish idiot and encouraging his delusions. Of course it meant being sticky and satisfying, but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else.
