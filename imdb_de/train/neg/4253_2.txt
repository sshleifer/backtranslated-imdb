This is one of the worst attacks on vampires ever thought of by men. How can you make a completely boring story out of such a mesmerizing topic? Apparently not such a difficult task ... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of a vampire movie is a dark and sombre atmosphere with a nice sexy touch that lacks all these things. oh my god, why in the name of christ / judas was that about? There was only one scene that made it worth seeing, just before the end of the film (beautiful dancing scene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas twist was definitely original, but this one is just not good, in any way. I hope that the third bears the vampire signature that I like in other classics like Duke Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula, or even an interview with the vampire.
