I would not say that, but if Netflix was not, I would not even have it in my house. Steve Martin's eccentric president of a chain of health food stores turns flat. He is just not funny. He's another in a lot of SNL denials that can only find work when she's longing for the next SNL movie. The birthing car with the Elmer Fudd lisp is about as funny as it was originally. Amy Poehler just does the same moves as for a 7-minute SNL sketch that's been as funny as SNL lately. The only thing going on in this movie is that Tina Fey is good for the eyes. The end was predictable as soon as you heard that her figure could not get pregnant. The theme could have opened up for other comedic attempts, but it just seems to boil, not really entertaining or laughing.
