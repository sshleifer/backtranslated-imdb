The two things are good about this movie because it's about two unknown celebrities. <br /> <br /> First, Daphne steals Zuniga on her first appearance in a movie, young and supple, with looks that still surround her body the beginning, which is everything she's in, and that's it She obviously starts only because her acting has improved with her next projects. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the score of the then well known composer Christopher (Chris) Young is what keeps that stinker from winning a star ... yes I know, one more star is not much, but in In this case, it is a lot. <br /> <br /> The rest is just stupid, pointless horror of a couple, a college student trying to clean up a dorm room is responsible for being knocked down, one by one by an unsuspecting murderer, blah, blah, blah, getting cut off ... we all know where that leads. <br /> <br /> Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga then turn it off.
