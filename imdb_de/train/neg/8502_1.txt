In the beginning, I think it's an interesting movie, a Spanish thriller in an interesting Madrid, but it's none of it. It's actually a movie that's only interesting for future film directors, who learn what you do not do to make a movie. In other words, it's not worse, even the presence of an Oscar winner (Mira Sorvino) is not enough. to justify the $ 3.00 for this film; Shots to go home, it leads to nothing and is boring, weak and bad, do not spend time or money on this movie.
