When I discovered that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like a score! I admit, I really wanted to see the movie. And I have to say, the first fifteen minutes were in a way nostalgic. Then it went downhill. I did not expect it to be a landfill for politically correct citizenship. They took up any controversial topic and managed it into a stupid story. I was appalled that Noah was involved in something like that, especially his role. No one with a fully functioning brain would actually accept all that crap about the Vietnam War. If anyone really wants to know what communism was like, sit down and read a book about it. And not one who praises or speaks against it, only the cold hard facts. <br /> <br /> I only saw a few scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that only interested me. Everything else about this movie irritated me.
