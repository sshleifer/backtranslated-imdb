As I review the other comments, I am amazed that potential viewers are not warned about what to expect when renting this garbage. First, I rented this thing with the understanding that it is a competent Indiana Jones knock-off. What I got was one of the most insulting movies I could remember when I tried to sit through it. All the more shocking were the comparatively high production values ​​of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not think this is a spoiler, but if so, be warned ... <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​entertainment is included, like Bimbo of Fearsome Tribal Chief raped from behind as she looks into the dead eyes of the severed head of her significant other, by all means, hire this strip. If not, I would advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Come to think, this scene sums up the movie so tightly that I do not have to say anything else about it.
