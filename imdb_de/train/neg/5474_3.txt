To be fair, they did it as well as possible with a budget of five shillings and sixpence, but the dialogue was more cheesy than a pound of Emmental and the CGI was now a little old hat. If some of the actors were not so well carved out of granite, that would have improved the movie a bit. To say that this would be awful would be to call this movie a failure, if you want to see something that is total. You can spend a few hours of your life watching 'sickle', that's so stunningly awful 'That's good,' (some big alcoholic drinks are derogatory, of course, every way up, I enjoyed this movie and it's a must!) Take a look if you have not seen it yet, do not expect anything in the sense of ' Jurassic Park, The Lost World "or" Apocalypto ".
