This little show is obviously a stupid little prequel / spin-off of the original series. <br /> <br /> Compared to the live action series, this show is absolutely crap. The live action show had smart jokes and storylines. While the animated series is basically a weakened, bittersweet version that can digest younger viewers, I think children may not understand this crap. <br /> <br /> The plot in each episode is basically just Sabrina, who has used some stupid and pointless dillemma magic to fix the problem. That's basically the idea of ​​each episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina became Sabrina with magic Gem and Gem. Then Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes Harvery into her slave. This leads to a bizarre but interesting scene in which Gem says she should just worship me. Harvey gets on her hands and knees and kisses her feet like a god. (which is right since he is her slave control) But this stupid byproduct is worth neither the time nor the effort.
