The movie that plays scenes from a scenic cave tour. <br /> <br /> Do not remember anyone in this movie, except Michael Pataki, who caused extreme pain as JC in "Five the Hard Way". He's the really annoying sheriff I applauded practicing night stick with our daring doctor. You're probably laughing most with Dr. Beck's epileptic seizures from nowhere. Could Mrs. Beck be more of wood? Seriously, if you take a 4-foot branch and put it in a hot tub, you would not notice a difference. The fear and the tension look at the clock and wonder when the credits roll. <br /> <br /> See it as a late-night movie, MSTified, but do not get out of the way.
