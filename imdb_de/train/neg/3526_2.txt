(Containing spoilers, some would say) <br /> <br /> This movie can not be taken seriously. In some places, it's so dumb that I just have to laugh. Try the sequence where Stallone's character jumps 20 meters with full climbing gear, or (and that's really my favorite) to sniff a bad guy by putting him on a stalactite. Yes, what ungodly power did he bring to accomplish such accomplishments? I do not know, but he certainly gives the money to reality.
