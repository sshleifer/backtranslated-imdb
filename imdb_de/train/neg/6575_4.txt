Interesting film about an event during the Civil War in Vermont. It kept my attention to the end and I do not regret seeing it. I have never read anything about this raid incident, so I was curious if the rebels would make it. I like historical films from this period. <br /> <br /> My main complaint concerns the Confederate uniforms. You look too good !!! The acting was sometimes a bit stiff. I like the old man who eats mashed potatoes because he had no teeth. The wounded soldier playing fetch with a hunting dog was a bit strange. Overall, it was a lineage movie.
