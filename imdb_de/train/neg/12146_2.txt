This apocalyptic zombie movie tries to be vicious and shocking. But feeding the massages seems lame as some of the stiff-legged zombies track the streets. In Rhode Island, the zombie epidemic known as the Lazarus virus is being downplayed by government-rigged newspapers and television stations. A few brave but stupid souls in Channel 5 TV News think the audience has the wrong hope and no idea of ​​the real danger. An avid reporter (Racheal Morris) and her cameraman (William Garberina) risked life and limb with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen) to present a live broadcast that set the doom. Do yourself a favor and do not watch. This thing obviously has a very small budget and seems like a high school game is bad. Acting is cruel and the meat-hungry zombies are almost funny. Also appearing: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. Feeding the massages should starve.
