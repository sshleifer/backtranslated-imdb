Ironically, although Thomas can do the "splits," as an actor, he is completely stiff. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the most divided and cheesy and incompetent films I've ever seen, and it's firmly in my memory. As such, I'm really very fond of you. <br /> <br /> The only reason that makes more than one star is that Thomas has a great shape, and it's fun to see how his tiny, muscular body is different on the oddly shaped rocks and sticks Gymnastic skills perform across the Eastern European landscape (including the notorious "pommel horse") in the middle of a village square, where Thomas puts his feet on the faces of various crazy villagers. But let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emulate, and any illusion that he might have a movie career is immediately torn to pieces. <br /> <br /> Thomas had at least the excuse that he was not really an actor. Everyone else in the movie - actor, director, lecturer, cameraman, etc. - are at least as bad or even worse and most of them are professionals. So Kurt does not come across as bad as you might think. <br /> <br /> I hope poor Kurt took the money and ran away. If anyone ever asks him to play martial arts film again, I bet Thomas will kick the man in the face.
