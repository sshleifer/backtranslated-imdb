Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon, and SCTV alumni are all in a sometimes funny sketching movie together. <br /> <br /> However, it is very interesting to look at the beginning of 2005 now. Twenty years after this movie is set to take place, look at how many of her gags have come true: there's an apparent movie trailer that was probably not even smart at the time, for something called "The Pregnant Man "That's what became true with Arnold Schwarzenegger's stupidity Film" Junior "There is a commercial parody that was probably not even smart at the time. Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis, known as "Celebrity Wrestling," have now come to life with a popular show called "Celebrity Boxing." There is an apparent movie trailer that was probably not even smart at the time, showing John Candy in a movie about a severed head. Take a look at this trailer and see how similar the settings and storyline are to Frank Hellenlott's Basket Case !! And finally, there's an ad for a late-late documentary about "a dead dream with only two left ..." The name of the documentary is ... THE LAST HIPPIES! LOL. <br /> <br /> Four prophecies come true!
