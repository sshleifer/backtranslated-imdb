Nu Image, UFO and others produce movies for the SCI-FI channel with a budget of around $ 2 million. Some are endowed with rich effects, others with recognizable casts and others with both - for $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Mr. Hines initially claimed the film had a budget of $ 20 million, but it is painfully obvious that this movie was probably produced for $ 750,000, if not less. Only a few sets are used, a series of scenes are shot against the green screen, and most of the effects are incomplete and amateurish. <br /> <br /> It is painful to look at. Not so much because it is badly directed, badly executed and misguided, but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for some time and, despite the relatively modest budget, had great hopes for this film. > Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those of whom PT has spoken Barnum
