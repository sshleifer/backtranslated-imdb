Oh dear God. Oh my god, I can not overcome this movie. It was terrible. dreadful! Do not even waste your money to buy it in the 99 cents. No, avoid it at all costs. I'm warning you! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I have ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-Girl? Are you kidding me. Really, that sounds like some kind of new Barbie doll .. Super Women? Are you kidding me. It was such a fake, a fake. The townspeople did not even seem to care that there was a flying blonde just saving herself from the city to rescue a fire. Oh, big! <br /> <br /> Jesus movie seems insulting? I think what you need to be a superhero is a pair of double-D, blonde flowing hair, no glasses and a tight leather suit ?! <br /> <br /> If it tried to be romantic ... than .. god, I do not know. It was terrible when love took someone to an art show and then had sex in a bed AND in the air ... when they totally loved each other! <br /> <br /> It was pathetic, everything went too fast. At first this guy was single, then he went out with G-Girl .. then they parted when he went out with Hannah Girl .. and .. it just keeps going. <br /> <br /> I have to say, this movie surprised me. How the hell did they get that in the cinemas ?? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
