Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write down the rating immediately after seeing this mud puddle. Why? Because I have to tell you all how bad this movie is. It is unbelievably bad. I just want to tell you how bad it is. I will offer this little detail about the movie. While scenes of chaos, usually involving people shooting or kicking zombies, cut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie is really shit. I think it costs ten dollars just to get in the cinemas today. And see so much corn stuffed? There's no story to talk about, and the movie basically has nothing to offer except occasionally a boob shot and really cheap kills. I'm really disappointed that I saw it. OK, I'm speechless. It's so bad that I can not even find the words. EVALUATION: zero from *****.
