Columbo films have been going downhill for years, this year it could have reached the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same uninspired performance and is scary in this movie. As usual in this series, crime scene protocols are unknown, so there is always a lack of plausibility. Brenda Vaccaro chews the scenery and draws pantomime faces, and Andrew Stephens is a rather unconvincing man. (His powerlessness, however, was a shout!) The script was condescending of the numbers and their delivery. They should never have brought Columbo into the nineties, but left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plans, better scripts and sharp characterizations.
