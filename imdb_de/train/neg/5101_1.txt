The only thing that came to mind after watching this drop was that I would never get the time I saw that back. If you see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn and want to try what has to have been, then the downpayments for a holiday home then stay tuned. Wood drama, bad special effects, the only comedic highlight was when our alien hero was in female form, and this is over once she has recorded her compulsory B-Movie nude sex scene in the movie within 30 minutes. The opportunity to become a decent movie disappears the moment Nicole Eggbert plays the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, while the police, military and Joe do not settle for the woman who's drinking coffee Use the mug handle carries four jumpers at the same time. She obviously has to be from another planet. Exactly where I wish I was at the time this movie was going on.
