I grew up with the original Disney Cinderella and have always loved it so much that the band is a bit worn. <br /> <br /> Accordingly, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was on TV and I would be able to see it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better. <br /> <br /> This film joins the club in movie sequences that should just be left alone. It absolutely does NOT hold any of the original super charm! It seems pretty rough and almost brutal to me, from the (not) sing-a-longs to the characterization. <br /> <br /> While I remember the character telling a story through a song, the soundtrack of this movie was superimposed and did not seem to fit. Jaq's transformation into a human being is a prime example: if he ate an apple here and there and added a few little jokes, he would have had to dance and sing how big it was to be tall! And in the ballroom, there is old country music in the style of the stable. It's as if the authors have forgotten where and when this story takes place. The happy violins certainly did not fit. <br /> <br /> The artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 are no match for the original. The artwork in this movie looks pretty raw and less detailed. And we see a part of Cinderella's hoop skirt that does not feel right. <br /> <br /> The movie itself could have been its own story, I think it should have been just that. I would not say that I hate it, but I think it had many shortcomings. It seems to be much lower than the beloved Cinderella original.
