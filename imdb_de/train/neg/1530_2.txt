I wish I had included MEN IN WHITE so I could watch it again. <br /> <br /> "What, you mean, you really enjoyed it Theo?" No, I mean, I could see it again to see if it was left behind, stupid and as embarrassingly unstable as I can remember. <br /> <br /> Many people said it was done for kids. May I suggest that it was done by children as well? because the entire structure of the script lacks any kind of discipline on the part of producers and authors, and it seems that many set pieces were included because it seemed a good idea at the time. <br /> <br /> The cast Do not help, but I have really started to feel sorry for you. Honestly, one can believe that the actors had to lie to their families during the filming that they turned a hard porno movie. It was their embarrassment that they had to act in something so gloomy. To give you an idea of ​​how bad the acting is, every time BAYWATCH's baby Donna D'Ericco disappeared from the story, I waited patiently for her to reappear, and seconds later I forgot she was in the movie , Roger that ? A star of BAYWATCH appears and seconds later you forget that they are in the movie. Here's everything you need to know about the MEN IN WHITE standard. <br /> <br /> Fairly it's trying to be a live action cartoon similar to THE GOODIES (though THE DISMALS would be a better adjective for this movie). Although the movie may deserve some recognition, that it has never descended to the toilet humor, but considering this is a children's movie (ITV did not stop that when it aired at 11pm), it should not be in the movie anyway Be close to the ankle-like humor
