I just found Darkness too dark. It had some kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas, no bad action scenes and a couple of sparkling moments to get you to the UGH! BUT, it was underexposed to confusion. You do not really know what's going on in the dark scenes, and for a movie shot on Super 8 movie you already have so much monster to do. As with Nathan Schiff films, it's just too much. Director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original film, but he lacks know-how. The camera is never aimed at the right place, the lack of basic information, such as recording simple dialogue scenes and lighting a movie, also hurt. The actors are all pretty uneven and hammy. But despite these negatives, the music is good, the Gore is plentiful and ranges from stupid putty to really good gadgets. Is this a classic, as he says? Is it worthy of the two discs? NO. But it's a good first try. Well, if these people stopped patting the backside of this movie (of what I understand as the only one they ever finished) for a while and trying again, they could do better.
