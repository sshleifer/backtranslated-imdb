Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young US corporal in Afghanistan. He is also a highly skilled surgeon and roams free through Kabul to deploy injured NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission, he casually grabs a sniper rifle and shoots Osama bin Laden from a distance of about 3,000 meters. He is eventually promoted to sergeant, but can not decide between a career as a sniper and a surgeon. One year later, frustrated by civilian life, he joins the navy and the last scene shows him proudly in a white uniform.
