American filmmakers decided to make a film that they believe is Japanese. The characters are all poorly portrayed, the actors are not even Japanese and the set is cheap, unreal and definitely not for Kyoto in the early 20's and 30's. Anyone who has read the book understands that the scriptwriters did not add any extra value to distinguish the movie from the script. Worse, they've even changed the original plot line with a few patches. Rob Marshall uses for his two main characters two well-known Chinese actors, who previously combined in a tiger hidden dragon. Marshall has probably seen a Chinese movie that represents Japanese culture. Seeing these two actors together makes the movies even more ridiculous. Quentin Tarantino's final scene in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese than the movie's.
