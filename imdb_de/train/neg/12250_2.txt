When I saw Tobe Hooper's Gem Crocodile in 2000, I developed a great deal of interest in the college / crocodile niche of the exploitation / monster genre. I am looking forward to a stubborn producer who is following some sequels of these wonderful candies from Camp Goodness. If only Ed Wood could bring in his subtle flair and dignity in these remarkable screenplays. After Ed wrote the scripts and a room full of Monkees producing crocodile special effects on a computer, we needed only a cast of crispy food with Russ-Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek breast implants. While Tobe Hooper's crispy opus focused on his own films Blood Surf decided to distribute some aging themes from the buddy of other films. See if you can see the consequences of the Nerds' Revenge to find the allusions / homages? Also try to find the foldable TV where the editor has stopped understanding the stock. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed that the Crock's tenor sotto is not alone on environmental awareness ... or crunchy appreciation, but the quasi-captain Ahab of the story gets his speech. Maybe in the next few years we'll see a pot galloping into a golden sunset after a shootout. Or hopefully, a monkey flushes the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoys the exploitative waltz of Zero-G monkeys / dwarf / crocodile bloodshed. All in all, the lack of a whammy bar in surf music annoyed me.
