The hardest thing about this movie is to say something positive about it. The characters were stereotypical "White-Trash", the film's "plot" was stunted from the start, and the worst part about this movie was that the nudity was so blatant that it was doubled by the body and that it was funny. Unfortunately that was the only funny thing in the movie. Ms. Jenkins would be better off if in the future she did not use her life story to "entertain" people. It was just so bad. The only positive aspect of this movie (this has nothing to do with the poor quality of the movie) is that my brother spent the money on that stinker.
