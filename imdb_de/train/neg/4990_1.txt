I can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante strip, but that's just awful. And not bad in a way that makes fun of MST3K. It's just bad because you can not find anything no matter how hard you try. I sincerely regret having wasted 2 hours of valuable life with this crap. You can tell from the film that no one was asked, and everyone knew that this movie would only bury his career. Apparently, "Walking Tall" has made so much money that someone decided they could put off their investment. If it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's so bad that it stains the worst movies out of my memory.
