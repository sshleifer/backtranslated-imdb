We had to go to an appointment, so we turned on the DVR to record the end. After it was over, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have any idea?" He shook his head. I said, "So you made me see the end of this movie, and I have no idea what just happened." He did not "make" me, but you know. <br /> <br /> The film body itself was pretty good. There was a lot of tension. It surprised you. Then came the end. The end was ... well, it just ended. They did not know what happened or why. Until the credits, I always thought something would happen to explain it, but it never did. So I came here expecting someone to find out and I just did not pay attention. Nope. Here, four years later, I'm as clueless as Tom Sawyer. I still have no idea what happened. I'm just glad I did not waste money to buy it because I'm sure I was crazy. <br /> <br /> OHHHHHH! I get it! The end of the movie has disappeared! rofl
