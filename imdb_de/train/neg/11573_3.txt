I came here for a meeting last night before deciding which TV movie to put in front of me. How mad I feel! <br /> <br /> First of all, it should be noted that this film is usually a housewife. The performances are made of wood, each set is an attempt to be "poignant" in the way the housewives are at the feature films and the bad soap operas, and it is based on this foreseeable and well-worn assumption that men ( especially soldiers) are essentially violent merciless. The whole film is about the "drama" that becomes visible in the moments when male characters threaten to develop a second dimension. <br /> <br /> If that sounds bearable (or even enjoyable) to you then be forewarned. Although Linda Hamilton's German accent is quite good, it bothers her - just like her face for some reason. The other performances are undoubtedly a permanent source of embarrassment for their perpetrators, with painfully thin and obvious characterizations on the agenda. There are few surprises, but watch out for the endless supply of 'Monty Pythonesque' miraculously emerging from the backpacks of hungry soldiers! <br /> <br /> I had not expected anything, but I was hoping for a nice or structurally or emotionally charged. What I got was a particularly bad Christmas party story that bends an intelligent audience with the clumpiness of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> See it in the following circumstances: 1: There is nothing else. 2: You are a fan of predictable "housewife men" and win TV movies. 3: A true story can only be appreciated if Hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: You have drunk enough that your feelings are easily moved by uncomplicated storytelling.
