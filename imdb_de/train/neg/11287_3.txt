This is a movie that had a lot to live on. In the year of the release of legendary film critic Barry Norman, it was considered the worst movie of the year and I had heard nothing but bad things about it, especially a conspiracy that was criticized as being too complicated <br /> <br /> Honestly, the plot is something of a red herring, and the movie suffers even more when the word "plot" is used, since, as far as I can see, there is no plot as such. There's something about Russian gangsters, a character named Pete Thompson trying to get his wife Sarah pregnant, and an Irish guy named Sean. I do not know how they all fit into a so-called "conspiracy". It's difficult to explain the actions of Guy Ritchie movies, but if you watch one of his films, we can all agree that they all have one, no matter how complicated they seem at first glance. Likewise, a James Bond movie, though the action with action scenes are curious. You will have a serious problem if you believe that RANCID ALUMINUM has any kind of central action that can be explained in peace. When you look at the cast list, you will be popping enough warnings, what a movie you are watching. Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films of the last 15 years, and she's doing nothing to get inconsistent. Steven Berkoff gives the acting a bad name (and he plays a character named Kant, which summarizes the joke of this film), while one of the minor characters is probably played by a television presenter, because probably no serious actress is seen dead in this movie. > <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it is completely forgotten. I saw it a few days ago and right after watching I wanted to write a very long critical review warning people what to look at, but meanwhile I forgot why. This does not change the fact that I remember that I did not like the crap so much
