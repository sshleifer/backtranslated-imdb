My comments may be a bit spoiler, which is worth it. Stop now, if you take care of that ... <br /> <br /> Saving Grace should have been titled "A sheer excuse for old British women to see on screen". This movie is stupid. The casual music is a nuisance, as well as the obvious, crazy melodies that sporadically appear to comment on the narrative ("Spirit in the Sky" for example - oh, I understand!) Through their uncomfortable English mindset and Brenda Blethyn's overwhelming power to give emotions to an audience with their voice. I literally heard the people in High Times magazine get their jollies talking about the huge "buds" scattered throughout the picture. Worst scene? Easy. Brenda tries to sell her forbidden goods on London Street in a waving white suit suit. Not funny. Not original. Not interesting. Not a good movie. The 7.2 rating is the result of an overconfidence of the zealots. Do not waste your time ...
