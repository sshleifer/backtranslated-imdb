80 minutes and it felt twice as long! Short crossing is not short enough. In fact, the first 50 minutes consist almost entirely of a dialogue (rather a monologue, really) of a middle-aged woman boring about "men," disappointment, sex, aging, and her recent breakup with a French teens teenager she met in the cafeteria of the ship. <br /> <br /> The boring monologue continues as they walk to the duty-free shop and bar, where they are eventually pushed away by their self-deprecated chatter. Of course, the "story" can not end here, so she persuades him to listen more to her drone than she brings him to her cabin. <br /> <br /> What a little romance, sex or whatever Everything this movie has, apart from bitter lamentations, is barely enough to justify the rental price, unless you're one of them who love dramas where nothing interesting happens. Yes, the end is nicely done, but it's hardly a reward if you submit to a submission of your living room to a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whimper. <br /> <br /> Of course some people like it. I could be wrong.
