You have to take a look at this show to see them all. The formula is exactly the same in every episode. Jim does something in his own way, he means well, but he turns his wife on the head, in the end she finds out that what he did was really for her, she strokes his cheek and smiles while he is ashamed watching. In fact, the storylines are so lame and formulaic that I'm going to tie myself to one now. <br /> <br /> Episode "Valentines Pay" <br /> <br /> Jim's wife notices that everyone of Jim's weekly pay has disappeared, then he tells her he lost her at the casino. She screams and leaves the house, how terrible he is. On Valentine's Day, he then appears in a limousine with tickets for a ball (and thus explains the missing reward). She recognizes 'her' mistake and the usual 'Oh Jim, you are so beautiful'. The End <br /> <br /> Another very obvious point is that Jim's character is based on Homer Simpson, who as a cartoon character can be belligerent and ignorant when trying on humans does not work and Jim just comes out as more arrogant , self-centered idiot over. <br /> <br /> IMO The only reason this is successful is simply because we now have so many people with televisions that today you could do a show about a man who would isolate walls and get them Yourself an audience. <br /> <br /> "Two and a half men" on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious.
