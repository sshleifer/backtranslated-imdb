** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is utterly unrealistic, he lacks an action and was basically only made to see stars that represent themselves. The most exciting scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi is in the shower and we see her TV playing the shower scene of PSYCHO. This movie actually expected users to believe that the character of Naseeruddin Shah is a good memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many! *** SPOILER STARTS *** <br /> <br /> In the end, killer Shabana Azmi pours out long enough to run and shoot the character of Naseeruddin Shah! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ENDS *** <br /> <br /> At the beginning, it's a bit funny (just a little) to hear the director and members of the group talk to each other insult and hear how Shabana Azmi "Oh sh-t!" Calls out baaaaaaaaaaad movie! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** by ********** (2 out of 10)
