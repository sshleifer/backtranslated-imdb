It is said that since the entry of this comment, no women have cast a vote in favor of this film. It's not surprising that cheesy sci-fi movies do not like them so much ... If you like a good "B" movie and especially if you want to satirize them while watching it, you'll like it. If you do not enjoy watching bad movies, this is not for you.
