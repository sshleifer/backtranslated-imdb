<br /> <br /> Okay, well, I hired this movie while I was bedridden and getting painkillers and let me say he did not help the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie It's about a guy who buys a car because he's in a mid-life crisis. He loves the car more than anything else around him. One day his wife decides to borrow the car. Since I do not want to spoil (not that there was anything to ruin), I'll leave the fantasy to the "Zany" (and I use that word recklessly) following, to fight to keep awake Stay tuned, snore for a minute, and I would like to say that if you venture into the movie store and think about adventurous, please do not, it's a waste of the movie he was imprinted on. <br /> <br /> Then I could be wrong ...
