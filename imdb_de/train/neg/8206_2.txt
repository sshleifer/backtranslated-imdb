With one of my favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this movie to be at least bearable. It was not After the first half hour I watched the rest with the remote control in my hand so the fast-forward was ready. So banal, so standardized, you know what will happen in every scene. You can even predict the dialogue word for word. This is one of those movies where you scratch your head and say, "How was this movie ever made?" To say something positive, I add that there are some slightly entertaining special effects. However, if you've seen 5 sci-fi movies or are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip it.
