I remember Devil Dog, who played on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends, who watched and laughed all day. It's not so bad for a TV horror movie, but it's rejected (mostly by The Exorcist) and businesslike because there's no better word. It will not inspire you with artful films or great acting, but it's not a waste of time either. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a few hours if you're not in the mood to think too much. <br /> <br /> But if you go to the movie and look for some laughter, you win 'It's getting disappointed. The early scenes with Lucky the Devil Dog as cute little puppies with Children of the Damned eyes are hilarious and the climatic blueprint effects of a huge black dog (with horns!) Are pretty exciting. And watch out for the hooded Satanist in Maverick Shades at the beginning. <br /> <br /> No great horror movie, but I wish they would do the same thing for TV anyway.
