I saw the movie here at home last night, but I thought it was too long at first. Second, the things I saw in the movie were far too little for the text to be a comedy movie like the rest before, in what I thought. Things are not funny in the movie: fiance beats his girlfriend, spanking. The movie was way too long - talk about whether you want to go to sleep and ask yourself when it will end when you wake up and still play. Some things on the reunion were too much to get caught - like the singing lady - I felt like I almost saw a spiritual song show here! Come on, Perry, you can do better!
