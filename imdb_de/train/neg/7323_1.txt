Well, unlike other comments, I have to say that the only good thing about this movie is the fact that a guy in it looked a bit like Jason Donavon, who reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how it won any prizes, and although I'm sure it took a lot of effort to make it, everything was fruitless, because the end result is one of the alien soap operas of the early '90s screams. The plot was non-existent, the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on a par with a level performance. Unfortunately it was long and the negotiations were incredibly unrealistic ... for example ... If your best friend slept with your ex-boyfriend of 6 years after only two weeks separation, you would not all be the best of friends. It was all fantasy. That's all! Oh yeah, and the weird 90's house / softcore indies were amazing!
