Somewhere out there must be a list of the most gay gay movies. Some have oversized camera images of the stars sitting and staring thoughtfully into space, or focusing intently on kitty kats eating spaghetti. This motion sickness picture is a story of a boy and a boy, and they live and love and swim and stay stuck in caves, and one of them has a depressive mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then leave and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there are a lot of fast-forward and rewind and there are long thoughtful shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing. I think it's some sort of gimmick technique, or maybe it's so bad the movie has to fill it up with long, wasted shots. Otherwise, the movie would take about 14 minutes if it had to rely on plot or story. Do not get me wrong, this is the 30th gay movie I've seen in the last 6 months, and some of them (most) were very phrased, predictable and boring, but this is really a terrible waste of The best one so far has been "Beautiful Thing". So I looked at it and after the very first opening shot, which was always back, I thought: "Oh, no, it's a creative dream." But I gave him a chance and looked at it and when it was over, I threw the DVD in the trash. Sorry that I did not like it and if so, I'm sorry if I hurt myself.
