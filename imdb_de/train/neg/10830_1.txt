1999 will go down in history as the film critic misleads the public. First, they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then they canceled THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA, which is by far the worst movie of the year. Why is? Who the hell knows. It is full of forbearance and burdened with bad actions. I always like to stay and watch the guy's throats, but when the thing was over, I could not get out of the cinema fast enough. Most of the viewers who participated in the show I attended felt pretty much the same. Dates quarreled with each other and with strangers. It's an ugly and hateful movie that makes you feel ugly and hateful.
