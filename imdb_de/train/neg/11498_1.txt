Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood's worst overvalued films ever. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to make a film that has to do with time, he gives a garbage movie. The songs were boring and not the kind of songs you want to hear in your car at full volume. Sunny Deol is famous for his stupid films, in which he alone defeats 100 villains. He even steps against a metal prison door (Indian) and steps into the distance (Teesri Aankh) driving a car. I can name another 50 examples of shameful actions by Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know that. Sunny reflects a pathetic performance repeating the same type of role. A man who claims to fight for his country by force. Amisha Patel is absolutely sexy with an amazing body that I would like to bones. But even she could not save the movie from catastrophe. Instead of wearing sexy clothes as usual, she does not do that in this movie. Maybe because she played a Muslim, but she does not behave like one in the movie. All in all, this is a bad show. I am sure that it will appeal to some people who love to see the Bollywood actor beating 100 guys. Give me a break.
