Do you know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you his life story, and you sit there with a miserable smile on your face, if you really just want to beat the idiot and leave? Well, I had a similar feeling when I saw this movie. Okay, I actually chose Aprile, and I knew of Nanni Moretti's predilection to become the only star of Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this last episode of his memoirs, I wanted to give Moretti the opportunity Madre all slaps. Caro Diario was funny, unusual and at least a few other characters managed to speak a word. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to dialogue so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a loud whimpering about how his politics are best or what a quirky piece of folk culture is tickling his imagination right now. He also finds time to film films he does not like, something that I thought was reserved for losers like me. Surely in a position like his, one would think he would say something smarter than the cinema. Maybe with a real movie, with some ideas and a decent structure, or one that is not completely dominated by his annoying voice. And when he started joking about his newborn baby, I just wanted to be in the company of a normal, preferably not self-obsessed, director with a peculiar fondness for big music. The next time someone you do not know tries to tell you your life story, give me a slap. Each stroke will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
