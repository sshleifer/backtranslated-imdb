Anyone who wants to become an editor should see this movie! It shows you every mistake you should not make while editing a movie! My grandma could have been better! But that's not the only reason why this movie is really bad! (Actually, it's so bad that I can not write a sentence without an exclamation mark!) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs was a pretty good family comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this sequel copies the recipe badly from the first one. The funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half. Clavier exaggerates his role even more than in the first part. Robin tries to behave like Lemercier (because she replaces them), but that's "grotesque." Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Although Muriel Robin can be funny on stage, she is not in this movie because she does not play the way she used to. I know it would be hard to replace someone who was good in a role (Lemercier won a César prize for her role in the first film), but she made a big mistake: instead of playing her role, she played Lemercier who played her role '! As for history, it's just too much! Of course we knew at the end of the first movie that there would be a sequel, but Poiré and Clavier should have tried to write a simpler story like the first episode. The gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu. No, really, there are not more than 3 funny parts. The only good things are the costumes and some special effects. So you have only two reasons to look at it: 1) If you want to learn how to handle a movie terribly, 2) if you want to waste your time or really need a "mindless moment"! 2.10
