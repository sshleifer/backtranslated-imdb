Yeah right. <br /> <br /> I spent the first hour patiently waiting for the movie. It was dreadfully boring and consisted mostly of people who happened to ride through the hills with no apparent direction. Then the hero comes into the picture. Born as an Asian, he became white when he grew up. Obviously know. He was not even close to passing for Asia. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely distracting and history did not help. Meaningless fighting sequences and lame dialogues. It's an hour and forty-five minutes, and in the end I tried to eat my own face. I looked at it because the people in the video library I work in are always asking me if this movie is good. Now I have an answer. It's like this: um. "NO, GOOD GOD, NO IT'S WORTH, DO NOT DO THIS FOR YOU! I would recommend another movie, maybe one that is entertaining."
