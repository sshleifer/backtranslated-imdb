Payback is the game that is played in this drama, and the revenge idea is undone by the absurd action that sets the stage for the fireworks that comes later. Why would a man deal with suspected henchmen with the trophy wife of an unscrupulous mob boss in the gangster's own mansion? Why should an unhappy woman encourage the attention of an utterly alien man and expect him to take her away leaving her husband and boredom behind to live happily ever after with her new love? Surely the hero, here Kevin Costner, must have expected a reaction from the man with the cuckold, who gives the film an excuse to indulge in pointless anger and violence. Anthony Quinn, a great actor he was, deserves better, and Madeleine Stowe is the tragic figure who suffers greatly as she ties herself to her charming prince. Stowe is okay, but her Spanish accent does not work. The cameos of the smaller players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a fading rock star.
