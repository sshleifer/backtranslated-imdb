Absolutely lazy Slasher movie has no redemptive quality. It has Camp Councellor Angela (Pamela Anderson ... as terrible as the killer, her jokes when wasting people is not even amusing) on ​​the warpath killed teenagers who act the least bold or defend themselves for good behavior. We allow the spectrum of boring, stereotyped killings, such as the neck in the neck to a child, looking for his Freddy claw glove. A child who gets a chainsaw, a girl who gets bored, one who is pushed into the crapper (filled with leeches), one who is roasted, etc. <br /> <br /> It has no original idea to offer and is just a waste of time. Unless you want to see Valerie Hartmens (slut Ally plays) tits. Most acts of violence occur outside the screen, so that even these are not satisfactory.
