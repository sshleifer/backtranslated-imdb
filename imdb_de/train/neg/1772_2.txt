"Sleepwalkers" is the first movie Stephen King wrote a script for. Given that and the outstanding Santo & Johnny song they used as the theme of the film, you would expect a strange and ultimately fulfilling visual experience. Unfortunately you do not get that. The thing is, they probably could have made it a good movie. The beginning is fascinating, what with its small town scary atmosphere. About 20 minutes after the film, something strange happens. The movie is funny for no apparent reason! From that moment on the whole atmosphere of "Sleepwalkers" is ruined. after stabbing the pen in the ear of a policeman?!? But do not get me wrong, humor has no redeeming quality. I just rented it again to see if Mabye got me wrong the first time because the plot sounded originally, but I was right. Man, what a waste. I can not believe they have the rights to this Santo & Johnny song. I gave this a 2.
