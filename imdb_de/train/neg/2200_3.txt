I love bad shark movies. I really do I laugh hysterically about her. and the Scifi channel had a marathon of them culminating in the premiere of their new original, Hammerhead: Hai-Frenzy. Based on the previews it looked like it would be very amusing. basically a remake of Benchley's creature. It was initiated by a shark attack 3: Megalodon, which represents Haifilm serenity at its best. I was in the mood. I was ready to go. Bring it up, Hammerhead Mad Scientist Man! Oh god, the movie was wrong. <br /> <br /> wrong, wrong, wrong. <br /> <br /> ill. twisted. MESSED UP. <br /> <br /> This is theoretical reproduction in the worst case, my friends. When a drugged girl gets pulled out of a hovering animation and strapped to a table shaking her head because of the hybrid shark-human fetus, the absolutely insane "scientist" deliberately implanted in her lap, OUT wants ... Jesus monkey. I call that disturbing. <br /> <br /> How it works: Hmmm, thought the mad scientist. My son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life by combining his DNA with that of a hammerhead shark, because sharks do not succumb to cancer and more hammerheads multiply via placenta. Oh look! a perfect amphibious creature! I created the next evolution of humanity! I KNOW! Let him reproduce him! but damn, if all these shark genes did not make my son bloodthirsty; Instead of rape the hot babes, I keep sending to his little jungle paradise. He eats him constantly. But look at this! Among the random people who have landed on my research island through an unimportant conspiracy is the woman my son was engaged with before he died! I bet he will do it! All this leads to a most touching and heartfelt reunion: Woman: You will impregnate me? crazy scientist: no. he is. (indicates that shark person is hit in the tank) How cute. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM. ever.
