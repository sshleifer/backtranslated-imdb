That must be the worst, and I mean, the worst biker movie ever made! And that says a lot because the line of stinkers is long and stinking! At least now we know what happened to Ginger after she was rescued by Gilligan's Island! The terrified Tina Louise (she was probably afraid that someone would see this mess!) Is a stranded motorist tormented by the most disgusting motorcycle gang in film history. But do not worry, fans! Batman, I mean Adam West, because a doctor comes to the rescue in a Hick Town town! Pow! Crush! Boom! Saint Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good points of this "bombshell" are a few nice women, some ridiculous fighting scenes and the still "sexy" Tina Louise!
