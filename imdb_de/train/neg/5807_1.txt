Do not even bother with this movie, it's bad when judged on its own merit, but when compared to the 1972 original (that's a classic), it's awful. By the way, someone said that the movie from 1972 is bad when compared to the book. That's stupid, movies should never be judged against the books they come from. There are two completely different art forms (as if to be pointed out, but apparently that does). If you used this criterion for all movies, "2001" would be an idiot and "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
