I do not see what everyone liked about this movie. The setup was too long and talkative, and when it was done, the main character remained as flat and opaque as in the first scene. After the movie finally brought Cusack to the hotel room of the same name, I had to wonder what would happen here in the next hour to get me engaged. The answer: Not much, only John Cusack has a long, protracted, mental breakdown. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the Cusack character had more depth. , Maybe if his slip-up were a more thorough overhaul of his everyday life. , , Maybe if the film had either bettered or not tackled its half-baked themes of loss and faith. , , Maybe if the film had made the decision to be either psychological horror or exciting horror, and had completely adopted one of those styles. , , I do not know. All I know is that I saw this movie with two other horror buffs and none of us really liked it. Apart from the disconcerting episode on the hotel strip, the alarming, crazy lady with the hammer, and the stupid, witty crypt guard in the air duct, all three of which make up no more than five minutes of screen time, this movie was boring. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from The Shining and use them here with much less impact. Will Stephen King be reduced now to steal ideas?
