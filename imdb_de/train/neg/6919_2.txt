My roommates and I almost got our TV out of the numerous spits when we saw this hilarious piece of pseudo-zen dirt from the 70s. I had read about this campfire for years and searched my local late night TV listings for YEARS in search of that elusive shit. Several years ago, our local ABC partner was known for showing cool films for his Late Night Weekend movie (eg, "Frogs," "Night of Lepus," etc.). Then one day it happened: at 1: 40 on a Saturday night (over 5 years ago) it was there! We had over 15 people and the strip did not disappoint! <br /> <br /> See you! Andy Griffith as the stupidest and most threatening villain since Jaye Davidson in "Stargate"! <br /> <br /> See! William Shatner carries a variety of things on his mind that are faintly reminiscent of human hair (or something organic for that matter). <br /> <br /> Listen! The pint technology of the 70s, where "Chicken Soup For The Soul" sounds like BF Skinner, feels that way. Content that every decade was better than the 70s. <br /> <br /> For those who are still reading ... the plot surrounds a number of middle-class A-holes that choose to soak up their sin --- Chief Chef (Griffith), by contacting him attends a cross-dessert race that spans California and Mexico. They all wear leather jackets and look more Christopher Street than anything else. On the way they stop in a cantina, get drunk, smoke joints (the sight in which Robert "Mike Brady" Reed smokes a joint is a picture you will not soon forget), start a fight, try rape and behave like a bunch of suburban middle-class jack offs. Although I have an excellent copy that I have made of television, I wish it would be released on video so that the whole world can enjoy their half-baked stupidity.
