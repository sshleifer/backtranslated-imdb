About the worst movie in sales now! I love zombie movies and have seen this in the used rack, so I thought, why not? Oh my god, a shame for zombie movies and fans of the genre! Who made this film, has to put away his camcorder and go to film school! There are so many bloody dogs that have put time and effort into their films, and they have something that is not worthy of this movie. I know what it takes to make films, and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time to make Meat Market, but none of that money and time was good to make it. You need actors, a script, a real camera, invest in some books to make independent films. I do not know how you got a DVD release, but whoever did that is either a really good friend or bangs his head against the wall. In Gore films quality is not quantity, the effects are weak! I was so angry that this is actually in the shops and I could not get my money back. Please, if you have seen this movie, write here and put an end to Shlock. I know that I am very tough. I only had 10 lines, so I try to get to the point.
