I still shudder at the thought that EVER would ever see this movie again. <br /> <br /> I saw action movies, I even liked some of them, but this one is over the top. <br /> <br /> It's not just the worst male actor (Sly Stallone) who plays the lead, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the start (why not steal the money while the plane is on the ground it would be a hell of a lot easier) that it takes a person with an IQ less than his number to believe it. <br /> <br /> Also, the plot has no real twists, a three year old boy could guess what's coming next. It's a series of clich√©s (of action genre), with Sly performing even worse than his other films (he was even better in Rambo III, if you look at this movie as a comedy rather than an action movie). Now there is an actor who can not act. A) B) sadly surprised C) anything but his basic face. <br /> <br /> I would like to point out that this film has two factors that some people like. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding, but then you'll see better on the 4th of July. LANDSCAPES are great, but then ... there are documentary films about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see better sights instead of wasting time on this movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, look at another movie. There are hundreds, even thousands of better action movies.
