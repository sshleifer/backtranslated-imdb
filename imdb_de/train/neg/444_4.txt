(SPOILERS IN THIS) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a film about heroic women in the German Nazi era. But it is way too long, it does not touch and sometimes even boring! There are too many clichés and not enough good acting. <br /> <br /> Storytelling is bad. As in James Cameron's Titanic, an old woman recalls events of her life. Well, now we have a point of view. Then another woman is introduced who does the same. It is confusing that both remind of events from the lives of other people! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge about basic storytelling ... How can Riemann, for example, learn about the mother's fate and her mother's interrogation? <br /> <br /> The scenes are displayed in the wrong order You rarely know when it happened. For example, the scene in which Riemann suggests Fabian. When did that happen? The scene looks like it was in the twenties ... <br /> <br /> Riemann's character is of course a talented pianist, well, she's even a baroness! Impressive. Her brother comes back from the Eastern Front, he has received a "Knight's Cross", which he shows in some scenes. So he is a war hero and still a good man who has preserved his conscience. And he gained knowledge of massacres committed by Germans. He even took some pictures! And so it goes on, the stereotype of the cliché jams and therefore the film does not work. <br /> <br /> Basically, Trotta made a chick movie out of what a decent movie could have been. And in the end everything is very simple. Riemann finds a way to bring Goebbels to bed and - ta da! - everyone is free This is not a historical fact, but pure imagination despite the "true story" claim at the beginning. Like "Sass," it is vaguely based on a true event. <br /> <br /> It's sad, but true, this is the typical German movie of these days. It's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
