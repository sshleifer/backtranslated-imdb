Ah, WINTER KILLS is based on the novel by Richard Condon, which is about a conspiracy that killed the President of the United States 20 years ago.

It's not a thriller - it's a worthless crap, perhaps the worst movie I've seen this month, and I've seen a lot of bad movies in June. The problem lies in both the direction and the script, and since William Richert was responsible for both, he should be held entirely responsible for this ill-fated farce. <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are two things that are not right. First, the way everything is totally exaggerated. It's not as OTT as I said, something like the James Bond movie with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but it all has a far-reaching advantage in that actors completely outsmart their achievements. This may be justified if the movie has an entertainment value, but none. As a satire she is very stupid, so stupid that she is almost unsurpassable. Second, the scenes seem to be cut so that they become meaningless. Take, for example, a scene in which the hero faces a slim militia leader named Dawson. Dawson tells the hero that he has 30 seconds, then he cuts off the hero, who is aboard an airplane. The scenes begin and end without rhyme and reason. <br /> <br /> A horrible movie that is about sitting
