When I rented "Unhinged", I expected a big movie. The box even claimed that the film had extreme scenes of violence cut out of the theatrical release (I now have serious doubts that this will be published in the theater). After the end of the movie, I wondered how he could ever get a video release. <br /> <br /> The plot looks like this: A group of three young women driving in a car crashes their car into a tree. These women somehow manage to get to a villa where an extremely sexist woman is. Beyond this point, the film consists mainly of useless scenes that are supposed to make the movie long enough for publication. <br /> <br /> One of the things that makes this movie awful is acting. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, looks like she is reading her lines of cue cards. The other actors are bad, but not nearly as bad as theirs. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technology. Many shots are taken with cameras attached to the ceiling. This gets very annoying in the course of the movie. In addition, there is very little gore, which makes the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this. My rating: 1 out of 10
