Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends poisoned orchids on the wedding day, steals the corpse in his fake ambulance / hearse, and takes him home with his miniature assistant to extract the glandular fluids to keep Bela's wife forever young. Some second-rate actors who play detectives try to solve the horrible, terrible mystery. Bela Lugosi is doing well, but you can tell he needed the money. <br /> <br /> This film is terrible through and through, and most actors would have been better off at the waiting tables, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. Tell someone what is happening in them and they tend to laugh a lot and ask to see the movie. I got the DVD in a discount store 2 for Â£ 1, which I think is a pretty accurate rating. Anyone who pays more would be crazy.
