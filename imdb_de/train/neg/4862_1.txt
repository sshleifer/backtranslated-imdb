This show is one of the worst shows of ALL TIME! absolutely no original jokes and you are always one year late. As in 2009 they will finally say something to Michael Vicks dog fighting. All actors are people who wanted to join SNL, but had to go to the lowest, crazy TV. It's an hour of crazy magazine jokes that are not funny at first, says the terrible John Stewart, who wants bees. So if you have a problem, tell me I would like to hear the opinion of the 3 people watching this show. Family man has expressed it well. "Osama bin Ladin hid in a place where nobody passed, the mad TV cast. There's a reason why nobody sees the show.
