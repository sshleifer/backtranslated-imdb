Acting was weak, but in a horror movie I can live with it, if the story is good. It was not The initial event was a clumsy and obvious trick to worship most children. OK Good. Fast forward to the "place in the country", where they will recover emotionally. I like the revelation of the spirits. OK, cool - this is going to be a supernatural kind of horror story, with some rotted things in our world partly in ... wherever. Then the action draws like a three-headed dog in a torrent of cats and birds - Is there any evil force trying to attack them directly? Is there any evil force trying to attack them IN DIRECT - getting people to do terrible things that they would not really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is a kind of psychic echo chamber where discord of the environment can resound in murder? OK, wait a minute - maybe it's just a small, mentally confused "Delbert" style that misses its mommy and is on a kind of spree, like a K-Tel Norman Bates takeoff? Oh yes - extra points: The only black character seems to be the grandson of a "Our Gang" Pullman porter. The actor plays it as straightforward as he is able to give the lousy dialogue, but the fact is that it's his goal: "All done, Betta, get out, boss!" At least they wrote it smart enough to find GTF there. The play with the little girl silenced and pulled away was definitely scary, as was the chick in the shower. These were just two of many really tasty tidbits in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in a disharmonious way, like a bite steak, a bite of chocolate, and a gummy bear bite. Everyone is great for themselves, but mixed? Bleah! Such potential. Wasted.
