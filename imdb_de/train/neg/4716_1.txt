This show is boring, lame and basically tears all sorts of things to make it "original". First of all: The animation is so ugly ... Johnny is abominable ... and all annoying. The twins look like teenage female dexters of "Dexter's Lab", and Johnny is almost like a smart male Dee Dee (also from "Dexter's Lab"). Second, the plots ... are painfully lame and make it hard to follow. The gags are crazy, and nothing makes me laugh a little ... especially when it tries to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but these alone turned me off. <br /> <br /> Third, the entire title song begins by tearing off the tune of "American Idiot" from Green Day. And although I'm not a big fan of this band, I find it really stupid that they take the same opening melody and then subtly change it to make it their own. <br /> <br /> Case In fact ... it's a big fat ugly hole. 1.10
