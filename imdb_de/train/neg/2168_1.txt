After reading another review, I thought this movie was really good. I like the "B" movies, but that can not even be classified as such. Photography is probably the only reasonably decent thing in the movie. The processing left much to be desired. It was very choppy and staccato. Those who opt for music and sound have done a terrific job. The music was terrible, especially something atmospheric or scenery. If the acting had been better, they could have ripped off the film. Unfortunately I have seen a better role in porno games. If you want to watch a "B" vampire movie, check out "Blood Ties." You will talk much more.
