This movie is little more than bad porn fetish, and that says a lot, considering the similar crap that was made during that time. This was recommended to me by a friend as a "unique movie experience". He was right. I suppose he meant that as a joke. Not disgusting, not even shocking. Only mediocre spectacle and bad attempts of shock art. A bit of inventory, though I do not think the makers of this movie intended it. And yes, as a previous reviewer has mentioned, it's sex with a man in a bear suit. Do not spend a lot of money on that. Try to borrow it if you need to see it. Or contact me, I would like to sell you my copy for half price. <br /> <br /> I may have to watch another film by this director because he has a certain following. But if it does, I'll regret two hours of my life again.
