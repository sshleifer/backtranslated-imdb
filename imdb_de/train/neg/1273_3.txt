I can say two good things about this movie: The scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk performs well (considering what he had to do in terms of dialogue and direction). Nevertheless, I found this movie extremely tiring. The drying of the paint would have been more entertaining. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Starting with the opening sequence where everyone talks and Paul Reiser repeats everything that is said to him on the phone, the movie is annoying. The film is full of clich√©s and falls, not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence from Falk. The director apparently had difficulty deciding whether to laugh or cry. There are a few sequences that touch, but they all make you laugh. If you speak slim, sentimental and sweet, you will love it. But if you were hoping for more substance, look at another movie.
