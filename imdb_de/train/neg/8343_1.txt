Salvage is the worst so-called horror movie I've ever seen. It's nothing so terrible. It does not deserve to be so good in a genre. First of all, I do not see how many people like this piece of crap so much. If I write something so boring and absolutely ridiculous, I would be laughed and too embarrassed to expose others to stupidity. Second, acting is terrible and the lead actress is painfully ugly. Third, the story is shitty, it's been used before and the excuse that it's a cheap movie is no excuse. Read the summary on the back of the suitcase. It reveals the entire story. I do not recommend you to watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste something that you will regret having seen. I feel really bad for these crooks and the irony of their name. Happy Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
