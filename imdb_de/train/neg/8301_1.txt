Really bad. Why someone thinks that this is a good movie, let alone funny, is a real mystery. I like comedies as much as the next man and I loved "A Christmas story". The fact that he has the same director and is based on the memoirs of the same author completely confused me why this film is such a failure on every level. Charles Grodin is terribly bad as a beginner dad. On the other hand, it does not seem to have the same speed - it just does not go well. Everything seems tired and forced. The joie de vivre that has permeated the first movie is completely missing here - you just want the movie to end. I would not recommend this movie for the curious who enjoyed "A Christmas Story". It is so bad. 1.10
