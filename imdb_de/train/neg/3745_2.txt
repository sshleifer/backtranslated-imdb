First; It is very amateurish to describe the way of history only by means of the positions of cannon, germs and steel. The same tried to make Marxists out of economic positions. <br /> <br /> The reason for Western success can not be just dumb luck, the benefits of domesticated plants and animals. We see that all the benefits and bonuses around the world are completely useless if not managed wisely. Japan has no huge natural resources, but Japan is one of the world's leading economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country rich in oil, there is little or no success. Both nations had and still have access to western technologies and inventions, but why such a gap? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Daimond explained that it is very important to understand the factors of cannon, germs and steel in order to understand. Perhaps the main factor of the world difference is not the geography but the ability of people to understand and use things? The mental ability to understand. And in this case geography is only subordinate.
