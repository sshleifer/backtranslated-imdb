I saw this lately and I have to say that I was moved by the factual basis of the story. However, "Holly" as a movie did not quite work. However, I am looking forward to watching the documentary produced by the producers who organized this project because I think it would be a much more compelling work than this film. <br /> <br /> Class actor, but her acting was appropriate, and I have to mention the young actress Holly played. This was her first movie role, and she did a great job, considering that she plays the most difficult role. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was fair, but bland as Patrick, the American whose goal is to "rescue" Holly, but Chris Penn was good in that last role. Unfortunately, these two actors were very forgotten despite my mostly favorable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier and have not done their best work in this film. I believe in the message and intention of the film. But I have to be fair, so I rate "Holly" 3 stars due to his shortcomings as a movie. But I think the topic deserves serious consideration, and I am glad that the people behind this film have also made a documentary that I hope will be premiered on the BBC and other television networks.
