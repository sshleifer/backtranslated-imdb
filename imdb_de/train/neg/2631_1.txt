A bum gives a secret serviceman a clue to a secret service man who wants to kill the president. Nonsense. How did the bum know? The script then turns to the most accurate investigation into how the intelligence works, but who cares? Most of it just slows down the movie. All the chases that follow are the version of this movie of annoying chases of many movies. After many impossible sports, when our hero trumps and surpasses all of his buddies, we have a shooting range at the Toronto City Hall. The Canadians are clearly marked with maple leaves, but how did they get that? At the end everything is clear. But it does not make sense anyway.
