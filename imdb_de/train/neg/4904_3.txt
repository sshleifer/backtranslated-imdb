Teamo Supremo are three kids, consisting of their leader - Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad - all with their own battle cry (buza! Chika! Woopa!) And their outfit and moves. They work for Governor Kevin and were recruited after they wanted to be heroes and play at this game. They also lead a normal life and have family and school responsibilities, but most of the actions take place outside of school fighting. All rogues have quite unique and unique traits, such as Mr. Vague and his men, who never seem to know what their plans are but still act. From a bad robot to a bad baron, the three must meet them and stop their evil, and often strangely they plan to gain power, take revenge. The style seems purposely simple. The backgrounds have an overlapping color and the buildings look futuristic. The music is pretty nice and the show is not all that bad, even though the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> The actions are almost always nonsensical and ridiculous, but at least this is a cartoon and you can not blame them. This would not be in the same rank as Fillmore! or pepper Ann.
