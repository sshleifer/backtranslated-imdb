Lovely Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel knocked her out with fianc√© Henry (Paul Rudd) in front of the "I do's". After two years, Henry has gotten stuck and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very worried. Chloe arranges for Henry to talk to an attractive psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley is to contact Kate's ghost hoping to help Henry get on with his life. As the medium feels attracted to Henry, Kate's mind seems to nip romance in the bud. There are some funny situations. But once you've seen the trailers, you've seen the content of the movie. With in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. Personally, I thought Bell stole Parker's show. And Biggs as usual a pain in the butt. Nevertheless, this film was exaggerated.
