What happened in God's name here? How do you manage to create a kind of cheap tee of redneck zombies? Should Zombie '90 ever entertain anyone, or even earn a dollar, or even a dollar? But mostly, what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was headed by a maniac named Andreas Schnaas in the titles. In the gusset department, this hardly differs from the others here. Although the degree of incompetence ... well, the earth shattering. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead Alive bloody, think about it. <br /> <br Being too specific would be a waste of time. In an accident with chemical substances, the dead return and eat the living. Never before has the concept been treated like this. The Gore effects are a new low point. Just a nightmare of the Z class. I can not say if this should be funny or not initially, somehow I doubt that the English dubbing was very faithful to the original script, but strange things happened. The whole thing just reminds me of an introduction to a Troma movie, except that it takes quite a while. <br /> <br /> I only saw a movie that was worse than this. The Chooper. <br /> <br /> To prove that Andreas Schnaas is a real director, I would highly recommend Nikos The Impaler. If you think you have no standards in a bad movie, look for Extreme Pestilence, but you have been warned. It takes steel nerves to go all the way. But if you are bloody, you may be able to endure this. Otherwise no atmosphere, no, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but mostly no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Updated 07/05/09: After a few more visits of Zombie '90, I had a heart change, or I guess I get it right now. Zombie '90 is weird, so you do not forget the hard words, though Extreme Pestilence still deserves only one star.
