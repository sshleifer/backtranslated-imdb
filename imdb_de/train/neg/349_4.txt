A cauldron, if I have ever seen one. An alleged thriller from "A Time to Kill," "Silence of the Lambs," even a reverse "In the Heat of the Night" with a little reverse murder, a la "Strangers on a Train" is thrown in where all this in high Dimensions succeeded. Namely in the release of thrills. The plot seems to be condensed from a larger book, making the plot's development obvious and unpretentious, while the direction lacks pace and momentum. In order to contain a few kudos, a big turn had to be made, and here, too, it failed noticeably. Connery slows down significantly at his age, barely bothering with his attempt at US accent, and also seems too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of those goddamn children. He even has a father-in-law who looks younger than him. Laurence Fishburne has little chance of occupying his role and you are confused right from the start, whether he is a bad person or a good person. Someone once said flashbacks should not lie - they are confused here. The rest of the game is only average if you play a reasonable cast in their signed stereotyped roles. The alleged climax was also able to roll, anchoring me firmly in the back of my head, not the goal as it should be, the front edge of my seat. Mediocre sloppy Hollywood movie going for sure.
