The premise of this expected sequel was really good and after the big success of the remake, I sincerely expected a lot. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inappropriate. The situations are stupid and beyond reason, and the spectacle is really terrible. <br /> <br /> There are no sympathetic characters or violins this time, unlike the remake. Besides, the Gore is not that abundant, and when it does, it's really bad. <br /> <br /> The violence is minimal and it's a shame, because there are many arguments that make you think that there is room for serious violence. I mean, there's a SWAT team chasing a family of cannibal mutants. You certainly expect something else! When I saw it in the movies, I wanted my money back. Anyway, this is a clear example of how starved movies are a mess and of poor quality in all aspects. <br /> <br /> A mess that left the fans of the remake like me. Therefore, continuations are never welcomed. At least this movie is not as bad as the 1985 sequel to the original.
