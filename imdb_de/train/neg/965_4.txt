At first I liked the movie. It seemed like a nice comedy with stupid moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best !!! The same as the wonderful decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste !!! But the writers have extremely disappointed me. The best ending would be the scene on the ladder, but instead they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. Does not like the end The father becomes friend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it in order. It would be fine if, for example, the scriptwriters say that there is another soul in the body now, but they do not, they only deprive it of memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dance scene :))) ... But some of the moments even spoil the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after her husband's death, waited 23 years for him (it's a long time!) After a scene with her boyfriend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she has the man she calls herself For so many years, very easily betrayed !!! It would be a good movie if not the end and some human psychology would have missed.
