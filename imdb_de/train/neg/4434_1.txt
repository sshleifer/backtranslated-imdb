I rented this movie and thought it looked like a wonderful historical piece. What I got was a piece of garbage. This film was confusing in most places, choppy at almost every point and terrible everywhere. Mira Sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young scholar was at best depressing. Ben Kingsley would have had to be robbed of his knighthood because he had even considered this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely play Petunia Dursley; At least the Harry Potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie. <br /> <br /> The cinematography looks as if a college kid has attended a course in Cinematography 101 and failed miserably. Almost every scene in the movie is hacked for an effect; The end result is of course the hottest piece of work I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost good as Agis; Too bad he had such a bad script he could work with. Rachael Stirling strives as the almost gullible lady while waiting. In the end, I really wish that blockbuster video gives refunds. I'm so glad I did not spend ten dollars on seeing this fiasco in the theater. When you perform this Marivaux piece since the 18th century, I wonder how many people have made their best nap during this work over time. If I had been there, they would not have heard the piece about snoring. Thank God for the modern convenience of DVD players; You can pass the boring or horrible scenes. I think I only saw the beginning and the end!
