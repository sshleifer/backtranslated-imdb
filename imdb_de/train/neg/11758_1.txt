I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's funny in a very terrible way. <br /> <br /> Gael is absolutely terrible, I mean, he just can not act, period. He should give up now, since acting is clearly not his thing. His co-stars are about the same caliber. I'm sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than anyone else! The director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous. Somehow I do not think an Oscar is at stake for this guy. I have never written a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad that I felt compelled to do so. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie, not 0/10, if there is a 0
