My wife and I are half amused by Howie Mandel's show. I also like Shatner - even if he is the most miserable. <br /> <br /> But this is absolutely the worst show on TV. <br /> <br /> Please cancel this show. It's shit for a **. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say is that the girls on this show are hotter and seem to wear less clothes than deal or no deal ... <br /> <br /> The Questions are a mixture of too simple and incredibly dark background. And if Shatner or the candidate say, "Show me the money," I'll throw up. <br /> <br /> This one will not last.
