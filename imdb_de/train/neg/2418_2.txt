The first mistake you make in the title of a movie is to use "of the living dead" without really having a budget for real zombie FX. Sure, that was a zombie flick on a low budget - really low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> It really was not that bad to mention the above, and it turned out to be an interesting twist on the zombie genre. If you get an "R" for violence, you can also give us some good ones Take pictures of the babies being attacked. The women were so little used in this film that they could almost be classified as "gay interest". <br /> <br /> And I'm staying out of Oakland. There were a lot of shootings and no policemen in sight!
