Terry West had a good idea for this movie. He just did not push it through. There are endless shots of the scary-looking school environment that goes on forever, probably polishing up the movie's runtime. Also at this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is good as always, but this movie will always be part of Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the movie in the beginning). If the script focused on her interesting character, we would have a movie to watch. She is so gorgeous !! Good news for DVD buyers: Terry West's earlier (and better) movie "Blood For The Muse" is a special feature. One thing I want to say is that this movie feels like someone who is not good enough to finish the punchline at the end of a long joke. Then watch again for Ruby LaRocca.
