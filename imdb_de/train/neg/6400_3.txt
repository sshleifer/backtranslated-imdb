The comic power of Pryor and Gleason could not save this dog from the web-based conspiracy, the weak writing, the dreary spectacle, and the ridiculous continuity in dealing with this chaos. There are very few memorable moments, but the well dries up quickly. As a kid, I remember this as a Luke-warm vehicle for the two comedian comedians, but the flow and feel of what was being conveyed in each scene was kind of strange and how it relates to the whole storyline. If you look at it again after many years, it screams for Schlock-a-Mania. I am not so worried about racial controversy, as I would not mind if a movie takes on this theme with a little ease. The most obvious mistake for me is that the scenes are depicted as a jumbled, disjointed series of 2-minute situation comedy bits (all not very good), which were stapled together by the editor after a nightfall at the local waterhole. Characters change feelings and motivations at once, without rhyme or reason, between scenes and within scenes, creating the feeling that nobody has any idea what to get out of the script. Not that it was a gem I could start with. I feel bad for the two actors whose legacy has been affected by this catastrophe that should never have been done. Maybe my sense of humor has been refined ...
