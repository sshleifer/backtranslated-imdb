If this movie was to be renamed, it should be "The Jackasses of Hazzard". In summary, this movie is nothing short of 88 minutes of two immature country punks traveling in town and on land with the iconic 1968 Dodge Charger chasing girls and eluding the law. <br /> <br /> I was a fan of the "dukes" and what really gets the movie going is that the characters are getting out of hand. The excessive enjoyment of profanity, sexual relations and drug use has turned the good name of the "dukes" into trailer garbage. In addition to the comparison with the television program, the spectacle was terrible. The only actor to do it right was the 1969 Dodge Charger named General Lee. The others exaggerated the role of the character that tarnished the film. <br /> <br /> The "Dukes" were another victim of the Hollywood TV-to-big screen transition tragedy of the 21st century. Skip this movie and just buy the TV series on DVD. <br /> <br /> My grade: F
