This movie is remarkable for three reasons. <br /> <br /> Initially, this low-budget feature was obviously benefited by the success of the two Superman series and released in the theaters. George Reeves and Phyllis Coates are convinced. first appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is reused in the series. In front of the city of Silby, a six-mile oil well penetrates the "hollow earth", causing the "mole-men" to surface. Forget the other holes (those in the plot). Second, unlike most SF invasion films of the 1950s, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) power in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of differences against an angry mob of racial segregators. No "gentle reporter" here! Clark Kent, knowledgable and confident, takes control of the entire situation ("I'll do it!") And even helps a hospital gown remove a bullet from a mole man! As Superman, he is gentler than Clark in the direction of the lively Lois, but he is also the voice of reason and tolerance when he acts as a "Nazi assault soldier" against the vigilantes. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you will notice that the transition from the fleisher-like, animated flying of Superman in the two series to the live action in the "Adventures of Superman" has not yet been completed.
