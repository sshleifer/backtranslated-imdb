I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate everything about it. it's so annoying and stupid. Everyone says that Nat and Alex Wolff are heroes in the music world and they will make it big. What kind of drugs do you take ??? !!!?!?!?!?!?! nat and alex will either end up as hobos or Jane Hudson from "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" end up. I could not of this one, just 30 seconds of the show, survive another 20 minutes and I managed to survive a half hour "Battle of the Bands". How anyone can cheer on these guys in the audience at the Kid's Choice Awards, I have no idea. Days before the premiere of Nick, most teen actresses Nick showed (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) in a commercial film that influenced the brains through brain dead. firstly, they have not deceived me, and secondly have nat and alex set either drugged or paid them a lot of money to say that and to sound convincing, because I do not see how anyone could find this show it. Movie entertaining. The music is just awful. Nat's vocals sound like a sick, dying moose in a crack. Alex is the most annoying movie / TV character of all time. He's not funny, he's annoying, he's really weird and he thinks he's hot and knows everything about girls. This guy is lucky if he manages to lie down. They know that this show is a fake, if you find that some of the characters do not exist (in real life) !! The character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex cousin Jesse Draper (they had a budget problem). Her father is not single, he is married to Polly Draper, but they do not appear in the show, giving the impression that the Wolffs are no mothers. Rosalina does not exist either. Her name is Allie DiMeco. I'll tell you, the Naked Brothers are going to be in a shit when their "fans" find out that the whole thing is being staged. 0/10
