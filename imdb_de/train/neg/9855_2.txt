Let me first say that I'm a big fantasy fan. This movie is not for me. Many far-fetched arguments attempt to support the film's claim that dragons may have ever existed. The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries, but does not examine them more thoroughly, which could give credibility to the film. The film uses (nice!) CGI to tell us a told fantasy story about the life of a young dragon. This is combined with popular CSI-style TV shows to make it look like something scientific, which it definitely is not. In many cases, the arguments / hints are far-fetched. In some cases, cues used to show that dragons may have existed or flew or spit fire are simply invalid. To see that, I only get cramps in my toes. Even a fantasy movie needs a bit of reality, but it just does not have it. Conclusion: It is a sophisticated fantasy CSI documentary that is not worth seeing.
