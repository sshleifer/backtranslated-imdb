(First, excuse my bad English.) Of course, only a movie with Jessica Simpson can contain serious fools like this. I am a Norwegian, and I felt offended and shocked that the creators of this film did not take the time to make them research on this American / "norwegian" movie. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country. <br /> <br /> So my corrections are out of frustration: -The country is called Norway, not Norway. - "Da" is Russian, not Norwegian. - Norwegian priests never use these black capes with the white paper on their necks because the Protestant church is by far the dominant. - It's true that we have a local traditional folk outfit (which we use only twice a year), but the outfit movie is more of a German outfit. -I could NOT understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this movie. Jessica did not make sense. Neighbors made the "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing I recognize is the Norwegian flag (and the Viking caps, but that's the stereotypical thing people think about Norway - Vikings !: Oh God. <br /> <br /> Well ... I guess the people who made this movie will never read this comment, but at least I cleared a few things and got rid of that frustration ... Me I'm proud of my country and I would love it if people in the US were less stereotyped and more accurate when they talk about this country. <br /> <br /> That's all ... Lenge leve Norge!; p
