Walerian Borowczyk's La Bete (1975) was obviously recorded in different ways: some were horrified, others were shocked, others complained. However, I am completely untouched, bored, and can not stop wondering why the presentation of incoherent, inconsistent images vaguely centered around a central theme is considered an intellectual journey. <br /> <br /> What was this movie about? Growing sexuality in a woman? I've seen great movies on this topic, but this is not one of them. How to try to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person, not just as a narrative means to dream of animals (in nudity). Where there are no characters, there is no character study. The beast pursued by the beast was not teen, the girl having sex with the black butler (is he also referred to as a beast?), Has a very adult attitude to sexuality, so where is the consequence? Is it a movie about religion? If so, we would need a bit more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire for two boys. <br /> <br /> Is it about bestiality? The metaphorical feeling of the film prohibits any realistic investigation of bestiality, especially as a realistic investigation requires realistic characters. So no real bestiality here. Some mythical beasts and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality. Enough for a college essay on the topic? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Is it about sex? Is it something? I dont know. All I know is that showing a fired weapon does not turn a movie into a war movie. Dealing with a topic must mean more than showing your own associations with the topic. <br /> <br /> So look at the controversy. Do not be afraid of bestiality, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and such. I'm not. Consider it if you look at a different story, and you may find that this is a poorly made, poorly edited, malfunctioning, really badly written picture (okay, some pictures are pretty nice and the main character is a really good one looking girl). The cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks to beat hypnotically slowly around the bush makes a story intelligent. It does not That bores it.
