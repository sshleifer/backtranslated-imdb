The plot of this movie is not strong at all, many holes. If you look at it as a car movie, it is not bad, many great cars in this. The reason why I like it is because I come from the area where it was filmed. I am most pleased when I look at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and see how the city has changed since 89. It is an interesting historical piece for us locals. It seems like every movie here is shot, everyone wants to have a relationship with it. It's impossible to find a copy in one of the local video stores because they were all stolen once they were posted on VHS. I had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay. I find it interesting how the drag race goes in the city. I did not know that the director was from St.Cloud.
