It's hard to believe that an action-packed Jet Li movie could be so boring, but that was transcendental garbage. The plot is a mix of other Hong Kong chopsocky strips. The martial arts action is all special effects and not human talent. <br /> <br /> It's a comic story about a group of superhuman soldiers who have to be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of their number (Li) who is rescuing an incompetent army to rescue them a life as a pacifist librarian. The rescued killers re-emerge, with an Austin Powers quality plan to conquer the world, and Li loses his new life to save the world's gossamer plot and 25-cent comic special effect. But I suspect that even Ninja Turtle-watched eight-year-olds would have found this youthful and hollow.
