We all knew it before it aired. The Ron Moore Mini Series is not a Battlestar Galactica. It's good. It just means it has to stand its own. It can not lean on Battlestar Galactica. If it's good, it's good for yourself and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If reports are true, Moore wanted that. However, when his mini-series rots, it has shamed all the great actors that appeared on screen, not to mention the countless off-screen staff. And that's what he did. <br /> <br /> Yes, this miniseries is not a remake. I would not even call it a new show. It's a new production, inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not take place in the Galactica universe, with the same places, the same jargon and technology. It does not tell of Galactica's search for the thirteenth tribe. It also does not rely on the legends and secrets that underpinned Galactica. Ron Moore's mini-series is a space opera, an action film with a solemn nod to Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should say, "just another" space opera, action movie. For as the plans go, he has little original or even interesting. I could tell you the whole thing without spoiler warning. But I will not do that to you. I will just meet the most important point. Ready now? Here it is: Just watch the trailer. It will tell you everything in the story. <br /> <br /> Yes, human creations turn to humans and try to destroy humans. (I think they forgot the rules of Azimov again.) They look like humans, so there's the whole alien among us. At least there is no time travel. Oh, and many fight scenes and random acts of sex and violence. The bottom line was that when Moore of Galactica pulled that ceremonial nod, it was less cheesy than respectful. I mean, could not he come up with something himself? <br /> <br /> I wanted to see something different in the first few minutes. I did not care about any of Moore's characters because I could not identify with any of them. This fact hit me in the face as the Cylons began their attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale, and I did not mind. How depressing. <br /> <br /> Moore's heroes face an insurmountable obstacle instead of overcoming them, instead sticking the dick and saving their own butts. After all, it was the only way to save humanity, Yadda Yadda Yadda. They took the safe route instead of risking their own lives to defend others. At least disgust is not apathy. <br /> <br /> But in the end, Ron Moore's mini-series was just a futile activity, a movie on a treadmill that runs forever and nowhere to go. And I just wanted it to be over. And when it was over, my vitality had been withdrawn. Against my will, I transformed myself into a meaningless, soulless zombie, probably of the kind that miniseries would appeal to. I had to fill up. I had to - and I swear, that's right - I had to watch an episode of Babylon 5. Two episodes, and I felt much better. And happier
