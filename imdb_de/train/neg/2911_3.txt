This movie is overblown, predictable, overbearing and hollow in the core. The attitudes are faithful to the age, but self-confident in their magnification by prolonged exposure. Lingering at artifacts stops the action and the Cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue. Tom Hanks, like Bruce Willis in Hart's War, seems to be sleepwalking. Tom, you can not just give depth to a figure by leaving your face empty! The content did not justify the histrionic action of Paul Newman. This is a dud that is wrapped in a nuclear bomb housing.
