The Canadians are too polite to do anything, but the Toronto Film Festival audience left the theater mumbling that they would rate this movie with 0 or 1 on their voting sheets. The premise is that a modern filmmaker interprets a 17th-century fable about the love of shepherds and shepherdesses who were in the distant past when druids were the spiritual leaders. Working in three epochs offers many opportunities to introduce anachronisms, including stupid and impractical clothing and special spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry. The lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic rules of conduct that result in cross-dressing and various farcical situations. The film could have been hilarious as a Monty Python piece that he resembles too much, but Rohmer's effort is very flat. The audience laughed at the sight jokes, but otherwise lamented the slow pace. The end comes in a hurry and is really terrible. This is a trivial movie and a waste of your movie runtime.
