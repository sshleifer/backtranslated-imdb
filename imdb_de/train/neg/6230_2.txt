I was a bit interested in this movie, as a trashy cannibal film. I was completely disappointed. It was the same kind of disappointment I witnessed on Friday, Jan. 13: Jason takes Manhattan. so much wasted potential! <br /> <br /> The opening scene is a decent rush of attention. then it comes to a stop. copious breasts and outrageous 80s fashion can not help this movie. The only thing that eats cannibal monks near this island is the piranha! I'm not asking about the cannibal holocaust level of Gore, but I was looking for cheap, exploitative gore. I have none of this. <br /> <br /> I found some parts of the fight scenes rather fascinating, hence the 2 stars. I do not think it's really worth the time to look at it. I was able to show it at a party where no-one cares about what's going on, and you just want something in the background. but I would not tell anyone, "oh dude, you've seen this movie GOTTA." it is neither good nor bad enough to demand much attention.
