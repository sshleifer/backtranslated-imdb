On his birthday, a little boy tells his mother that he is not her son and that he wants to go home to his real mother. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Comedy De L'Innocence feels from a different perspective on filmmaking, perhaps the '60s or' 70s. It certainly reminded me of Losey's Secret Ceremony (1968) and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977), both of which deal with loss, grief, and relationships between parents and "lost" children (strangely, both films are Mia Farrow). > <br /> All three films are populated with disagreeable characters who behave in a strange and inexplicable way. All three films feel cool, both emotionally and literally. All three films focus on mother-child relationships, and ultimately, all three films pose the question, "What is real, what is being imagined?" <br /> <br /> Nice but flawed, it does not provide easy answers and leaves a lot to hang on, unexplained and strange.
