This is a well-made informative film in the style of PBS Frontline. The problem is, Frontline has already done this piece and managed to get L. Paul Bremer to tell his side of the story. Even more disturbing is the fact that the director of the film, Charles Ferguson - a former think tank joke, was a war supporter until the occupation went south. What would he have thought? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland went really well until it was messed up by these annoying Nazis. And this is how the film feels - more of an apology for the occupation than a deconstruction of the act of war. <br /> <br /> Ferguson seems to indicate that the war could have gone better - as if any war could be better.
