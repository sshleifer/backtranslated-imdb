What can I say about Seven Pounds? Well, I saw it on a flight from Seattle to Tokyo, and since this flight was long and boring, the movie definitely did not help. Will Smith's character Ben Thomas is almost completely unlikely despite his salvation. The two hours and the running time of the movie waste most of the screen time with random garbage that tears the presentation as slowly as possible. In film defense, the character of Rosario Dawson adds a little life to the film, though not much. I do not understand how anyone actually could cry during this movie when I just wanted to turn it off. Will Smith also deals with a jellyfish at the end, which proves it is the dumbest thing to kill with a jellyfish.
