Well, this is the first post commenting on IMDb. You see, this movie has made me warn all the good souls who will stop experimenting with movies. <br /> <br /> Like most of them I thought about watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors (although I read the worst critics against the movie). I thought I would experiment with it, assuming it's a comedy movie, comedy ... then it all started miserable ... man, you can believe yourself, you feel like you're going and every time to hit the head when the pitiful-looking woman called the heroine of the movie is helpless. Well, how much can a person digest a sick person doing whatever he can to irritate you and keep you from doing what you do. <br /> <br /> The next worst thing the movie is the "ZOMBIE" hero, yes, as he loses his fianc√©, he roams around like a goat, with black markings and his eyes., and with the "awful stupid "sister of the hero. You would bleed from head to toe if you tried and managed to fully watch this movie ~!
