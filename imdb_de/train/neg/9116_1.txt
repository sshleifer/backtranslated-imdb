There is no decent scene. Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you can start anywhere. The guy who plays Sebastian is shit, too. He does not look very much like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. The other two girls are also terrible. <br /> <br /> Then the dialogue is also crap. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (having a threesome): If you can not beat her ... <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who says you can not beat her? <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> The end contradicts the entire plot of the original. The first movie clearly states that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons Sebastian wanted Kathryn so much, apart from the fact that she was played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was "the only girl he could not have and killed him." She was a playful person who liked to play with him. The fact that she never gave him increased his desire. Then he implies in this article that he can have her, along with a girl by the side. What? And we do not see the sex either. It implies, it not only makes stupid, meaningless and contradictory, but also worthless. <br /> <br /> And in the first case, Kathryn refuses Sebastian because he fell in love, which makes him a loser. Although he had won the bet, his chances collapsed. Then he loses himself in this excrement AND falls in love. So she does not screw "losers" but whole losers? Another thing: It is claimed that Sebastian was never in love, so what's the name Virgin Girl? <br /> <br /> In the end, the virgin girl is suddenly exposed as Kathryn's evil lesbian lover (dun dun dun) and as said, they go into a lame offscore threesome. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are several other contradictions. Did the author even see the first movie? A 5 year old can show his stuff. <br /> <br /> After the threesome, Sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin and spoils her innocent mind behind a limo, while Kathryn and Virgin Girl get angry Lesbian In Lame Sudden Plot Twist sits in front, listens and smiles wickedly into the Camera. <br /> <br /> The end ... <br /> <br /> To see how Sebastian became the asshole he was in could have made an interesting movie. I think everything that bothered little Sebastian was a threesome with two hot girls. Interesting.
