I'm one of those millions who consider themselves Cary Grant fans, but I can not think of a single reason to recommend this movie. I do not understand the casting of Betsy Drake and it seems like nobody else did, if we want to Judge from the few films in which she played afterwards. <br /> <br /> Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was great at chasing Cary Grant in "Bringing Up Baby" and catching idea, but it fails miserably. I've read comments about how "scary" Drake was, but I thought that was a much too mild description. Franchot Tone went through this movie as if he were a hangover. A casting disaster is one thing. This movie is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie does not deserve 10 comments and I do not know Why is this a requirement? Too bad, this movie has been preserved when so many worthwhile films rot in vaults. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to torture someone, give it a big berth.
