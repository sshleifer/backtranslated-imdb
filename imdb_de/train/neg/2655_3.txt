** 1/2 for this Diane Keaton farce. <br /> <br /> Somebody should tell Mrs. Keaton enough about her Annie Hall philosophy and her hats. <br /> <br /> This movie is just too much Keaton's daughter Sara dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend survives. Keaton, who was initially not available by phone, as she was in the bag with her buddy and pulled out the hangover phone, mourns the mourners in a new way. <br /> <br /> She retreats into the summer, where all the friends of Sara are. She cleans the house, sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things that should not be revealed. It seems that sweet Sara slept with her friend and the man who married the latter. Besides, she had an abortion thanks to this guy. We are all now on this debt trip. <br /> <br /> Her only hope is to find the elusive diary that Sara kept. She also hopes that the friend Adam, who is a playwright, does not incorporate all this into another piece. <br /> <br /> When the journal is found, it was written in Japanese. Sara has a doctorate in this language. It is not such good news for Mom when an excerpt from the diary is translated by a Japanese chef into a Japanese restaurant. <br /> <br /> Of course everything seems to work out well in the end. <br /> <br /> The title of this Shmaltz comes from The Wizard of Oz. Every time Mother and Sara talk, they would both voice Surrender Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, Keaton says, during this bizarre extravaganza, that Adam is not another Woody Allen. In his film Interiors he tried to imitate Ingmar Bergman successfully. Ms. Keaton also tries drugs with the group. Come on, guys, can we realistically believe that someone who is sane could mourn like that? <br /> <br /> Mediocre best, this movie sums up.
