I could not follow, understand, or understand the story for my life. As the plot progresses, it also remains incomprehensible. I will guess and argue that there was a problem in pre-production / history that was never clarified. The producers could never have the time and space to create the other idea of ​​the many details the novel or novel has to offer, namely a movie about a serial killer and the police's persecution of the killer. They ended up with too many things that happened within a time limit for a prohibited movie. It's a shame because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things, and excellent cinematography. A well-made film that lets you relax and enjoy yourself for a few hours.
