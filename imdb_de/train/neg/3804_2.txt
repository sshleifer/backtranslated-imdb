This is a bad movie of any standard. The story in Match Point had a certain intrigue and direction and writing a certain fascination (Woody Allen mixed his own culture with classic English murder and explored what could be done with it). <br /> <br /> Scoop has none of that. It's badly written, the two leads are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest whatsoever. The genre it plays requires at least some kind of subplot with witty explanations and connections (why are tarot cards and keys kept in a closed space under French horns?). Allen's delightful and witty versions of Various Hollywood Genres (Jade Scorpion Curse / Purple Rose of Cairo, etc.) have brought us so much joy over the years. Even Hollywood Ending had a great central idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration left him this time.
