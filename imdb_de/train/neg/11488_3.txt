It's hard to imagine anyone could find this short a favorite after seeing most of his shorts, but I know that humor is VERY subjective. I've seen all their sound shorts (by far the best IMO stuff), and I thought that was one of their weaker efforts. <br /> <br /> This year (1930), Stan and Babe did 15 shorts and one feature. They were extremely popular and their boss Hal Roach took the opportunity to keep them working. In addition, this was a time of experimentation for the authors and Stan. I would say that this was an experiment that really did not work. As someone else said, it does not play to their strengths. Too many dialogues and actions. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film for me is the largely improvised sequence with Stan as Agnes, the maid, and the great Thelma Todd, who talks about "girl" things. <br /> <If you really want the guys to be the most creative and funniest, check out Blotto or Brats from the same year. <br /> <br /> You made so many shorts in such a short time that I think they are. You can refrain from spending a few less than a pair of shorts. They made about 108 films. Very few (except those made by FOX) were absolute failures, but there are some. District Hospital, Me, and My Buddy, The Live Ghost, The Fixer Tops seem to me to be essentially weak. But otherwise I find something wonderful in all her shorts. A whole record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and enjoyed all the other shorts, you should check them out here, but I'd bet it was less memorable for Stan and baby.
