Really terrible, overbearing, endless movie. Director Bellocchio seems to be enchanted with the handsome face and figure of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him? But maybe, just maybe, he should have focused his attention a little more on making a good, engaged movie. I hate it when a sex movie appears as an "art film" just to become "more respectable". The frequent, occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for the existence of this film. It's a matter of taste whether it's worth it to go through the rest of the picture. (*)
