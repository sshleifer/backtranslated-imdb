A glittering romanticization of the sexual exploitation of New Orleans black women by white men with power and privilege. Oh. Is that your appetite? Well, then come to a VHS or DVD and let this undiscovered trolling meander through a historic section of the story. For a good measure, it is adapted from the book of the famous hacker Anne Rice. The direction is as chic and melodramatic as the cheesy dialogue. Most acting is amateurish. The only worthwhile note of the production is that it employed virtually a dozen black actors, all of whom were barely busy in the market today (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces that were barely seen ( Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). But it's also a great showcase for Nicole Lyn. The pompous and cumbersome James Earl Jones is also available. So is the late Ossie Davis, a minimal talent that owes his success to the connection with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company. This movie should be rated "T" for Tripe.
