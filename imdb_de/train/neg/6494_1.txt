I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor. I was very interested in how he would act as an author / director. I could not have been disappointed by this step. The film was so disjointed and the cinematography was so finished that I wanted to pull the plug out of the wall. The actors were very good, but it was such a talent waste. Not all actors are writers or directors, and Mr. Hopkins clearly falls into that category. Of all the movies I've ever seen in 50 years, this is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. Please do us all a favor, Mr. Hopkins, and stick to acting, where you are excellent, and leave the writing and conducting to those who are talented in these areas. If I could rate this movie less, I would certainly do that.
