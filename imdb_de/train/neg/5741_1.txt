<br /> <br /> I'm a big horror / sci-fi fan, regardless of budget, but having seen countless horror movies late last night on cable and video, this must be the worst of all movies. With bloody special effects (which looked like a bad-blooded or ketchup-covered roast that was shown over and over again) and people running around screaming from left to right, then back again. It should have stayed with the first convenience store scene and stopped there and had been 15 minutes. Instead, it is pulled out for a very long time. It is a very, very low budget. Many scenes were way too long. The speaker sounded very amateurish, as if talking to a random person from middle school. This is the only movie I think is rated lower than Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji and Godzilla Vs. Megalon despite her higher budget. Try to stay awake all the time in one shot, or better still, avoid it as if you were doing an undead, brain-eating mob. The Why-I-Ever-See-This-Piece-Of-Zombie-Dung-Blues. Epitome of bad movies etc..ad infinitum. -Infinity / 10
