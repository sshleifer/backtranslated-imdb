A little bit attracted by the erotic scenes just to realize that this was one of the most amateurish and incredible pieces of the movie I've ever seen. Something like a high school movie project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking? And what about all those stick characters in this bizarre midwestern city? Pretty hard to deal with this topic. No lessons to learn from, no brilliant insights, just stilted and quite ridiculous (but lots of skin if you get curious), video footage of nonsense. And what about this absurd dance in which everyone played his stereotypical roles? Give this one passport, it's like a million miles of bad, wasted film, money that could have been spent on starving children or AIDS in Africa.
