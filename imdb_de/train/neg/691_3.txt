This movie probably will not fit in the barrel of mediocre Slasher movies, but it's certainly a damn bad movie. <br /> <br /> The holiday premise made it somehow interesting, but after the first scenes the movie shows that he is poor production values ​​and stupid plot. I mean, the sub-genre was all about an invisible maniac teen right now, for no apparent reason, but this one has gone too far. There is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add. <br /> <br /> The stereotypes are more than boring, the gusset is minimal and the puzzle too. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty mediocre Slasher entry that should not be hyped even if it has a Video Nastie label. <br /> <br /> I am really disappointed with this overvalued garbage.
