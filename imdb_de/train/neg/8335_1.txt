The package indicates that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are attacking a huge bank robbery, but I did not find that out! I did not get anything! In the first half there is a new character in every second scene (without introduction). The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just a long, annoying, under-lit pursuit scene. There is always an irritating sound in the background, be it a loud clock, a siren, a whistle or even the awful score of Quincy Jones. There are many parts that are also ridiculously bad. For example, the bad guys chasing Beatty on a thin ice with a car! Or the police arrived at the scene about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
