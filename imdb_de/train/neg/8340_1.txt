One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I got so bored that I switched it off halfway to see the news. When I turned it back on, I fell asleep. The movie starts with a dream, goes on with a dream and ends with a dream. Then there are a few dreams in between. Come on, what should I care about? A movie must have a reason to be interesting. The minute you feel that the movie is just a dream is when a sensible movie visitor shuts off. Has anyone ever insisted on telling you their dreams and what it means to them? That's it !!! <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible.
