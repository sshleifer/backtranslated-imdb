A little subtle blow to the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church gets a dark death color towards the end of the show. Throughout the show, dark humor plays a medium through which to ask some common rhetoric questions, in particular, "If God is so good, why does he let evil exist in the world?" Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (though some may disagree) of stereotypical religious teachers who spit out the "corporate lineage" and condemn half the world to burning in hell. To celebrate her school's 25th anniversary, she invites her first students to return and hold their Christmas contest. <br /> <br /> However, when the quartet "updated" to parody Sister Mary's "false" teachings, the nun has been pushed over the edge and history torn into a chain of unfortunate events. The end eventually leaves the audience with a sick feeling in the heart. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Instead, look at the game.
