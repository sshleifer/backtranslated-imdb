What can I say??? This movie was so dumb and stupid that I thought it was a psychotic DRAG comedy - you should rename it "Bitching Pregnant Cat Fight!" What a stupid waste of time, if you want to see (THE !!! "I WANT YOUR BABY DRAG QUEEN)" Jennifer Tilly is her crazy self. Then just rent one of the "Chucky" movies, oh ya, "The Bride" by Chucky. "It's more fun to see the Two Ugly Plastic dolls (one of them turned Jennifer Tilly into the UGLY Female version of Chucky) with Squeaky Plastic Rubber Sex when they saw Daryl Hannah getting pregnant, stupid and stupid, Husbang in A food processor reminded me that my mother wanted to do housework! OK, it's just BAD !!!
