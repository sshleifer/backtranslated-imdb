I found this movie in the horror section of my video library. That seems to make sense because most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's "Dead" trilogy to "28 days later". But if you look at it, you can quickly see what this film really is. <br /> <br /> It's actually a music video that is progressively faster and gets more and more bloody. There is no horror here. Only halfway decent staged action scenes that are soon tiring because they last ... and last ... and last ... and soon you have the feeling that you are a DVD player that was accidentally set back 3 minutes. That's how they did the movie. This is a pity. I think anyone could find a better $ 7 million benefit in the movie industry than this lump. Some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, but once again they were overloaded and boring, as it was always the same stunt, just with a different character. <br /> <br /> Also what makes ROYALLY annoying is the assembling of footage from the arcade game. I played the game. It sucks. Why did you fool it here? Oh, that's right, this is not a movie, but a music video, and that's a poor one too. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence / violence and obscenity
