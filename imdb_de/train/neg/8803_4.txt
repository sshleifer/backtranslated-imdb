I loved "Anchorman, the legend of Ron Burgundy" and hoped it would be just as funny, but unfortunately it was not. However, some pieces are excellent. I found the athlete Champ Kind, who testified to his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team, hilarious. Everyone ignores him and he is getting louder and finally kisses Burgundy, which is not recognized. But on the whole the story does not succeed. However, it is a noble attempt to save the unused portions of the first film, including a complete conspiracy against some fairly harmless terrorists known as "alarm clocks". Saturday Night Live's Maya Rudolph is one of the members and has some funny lines, but basically this unused plot has reason to be wasted in the first movie. The extras on this disk are pretty good. The best two are the filmed rehearsals with a lot of improv comedy, and the faux commentary with Will Ferrell and an "exec producer" Ferrell spotted early on was not even part of the movie in any way, shape or form. It turned out that he is "just a guy" who stepped through the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. It's pretty funny and takes about 10 or 15 minutes
