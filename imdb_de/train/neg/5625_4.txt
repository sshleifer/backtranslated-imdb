Jack London's life was undoubtedly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him. Sad to say, that's what his life was used in the film, was a war propaganda, which gave some of the most attractive parts of the least of his character to face the best. Jack London, barely 40 years old When he died, he wrote some of the best stories. He wrote about what he knew, but he also wrote like anyone else who brings the luggage of his own life experience. Some of this experience on another day and at another time would have been condemned as racism. This, however, was World War II, and London firmly believed in the "yellow danger" as it was then called. <br /> <br /> Two-thirds of the film deal with his life as an author, we see his years as a sailor from where he got the inspiration for the Sea Wolf. We see him in the Yukon in a miner's cabin with a dog that was undoubtedly his inspiration for The Call of the Wild. London was able to capture the spirit of adventure that the world has always enjoyed. The last third dealt with his time as a war correspondent, representing the Russian Japanese War. London was a socialist, but his socialism did not include oriental people. Like several million other he saw the increasing immigration of Chinese and Japanese to our Pacific coast as a threat to the jobs of whites. He campaigned for a strict immigration policy for Orientals. The film puts the car in front of the horse. London is presented as a man who has seen because he was present in the Russo-Japanese War, which were Japan's ambitions, and this is why he was so hostile to foreigners like him. In fact, during the Russian-Japanese conflict, there were no kinds of atrocities that occurred during the Second World War. Japan had its imperial ambitions, but also everyone else, including the US at that time. Our immigration policy, created by pressure from our West Coast politicians, has been instrumental in worsening relations with Japan over several generations. London was part of the story, not a prophet crying in the wild. <br /> <br /> This film was the first independent production of Samuel Bronston, who later produced some movies with slightly more budget than Jack London. If he had a little more money, Bronston might get James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, both of which would have had for the role right. Instead, they got Michael O'Shea, who filmed his second film after Lady of Burlesque. O'Shea is good in the game, but certainly not box office. <br /> <br /> When London covers the war, it meets a Captain Tanaka, played by Leonard Strong, an actor specializing in Orientals, who played a ton of it in World War II. From the perspective of 1905 Strong outlines in the best tradition of Fu Manchu, Japan's imperial goals to the United States. Must have gone great with the Swift Shift set. <br /> <br /> In London, of course, a lot is not included, including a first wife. The second and only woman in this film is Susan Hayward, who does not get into the movie until she's half over. I wish we had seen more of her. Charmian Kittredge London survived her husband for nearly 40 years in 1955. <br /> <br /> In fact, O'Shea met and married the leading woman of his life in Jack London. Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London and they have been married for 30 years until O'Shea died in 1973. <br /> <br /> Maybe one day we will get a look at Jack London, who is much better this one.
