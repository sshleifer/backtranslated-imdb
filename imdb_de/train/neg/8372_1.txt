I can say catastrophically and say unequivocally that in all of my 51 years on this planet, this is the worse (presumably children's) film I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I took my three grandchildren with me and even the laborious 90 minutes they had to fight with a smile. I will leave the sexual indendos for another day, but they were as tasteless as the movie. You should pay YOU not to watch. It really is really terrible, there is no other way to describe it. The people who made this film should be held accountable for taking money under false pretexts. <br /> <br /> Aplogise for my typing mistakes, but I'm so upset that it spoiled the time I had with my grandchildren Regards, Stephen
