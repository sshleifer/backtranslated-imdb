Let's get it out of the way first. , , Yes, this movie steals a lot from "Darkness Falls" (2003). The plot for "Darkness Falls" looks something like this: Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement, kills people who seek revenge. In 'The Tooth Fairy' (2006), the disfigured Tooth Fairy (who hides her face) bares her frantic revenge on just about everyone else. A bit too similar to be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> But you have to ask yourself: If you steal the exact action directly from a movie, why choose as mediocre as "Darkness Falls". ? Sure, there were a few bucks at the box office, but that was just for the pretty good theater experience the movie provided. A low-budget movie with direct video does not have the same effect. And it did not. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, my expectations actually increased. There seemed to be at least some production values. The story did not seem to be terrible, it just got ripped off. After the first scene we get a good cast of characters, including a former secretary (played by this guy who looks like a Busey) and some hot veterinary students (Jenifer of Argentos 'Masters of Horror: Jenifer'). After these few minutes, however, the movie slowly goes down the drain. It serves all the basic horrible clich√©s, including but not limited to: a crazy old person with an unobserved warning, the buff stupid jock, the psychic and the stripper with the gold heart. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems of this movie was its inability to reach a target audience. It's as if the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for the character who was just on the screen. When the adults were on the screen, she felt more mature. When Star (the stripper) and the face (the jock) were on the screen, the dialogue was reduced to a stupid, madly immature level. When the boy was on the screen, it felt like an episode of "Are you afraid of the dark?" , , just less scary. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is omnipresent. The look ranges from pretty good to simply boring. Writing is subpar, as is action most of the time. On the positive side, there are some excessive gore parts (including a rather cool (but painfully predictable) wood carving scene and a pretty devilish nail gun.) If you're looking for a bit of the sexy stuff, there's a short topless scene (but if you have this Apart from that there is not much to do when it comes to this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of "Darkness Falls "Are (are these?), Can you possibly find out to see the story differently ... But that's about the only reason I can find this. <br /> <br /> Final Judgment: 3/10 -AP3-
