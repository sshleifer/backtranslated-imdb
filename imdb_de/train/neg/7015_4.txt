"54" is a movie based on the infamous "Studio 54" of the 1970s - the meeting place for the social elite and party clubbers. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on an actual employee of Studio from 1977 - 1982. <br /> <br /> The film's problem is that everything is glitter and style and not substance. It tries to be a really dirty and investigative satire like "boogie nights", but ultimately acts as a low-quality wannabe. Mike Myers has the thankless task of playing club owner Steve Rubell. It's just a bit of a comedic role, and if these were Myers' best attempts to move into dramas like Lemmon and other comedic actors, it was a total failure, but instead it's just another stupid teenage movie that neither entertaining nor detestable. View at your own risk.
