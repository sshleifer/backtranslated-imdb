Hello, can someone hear me? I do not know why you came to this site, but if you are another viewer of this movie: Join the fan club! This movie was so bad that I could not stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's a must, it's bad in a nice way. Here is every clich√© ever invented for a horror movie. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie, but he should be in the top 10 worst films ever made.
