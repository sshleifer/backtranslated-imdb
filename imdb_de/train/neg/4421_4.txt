The theme is undoubtedly captivating: a group of people loves to go one step further by creating a false medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that plunges into our collective need to "escape" the reality and sometimes superabundance of our existence - something that almost anyone can identify with. The characters are the predictable mix of Lord of the Rings nerds and Star Trek enthusiasts. That's enough to get most people to watch. However, the film quickly evolves into an insider's look at wargaming with an almost stereotypical nose smell to viewers who "do not understand". The filmmakers seem to be taking the theme of wargaming, and this one, waaaaaay, is too serious for the odd humor and fun of making a movie about grown-ups wallowing in medieval robes and swaddling with foam beat. It's quite difficult for anyone who does not sit on their computer playing games or designing the latest star destroyer for 7-10 hours a day to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care about it. The filmmakers, however, do not seem to be interested in focusing solely on the theme of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand. In addition, the characters themselves are not that captivating and you get bored quickly: a big no, if you try to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
