I can not understand how anyone who likes Van Damne might like this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie actually starts with some promises. I would say that the action scenes at the beginning of the film are excellent. The action scenes in which the family station tries to save the twins is a good start and a good introduction to the main story. However, the movie is downhill from there. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice if the director had stuck to the original premise. That is, the brothers are born in different parts of the world and learn so different skills. One brother should be trained in martial arts, the other in firearms. How convenient it is when the time comes for the brother, who has never before taken a weapon, to be a great shooter, and the brother, who has not learned martial arts yet, suddenly splits and kicks. <br /> <br /> The plot, plot, etc. are just ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about Van Damne confronting an armed soldier with an AK-47? The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne, he makes a war cry as if he is leading an ax and running towards him. Van Damne picks up a gun from a fallen soldier and shoots him while he is still about 75 to 80 feet away. <br /> <br /> This movie has one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Yeung is a seasoned martial artist. Instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo throws barrels on Van Damne like Donkey Kong. Absolutely aggravating film that has promised so much. If you're a fan of Van Damne, save your time and watch Hard Target or one of his earlier films.
