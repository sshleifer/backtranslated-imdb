Well, TiVo did that for Angelina Jolie. It had 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. It went downhill quickly. <br /> <br /> Angelina is also overreacting. She is about 20 and plays a 16-year-old. There are three characters that should be Italian. All others are Italian-American. The native Italian accents were good, I thought. The young male lead is sweet, says my wife. Everyone else in this movie is a fat Italian. Even the men. <br /> <br /> I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was cast as a horny doctor, it was a bad sign. The two couples chasing their kids are like the four Italian Stooges. <br /> <br /> My wife would not let go of the remote. I hope she did not take any make-up, clothes or decoration tips. It was a sick and twisted combination of hideous and glaring ones. It was hegagarian. <br/> <br /> Cutting off my left ventricle was not enough to distract the pain that this movie saw. If this movie is on your TV, do yourself a favor and ram your head through the TV screen instead. You will not regret it. The only movie I've ever seen was worse than this: "Hamburger: The Movie". Or maybe "Deadly Friend".
