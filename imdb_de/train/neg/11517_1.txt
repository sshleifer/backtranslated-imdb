I really wanted to like this movie because the critics were not so good (to say the least) ... but it was awful. Really terrible. Poor <br /> <br /> plot, a funny script, a hand-shaken direction ... The look of this movie was <br /> <br /> like a car accident /> <br /> because you want to see how messy it gets. Well, the car is broken and there are no survivors. On the positive side, the camera was <br /> <br /> nice, which made me go on vacation if I just wanted to cleanse myself <br /> <br /> of this unholy one
