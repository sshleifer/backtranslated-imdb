This movie is terrible! It competes with "Ishtar" in the number of embarrassing bad moments. I would have rated it lower than a 3, except for a few funny lines; But overall, this movie was crap! It looked like they had made it over a weekend in a bankrupt resort somewhere. Joe Roth should leave Elaine May at her side forever!
