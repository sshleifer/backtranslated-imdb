Woody Allen, if he's the best, has one of the sharpest pens. He can take close scrutiny and wrap it around a headline like no other. But if he is the worst, his films can stink of pretension. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" has this stench from start to finish. The setup is one of his more intriguing ideas. Four friends sit in a restaurant and discuss whether comedy or drama is the essence of life. To settle the dispute, a man tells the beginning of a story and asks the other two men who argue (one is a comic dramatist, the other a dramatic playwright), whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories they weave. When I heard about this movie for the first time, I understood that they are telling the same story. The genre (comedy or drama) changes only by how you look at it. That would have been interesting now. However, the stories share only one main element and a few minor elements. There are completely different stories with big differences in action. The drama is so stiff and presumptuous that it can only act as a self-parody. If that was the point, it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling an emotional investment in the characters. The comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. Will Farrell was obviously intended as a replacement for Woody, but he could have played that character so much more believably without adding Woody's stuttering and ticks. Woody is the best to be Woody. If someone else tries, he does not play any character, he models a recognizable actor. These kinds of things only pull the audience out of the story. <br /> <br /> My favorite films by Woody Allen make me leave the theater a bit easier when I go in. In that case, I wish I could get my money back
