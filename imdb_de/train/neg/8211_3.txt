I read the book "7 Years in Tibet" by Heinrich Harrer and was fascinated by it. then I immediately grabbed the DVD and watched the movie. I remember the first time I saw it in 98 for the first time, and somehow I liked it. Well, now I have seen it again in full knowledge of the book on which it is based. and soon I realized how wrong it was said: <br /> <br /> When they enter Lhasa, people start to stick their tongue out of their mouths, and Thewlis and Pitt get the impression that it's the way is to say hello in Tibet So they say hello back ... in the book, Harrer explains that tongue sticking in Tibet is a sign of absolute humility and loyalty and they may be allowed to do it before the Dalai Lama, but certainly not for them two Europeans! Not only the mother, but also the Dalai Lama himself wore glasses in public. In the book, Harrer mentions that at that time nobody in Tibet wore glasses (sorry forgot the reason, but it was also explained in the book). The young Dalai Lama did this, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! and what about this Mao-tse-Turtau who is destroying the mandala in front of the young "living Buddha"? childish ... and the tailor did not make any European designer suits out of Tibetan dresses by Harrer and Aufschnaiter! Why are so many events that have really happened excluded from history just to fill the time with a fictional love interest (the seamstress ...) that is completely unimportant? Like the whole story about Harrer's son Rolf. No word about him or a family member of Harrer is mentioned in the book. but that was ok for me, because "7 years in Tibet" is not a book about harrers person. it is about Tibet. I am very disappointed in this "adaptation" of the famous book. And I bet, Heinrich Harrer was also ... 3 stars, just for the cinematography.
