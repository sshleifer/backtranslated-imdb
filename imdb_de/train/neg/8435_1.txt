Very disappointing movie. In the end, I no longer cared about the characters. I enjoyed watching Ving Rhames in a very small part, and William Macy was as always good and still not worth watching. It starts strong and gets weaker and weaker. Insomniacs will like it, because I'm sure it will fall asleep.
