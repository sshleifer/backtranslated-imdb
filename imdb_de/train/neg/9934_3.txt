As a random listener of the Rolling Stones, I thought that might be interesting. Not so, since this film in the 1960s is very "of his age". For me (someone who was born in the 1980s) it just looks to me as a hippy purist propaganda junk, but I'm sure this movie was not made for me, but for people who were active in the '60s. I was expecting plenty of drugs with Stones, I was disappointed, it really showed life, hard work in the studio. So much did I feel like working with them to come to a conclusion of this terrible movie. I have not seen any of the directors of other films, but I suspect they follow a similar directional style, sort of "amatuerish," conveying a sentiment like the Eurotrash television program, badly directed, disconnected, and without real entertainment value. My only good opinion is that I did not waste any money on it, it was delivered for free with a Sunday newspaper.
