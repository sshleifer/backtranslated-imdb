I gave this movie a rating of 1 (Awful). The only reason that there should even be a 1 instead of a big -0- is Ben Kingsley, who always shines, no matter what terrible material is thrown on his way. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is so out of her element Here, as a viewer, you just can not get over the fact that she herself is in such a piece. <br /> <br /> Stupid, stupid story and terrible production. Do NOT waste a rental video.
