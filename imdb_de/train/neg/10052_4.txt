Warner Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast, economical and very entertaining. I really like how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily lives. This is one of Warner's few hard-edged melodramas that simply do not work. Edward G. Robinson plays a relentless editor of a newspaper reviving the 20-year history of a murderer with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a lively performance, but he is surrounded by actors who do not cut the mustard. H. B. Warner, Aline MacMahon, and Boris Karloff are good, but Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell's poor performance in the second leads really hurts the movie. Starr is especially bad during her big dramatic scene at the end of the film. Moreover, the film's moralistic tone seems ridiculous in the context of the Hollywood pre-code. LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual touch, but he can not overcome the bad drama and the unintentionally funny situations. Sol Polito's camera work is strong. Somehow this bitch received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (in a year that gave us "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
