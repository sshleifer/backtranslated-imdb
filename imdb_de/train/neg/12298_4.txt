"Witchery" is perhaps the most incoherent and unfortunate horror movie of the 80s, but luckily it has some compensatory features like fantastic gore effects, an exciting music score and great casting options. Honestly, the script does not make sense, but who cares if Linda Blair (with an exploded haircut) represents another girl obsessed by evil forces, and David Hasselhof shows a handsome photographer (who apparently can not lie down) A film that shows bloody voodoo, stitched lips, crucifixions upside down, fierce burns, and an overused, but really scary melody. On a deserted resort off the coast of Massachusetts, eight random people gather. The young couple is there to investigate the dark history of the place; The dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair, although apparently nobody cares who his father is and where his whereabouts are), is considering the reopening of the hotel and the mouth-watering, female architect has simply joined in for occasional sex , You are forced to stay overnight in the run-down hotel, and then suddenly the previous landlady? an aging actress or something that always dresses in black? It begins to take them out in various enthralling ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence that shows a woman being accused of jumping out of a window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of lesser importance in an Italian horror franchise that began as an unofficial spin-off of "The Evil Dead." The atmosphere is occasionally disturbing and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire movie. It's a very pathological and discomforting thing to look at a defenseless woman hanging upside down in a fireplace, waiting to be fried.
