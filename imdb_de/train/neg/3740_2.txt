The movie was immediately ridiculous. Not that it had no redeeming aspects? The best thing about this film was, for example, the beautiful backdrop. Anyone who does not live on the east coast should know that the south has no beautiful mountains as in the west. I knew it was Utah, but Dalton could not suppress his English accent, so they apologized for saying that this was a southern city. It was easier to put his accent in a southern accent. Sure, the film has twists, but I could not overcome its wrong sense of place. It's not as if Utah does not have a meth lab ... which is why the authors think it's necessary to pretend it's in the south is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Another thing in action pictures confuses me again and again. Why do they always do the "effect" when the character draws an automatic handgun? It seemed that every other sound effect in this movie was a "chuk-chich", indicating that a 9mm sound was loaded and ready to shoot. Of course, the weapons already had round chambers, so this was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, the pyrotechnics were far exceeded. But hey, this movie was aimed at a certain "market segment", I think ... It's too bad. Any actor can act, but this movie was lame.
