After watching this movie, I came to IMDb and read some reviews that compared it to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that, I could immediately see the point of reviewers. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bad attempt to see a similar theme. Interestingly, the format of the movie is almost identical, but the PACING is incredibly different. "10 Items" plunges the viewer through the film's 1-day timeline, while the better-planned "Lost In ..." spans a few days. <br /> <br /> I'm sure some people will see this because it has Morgan Freeman and will be disappointed. It seems that his better roles today are more supportive roles in big blockbusters than the leading roles in less than $ 10 million limited release films and indie films.
