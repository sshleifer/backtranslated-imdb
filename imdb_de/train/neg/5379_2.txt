The Choke was released in the UK as an ax on DVD and is a youthful slasher that fails in almost every department: the story is almost non-existent, resulting in a movie that mainly consists of people wandering in a dark building. With the exception of two characters (who are clearly meant to be the survivors of the movie), everyone is completely unattractive, which means that the viewer should not care less about being slaughtered. the deaths are not bloody enough (unless a short shot of a fake blood-covered pound of beef cuts your stomach); and in the free sex scene, there is almost no nudity (an unforgivable mistake in a Slasher movie!). In the gossamer action, members of a punk band trapped in the world see the biggest nightclub (there are endless deserted corridors and rooms, unlike any club I've ever seen) where they are picked up by an unseen aggressor. For a low budget, the production values ​​are fine, and the performers all seem to be quite capable actors, but with not enough real frights, a reluctance to really get messy (this is a slasher, so where's the graphics splatter?) ), too terrible dialogues (especially from the not-soon-enough-drummer) and some bad advices for using video techniques to add some style, the movie gets boring quickly.
