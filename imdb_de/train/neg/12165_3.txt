So Angela is grown and got therapy and surgery to turn her into a real daughter rather than the son she bore and now has a job as - wait for that - a camp counselor! How fitting, right? I know, I love it. However, the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp series follows all the rules of the horror episode - more blood, smarter kills (which are not resourceful, but still more than the original), more nudity, a more complicated plot, and more worse than the original. <br /> <br /> It's just as entertaining as the original, as the characters and wardrobes are so stupid and so authentic 80's that you can not help but laugh. At some point, a man asks Angela and she says "I'll call you" and then leaves quickly. The guy says to himself, "How will she call me? I do not have a phone!" and then he sniffs his shoulders and wonders what she has turned off (it's the hair, buddy !!). It is a known fact that in 80s Slasher films the murdered youths were more often not punished by their killer for some bad behavior, mostly because he is too promiscuous. When I first came to the horror movies and saw the Friday 13 movies for the first time in the mid-1990s, I did not know that. I learned it in a movie class a year or two later and was amazed that it was a method for insanity. I was quite impressed, not only that the films were kind of message, albeit morbid, but there were also some considerations. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! Just before Angela kills one of her victims, she says, "Let this be a lesson, say no to drugs!" Really decent screenwriting, guys. On the other hand, the dialogue is the most entertaining in the film. Angela (who, by the way, went through all these therapies and these surgeries and all the effort to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and well-developed person, and then changed her name from Angela to umm, Angela) eventually says, "Me I do not like being the evil witch of the West, but I know what happens when things get out of hand. " (People start getting killed by me! HA!) Then she asks that one of the counselors, Mare, apologize, to which the girl replies, "I would rather." Mare! "I'm sorry, Mare, but you really did drive in ... <br /> <br /> Two years ago I was a camp counselor in a sleep camp, similar to the one in this movie (except the camp, in I have taught) had more than three children among the 15 or 20 advisors and there were also rules that the one in the film does not know, which has led me to notice the myriad discrepancies in the film about life in the camp /> <br /> That's alright, with so many 9-year-olds you can hardly shoot a movie like this, even though some 10- or 11-year-old kids were killed in this movie, something I had not seen before. <br /> <br /> Definitely bad taste, even for a cheesy 80s Slasher movie ....
