The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came out in 1993, reportedly on the Japanese television show Sentai, which began in the 1970s. Well, as a fan of Japanese action movies and series, you'd think I'd get a kick out of this show. <br /> <br /> You could not be wrong. What has worked in the Japanese version has become a total abomination of television with powerful morphine power rangers. MMPR is based on five teenagers who are getting powers to become costumed superheroes whose robot dinosaurs make an even bigger robot. <br /> <br /> Well, that premise is far fetched and ridiculous than anything else in any of the Transformers movies, but the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> Two really bad guys followed, and I mean, really bad movie tees, and the actors starring in this series are completely gone from the scene. <br /> <br /> If you have to decide, try to see the Japanese Zyuranger series instead. <br /> <br /> And what about the awful long haircuts of the 1990s and all the boys' earrings? That makes them all female!
