This movie was amazing. It is more than cruel. I often meet with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find terrible movies to look for their comedic value. My friend suggested this, but when we saw it, people started walking. I really wanted to finish it just so I could say I had it, but I could not. It is so bad. Terrible running gags, lame acting. The main characters are an annoying dinosaur Klutz and Whoopi Goldberg. I would rather watch Costener's The Postman twelve times in a row than see a fraction of that movie again. I think they are trying to cope with some dinosaur discrimination issues, but the really notable part of the movie is that the dinosaur is constantly knocking things over with his tail and laughing at them. It hurts. Take a look at it, if you're an aspiring masochist, otherwise leave it alone.
