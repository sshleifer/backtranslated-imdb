I tend to watch bad movies often, and the original sci-fi channel movies are usually one of the best sources for these movies you can find. I'm sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw the sand of oblivion. The acting was atypical, in contrast to the nefarious presentation that Sci-Fi usually holds for us. There are a few cameos made by people you would most likely recognize, though you may not know their names by heart. The CGI special effects are minimal, and so one of the biggest sources of comedy in a science fiction feature is missing. Sure, there are some funny moments when a man is beheaded by a bulldozer or when the main character dies his friend to save a girl he's known for a few days. They roll with laughter on the floor and I stop this for a big disappointment. If I rate it on a 10-star scale that was made specifically for the ratings of television movies, I would probably give it a 4, maybe even a 5. A real shame that I might have until the next sci-fi original movie wait to make a good laugh, and I really hope that this movie is not part of a general quality enhancement in Sci's Original Films.
