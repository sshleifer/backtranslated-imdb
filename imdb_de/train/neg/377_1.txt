Do not even ask me why I saw that! The only excuse I can find is that I am ill with bronchitis and too weak to change the canal. :) It's too terrible for words, the movie is not the bronchitis. The acting is regrettable, Richard Grieco makes it a trigger serial killer who leverages the gun with a penchant for shooting police. Nick Mancuso is on his way in a performance as a police officer on his way and Nancy Allen manages to take the only sympathetic role in the entire film. The script is somber, peppered with cliched lines: "Are you ready, Pardner?" purr Richard Grieco to each of his victims. Avoid Dire.
