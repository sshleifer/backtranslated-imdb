I go to UCSB and take lessons from executive producer Alison Anders. She is a great teacher and director. Everything she gave her name to, I thought, must be pretty good. This film as an option at the Santa Barbara Film Festival seemed like a good choice. <br /> <br /> Although this film contained some nice shots and film footage, the lack of history and coherence has really taken away everything it was trying to achieve. My main problem was that this was someone's first movie and you could obviously see it. Bad acting and an even worse screenplay prevented this film from getting on its feet. The soundtrack contained some beautiful music that gives a sense that the main characters are having trouble dealing with the sadness that has led him to leave and now return to the place where he grew up. All I have to say is that, despite the movie's better crafting, lack of story and performance has really prevented it from doing well.
