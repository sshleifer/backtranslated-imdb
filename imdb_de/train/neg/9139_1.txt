I do not know what this movie is about - director Sam Mraovich has somehow messed up every little aspect of this movie. I would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist, but this movie is perhaps the most important of all times. This movie should only serve to undoubtedly be "The Worst Movie Ever". I've seen bad movies in my life, but somehow, what I think is bad breaks into something much more difficult. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is hilarious, but the funniest thing is that Mraovich himself considers this a great movie. <br /> <br /> Oh wow ...
