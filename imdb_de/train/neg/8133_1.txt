The movie is just as much fun as the view into the sun. Sheriff Pataki is a total retard that does nothing better than sit on his fat heel and make a smoke out of his swollen cigars and drink alcohol while the doctor acts like a zombie version Nicholas Cage soaked up the whole thing "Blood" on, which in reality seemed like Fruit Punch. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, plotting seemed very awful, even calling this piece of crap a movie. The rest of the characters In this movie, it's all a waste of time, the end was awful, the outlines were cheesy and the scenes were awful. What else should I say to your viewers? My advice would be to record your rabies if you've already seen the movie. This film can give you the foam in your mouth if you have not taken any recent shots.
