I reckoned with the various sci-fi and thriller movies this summer, but was so disappointed with this movie. While some people left the movie, I decided to stay just to laugh with the other moviegoers about acting. I was almost as confused as the main character of the movie. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the soundtrack. This is one of those up-and-coming star movies that they will regret later. In retrospect, I would not even rent it, let alone pay more than $ 5 to see it.
