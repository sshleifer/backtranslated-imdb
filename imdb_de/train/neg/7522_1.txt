Wow ... where to start ... I picked this up at Big Lots for only $ 2.99. That's three dollars I'll never see again ... anyway ... and for what? I will tell you. An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring entertainment and college staring that seemed more appropriate for a lifetime movie than the horror movie quoted on the box. (May the marketing droids that designed them burn forever in hell). Follow this with a bit cheap Gore (not even a good Gore ...) and a plot twist at the end that comes from nowhere and makes no sense. Terrible, terrible, terrible ... <br /> <br /> Were there any redeeming qualities? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs scale, six breasts were involved, but that's hardly worth my long loss of three dollars. Without them, this might have been on Sci-Fi at two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmovie freak
