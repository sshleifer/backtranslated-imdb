I saw this in an Arty movie that also featured "Last Days" and some Charlie Chaplin movies. Because of the quality of the other features, I decided to give Immortel a chance. I almost got out of this movie and I like science fiction! The story takes place in a futuristic city of New York, filled with Blade Runner-style sky ads and some similar debates about clones / synthetic humans. Unfortunately, the script was not compressed enough for a forty-five-hour movie. There are three groups in this world: humans, artificial humans and Egyptian gods. The artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and to control the politics of the city. The humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid (after the model of the Great Pyramid of Khufu), which has a worsened appearance and leaves a smooth "cap" on the pyramid. Would not a futuristic floating pyramid be in perfect condition? The pyramid stands over the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it is there. I will not bore you with the so-called plot, but there are many unnecessary gore and many rough out-scenes. The movie, as I said, seems to have been influenced by Blade Runner and maybe The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film, the thank you went to Great Britain, France and Italy. The film is French but uses British actors who do not speak French. It is therefore obvious that their French dialogue has been synchronized. This is a distraction and I also thought that switching between real people and animations is quite distracting. It does not help that the animations are bad - no better than a video game. Skip this.
