Before the publication of George Romero's genre-defining Night of the Living Dead, zombies were relatively well behaved creatures. They certainly had much better table manners in earlier times. But aside from the social etiquette, what arousal had these early zombies exposed to the public? Judging by this movie, no. <br /> <br /> The story is about an expedition to Cambodia whose purpose is to find and destroy the mystery of zombie confiscation. One party discovers the secrets on its own and sets about building its zombie army. This movie is basically a love triangle with zombies. But since this is a movie from the 1930s, the zombies mentioned are more somnambulists than the carnivorous variant that we think of today. They seem to respond more to thought control than to insatiable appetite. And honestly, the "revolt" is a bit too little. The whole thing is really boring. Apart from the lack of horror, there are no exaggerated melodramatic plays that entertain us. It seems unlikely that 70 years ago this could provide much entertainment. Take a look at it, if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the title, but otherwise I would advise skipping it.
