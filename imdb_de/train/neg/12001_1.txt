My sincere advice to all: Do not look at the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not go near the theater where this movie is played !! even a quick glance is harmful to your health. seriously no jokes. It is 3:30 in the morning. and I have returned from this craziest movie in this universe. FOUR HOURS DAMN !!! I am proud that I survived! If this is called survival, I am very frustrated. upset. disappointed. It was a waste of time! Money went down the drain! no plot I hope to wake up tomorrow, healthy and with no memories of this night !! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day for all :)
