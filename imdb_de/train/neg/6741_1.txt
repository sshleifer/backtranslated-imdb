Seriously, I'm all for wild romantic comedies and getting pulled into Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas ... but this movie? It makes no sense !!!! And I'm not even talking about the willing suspension of unbelief that makes no sense. Why is her family living in England? Or at least, why does not she have a British accent? She is certainly familiar with her father and surprisingly forgives that she has not been there in the last two years. (Nobody makes a big deal on this subject because she's gone so long). And what about the silly outfits at the bachelor party? I will not even understand the fact that the companion she has paid for falls in love with her - that could be overcome by better filmmaking. I'm just saying that the characters, the scenery and the storyline are not worked out enough to make an even coherent story. Oh, and worst of all, in my opinion, the filmmaker consistently uses the unflattering angles in the nose of Deborah Messing - I would have sued the filmmakers if I were them! I mean, honestly, I'm all for women who are who they are, but why have not I realized how incredibly funny their nose is in seven loyal years of Will and Grace? Oh! Because these producers are nice to her! This movie is, like my other least beloved film, Armageddon, the guilt of the filmmaker, not the actor. I can see both Brass and McDermott in these roles with a better author, director and producer. <br /> <br /> This easily brings my voice as one of the worst films I've ever wasted time in. I'm just glad that a friend lent me her DVD, so I just wasted time. If there was a way to do that rating with ZERO stars, I would do it.
