The point of the far-reaching preparation phase of this star is Born's story seems to be the ultimate success, all the more exalted. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as an inarticulate young woman who is self-confined but never convinced as a stage actress of growing fame benefiting both from this separation and from her. Even in the long scenes of Esther's acting class we never see the teacher's instructions. After suffering pain in a painful detail from Esther (mostly self-inflicted), we have no convincing impression of her triumph. The obsessive presence of the heroine's pain seems to be a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence. However, the causes of this pain (poverty, quasi-autism, Judaism, sexual betrayal) never come together in a coherent context. A 163-minute film with a simple plot should be able to knit its loose ends. Esther Kahn is still not ready to kick the crowd.
