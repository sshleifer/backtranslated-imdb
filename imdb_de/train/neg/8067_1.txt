Let me first say that this must be on top of my list of boring movies. Nothing and I mean nothing in this movie is even exciting from afar. Most of it is very confusing and in the process of progress you just wish it would end !! Some people want a movie that makes them "think" the whole thing that I'm saying ... "more power for you" !! I just want to be entertained. What brings me back to this stinker, entertainment is not. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. Seems that most of them agree. Most of them did not make sense, and when you think a scene would have found another lame scene coming by, and ... well, I think you see where that leads. Avoid that sucks .... bad !!
