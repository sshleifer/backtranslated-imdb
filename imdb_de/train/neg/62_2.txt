SWING! is an important movie because it is one of the remaining black-produced and pre-theatrical films from the 1930s. Many of these films have deteriorated so much that they are hard to beat, but this movie is in pretty good shape. It's also a great opportunity to see many of the talented black performers of that time shortly after the heyday of the old Cotton Club - a time that's almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the film is of historical importance and has some nice performances, it is also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era - including a prima donna that will ruin the show and the surprise that seems unknown to save the day. However, the writing is just awful and a bit trashy - and projects images of Black America, which some see as something humiliating. Because before the conspiracy really gets going, you'll be treated to a no-account idiot who lives off his hardworking wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when caught by a Huss (who, by the way, is totally excited) excels this role), they have a fight that looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And one lady wants to cut the other lady with a razor - indeed a trashy scene! Later in the movie, when the prima donna behaves abominably, her husband slaps her face and everyone applauds him! It looks like the film sometimes wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience, plus they can not even do well - with some of the worst acts I've seen in a long time. <Br /> <br /> However, if you can come across a lousy production in every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and bad writing), it might be worth a look so you can see great singing and tap dancing - as well also catch a glimpse of the forgotten black culture. Just do not say I did not warn you about acting - it's really very bad!
