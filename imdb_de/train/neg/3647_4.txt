It's a good thing that I did not watch this while I was pregnant. I definitely would have cried my eyes and / or vomited. It was kind of cruel and mostly disturbing. I personally thought the baby was adorable in its own twisted way. Anyway, when I woke up as a mother, when Beth stabbed herself in the stomach and Virgina no less dismissed the child during her third trimester with rusty utensils. I almost cried when she scratched the cat into a bloody porridge. How scary and scary, how the baby was I praised it for life. And as twisted as the movie, I'm extremely excited about the sequel ..... ......... ....... ......... ...... ... ....... ........ ...
