I watch a lot of movies. I saw the original wargames years ago and loved it. Computers were still "a big mystery" to most of us and the movie was convincing in its own way. <br /> <br /> This movie, however, looks like a low-budget special on Wednesday. Dead crap, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The plot is so weak that you will not believe it until you see the movie (which I can not recommend). I can not point to an actor who did a really good job in this film. But hey, with this script I would have been surprised if ANYONE could do a good job. Many clich√© scenes. CGI looks like it was taken out of the '86 version. <br /> <br /> Bah, no, I'm in a bad mood when I write about it. DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to waste looking at crappy films.
