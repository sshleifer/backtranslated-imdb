I just found the TV show "Mash" banal, preaching, oh so "politically correct", repetitive, overbearing and the biggest sin of all, and that is,? that it is incredibly boring. They have Alan Alda as the lead actor "(star)", who is so in love with himself and his wisdom that I was actually uncomfortable even sitting through an episode. The original series had both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, who, I would admit, had a certain verve and style in their character depiction. Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both single and compound, are like caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, whom I also found boring, was no wonder, and Gary Burghoff, who was good in the movie, got tired when he was playing and acting on the show. Watching a show a year has shown me that. Jamie Farr was just a "comedy" and is not even worth mentioning here. The reason why I did not give him any (one) rating, which everyone who reads this now wonders is that ratings of any kind are not just a subjective, but a relative rating. Television is, with relatively few exceptions, so crude. In relative terms, Mash had a certain production quality (according to television standards) from then and now, and that's why it deserves two. Rob Ritter
