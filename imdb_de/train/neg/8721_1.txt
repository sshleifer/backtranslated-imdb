I'm sorry, but that's just pathetic. The little girl was a brat, they were not funny characters and the plot sucked. Besides, it was not even an alligator, as the movie would have us believe. If you look at a complete guide to reptiles, you will find that it is really a crocodile rather than an alligator. Obviously, they have not hired a real animal expert, or they would know that the creature is a crocodile. It's a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the end. I almost fell asleep with this.
