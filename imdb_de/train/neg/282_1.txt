What was an exciting and rather original Fox series has been reduced to meandering minds. In the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly must list, and not just because of Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Fox executives decided they needed it "Plotline fine tune In three episodes of the season opener, they totally lost me as a spectator (not even to see Jessica Alba!) too ridiculous and amateurish for new characters added in Season Two, the new moves stretched the show's continuity and credibility too thin, and in one episode of season two, they had even slept and dreamed of Max - where in the first season it was stated that she could not sleep biologically, the moral of the story (which Hollywood never gets): if it works, do not screw it up! <br /> <br /> Azjazz
