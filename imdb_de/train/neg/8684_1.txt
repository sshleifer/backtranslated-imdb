Abyssal with a big "A". This must be one of, if not the, most unrelenting show on TV right now. I'm about as bumpy as it gets, but this show does not even make me laugh. What you think of Bush as President has absolutely nothing to do with whether you like this crap show or not. The "jokes" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene where lil bush has his underwear on his head: "Welcome to the camp al-qa-eeda!". It is NOT funny about it. Should it be a joke at all? The commercials shown in the weeks before the show were a bit funnier than the show itself, and that's just sad. Hopefully this will not even be considered for a second season. It should not have even had a premiere.
