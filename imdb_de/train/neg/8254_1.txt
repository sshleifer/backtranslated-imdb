I've seen better production quality on YouTube! I feel sorry for the actors because the writing was horrible and the direction was shocking, not sure how they could bring out the lines - I really doubt any actor could save this movie, no matter how good they were. The characters were not developed at all and there was no real cohesion in the plot that simply did not seem to go much anywhere. It's really a shame, because the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality, director and script there could have been a decent movie. It was certainly not a comedy, unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing - which was amateurish, even the English actors sounded weird.
