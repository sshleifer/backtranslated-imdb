I finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago. I still can not believe what I saw. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the worst movie ever. If I listed all the mistakes in the movie, I would need many sentences for this review. (Very funny mistakes because they are so bad) <br /> <br /> You must be surprised with the skills of Amazed the commands that are supposed to save the plane. They did not even know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice-t is such a bad actor ... and what I do not understand is how production wanted him to be like a hero, but he's a zero. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest flaws will be landing a 747, which only needs 3 or 4 tips from a man in the gearbox to land the plane ... amazing .. as well as the dead bodies that way good as no blood had. <br /> <br /> But I strongly recommend to watch this movie as it is very interesting to see how bad something can become
