As a big fan of David Mamet's films and plays, especially his first movie House of Games, in which Joe Mantegna starred, I expected great things from this film. Instead, I was annoyed by the film's superficiality and lack of credibility. Racial advances are left behind without feeling and without meaning, hoping to build up a racial tension that has never manifested itself to me. Identity is completely re-evaluated and people become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Due to his oath as a police officer, the main character relentlessly refuses to carry out a relatively small action that could harm anyone and possibly save lives, yet carries out another action that is very violent and very illegal but still refuses the minors action , In addition, an incredibly incredible signing of a man who killed his family is only introduced for a conspiracy that was almost exclusively advertised with skywriting, and the policeman's response to this incident goes far beyond all reasonable limits. Needless to say, after expecting another thrilling thriller from David Mamet, I was extremely disappointed, to say the least. 3 out of 10.
