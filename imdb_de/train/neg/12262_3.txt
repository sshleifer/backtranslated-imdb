Fans of creature movies have to endure many terrible movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid, superfluous Pulp Horror titles about ridiculously large animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful as we have already had to fight through the abysmal "Crocodile" (led by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and "Lake Placid". Blood Surf is just as bad as these other movies and? on top of that ?? it likes to exaggerate enormously. The saltwater crocodile is supposedly 90 years old, over 30 meters long (!) And it's fun! During the film, he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of totally stupid surfer dudes and dudettes looking for new thrills surfing in a shark-covered area. The only nice thing about this movie is the tropical place. Although it is a totally inappropriate backdrop for such a movie, lagoons and nature are wonderful. Every other aspect is just catastrophic. There is a lot of blood, but it looks fake and ridiculous. The dialogues are really painful to hear! You will not believe that some of these lines have these actors to say! I know that surfers should be a mentally underdeveloped group, but I hope they are not so stupid! At the beginning of the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as a "mechanical toy," but the crocodile paint here looks at least ten times less than the great white of Spielberg. The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateurish and the massacres are not impressive. I will not say too much about acting as it is secondary in such jolts. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their breasts bounce happily as they run away from the beast. You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. It's going to be so bad again. But 'funny' for a totally different reason than James Hickox intended.
