It seems like everyone can make a movie today. All you need is a camera, a group of people for your cast and crew, a script and a little money and money, and you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation, and these low-budget films often turn out to be duds. The shelves of the video libraries are filled with these so-called films. These are not even guilty pleasures, they are just a waste of celluloid that is better forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for making garbage cinema, but most of their films are b movie gold. However, some of the films they released had nothing to do with producing, and others like Nightmare Weekend did not deserve any form of release at all. <br /> <br /> Pros: The performers do the best they can with the lousy material. Unintentional pleasure. Moves at a good pace (should be at 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Horrible writing that includes lazy dialogue and countless storylines. Badly illuminated, especially the night scenes and the end that you can not recognize at all. Makes no sense. Badly rated Cheap and very outdated effects. Total lack of character development and you are interested in no one. This is supposed to be a horror movie, but in this area he lacks it and is not the least bit scary. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Loaded with unnecessary padding. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I never thought that this was a forgotten gem, but I never thought it would be that bad. I do not know if it's the worst movie ever made, but it's a definite contender. Troma should let this movie rot instead of releasing it. Do not make the same mistake as me and let your curiosity do the best you can. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
