OK, the story - a silly madman lives a bored, young chick and her little brother and wreaks havoc in her life - is slightly interesting. However, ideas are nothing (everyone has something ...) - the execution is everything. <br /> <br /> This bothered me with this movie. And it bothered me a lot. The rhythm (direction, cut) was slow, the tempo was uneven and the climax was to be expected. We've seen these lost highways five, six, seven times - why? The problems of the Norton character were seen as a childlike game, not deep enough to understand his problems / soul / blah and fight back for or against him. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just an idiot? References to the "taxi driver" were ridiculous and unnecessary and certainly not for this movie (or on E.N.). <br /> <br /> And in my opinion he ends up being cowardly. Cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers anywhere in Central America. This guy should have killed the boy, accused the father and created a real havoc. Or the boy should have killed his father at the end, etc., but no, we've gotten a cheesy end where children miss the idiots, the father is confused about his own life and his relationship with them and the Loony dies of course. The happy, dysfunctional family remains uninjured, safe and happy bored so we can enjoy our popcorns undisturbed. <br /> <br /> And this scene where the rags enter the movie, oh my god, I would have to think long and hard to find anything other than that! They do not photograph such a scene with a hidden camera and a hidden crew. The creators of this movie probably thought that this was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. If you're a 16-year-old girl anywhere in Kansas, nowhere or anywhere, and dreaming of having sex with a crazy man twice your age, OK, then you can enjoy this movie and his message.
