I had the opportunity to view this film as a member of a test audience, and the only thing that kept me in my seat was the chance to complete the survey after the screening. The biggest problem of the movie was the lack of a main feature. Instead, it consisted of (too) many subplots competing for screen time. As a result, there is not a single character that is designed so that the audience can form any kind of bond. What the director and producer did not show us why we should care what happens to the characters. In fact, a single signature and its associated characters could have been completely removed without seriously affecting the movie. (The time gained would have allowed for the much-needed development of the remaining plots and characters.) Simply put, the Hungry Bachelors Club's plate is overcrowded with side dishes and starters when an entree is offered.
