This movie looked like it might be good at first, but never lived up to expectations. The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of the Asian directors). He does not know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it. The story was fragmented and seemed to go in all directions throughout the movie without finding a solid, explainable, interesting angle. Basically, the film never fits the explanations in the press releases. The acting was very good though. All the actors have performed well, and Jude Law has been as outstanding as he always is. It's too bad he chose such a weak movie.
