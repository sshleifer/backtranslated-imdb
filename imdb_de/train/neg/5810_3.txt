SPOILER'S THROWING ROOF: <br /> <br /> The Gettaway is mostly an action movie. And what is there to do !! Shootouts, car chases, dumpsters and much more. It plays Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coys. <br /> <br /> This is a remake and I have not seen the original, but I really did not care, though Bassenger and Baldwin have some nice screens chemistry. But the movie itself did not do that for me. <br /> <br /> The gettaway was very tiring very quickly. The action is overshadowed by battle after fight, and as the violence continues to build up, Bassenger and Baldwin keep their great looks, no matter the dangers they may be. In fact, at the end of the movie they almost see BETTER from the beginning. I do not think Bassenger's eye make-up moves throughout the image. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, at least not, but it's not very good and unless it's an action movie purist I can not really enjoy, because there is not much here. The Gettaway is also not very original and goes from unnecessarily brutal to quite boring. It could have been better, I think. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin give OK appearances, but they have little to do except to be hunted and run for their lives. Sometimes less is more, if you keep seeing the same thing, it gets stale. I did not enjoy it very much.
