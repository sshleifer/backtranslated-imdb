I really do not have anything new to add, but I just had the feeling that I had to comment on this sack. So here's: <br /> <br /> Horrible. I am running through my MST3K DVD collection and have just watched Hobgoblins for the 10th time. It's really very painful, but it was next on the list ... You can see that among all the crap "hobgoblins" a tiny core of a real movie is buried, but it could not come out. Everything about this movie is the 4th installment. The story, the drama, the effects, the women, the "action scenes" that ... ahhhh, forget it. I can watch a piece of crap like "The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z" (aka "Zaat") over and over again with little negative impact (I actually like it - by the way, it will be on TCM later this month). October 2009) but "hobgoblins" is a whole "Nothballgame". <br /> <br /> Worst of all, it's about 12 hours after the end of the movie that it's coffee and dry toast, my meds, and yet the replacement music is "New Wave," the Amy, Red Shorts and Laraine Newman in the living room, still running through my head. This agony lasts several days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, right?
