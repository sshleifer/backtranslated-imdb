The film "My Name is Modesty" is based on an episode that includes about one page of the Blaise novel "Night of the Morningstar" (10). It describes an incident in which the young Modesty (17 in the book, in her mid-twenties movie) asserted her leadership in a war for a casino. Since this plays before the actual Blaise adventures, her trusted buddy Willi Garvin is not in the movie. This is one of the main problems, as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin has always been one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long comic strip. The other problem is that the movie is just incredibly boring because it's really just a little episode that gets blown up in a script. The casting is okay, but Alexandra Staden as a heroine is not really convincing and actually too old to play the role of the young Modesty. I have the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution not to lose the rights to the Blaise franchise.
