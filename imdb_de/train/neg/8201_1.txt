Cuddle up in your favorite chair and turn on the Playstation while you drop it into the waste disposal unit. Spend a reasonable 90 min. live your favorite game. Not connected - badly filmed - undirected garbage. Some other "science-fiction" films need something, and the attempts to put the pieces together into a pitifully weak story are bad. There is nothing new here, the filmmakers do not seem to realize that providing simple entertainment would be a monetary game, but a touch of skill and skill is needed to make a good movie out of it. Any money spent on watching is a waste, and I personally want to have my 90 minutes of life back.
