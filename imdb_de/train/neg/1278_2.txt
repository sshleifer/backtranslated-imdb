Imagine a woman alone for forty-five minutes in a house where absolutely nothing happens. Then it continues two more times. The writing is flat and lifeless, and jokes are not funny, and the bad acting prevents you from taking care of any of the characters, even if they are fighting wolf packs and beaten up by brotherhood thugs. Anyone who rated this movie higher than two is not completely healthy.
