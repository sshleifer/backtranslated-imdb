The film is very horrible and demeaning to rape victims. On the surface, it may be a brave rape film, but digging beneath the surface is the not entirely positive message about rape. Aishwarya, the rape victim, is shown to be a helpless victim that not all can handle because she is a WOMAN. She needs a MAN to help her. If society makes fun of her and comments on her, she will not stand up for herself. It remains Anil Kapoor to talk everything while Aishwarya cries. <br /> <br /> The director (Satish Kaushik) went the wrong way by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive. What would have been more effective would be the portrayal of a strong woman bravely rebelling against her enemies. The director is known for being chauvinistic. His films are usually full of weak women, but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. He has to learn just because the role is controversial does not mean that the character itself is strong. <br /> <br /> The most demeaning scene in the movie is when Aishwarya cleans herself after she has just been raped. She does it to please her father, who thinks she is dirty now. Although it is commendable that Shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a severe light, he does not show us if Ash's father was wrong because he made his daughter do it. So we have a confusing message about rape. <br /> <br /> Even the comedy is not needed in a strong theme film like this one. Even more, the comedy is just not funny. Ash is made of wood, while Anil Kapoor just screams. The music is mediocre except for the theme song, which is beautifully rendered (the only bright spot in this movie). Sonali Bendre's role is disappointing and pointless. All in all, a great movie to remember might be a terrible mish-mash that will cause serious digestive problems for some viewers.
