Compared to other Columbo films, this can only be rated 1 (terrible). I seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this horrible train wreck of a movie. Only through morbid fascination did I keep watching - to see what bizarre or inappropriate decision the director would make next. Another reviewer said it was Falk's only directorial tour because it hindered his acting role. I think the real reason is the studio bosses, who must have been horrified to see what he had done with their money. It's a wonder they did not kill him.
