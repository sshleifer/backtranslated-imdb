Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, revolves around three "couples" and their relationship to obsession and violence. Pretty good start for me. Interesting. The couple split into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends, and a heterosexual male who is "harmlessly" persecuted by a gay man. The movie. There are scenes that show how aggressive they are in sex or playing with each other, but they seem to have no real purpose because they are so marginalized. I assume that they represent a more common illustration of the integration of sex / violence into the life of a couple. The couple is not very aggressive and it is not shot in an erotic way. As characters, they do not contribute much to the topic or plot. <br /> <br /> The two male friends account for most of the plot. They engage in gay fights by convincing a gay man to have sex with them in an alleyway. This escalates to violence. And violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual satisfaction. And her need for violence grows as the movie progresses. The main problem I had is that the violence is not convincing. It never once seems that one of the characters is in danger. It just does not work. Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters' relationship to violence, this is a big problem. Unfortunately, the make-up does not help either. Sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had smeared Rouge on his face. Confusing. <br /> <br /> The more interesting couple of characters is the "Stalker Couple". Here Calson seemed to say more and could develop a more coherent plot. Maybe it's because the characters evolve more and end up with a resolution. Shiner might have been much better if it had stayed with those two. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It is admirable. Most low-budget flicks do not aim for much. I do not think Calson has reached the goal. I myself found nothing particularly controversial or disturbing. Shiner was not convinced. However, this does not mean that the director can not achieve anything with his next film. <br /> <br /> He seems to be saying something.
