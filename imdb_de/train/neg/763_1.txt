I love Columbo and have seen pretty much all episodes, but this is undoubtedly the worst of the two. A stunningly boring, meaningless, cluttered pile of unsurpassed drops, wasting both the time of the audience and the acting talents of an overly boring Peter Falk. The "conspiracy" as it is seems to be simple, since the film does not even contain the slightest indication of the formula that has made the show such a brilliant success. Part of the process that I found extremely confusing (or possibly annoying) was the character of Peter Falk, who was introduced to guests of the wedding as 'Lt' Columbo. If the producers insist on keeping Columbo's first name secret, why could not they omit this line altogether, as it sounds ridiculous? As I said, this is the box and all real Columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague.
