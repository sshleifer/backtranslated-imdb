I'm generally not worried about violence in movies or a lot of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. This is all very well with me and the film brings us much of the above. There are beautiful pictures especially of the lake and nature, a good attitude of the characters, a good direction. This movie could be chosen as a good movie. However, it is spoiled for two reasons, and both of these reasons make this movie simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> Violence against living beings is first used to make this film. Not violence against films, I'm talking about REAL violence. This violence alone could perhaps be justified, if not, and that is the number two reason; The message of the film was not just insight into the film's twisted relationship with women. Not that we do not all have a real turn with women (or men). But the conclusion of the film ruins everything. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * Our "heroine" is finally dying (from myself, if I remember correctly, I saw this movie years ago and it infuriated me, now the guy is on the way with a new movie who is certainly not to be seen) and is now even more clearly portrayed as a kind of natural demon, nature is growing above her, especially her gender. Of course it is the director who "kills" the female heroine. Women have to die, especially when men are attracted by their sexuality. That seems to be the final conclusion. ** Final Corruptor * <br /> <br /> Well, anything that might be fine with me if the director had kept his sight to themselves. But to use big pictures, artistic instructions on cruelty to living things, just to say that men can be afraid of women and men are cruel to women. That's just not enough. I knew when I saw this movie, he would be good critics for "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and whatever. But for me this movie is just totally broken.
