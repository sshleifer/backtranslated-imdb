A well-known comedy story about inconspicuous cute guy Paul (Jason Lee) waking up in bed after the night of his bachelor party with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde he had met the night before. After lying to his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair), he had to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks. <br /> <br /> I am sure that most of us witnessed a story like this at least once before ... in the movie or on TV. The film is formally and EXTREMELY predictable, with an end that you might see a mile away. <br /> <br /> At least the cast is of interest and makes sure that the movie is good to see. Lee is just right, and Stiles is having fun in a carefree comedic role that's different from the very serious roles she normally plays. Becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know, that's not really well written. At least one question remains unanswered: For WHAT exactly is Ray (Lochlyn Munro), Becky's brutal ex-boyfriend, being investigated by the IA? <br /> <br /> And I did not like the character of Buck (David Koechner), Paul's stepfather; He's a very disgusting idiot who got on my nerves so fast I asked him to beat him. <br /> <br /> Add another direct debit: a free, uncriminal cameo by comic / actor Larry Miller, who again plays a grumpy (in which case it's a bit justified - his character is an ultra-conservative Minister). <br /> <br /> Not good, but as usual I give him three out of ten points to the efforts of the cast alone.
