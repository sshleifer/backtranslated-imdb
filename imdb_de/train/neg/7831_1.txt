With their companion MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES can only be considered an absolute nadir of the genre, which started so favorably with THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem This means that it is not of interest to a comparatively adult audience to target TEN-YEAR-OLDS, who can only count on body bags, and hardly. And so rudeness is king, and king is rudeness. Stephen King is just illiterate? In general, he has the ability to tell stories about Bart Simpson. Since he can not read his only inspiration, the films are. <br /> <br /> The cinema is not such a bad place to start, as it has escaped the onslaught of "realism" in the rule. But these movies are just the rumor, not the thing, and if you want to write, you have to dig deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as close acquaintances. However, every student should realize that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi. <br /> <br /> At least AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear indication of what's wrong. You can almost imagine that pathetic dumbass sitting as a desk, trying to create something sinister. <br /> <br /> Well, you're trying to describe the horror of the system of which he's an integral part, the silly fool, but trying to find a scary story for his little nephew. Suppose you were paralyzed, and people thought you were dead and started slicing you, like those autopsy stuff! Would not that be disgusting? And that, boys and girls, is history. What about characterization? Oh yes, he's one of those suits that never really appreciated life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And he screams? Well, they can not really hear him, you know? He says he'll sue the hospital, but he's not such a big litter anymore, you're lying there (or is she, I can not remember) and so on. And he thinks: Oh no, please, please do not cut me and that's terrible, lying (or lying) like that? Would not that be a great story? You know, I read somewhere that a snake bite can do that, I think it was this great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of this snake, oh yes, a BOOMSLANG? has quite a bell, right? <br /> <br /> Let's make a Peruvian BOOMSLANG! Sure, Steve, is that great? Except that BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, you idiot! But how can you really see that the target audience is children and not just mental defects? It's simple: there is no sex. <br /> <br /> Well, it's the kind that was discovered through a crack in the door to our parents' bedroom. Modern filmmakers are really interested in the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the persecution. <br /> <br /> But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON, they have no idea what's going on. All that's left is the giggling outside the SM club and the fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are evil in themselves. Despite some variation in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay. Wray Freddy Krueger can only kill her. <br /> <br /> And since there's no real thrill, does he have to torture her first? They do not understand in any way that might excite them, as this would disturb our puritanical feelings. Thus, horror and romance are simply a pain and care for psychopaths. Our hero is a rubber fetishist and can only get a boner if anyone touches him with you ?? Rubber gloves (giggle). And that's what they use in autopsies, so they discover he actually knows. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers. Too bad they cut it off as the FIVE-YEAR OLDS might be bothered to watch the show!
