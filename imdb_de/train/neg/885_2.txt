An anthology is always a risky business, and I think that this effort should be praised. There is a lot of talent involved here. Many talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I could not really enjoy this movie, based on three issues I had. <br /> <br /> At first, the segments vary in tone and quality. And unfortunately, some come together with the others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, several segments feel underdeveloped for me. Like seeds of good stories that never lead to success. I'm not talking about happy endings (or even about an end time), but they lack even basic development or even solid setups that attract you. New York and its inhabitants have been portrayed correctly. <br /> <br /> What remains are short films that may still be interesting for some, but leave the average viewer unsatisfied.
