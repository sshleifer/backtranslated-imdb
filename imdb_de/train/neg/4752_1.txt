I've heard a lot of stories about this movie being great ... Well, I took my chance when I saw it on Ebay last month for a cheap price on: <br /> <br /> 1) Terrible act , 2) Terrible Drama, 3) Bad fight scenes ... <br /> <br /> I've never seen a worse movie in my life far !! If the story is bad, the fights make it a little more interesting. But BOTH are ridiculously bad ... <br /> <br /> * The only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, she looks good in this movie. <br /> <br /> That's it ...
