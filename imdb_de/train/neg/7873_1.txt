This movie is so bad and gets worse in every way imaginable. It's not just the bad drama and the script, and it's not the lame and perverted time you waste watching it. What really puts this movie in my shame hall is the obvious fighting the writers and producers are doing with the movie to make fun of it. The actress, replacing the descendants of Jean Reno, is too old and has learned her lesson in the first film. So you add a new girl to be married. Almost all of the original extras and gags return, but this time I want to rip my eyes out of my eye sockets because it's a waste of absolutely good movie. The torture of the constant camera cut-outs and shots in every scene in this film can turn the viewer into violent confusions. In this second film, the successful original is pulled out of the coffin and the corpse shown in the public square. In this way, not only the original idea and its heritage, but also our intelligence are perversely degraded. In contrast to the spruce goose, this film could not fly because he had no conspiracy for a 'necklace' in the builders. No script, as it seems to have been written and added daily. No attention to camera or recordings. Poor lighting and special effects done for it. This film would not even go through for a student film in base movie 101. No one can say how this bunch got through. It was a big loss investment and it seems no one had the strength to get that unnatural, cruel mistake out of our misery. This movie has a good part ... its ending! This movie is my worst movie ever, after all, "Howard The Duck" is no longer the goose.
