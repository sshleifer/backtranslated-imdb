What happens to RGV? He seems to repeat himself in every movie. Does he have no more creative ideas? When he has time to take a back seat. I saw the movie with great anticipation - of course I never imagined it would be near the original. I knew it was not, the promos said it all. But even then, I thought it was a great RGV treat, after all, is not he the same man who ran Sathya and his company? Or is he? I have my doubts after seeing Aag. I will not talk about the plot or the story because most of it comes from the original. If you really feel like seeing them, you could play a fun game with friends: Identify the scenes from the original one and enter your own ratings! Heeru (how stupid is that?) From Veeru, Heeru would not sound so great. Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero, the comedy is tense and the blurry conversation that was really effective in the company sounds wrong. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, the more charming Nisha tries to be all the more irritating. This reaches a climax in the end. Raj is not bad compared to the others, he is a guy to watch in the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene where he drinks something from a bowl covered with a cloth. Instead of arousing fear, he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only achievement that truly stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha. I'm afraid I do not have the patience to write anymore.
