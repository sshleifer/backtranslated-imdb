A Slasher movie made in the early '80s has a curse that kills anyone trying to finish it. Years later, a group of film students tried to complete the film - and revive the deadly curse of the movies. Great idea for a movie, but unfortunately "cut" is just a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia did not have the best track record in the world when it comes to horror. "Razorback" (1984) was an absolute dude, as was "Holwing III" (1987), which was half a US movie anyway. As far as our journey through comedy horror is concerned, 'Body Melt' (1993) is best forgotten. The problem with 'Cut' is that the creators are trying to create a clever horror a la 'Scream' (1996), but have no insight into the genre or what it does. And even though that sounds funny, when I say that about a Slasher movie, what "Cut" really lacks is "heart". Certainly it follows the basic "rules" set by 'Scream', but it does not want to play with the formula, but it does apply to a cardboard copy of the earlier ones. <br /> <br /> The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history. His infinite, awkward, awkward, impregnable arrival would make the dialogue of a porn like Shakespeare appear. The actors never look like their peers, waiting for a shoot to be over so they can pick up their paychecks. And the feeling that the film was deliberately trying not to be scary; more like a series of "Neighbors" or "Heartbreak High". By the way, these MTV-style experiments, the hyper-cinema during the "research" sequence, seem just lame, dated, and inappropriate. I hope we still do. Maybe we should take a leaf from the book "Mad Max" (1979). Instead of trying to copy the US, we should try our own attitude of the genre.
