What can one say about this catastrophe? I saw it because it was broadcast over cable. I regret wasting my time, but at least I wasted no money. <br /> <br /> The creature is the cheeseiest you can get! Please, you must be very generous not to be annoyed by the cheap Halloween costume. Well, there are also portrayals of horrible drama, f / x, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is incredible, you can not see a miserable scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst thing you can get from direct to video. "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like "Halloween". <br /> <br /> Please avoid this at any price. The only "positive" thing about this junk are the sexy women.
