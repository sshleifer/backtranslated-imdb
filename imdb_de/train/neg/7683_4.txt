"The Cobweb" is an example of many examples of films with strong, sometimes notable performances and climaxes, which unfortunately are drastically shaken and slowed down by a grim plot and hardly interest the audience. Richard Widmark is referred to as a physician in a mental institution whose lives are in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ridiculous and overworked conflict that really does not seem like a big deal. <br /> <br /> The plot is absurd. It's time for the institution to get new curtains for the library windows. An old woman wants her curtains to be pulled over her, but many patients want to make their own. And somehow this ridiculous and unintentionally crazy conflict breaks out at the point where life is in danger and families start to crumble. It sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children. <br /> <br /> The question of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real maniac could buy it. Do not get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with acting. The cast behind Widmark is made up of other great actors, many of whom are Oscar nominees and winners. There is occasionally a moment in the film that works brilliantly, but the stupid conspiracy on window curtains always excludes. Unfortunately, there is too much about the doggone curtains and the movie slows down. Many of the adjustments are tedious and are done from a single camera point of view. They stick to the slow pace and the lack of interest in seeing. <br /> <br /> In a quick analysis, "The Cobweb" is an unrecognized movie that becomes obvious Why basically to the viewers as soon as the action gets into focus, which makes them pretty fast. It really does not sound like much fun, and I'm telling you that watching is not much fun.
