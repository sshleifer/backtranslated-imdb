Normally, when a movie gets a voice of one, it's because someone just does not like it and is angry that it has no lower rating and therefore decides to pull it down as much as possible rather than a low one To give rating. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0/10 movie. It does not do anything right and has no chance because it's not really trying to do anything. There are strands of bad D & D action that does not hold together, and there is no action. It is clear that no one involved in this project has made a serious effort, because even the work of a completely untalented staff would mean more. A really horrible movie.
