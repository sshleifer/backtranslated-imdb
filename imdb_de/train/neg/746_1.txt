Save $ 8.97 you spend with Walmart on buying this DVD, and watch the real Steven Spielberg movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a filmmaker, and I had to buy as an avid fan of HG Wells, hoping to enjoy good conversation for three hours. Instead, it took me four days to finish it because I could not watch for more than 10 minutes. It is terrible. <br /> <br /> There are reports that Timothy Hines had a budget of $ 20 million for this production. Where the hell did it go? Did he need the most to buy a new house? Finance his retirement? Or what? Let me start with what's actually good about this movie. It stays true to the book AND there are some good services. I can respect the actors who have obviously tried to make this movie a good movie. But good performances were quickly overshadowed by terrible things ... and I mean terrible special effects. Any undergraduate could have done much better work with the CGI. For me, most of them looked like "Stop Action" carton blanks that were used instead of sophisticated CGI software that was supposed to use a $ 20 million project applied to this movie. My own partner and I got together and created our version of the Ferry scene with software that costs less than $ 1,500.00 and within a day had five minutes of the scene that looked better and more realistic than what Hines had created. I've seen movies with a budget of less than $ 2 million that look better. Much better. <br /> <br /> I think the special effects of the original King Kong were more mature and better than the special effects of Hines in this movie. Actually, I appreciate Attack of the Killer Tomatoes much better because of this movie. There is no excuse for today's technology that a movie looks like a '50s B movie, unless that was the intention that should not have been in this particular project. <br /> <br /> A problem I had with the DVD broadcast The movie is jerky, another demonstration of the amateur movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to say that in 2003 I produced a $ 45,000 project that has better cinematography and special effects than this movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone who appreciates good filmmaking or is a fan of WOTW to leave this film on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 Foot Woman instead. It would be easier on the eyes.
