If this is a 2008 product of one of the largest production houses in the Indian film industry (Yash Raj), then I fear that it will take a long time to reach the right standards. <br /> <br /> If You Can If you go the wrong way with such a huge star of Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, film making is even harder for anyone involved in the movie to study. The film is missing in almost all departments except the cinematography and Akshay Kumar. He has some good dialogues he can render, but that alone makes it impossible for you to enjoy a movie with great expectations. The first scene in which a car drives off the mountain into a river has very cheap graphics like those of a cartoon. This was a clear indication of the Director's vision. Any actor who otherwise wins a movie is simply wasted. Anil Kapoor's gimmick to try good English is mostly flat. And Saif will surely think for himself why he has signed this film. <br /> <br /> In short, THIS IS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF RESOURSES TO "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM". I would say even "Aaja Nachle" was a better fun movie than this one. <br /> <br /> You can not understand how and why this type of script was written and approved. Most unintentional was the flashback sequence of Akshay's love story. After the flawed script, the weakest point of the film is its music. Vishal Shekhar has given each song just a few filling tunes. The songs start off very well and suddenly the songs drop drastically. Only a single song "Falak Tak Chal" is somehow good of everyone in the lot. A chance that Vishal Shekhar has wasted. <br /> <br /> Just try the continuity intelligence of the makers: Akshay and Saif are in the hilly area of ​​a strange place (probably Ladakh). In the next scene they search Kareena in Haridwar and then with Kareena in the hills of her car. I still think who wrote that. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit until last, the culmination of stupid and unnecessary stunts is too long. You can see all the heroes who go through the storm of bullets and do no harm as if they were GOD. Do we still see a movie from 2008 with all these technical highs? So no more words to this pathetic and rundown movie, but a sincere plea to older actors from their fan. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, Please ask for a first copy of your movies if possible Out. As an artist of this size, you have certain obligations to your fans and viewers. People are still clapping for you when you call up the screen in your first scenes. I think this kind of movie should not see the light of day because it hinders the reputation of all the actors involved in the film, the actor and the production house.
