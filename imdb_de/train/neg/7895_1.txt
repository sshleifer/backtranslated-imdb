Germans think the grin is funny (just as Americans think marbles are sexy and that women have English accents). I had to close my eyes when the screen was filled with a huge close-up of a grinning face again. One of these "housewives" hacks a corporate mainframe in which she cheats a bank by tapping some random keys on her home PC, which is only plugged into a power outlet. The director obviously loves the pretty big lead actress. I can not say that I share his feelings. It's a funny thing when the whole family sits in front of the TV and sings silently with the commercials. Apparently this check must be one line longer, so here.
