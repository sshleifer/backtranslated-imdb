Revolution is a terrible movie. I do not care if you're a history teacher, a news writer or an Al Pacino fanatic. There is no way that this movie deserves a legitimate "10" point on the conspiracy is Tom Dobb (Al), who is trying to get money from a note he received for radical patriots who took his boat. It's all about this note. Tom's son joins the army to make amends, and Tom joins the army as well. They are trying to get out of the army. Years later, the war is over and they can finally hand over the note for their boat. The end. <br /> <br /> There were some fight scenes and they were mediocre at best. Transitions between scenes that were used "five months later" magically transformed the characters into a famous historical battle. The love story is a joke, and the movie as a whole is hard to follow. So save your "notes" and watch the patriot instead.
