Another set of flicks made by people who think operating a camera is the same as telling a story. Within 15 minutes, the entire premise is arranged in just a few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery that eliminates a whole facet of tension. The only halfway competent actor is killed after ten minutes, so that stupid characters walk around and do stupid things. Low-budget movies can not afford expensive special effects, so the CGI shares are not surprisingly unimpressive, but at least they were a valid attempt. The creature suit is horrible, as you can see when it falls on the sidewalk, and the director repeatedly emphasizes the eyes, which are not even the red color shown in mirror images. The dialogue is awkward and uninspired, some lines are reminiscent of aliens or terminators. The final action sequence takes place in a police station, also a rip-off of Terminator. Everyone hides in a single glass-lined office that the Darkwolf does not enter. In the end, the girl calls the hero "a good protector," but he kills all of his two partners, the original protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen policemen, without throwing a decent shot despite an arsenal of Silver bullets and a submachine gun. But here's the real joke against the bad writing: they could have killed the beast just after the credit started when it held the stripper, while he flashed his red eyes. Instead, they took it into custody?!?
