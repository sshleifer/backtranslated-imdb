Apart from the Brady Variety Hour, this was one of the hottest TV shows I've seen in a long time. The video production qualities were not so bad, but the overall look was unmistakable in the early 80's. And Marie Osmond looks like she fought with the Avon Lady ... and lost a lot of time. Far too much eyeliner. <br /> <br /> It was kind of embarrassing watching veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid. It was even more interesting to see Alex Haley talking about the African pavilion in World Showcase, which would open in about a year (unless you count Disney's animal kingdom.) All in all, despite all the shortcomings, this is an interesting visual one Piece of the story of Disney.
