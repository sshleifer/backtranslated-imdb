I loved the original. It was great and always will be. Strangely, I was actually looking forward to seeing the re-make. I'm usually a bit against it because there are far too many, but somehow that fascinated me. I really enjoyed it in the beginning. Caine brilliant, as usual, and Jude Law, who manages to hold himself, belongs to him. It was pretty clever how it was modernized and worked. What keeps you from being really good are the last seven minutes. It goes completely from the original, so far that it is no longer smart and only annoying. The end in the original was fantastic! So much tension was built up and it was incredibly smart! These? It does not grow in tension, but in frustration when it seemed that they had decided to turn Caines character into a homosexual. It was when they tried too hard to be different. And then ... BANG! Law is Dead Roll Credits. This movie is just worth the clock for the performances, but the last seven minutes they really pull down. What a shame....
