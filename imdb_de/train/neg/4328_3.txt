Every film with "National Lampoon" in the title is absolutely certain that he will die in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and anywhere in Germany. It is an institution in the US, but practically unknown in Europe. For the larger public it is unlikely that National Lampoon's European Vacation will correct this situation. The terrible Griswalds are just so - terrible. They are not funny. Mr. Chevy Chase thinks it's funny, after all, Miss B.di Angelo laughs a lot about his jokes, but she gets paid for it and did not have to pay £ 2.50 for the privilege. The section that plays in England is typical. The same old television artists, Messrs. Idle, Smith, Coltrane, and Miss M. Lippman, trudged off the same old, tired clichés, yawning, yawning. Bucking - Ham Palace, Big Ben ...... I feel cheated, that we've never seen Bobbies on bicycles in pairs ... rosy red cheeks on the little kid - Dren, do I have to keep going? The English are buffoons, the French spiteful tongue Yank haters. The Germans are pompous and bloated (do not mention the war, Clark), and the Italians, the lustful, scream. Every possible "weird" situation is put to death, Mr. Chase pouts desperately, Miss di Angelo chomps sweetly, the children are embarrassingly bad. The fact that this franchise has lasted for as long as it should comfort those who claim that you never lose money by underestimating public taste.
