This is the most boring worthless crap in which I have ever wasted an hour of my life. All I can say is that, thank goodness, it only lasted an hour. More than half of this "film" consists of footage from the original "Criminally Insane". At least I could see the highlights of this rare exploitation classic, because my video store for unlawful reasons only "Criminally Insane II" (as he had "Crazy Fat Ethel II") has. But the rest of this movie is one of the absolutely worst home video acts and backyard movies you'll ever see. Why does my video library have this and not the original? Why does something like that end up in video stores? Why do people rent it and not burn the copy immediately after seeing their horrible horror? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, God, why? <br/> <br/> Unless you enjoy watching annoying fruits in a torturous slow scene in a chocolate bar, or hanging the fruit on the banister in an even slower scene, or a character sideways is stabbed several times in the back (not ask), or monologous brain murder murderer, because he gives his wife poisoned tea and then complains that his own tea has become cold or the mental thought. Eating fly soup or just watching Crazy Fat Ethel dancing in the garden with a bloody knife: Do not look at this movie. DO NOT repeat this movie. Do not borrow this movie. Do not pass, if at all possible, past a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie shot. You can still be saved, but it's too late for me now. , ,
