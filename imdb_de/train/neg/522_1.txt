After about 15 minutes, my wife already wanted to leave. Not so much because of the material, but because of its lack. They decided to fill in the blanks where the weird stuff should have stood with as much language and absolutely vulgar conversation as they could. If this subsides (very rarely), we would sit back and watch (not laugh, watch out) and wait for the next brutal or insulting remark. After about 35 minutes we both got up and left. Everything we read told us how great that was. The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert called it "smart" and said it was not a rough sex comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Besides Be Cool, it's the only other movie I've ever run ... and I do not regret it. I'm sick of seeing comedies in America.
