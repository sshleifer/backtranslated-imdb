This movie is so incredibly bad that it almost hurt to look at it. Until then, the other installments had at least one good thing. Part 1 was exciting and bloody. Part 2 was off-beat and entertaining. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part 4 had great music, good special effects and a new entertaining Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything I've ever seen. Alice, a much nicer blonde, from Part 4 is back with her boyfriend Dan. In parts, this alleged Elm Street rate turns into a daily soap. The newer characters work hard and even the sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy seems to be completely out of this. He looks tired and does not seem to be so cruel. His one-liners seem to be inappropriate and different, where as in Part 4 they might be pretty funny. The story of Leslie Bohem never comes up, and Stephen Hopkins' direction is so bad that my grandmother looks good! The whole plot of this film is ridiculous and unrealistic. It's also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid part 5 at all costs!
