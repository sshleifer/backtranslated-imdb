I wish I could give this movie a zero. Cheesy effects and acting. The only reason to watch this movie is that you can see how bad it is. Let's start with the child Brian plays. What a geek! I could not believe the mullet! Then there was the conversation with itself. I think they could not keep the movie quiet, but still. Of course, they also had to let him dive thin, not something I wanted to see. Compared to the special effects department, however, Jared showed an outstanding performance. Everything from the bear to the crash I could do myself and better. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production because the movie was not even called Hatchet. After all, I do not think the author ever read the book because nothing was the same. I think the book is great, but this movie stank like a stinking goat!
