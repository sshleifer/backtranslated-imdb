The prerequisite for such a film is the complete ignorance of Nietzche's work and personality, psychoanalytic techniques and Viennese history. Take a well-known genius that you have not read, describe it as demented, take crazy doctors with them to heal, a few good-looking women playing an actor with a huge mustache, having every character speak the strongest Accent, show ridiculous dreams, include another prestigious figure that has nothing to do with the first (Freud), mention a few words that are used in the works of the genius, exaggerate all that you can, especially the Music, and you're done. Audience, please stay away.
