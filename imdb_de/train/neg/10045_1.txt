The whole world has said that the movie Tashan would be a great movie with great pleasure, but that is not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake as actress Kareena Kapoor. She was unbearable throughout the movie. Her Tom Boy look is not really good. Even the movie, the story of the film, makes no sense at all. Everyone said that the Quetin Taratino of India is Vijay, but it is not Quetin at all. Talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie. Anil is a big-caliber actor and this movie is not. Akshay Kumar is also a victim of this movie because it's all Saif. The style and the Phoormola are not really good in this movie, I was disappointed
