I just want to start with this being the first report in a movie I've done on the internet. I felt the need to warn people about this movie because it really is one of the worst films I've ever seen. After reading interviews with the director, he says that he respects constructive criticism, and I will try to plunder the film only and express my opinion on why he was so catastrophically horrible. <br /> <br /> 1. The actors. I know that the budget for great Thespians might not have agreed, but with Nicholson, who has been in the industry for over ten years, he certainly knew some actors who were at least average. <br /> <br /> 2. The incredibly lame make-up and special effects. Once again, the budget has obviously affected the originally planned budget, but after working so many years in make-up, there's really no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. The obvious similarities with Hostel. Although it is not exactly a rip off, it certainly tries to benefit from the previous movie success. The only problem is that Roth knew where he wanted to go and how he should get there. <br /> <br /> 4. The music. Not scary or haunting at all, not even foul-smelling. <br /> <br /> 5. The script in general. All dialogues were forced and terrible! Even the negotiations about the theater and the guy who wants to save her were weak and almost like an afterthought. <br /> <br /> 6. The processing WTF. How shrill and not in a good way. he said. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I want to hear the headmaster's thoughts on my post (he's probably going to visit his pages on IMDb.) Buddy ... what did you think? Surely, at some point during shooting or editing, you recognized what a turkey Yolu had on his hands ... I'm sorry, I do not want to be tough, but you have to have more talent than this. I hope your next movie, the Gutterballs movie or Wahtever is better, hopefully exercise will progress. <br /> <br /> But in the meantime, avoid this like the plague. I would like to return my 81 minutes with interest. (At least I did not pay to look at it.)
