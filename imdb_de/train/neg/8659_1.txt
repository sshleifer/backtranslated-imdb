There are some things I can never understand. Like this movie. What if I made a really cheap and shitty dino and crocodile polygon model in Maya and then cut and paste it into an amateur video clip where people scream and get eaten by the same thing? How can anyone even believe that a completely fake CGI dinosaurs looking out of place would influence the events in this film? I know that his grade B, low budget, and all but the producers could do better than make a crap no one would ever see or sit. It just does not make sense. Are people really so stupid that they would go through this? Seemingly so. For laugh? No, it's not worth laughing about this thing.
