** CAN SPOILER INCLUDED ** <br /> <br /> The topless heroine with titular rescue rescues another pretty baby and her dad (an eccentric professor whose standard pith helmet is broken in a weft) from a moth-eaters dime Store mummy and evil Nazis to - what else? - to build a Fourth Reich. The costume of Misty, like that of other Wimmen, becomes more and more scarce as the movie continues. The last part of the film is dedicated to the longtime lesbian action. This material really gets boring, very fast, which says more about the creatures behind the camera than the curvy creatures in front of it. MISTY first eliminates his nominal conspiracy and gives him undivided attention to nudity and softcore sex. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a retrospective of films shot in the 1960s by men like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman, and Harry Novak. Just think: If this miracle work had been done four decades ago, she would have played on 42nd Street along with WHAM BAM THANK YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK for years. MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went straight to the home video. Grab yours before she is no longer printed.
