Richard Dreyfuss is actually in this movie, but in a rather small part. He is NOT the "obsessed" filmmaker - he is the business manager / accountant of the group. Even the box describes the film inaccurate. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, as advertised, unless you use the term "eroticism" quite loosely. I would not have considered the film without Richard Dreyfuss as the main character. However, I could have known that the famous anthem of the 60s, Leonard Cohen's "Suzanne", had an artistic influence. Apart from the brief recitation of lines from the end of James Joyce's "Ulysses" and an interesting visual reference to the end of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal," I found it a bad attempt to use symbolic elements and moods in films like this one to be immortalized, to merge "Last year at Marianbad" and "Un Chien Andalou." If you like the idea of ​​an eccentric artistic troupe, there are many superior films, from Bye, Bye, Brasil to Cecil B. Demented.
