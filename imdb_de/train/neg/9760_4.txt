The film crews did not have good access to the occupied territories, so Israeli film footage dominated. I was impressed by the almost completely opposite views of the mothers. The Israeli mother lost a child who had the opportunity to live a life of happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who only had the opportunity to lead a life of deprivation and despair. With such totally different viewpoints, each meeting had no real chance for a heads-up meeting. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for each of them. Peace for the Palestinians was freedom. Peace for the Israelis was security. Is this movie really worth such an abyss? I ended up feeling that I had seen meaningless propaganda - both sides were unconvincing.
