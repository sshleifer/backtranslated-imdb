I love Dracula, but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula movies when I was younger, and I thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I do not know if my youth made me believe that Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with style, looks, power of attraction, and the evil underneath. Or maybe this film just disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But can you imagine Dracula with a snobbish English accent and body language that fits? Do you like it when an action contains unrealistic choices of characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension? Then this is a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise - do not see it! I only gave him a 2 because I somehow managed to stay awake. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if you liked this movie then you must have been home alone in a dark room with lots of sleep unfulfilled space behind you. Maybe alone in your parents' house or in a strange house. Because not even the characters in this movie seemed worried, and I think that summarizes the whole thing! <br /> <br /> Or maybe you like this movie because of its place in the Dracula movie history, and maybe it fascinates how the story of Dracula has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Because as a film it is not so appealing, it does not draw you into the suggestive mystery that the myth Vampyre is so fascinating for me. <br /> <br /> And besides, it has so much of the cheesy 70's. The scenery looks like cheap theater. And I'm not saying that I reject everything that was done in the 70's. Because I can love both old and new movie.
