STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past, had trouble with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit which makes him paranoid and vulnerable to domestic violence, to his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke), who tries to keep the family together, but in the end looks more like a doormat. Meanwhile, her mother Janet (Laila Morse) knows Ray's son Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his escalating drug habit that lets him off the rails. The film follows these desperate characters as they move with their lives. <br /> <br /> The British are said to enjoy being unhappy and to watch movies that entertain them that way. Films like Nil by Mouth underline this. It's a story of a broken family, torn apart by crime, poverty, alcohol and drugs, as Jeremy Kyle was like a three-course meal. It's also essentially a story of self-destructive men, three generations apart, copying each other, tearing apart a family, and women trying to hold them together, even though they are not strong enough. If you read a little bit about what the off-set is about, you can see that it does not promise happy views from the beginning, and it certainly will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> It's true what everyone said about the performances, and the main stars Winstone and Burke deliver great shows. We see how Winstone loses it with his wife, beating her senselessly after another cola-induced paranoia, collapsing with her during a phone conversation and unleashing a typical arsenal of f / c words when she refused to see him as his child to let. Likewise, in a private moment, as Burke skillfully loses his composure on a flight of stairs, we see the full effect of the night before they enter. <br /> <br /> This is another of those films where no "conspiracy" follows as such a real sense of that desperate life that continues day by day. It was celebrated by many (including the Baftas!), But it was really too bleak and bleak for me. I have no right to criticize this because I knew what I knew about the offset, but unfortunately I thought so. **
