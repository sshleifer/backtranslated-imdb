I saw this movie on the BBC a few years ago when I was sitting through it. As? I do not know, that's way up the so bad it'Good charts that Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman have to twitch when they see it now. I think Woody Allen would have done wonders with the failed conspiracy and with Baldwin's part could have been played with gusto by Leslie Nelson. I was back this evening. I tried to see it again, but life is too short. The few minutes I saw were for pretty Nicole, who was so hot at 93. Has Baldwin ever made a good movie? Pullman played his stock in the trade "nice but dim" character as the F-word comes out of his mouth as the lady from "frasier" miscast ed as a detective complains he complains of murder so wrong. stay away
