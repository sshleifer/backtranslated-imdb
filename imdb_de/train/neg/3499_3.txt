Comedy Central was successful with the original programming with professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show and the hugely popular Colbert Report, all the professional comics and all, or in the case of the Chapelle Show, were solid shows. Considering that Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the industry, I expected good things when I got involved. I was so disappointed in funny sequences, but since the star is the caliber of Silverman, the show could have been much better. It was just the pilot, and hopefully the show will be better next week. If not, get help in the form of better authors for the show.
