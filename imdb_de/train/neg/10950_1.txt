If I had known that this movie was shot in the annoying and disturbing Dogme 95 style, I would never have hired it. Nevertheless, I took a Dramamin for the seasickness and gave me a shot. I took very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. It's just boring and presumptuous. <br /> <br /> The last French movie I saw was "Romance" and it was also pretty grim, but at least the camera was stable and the characters did not look out of time. I am amazed at the continued popularity of Dogme 95 overseas - it will arrive in America at about the same time as the next major outbreak of leprosy. (It's called Dogme 95 because that's the average frequency in which the actors are caught by the camera.) <br /> <br />
