At the end of this episode, Holmes Watson asks not to record the case for posterity. For good reason! The super war man left his little gray cells (sorry Agatha) at home for this story. There is no deductive justification, no acute analysis of signs at crime scenes. Holmes bounces fifty meters behind the action. The insidious CAM is finally treated by an old weakling who could have swelled Charles Bronson's heart with six balls of pride in the bread basket. In a subsequent chase, a prosecutor grabs one of Watson's shoes They do not choose to attack Cinderella's story to extend the film. The murderess, Holmes and Watson, flee from freedom. Well, in late Victorian London, that's a bit of a tempo change. A little Sixgun law :-)
