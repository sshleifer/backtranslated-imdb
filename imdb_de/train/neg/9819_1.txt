I have read the other commentary on this film, and usually I try not to be sharp in my criticism because I try to be a nice person. However, this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen (and that's the culmination of many bad USA Network plus Cinemax nights.) Anyone thinking of this movie needs to be prevented from ever making another movie. This movie has disgusted me in a way like no other movie. I really think these people are crazy. Just save your time and do not look at this movie. Please - I wish I had. Acting is awful, the plot (what action) is stupid and humiliating and crazy. I really do not think it should be made into a movie. But that's my opinion, and I'm trying to save you from wasting your time.
