I know I've already added a comment, but I just wanted to clarify something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not an age-old nebula from the baby boom generation that grew up with a flickering black and white image of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, etc. <br /> <br /> Bilko was 20 years old when I was born, but I had the pleasure of seeing Phil Silvers Bilko courtesy of BBC2. I wonder if I would have enjoyed Steve Martins travesty if I had not seen or heard Phil Silvers - I do not know - maybe I would. Some of the other reviewers who think this movie deserves a '10' admit that they are did not see the original. I can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode. If you, after seeing the original by Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin and others, still think that Steve Martin's movie is something about "2" is - I stand you a pint ....
