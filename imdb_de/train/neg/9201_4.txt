This is the film that embodies the fear of D & D in the 80s (and today). The fear is that people who play D & D (or any other role-playing game) are "sucked in" and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and continue to kill acts, child sacrifice, suicide, etc.). A great movie for anyone who wants to blame the problems of society with inanimate objects, but anyone who has played a role play, video game or even a game will find this an insult to his intelligence. It's for D & D what wargames were for computers. Plus as a movie, it's just crap.
