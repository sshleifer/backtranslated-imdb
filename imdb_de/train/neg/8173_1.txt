One of the most boring slashers of all time. If you can even call it that. I would not look at it, if it would be a kind of porno movie that it is very similar to. The fact that you are watching a small group of middle-aged people in the woods is really unbearable. They made these kind of teenage films, so who were they actually doing when they were doing this sleep test? My favorite part of this movie is the cover, and that's the only reason I chose this movie, which happened to be part of a Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack. I'll realize it does not belong anywhere else. So if you fancy a decent slasher in the woods, I recommend "Just Before Dawn" and "The Final Terror".
