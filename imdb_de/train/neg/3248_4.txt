Why did I watch this movie? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was there and made funny movies in the past that made me cry with laughter, are you really blaming me for having expected that again? In addition, the premise, the funny trailer, the involvement of its co-star Jennifer Aniston and the fact that this was a massive hit encouraged me in the States. <br /> <br /> As my "One Line Summary" suggests, I was disappointed. For various reasons; <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It was not funny. In a 2-hour movie, I laughed for about 5-10 minutes ... all together I sat the rest of the time thinking "I should have had ice cream". I admit that it may be wrong to judge Jim Carrey in his previous films, but what does he really expect when he sees Gems like "The Truman Show," "Liar Liar," "Me, Me, and Irene," " Dumb "makes? Dumber ',' The Mask 'and the' Ace Ventura 'films then produce such a mediocre film in Bruce Nolan's own words? Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminally signed. I mean hello! She has been in the public for about ten years and has about four lines in this film. Not correct. <br /> <br /> Reason # 3: One Word Cliche <br /> <br /> Reason # 4: An occasional use of specific American references - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite's "Sweeps Week" - is an indication the film is especially from own cultivation. "A teenager says no to drugs and yes to education - that's a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle!" God says Bruce, a melancholy feeling that seems to be a treat in the US, but may be in the face of harsher opposition in markets that have a certain subtlety. Besides, I still go to school, and this statement suggests that I and all my friends are miracles ... or maybe that just means we have a brain? <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are enough fun Carrey moments to make you giggle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total disaster, but it is recommended that you revise your expectations downwards.
