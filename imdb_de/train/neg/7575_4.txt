A retired diplomat, played by Michael York, goes to Russia to avenge the Russian gangster who murdered the diplomat's cop son. There, the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian police officer who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice. <br /> <br /> I remembered the old action strips of the 1980s that always portray the Russians as nasty villains who undermine the righteous US government. It's interesting to see that the Russian is a hero this time. <br /> <br /> No great movie, he is usually an action movie "B". Michael York gives this mediocre movie some class. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian policeman, is a bit "blah," but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Michael York is such a good actor that he has chemistry with anyone who plays a scene with him. Disappointingly, pretty Adrian Paul is killed within the first 15 minutes of the movie. If Adrian Paul was longer in this movie, there would have been an above-average "B" action film. All I can say to Adrian Paul is that he's really nice to watch the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical villain. He is very blond and mischievous in this movie. <br/> <br /> Borrow this strip if nothing else is on TV. It's okay. It is not so bad. The action scenes are decent. The acting could be better, the plot could have moved much faster, but hey, you can see what Russia looks like today!
