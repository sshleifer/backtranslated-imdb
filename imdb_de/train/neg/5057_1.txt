Very outdated film with terrible, clich√©d and mawkish dialogues and a very bad construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Falk are constantly over. A pseudo "good movie". It does not take time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is. The first scene is a total hole filled with histrionics and hysterical exchange. The sound is terrible. Camera movements are as unimaginable as the construction of characters. No poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting attitudes. The actors are constantly smoking and we see ads for beer drinks. Attractively priced. (One exception: Ned Beattie's nice and easy way to play the hitman).
