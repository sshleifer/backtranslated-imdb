There are only two films that I would give a 1/10, that stinker and "The Man Who Falled to Earth". I remember watching the minutes in the early 1980s at a high school theater. The script insults the intelligence of everyone (including the students of a high school student). It completely lost me with the "crazy" gag that somebody was shot in the butt. Goldie Hawn is said to be charming, but somber and feeble-minded. Then there are offensive stereotypes about Arabs, followed by Goldie, who has won everyone over with populist dribbling. The acting was terrible, including that of Goldie Hawn. I could not bear to see another movie she was in until she broke herself in Every Says I Love You herself. This is the kind of movie you do when you do not want to be involved in writing scripts. The worst.
