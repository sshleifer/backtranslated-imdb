Great cast Great show. Unpredictable story for the first half of <br /> <br /> hour or so. I really wanted to know what would happen to these unsaved characters and how their seemingly different lives would merge. But when <br /> <br /> the authors took out the glue to connect the players, they accidentally used super glue and brought the film to a standstill <br /> <br /> for the past two hours. I always thought it would get better, but it only got worse. Do not believe the reviews. That's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise made ugly - why? The gorgeous <br /> <br /> hunky bartender wears braces - why? I know it had something to do with the storyline, but without it there could have been at least one attractive performer to remember.
