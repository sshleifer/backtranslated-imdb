I was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent Indian Candians, but I did not find this show funny at all. The producers and the cast are probably happy to receive both bad and good feedback, because they talk about it! I was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it, because stereotypes exist for a reason, they're usually true. But there was nothing funny about these stereotypical characters. The dad "fresh from the boat", who does not understand his daughter. The radical feminist Muslim daughter (who, by the way, is a terrible actress) and the young, modern Indian man who tries to run his mosque as politically correct as he can (he's a pretty good actor, I just see that he's getting better ) /> <br /> it is very invented and the dialogue does not flow so well. There was so much potential for that, but unfortunately I think it failed, and I'm not really interested in watching another episode. <br /> <br /> I still enjoyed seeing a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, she's always doing a treat and a natural thing in all she does is a pity that her daughter is on the show does not have the same acting skills!
