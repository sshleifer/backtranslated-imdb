Reacting to this new "adaptation" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted as NOT a remake of the original 1963 movie (true enough), will, so to speak, be based on the following: those who were both big fans The book or the original movie will not think much of this movie ... and those who have never come in contact and are big fans of Hollywood's current trend for "special effects" are the first and last word for "good" a movie is , will love him. <br /> <br /> Things I did not like about this adaptation: <br /> <br /> 1. It was not a real adaptation of the book. From the articles I read, this film was meant to cover other aspects of the book that the first one never came to. And that seemed reasonable, no movie can spell word for word, unless it's the length of THE STAND! (And not even then) But there were things in this film that were never mentioned or even hinted at. Reminded me how they had decided to kill the black man in the original movie version of THE SHINING. I did not like that either. What the press release of the film should say is, "We got the basic, very basic idea from the book by Shirley Jackson, we have the same names of the house and some (but not all) names of the main character, but then We decided to write our own story, and, what the hell, we first looked at THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST and decided to bring in a bit of them as well. "<br /> <br /> 2. They completely lost that The subject of a paraplegic scholar who invited a carefully selected guest who in the past had discussed everything with the paranormal to examine a house that had really appeared to be "badly born". No, instead, this "doctor" brought everyone to the house, under the false pretext of studying his "insomnia" (he really invited them to scare them to death and then to see how they reacted to their fear ... like lab rats, of which he said he was never part of an experiment (nice guy), this doctor, who did not have the same name, was just as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as he was from the day of the night. > <br /> 3. In direct contrast to the statement used to promote both films, "some houses are just poorly born", this house was not born bad, but rather bad because of what happened there ... and this time Nel comes to unravel the mystery (shadow of change) The only problem was, the so-called mystery was told so incoherently that I'm sure it remained a mystery to most viewers ... but then there was no mystery at all (not in the book), because the house was bad to begin with. It's the first "victim" he died before he saw it. <br /> <br /> 4. The way Luke's figure was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. He was supposed to be a debonairer playboy who would someday inherit the house (and was a true skeptic in terms of his "story") ... and in this he was just a wine-red, clumsy nerd who could not sleep (remembering insomnia ) and was a compulsive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. I was also upset about the way the movie jumped after trying almost original scenes word for word (the scene with the family of Nels sister and Mrs. Dudley's small opening speech ...), to flights that made me think more about these other films than THE HAUNTING. It's as if it could not decide what it wanted to do. <br /> <br /> 6. I missed Nels story throughout the movie. The original was like a gothic novel in the way that the story was told mainly in the first person with Nels eyes, and we were always privy to their thoughts. This completely unique note was completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make Nel a heroine much more. The original Nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could she be different after having sacrificed eleven years of her life to a selfish old woman and a mischievous sister?) And she liked to groan and she lost her temper. That was almost too good to be true. This was never clearer than in the film's climax, where the author had obviously seen GHOST too often. <br /> <br /> 7. You have changed the history of the house and it has too many inhabitants. There was no Abigail Crain (the daughter of Hugh, whose legend played a major role in the original versions), there was no "companion" and no nursery. There was no "Grace" (wife of the original doctor), and Hugh Crain's wives died in very different ways. These changes have changed the story far too much. I do not know if the producers of this movie should be happy that Shirley Jackson is not going to walk on Earth anymore or if she ... SORRY (if you should get my drift !!!) The chases she can imagine are not too small with !!!). <br /> <br /> Finally, let me just say a few words from Original Luke (fitting replacement for the word "house" for "film"!): "This" film "should be burned to the ground and the ground with Salt are sprayed! "My favorite movie of all time remains so. No competition from this one.
