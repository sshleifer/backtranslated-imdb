To be honest, I did not like Executive Decision - that was obviously the original - but compared to this crap, it looks like a masterpiece of art. <br /> <br /> Not only that The people who move in the movie (the term actor would be an insult to all the other actors) should attend more acting classes. The man who builds the scenery has not even seen a plane from afar. It is so ridiculous that on a 747 only 3 flight attendants are on board, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogic (eg: use sleep gas, then do not use it, then use anyway), which finally got my rating to the bottom. <br /> <br /> You can have more fun You can rearrange the sock drawer or drill a hole in your knee and fill it with milk.
