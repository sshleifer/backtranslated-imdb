My 10-year-old daughter Alexandra writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was very boring and I thought it was just a repeat of "101 Dalmatians". I could not wait for the movie to end. The best thing was the credits at the beginning - they were cute and well done. The rest of the movie is not worth seeing. Many Thanks.
