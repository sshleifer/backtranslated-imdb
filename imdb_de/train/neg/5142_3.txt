After Chaplin made one of his best films, Dough & Dynamite, he made one of his worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. In this first year of film, Chaplin shot around a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of ad libbing, editing, gags, movie location, and so on. This takes place on a racetrack where Chaplin and his friend try to pay without paying. Mabel Normand is also there with her friend and Chaplin manages to free himself from his and Mabel's friends. He then woos Mabel in the stands without any apparent effects of his behavior. There is plenty of slapstick here, but there is little else to recommend this film for other than Chaplin development. The pressure I saw has worsened greatly, which could have affected his enjoyment. Charley Chase can be seen. * of 4 stars.
