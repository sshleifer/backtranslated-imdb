I saw this movie in my movie class. I'm glad I did not pay for it. I came with an open mind and was even a little upset. I really like Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I just never connected to this movie. The acting was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the plot, or rather its absence, was a problem. There was no central, connecting theme to the film. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? No not true. Was it a western? Somehow, but no. I'm all into filming, I've recently seen "Brick" and loved it, but the place where this movie went was just too far out there. It was so funny, and if I had not sat through the whole movie, I would have gone. The writing was not that bad, but it was just everywhere. When the movie was over I was just terribly confused and wished that the movie had ended earlier. There was just something about this movie that did not resonate, I understand more unusual movies like Fight Club, but I just did not care about the characters.
