... This man does not shred Bard so much. It's still a terrible, minimalist production, Hamlet's Dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a Spaniard (whether or not it's Ricardo Montalban's debated) and Maximilian Schell works like never before. Most of the dialogue gets through unscathed, and the fact that the MST3K version keeps pointing out that the speeches are * long * does not seem to me to be incredibly humorous. Mostly it's just a bad show.
