I read comments that you should not watch this movie if you are looking for an exciting Shakespeare dialogue. Unfortunately, this is true because all the rousing dialogues that this wonderful game contains were cut and replaced with songs. I have read this piece and recently got lucky that it was performed. It remains one of my favorite Shakespearean comedies, but this movie seems to take everything I like about it. Although the princess undoubtedly did what she was commanded to do, she did not have a royal attitude, and all the girls seemed to lose the prudence of their characters - also affected by unwise cuts, which not only deprived the female characters of the sparse dialogue. however, took comments out of context - it was a little disturbing to hear the princess proclaim; "We are smart girls, so to ridicule our lovers!" When ridicule had not taken place at all. The news footage throughout the film also disturbed the river and took many outstanding scenes as they showed the information in the scenes after them and were in modern phrasing. Finally, an excellent game that is ruined by a weird concept and unwise cuts. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What did you think you were doing?
