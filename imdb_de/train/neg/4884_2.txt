Criminally Insane 2 is included on the new DVD of Satan's Black Wedding / Criminally Insane, and that's a good thing too, because if I've seen a movie and know there's a sequel (especially something that's so dark), then I am always curious. I was satisfied with my curiosity now and will never see it again. Most of CI2 is nothing more than "flashbacks" for Ethel's CI and footage, which sleeps and reminds of beautiful memories, I think. Thanks to Proposition 13, she is dismissed from Napa State (wonders if she saw The Cramps during her stay?) And was sent to a half-way home run by a nice old lady whom Ethel promptly calls the "grandma." This is all filmed with a video camera, so that picture and sound are rather pitiful and even contain a few "roles". Of course, Ethel does her thing, to send someone between him and food, especially the guy who is witnessing one of their turmoil and blackmailing their dessert. You also have to wonder if there's a reasonably big house for murderers with a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the sink. I think that's all a matter of misguided "trust." If you liked Criminally Insane or not, there is no reason to watch, except out of curiosity. One wonders why the makers have disturbed this at all. 2 out of 10.
