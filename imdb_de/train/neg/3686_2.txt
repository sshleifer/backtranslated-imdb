I am surprised that everyone (critics too) seems to think that this was a good movie. It was the clichiest thriller I've ever seen. We have the "bad guy" who wants to force the "good guys" (or girls in this case) to do something or face the consequences. The "good girl" in this movie has to defeat the "evil" with his abilities and abilities and save the day and his relatives. With charisma, courage and even luck to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Reisert meets a young man named Jackson Rippner (beautiful name) at an airport. One coincidence leads to another, and soon it seems that fate brings these two together. Sharing drinks, sitting side by side, seemingly coping in every way ... Is there more to this strangeness? Could these two be meant for each other? Does 'fate' have a reason for their strange and chance encounter? <br /> <br /> Well, as it turns out, unfortunately. Jackson has to support Lisa to help him assassinate the Head of Homeland Security by moving him from one room to another so his men can attack him. Oh, if she does not, her dad is dead. Although we never know the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness, Jackson explains more than how this will happen and why it is in Lisa's greatest interest to him help. Of course, Lisa defeats his evil plans with her smarts and stabbed him in the neck, makes him stumble over chairs and hits him with a field hockey stick. Oh, and before that, she leads him on a wild chase through Miami Airport, where she is pulled past security after 911 and steals a car she later overruns with the man who was supposed to murder her father. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. <br /> <br /> First of all, I find it strange that a man like Jackson, who gets high-tech weapons in his hands, needs the help of a hotel manager. Could not he just sneak a bomb into the building? Would not that be safer for him and his team if third parties were left out? And why do characters like Jackson explain everything they're going to do to someone they threaten? Does not that make it easier to stop them from the same people? <br /> <br /> The actors did their best when it comes to the movie they gave. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still looking for actors. I also believe that Jayma Mays (who played the "lovely" Cynthia) will be someone we'll see more about. It's just too bad they were all involved. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points
