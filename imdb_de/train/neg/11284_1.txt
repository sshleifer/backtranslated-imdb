Normally, I try to construct reasonably argued criticisms of films, but I can not believe that this has survived the script phase. The dialogue is appalling, the acting very dodgy, the accents just awful and the direction and the tempo are bad at best. <br /> <br /> I can not remember the last time I saw a movie that was so bad. Joseph Fiennes, handsome as he was, might have broken his career as soon as it began. <br /> <br /> The island of Doctor Moreau was no worse than this garbage.
