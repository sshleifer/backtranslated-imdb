I got this movie as a gift, I knew from the DVD case that this movie is going to be bad. After not seeing him for more than a year, I finally looked at him. What a pathetic movie? <br /> <br /> I have almost finished this bad movie, but it would be unfair for me to write a review without looking at the entire movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say "This movie is shit" I'm really shocked that a bad filmmaker was even funded to shoot this pathetic movie. But it would not have cost more than $ 20,000 to produce this film. All you need is a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera. About 15 people without acting skills, a script written by a couple of drunken people. <br /> <br /> In the first part of this extremely bad move, a reporter (Tara Woodley) probably ran a drunken man on her way to report about a killed city. He is completely unhurt. They went to an allegedly abandoned house, but fortunately it was almost completely furnished and a bottle of alcohol on the doorstep happened to be there. Only for the supposedly drunk man, but not everything is as it seems. Then the supposedly drunk man begins to tell Tara ghost / zombie stories. The fist of his nonsense lame stories must be the worst in the story. <br /> <br /> His story <br /> <br/> Sgt. Ben Draper caused one of his soldiers to die of utter exhaustion (I think that's what happens) after seeing the private soldier of private soldier Wilson had left. He had him dig a grave and then the soldier collapsed, Ben Draper. <br /> <br /> buries him in a shallow grave. <br /> <br /> But Sgt. Ben Draper is expecting a big surprise. His wife / boyfriend knows about it and she and her lover kill Sgt. Ben Draper to take revenge on the private Wilson (he assassinated next to the grave of the soldier) The soldier wakes up in the form of zombies and kills them because of him has avenged himself for him. <br /> <br /> The twist end was so lame. <br /> <br /> Even if you like B HORROR movies, do not watch this movie
