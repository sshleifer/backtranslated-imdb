Jason Lee's Pecks are back! If you search for it, look no further. If not, go ahead ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Clich√©s in abundance, some poorly shot, but somehow exotic fight scenes (uses JKD) and many bad acting and cheap effects. Poor Lee looks the whole movie like he's in pain, and no wonder. No welcome comeback. <br /> <br /> The film does not even cut it off as a B-movie - sure, there was a pale blond Rutger wannabe villain from Germany, but no superfluous sex scene or even a single booty shot. None. Post Code. Nada Even in Starship Troopers 2, they had the common sense to include the obligatory nudity scenes (for the remainder of my comments on this outstanding piece of classic cinema quality, we refer to our upcoming review of this stunning sequel ...). I felt like the author was taking revenge on someone - so I'm not getting into the movie's "conspiracy" or anything else that goes with it. Apart from the fact that there were some non-heterosexual overtones, Nuff said. <br /> <br /> However, this movie has one thing - no Jean-Claude :)
