This movie has a beautiful landscape. Unfortunately, it has no action. There must be a conflict to have a conspiracy. This movie had no. She spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and never did anything. The picture tries to be artistic, but does not pay attention to the basics of storytelling. <br /> <br /> If you love the Montana landscape and fly-fishing, you will find something worthwhile in this film. There is none.
