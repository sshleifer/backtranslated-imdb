Bonfires of the Vanities is a movie bathed in sweaty sweat. I can not remember a movie that tried so hard to be so relentlessly outrageous, provocative and important, but consistently failed on the whole line. It's like a stand-up comic that does not laugh but can not leave the stage. The harder the movie tries, the louder it gets with every laugh attempt. The desperation that the film shows is so blatant that it almost arouses pity for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> The movie only gets "Laughter" status twice. Once, in the view of Geraldo Rivera, who plays a disgusting, arrogant and amoral tabloid journalist on TV - which is funny, just because he does not seem to notice that he plays himself. The other scene to laugh about is the movie's final "big moment" when the judge appointed by Morgan Freeman holds the hypocritical lecture on morality ("that's what your mother taught you!"). The pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of absurdity. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, one must admit that it is a noble effort. There is a good, if poorly staffed group of actors trying to make characters out of thin cartoon boxes. The film looks professional and the little cinematic flourishes that director Brian DePalma loves are obvious, if not particularly effective. The film, which seems to be a commentary on modern morality and ethics, never rises above the level of caricature. Satire requires style. Farce needs energy. Even the sitcom requires timing. But the best thing Bonfires can muster is despair. In the end you do not want to laugh, you just want to turn away.
