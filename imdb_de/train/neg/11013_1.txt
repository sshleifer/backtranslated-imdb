I like bad movies, but that has NOTHING for them. Regardless of what the idiots said above, it's NOT funny. I know comedy and underground movies, but this is so boring that the director / writer should never be allowed to refer anything but local cable access again. Loving movies and comedy means to despise this movie. I may never get over how annoying and boring this job was. If you like this movie, you are a sober point, because there is NOTHING here. ZERO! If you need to compare underground movies, read "Kentucky Fried Movie" or the early John Waters. The film begins with the definition of satire, and I can not resist anyone showing me the satire. The rule for the comedy is THIS ... If it's FUN, you can say or do ANYTHING, but if it's NOT funny, you're not satirical, you're not nervous, you're just pathetic and this movie is just not funny , ZERO!
