First, I have to admit Batman: The animated series is by far the best Batman series. We saw it when it was on TV. I did not know there was a fourth season. Not really. BTAS ends with Season 3 and should have stopped there. <br /> <br /> Why did you have to deal with a good cause? Catwoman and Poison Ivy now have terrible gray faces. The Joker looks more than scary, it seems like every time he revises his look, he looks increasingly scary. He does not seem to have any students left, and now he does not even look human at a distance (though he is). Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy, who makes the best Batman. Although he now looks like Superman. There is nothing that distinguishes him, because both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night Wing really needs a haircut, please! Alfred has only pupils out of his eyes, looks more like a character from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I've watched three episodes of Disc 1 in the series and I find that this version is more violent and graphic (there's blood in each episode). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Batman: The animated series, there is no Batman Season 4. You've only included this series as Season 4 for marketability. If they just released it as The New Batman Adventure, I do not think many people would have bought it. <br /> <br /> Save the disappointment and stay with seasons 1-3.
