This is literally the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It can be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they are good; This movie is so bad that it goes past a pleasant camp and becomes incredibly horrible. It's the anti-enantiodromy. We bought it with the intention of torturing ourselves, and my whole family gathered for a fun evening with clever remarks. Instead, we sat in stunned silence, regretting poor Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> This is worse than the vivacious Lord of the Rings. It's worse than the Matrix sequels. It's worse than Krull. It's worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should this film be placed one meter near your TV.
