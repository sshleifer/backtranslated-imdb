Perhaps one of the most overrated so-called horror classics ever made, Halloween features memorable Michael Myers and some great plays by Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> However, its reweatability factor is very close to zero There is an unforgivable amount of time spent on the boredom / culmination of actual events. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you can go to Microwave Popcorn and do not miss anything. <br /> <br /> I will never understand how many sequels have happened. Thank god Rob Robben does that. And generally, I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> Certainly he will make up for any random, time-filling gaps with a few bizarre points of interest that are seriously lacking in the original. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that we believe we must like, much as we have learned that we should enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> Do not assume that this is a classic.
