One of the previous reviewers wrote that there was no middle ground for Love Story opinions; you loved it or hated it. However, there seems to be a remarkable distribution of opinions across the scale of 1 to 10. For me, this film has received the rating 4. There are some beautiful scenes and locations, and Ray Milland does a fantastic job as Oliver's dad. But the film was not particularly convincing to tell its story, and the story was not so unique that, at least for me, it justified several sightings. I may be a bit of a snob, but I tend to avoid watching movies with Ryan O'Neal - I still have not seen Barry Lyndon - because most, but not all, are ruined by his presence for me. The one exception is What Up, Doc ?, whose straightforward performance is the perfect support for Barbra Streisand's Goofball protagonist - and it's no coincidence that he's trying to taste Love Story! McGraw and O'Neal tend to outsmart their lines instead of playing them. <br /> <br /> This film is remarkable for the beginning of a good career: It was the first movie by Tommy Lee Jones.
