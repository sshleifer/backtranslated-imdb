Hard, yes, but I call her the way I see her. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the late 80's, and it really was one of the most horrible, boring movies I've ever had to watch. <br /> <br /> Yes, the cinematography is lovely. The Czech attitudes are really stunning. The political background is tempting, but unlike similar "historical" stories (eg, _Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)), it has not made politics relevant or even interesting for history. <br /> <br /> Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this movie also manages to plodding and slowing down "erotic" scenes. I'm all for the romance, but this movie was so boring, I was hoping the Russians would all shoot and put an end to my misery. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I would have read the book if the story made a little more sense. However, life is too short to spend more time on this life.
