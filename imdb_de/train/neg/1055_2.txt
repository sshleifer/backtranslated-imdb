* Spoiler warning * <br /> <br /> First I rated this movie with 2 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but there are too many stupid mistakes in the movie that fail Make it the psyching drama it could have been. First of all, she never fights alone. After initially very strange doubts from her mother (which is not credible when the mother later in the film proves so supportive and affectionate), the victim of a rape is not alone. <br /> <br /> She is incredibly na√Øve and always falls into the strange traps of the crew. <br /> <br /> Your friends are incredibly angry. <br /> <br /> What I find most is that Ethan does not control the crew if he changes his mind. Ethan is very much the leader of the crew (hey, they even say it) and people seem to think that the other guy is an idiot, but when Ethan changes his mind, he does not manage to do just one person in the crew convince that he is right and that his former friend is wrong. Everyone just hates him ... why? The film does not provide an explanation. How did he ever become a leader? <br /> <br /> A funny news is that my friend thought I would see Beverly Hills when she came in. Two actors from the same successful TV series ... a cheaper way to get viewers
