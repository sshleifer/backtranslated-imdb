The movie was awful. The theater was dead with silence because everyone was embarrassed to see such garbage there. I think someone gave a lobotomy to Jet Li and got him to do a script with a dialogue written by a five-year-old. The martial arts are "ok," but if you put them next to the Jackie Chan movies and "The Matrix," you better see one of them.
