<br /> <br /> I saw this cruelty in my film program recently, and I found it awful, as I said in my slogan, it was presumptuous, banal, petty, and phenomenally self-important. I consider myself a fan of the movie and all the things the movie has to offer. If I want to see a documentary about the Cannes Festival, I'll look A & E .... and they'd probably be much more objective about that. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it, period. <br /> <br />
