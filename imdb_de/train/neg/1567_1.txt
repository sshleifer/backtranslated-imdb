I had to change my mind about the worst movie in the world that has just seen this movie. THAT'S IT! <br /> <br /> Do not make mistakes, this movie is awful. <br /> <br /> Here's a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> Desperate history (though on a true story). Terrible spectacle (thought Reinhold) Incredibly bad stunts. Childish dialogue. Non-existent continuity. Lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Get the picture? <br /> <br />
