THHE2 is entertaining as you laugh and wince a lot and probably "oh sh * t!" Say. and "Take your face away from the goddamn hole you stupidly dumb" or things like that, but I do not know if it's really worth seeing - I was all the time with the awful military characters who do not seem very upset to know the first about the fight. <br /> <br /> Yes, there was more violence, grief, and a higher body count than the first one, but I'm still not sure if that fades out my feeling throughout the movie, how ridiculous it is (and not a good one Ridicule like Dead Alive or Feast). My time would have been better to see Ajaa's remake for the fifth time. <br /> <br /> So laugh, or go for a bit of Gore, but do not hope to be satisfied.
