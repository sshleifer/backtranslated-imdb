I'm not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren. I think when I see him on screen, I feel like anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. This is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent. Some of the other reviews show how stupid the detention is, but many neglect to highlight the positive results. <br /> <br /> Any movie that kills at least one annoying teenager can not be all bad. Why do so many teenage films always involve stereotypical teenagers? Are there no other teenagers? Does every group of teenagers have an angry black? An ingenious nerd nobody likes? A slutty girl who is very friendly and pregnant (in this movie)? A troubled, antisocial white child from a broken home, all of whom agree that it is talented (but what is the talent?). And a relaxed black kid that is in tune with the universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him. Then add a few generic teens for each color. They do not say much, but they are shot sometime. <br /> <br /> The detention would have been better if the bad guys had blown up the school. Preferably with the writers. The dialogue is bad and the action is worse. When the bad guys (and the girl) finally kidnap a drugged van, they sit in the van and set off. They drive the van to school because they want to repaint the van at the school's paint shop, but they never get to repaint the van. Incidentally, it would have been easier to simply put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or truck and drive away without repainting the police car. They never move the drugs, they do not sell or do anything else with the big score. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they decide that they have to kill the children and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren), even if the villains take over the school, nobody is aware of that, because it's after school hours. The few people still in school have nothing to do with painting vehicles. So why go after them? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the best part about this movie is that the bad guys are all armed with a lot of machine guns and keep finding the teens (including a man in a wheelchair), and shoot hundreds of bullets at the teens and in usually miss. Toward the end of the film there is bloodshed. Every time someone is shot, at least three hundred bullets must be fired. The stunts are pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I read one of the reviews that said that this movie had a budget of $ 10 million and I'm amazed. When I saw the movie, I thought that Lundgren might have done it as charity work for a film school where he is the teacher. Maybe this movie was the end of the year. It was a test to see, but I passed.
