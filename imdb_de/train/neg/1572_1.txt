Pretty one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Terrible acting, ridiculous 'action' (it's clear the cars are driving slowly), horrible script, horrendously unsatisfactory end, and incompetent directing make up a movie. We know that Judge Reinhold is a good actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is not much tension in the car, and when the characters stumble over moments of hope, for some reason they laugh like inhuman banshees, even when they see the bridge lowered, even "high five-ing"! Also the chain of events that cause these people to share the same credibility of the car. But apparently based on true events? If that's the case, the truth is obviously stranger than the fiction! Unfortunately, it was so inappropriate.
