Based on the life of Domino Harvey, a model became a bounty hunter. I would say 95% are fabricated. I'm always open when it comes to movies, but this movie lost its chances when it turned out that it had narrative throughout the movie. Something I can not stand. The culmination of the story is so hateful and shown as arrogant! I just wanted her to end up being shot in the head. It's too incoherent, too flashy and too boring, it's one that tells a fucking story, and I really think that great directors have to make films based on their own or the imagination of an author and not something that's on the screen The life of an unknown snobby brat is based.
