Otherwise, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I mean that. My wife and I were bored within 10 minutes. Not to mention boring, it's absolutely incredible. Women (non-lesbians) do not bathe - nor do they kiss "accidentally". Brothers and sisters do not live well in their thirties and walk around dancing and dancing in Central Park. Men do not find their wife and sister kissing romantically the night before the wedding, and then never discussing it with that woman. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham is possibly the worst actress in movies. She smiles when she should cry and vice versa. The only movie she's ever been good at is Boogie Nights - and that's because she did not play. <br /> <br /> I can not stress enough how bad this movie was.
