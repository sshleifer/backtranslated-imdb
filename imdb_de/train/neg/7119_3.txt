* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I'm sure when this was released in 1958 it was very appropriate to his time. At that time, movies were slower to follow the audience and analyze the story. Here a man moves into a house of his last wife, who died mysteriously with his new wife. The gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who also shot the film) is really an underrated character. He gets a skull to indirectly warn Jenni that she is in trouble, knowing that the first wife's death was bad. He can not tell Jenni what happened, so he tries to scare her away with the skull. Jenny, we also find out, saw her parents die, causing emotional torments throughout her life that led to institutionalization. Like many other viewers, I found the pace a little too slow for my liking. However, if you like slow horror without a lot of blood, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
