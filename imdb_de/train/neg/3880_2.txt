I can see a good bloody movie from time to time. I have seen quite sick things. However, this is one of the few films that I found grotesque in a way that was simply repugnant and disgusting. I like gore movies when they are fun. I like who they have a lot of creativity behind them. The blood in this movie is not creative. It's sick. It's disgusting. That's totally uncomfortable. For that reason, this movie is certainly not entertaining. The movie is a horror movie, but it lacks fear. Pretty much the only reason you'll see this movie is for Gore, but that's the ugliest and ugliest aspect of the movie, and that says a lot. Acting is terrible, the plot does not make sense, and the music is really annoying and too electronic sounding. I took everything out of the movie. Pretty much the whole movie is a big, boring ordeal. There's this guy who has an unusual accident on a shuttle, and wakes up in a hospital, and his skin dissolves and melts. I think he goes out after that and eats human flesh to slow down the melting process. There is a strange subplot where an old couple is being chased by a dog, a dismembered head is floating down a stream and an end where a man is electrocuted. There were times when I was really trying to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole movie I considered entertaining was the scene where a nurse ran through a hospital corridor in slow motion. If you like ugly, dirty and unsightly horror movies, this movie is for you.
