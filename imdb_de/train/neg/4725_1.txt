A great opportunity for an Indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of fame. It could have been a decent movie if he had dealt with John Livien's traumatic past and how he tortured his psyche. Instead, it's a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon. John Liven's mother, the hero of the Suicida mother, was John Lennon, and she wished that he would become as powerful and productive as Lennon. Rather than focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance, and his wonderful ability to teach others to learn about their own lives, Lennon's legacy was that of a confused, drug-addicted soul who considered God instead of God Man should be. I'm a big John Lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another "crazy" person obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's murderer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by another man who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we have to be reminded of this? John Lennon has given so much to the world with his music and honesty, and I've been back to see another troubled person as the main character in this Lennon obsessed movie and not to show his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon's memory by setting up the memorial in Central Park to give his fans the opportunity to pay their respects and remember John. Instead, the director of the film decided to use this site to try the killer to commit suicide. I found that so unpleasant and disrespectful of Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who had to endure a brutal, meaningless death, and seeing such violence near this site felt like he was a terrible wound to any Lennon fanatic. It totally ruined the movie for me. It could have been a decent movie, but I had a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his cruel murder by this irresponsible movie.
