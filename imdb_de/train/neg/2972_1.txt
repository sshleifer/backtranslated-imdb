My teacher picked this up and showed it to us in childcare to show how teenage pregnancy affects people. It only shows how teen pregnancy affects a child's jock who is not properly learned how sex works, and a crying, unloved girl throwing fruit in anger and may not realize that they had the wrong man, even if he wore a sign that he was like that. I would not be surprised if the baby's father had about eight friends in the first edition of the script. The mother of Stacy (the bearer of the baby) is a rebellion. She is aware of the fact unaware that her daughter is older than four years, which seems to be unshakable, when people spying through their dining room window. The best friend of Bobby (the father) is Dewey, and is an obvious rip-off of Sean Penn's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This movie is awful, simply because none of the characters is believable. Luckily, it's just for television, which limits the public's chances of seeing it.
