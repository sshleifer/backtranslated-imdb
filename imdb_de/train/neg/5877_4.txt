Williamson's accent is hard to go through. He speaks incredibly fast, as if in a hurry to get through the lines. During the monologues, he pretends to talk to someone if he is to talk to himself. All this and his bald spot just annoyed me. He was just too old for that role. If he read other reports from Williamson, he might get that role because he was crazy and the director decided to do some life-imitating or coercion. If the actors declare Hamlet crazy, believe it! Marianne Faithful is a stunning beauty and could beat Ophelia's role and still get a pass. The set is dark and unaware, but it looks like it's being shot in a real castle, especially the scenes in the tunnels / corridors where the dead king shines as a big light in the sky.
