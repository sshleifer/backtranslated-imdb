It's a bit frustrating to watch a movie like "Murder By Numers", because somewhere in this formula of Hollywood is a good movie trying to come out. At the time of the credit, however, there is no saving. It's all blown away by the "cop side" of the story, in which Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's homicide detectives move through a clumsy sexuality that's always trivialized the longer the movie goes. Although Bullock is strong in her role, saving the smooth script and slow pace is not enough. Ben Chaplin's talents have been wasted in a forgotten role (he used to fare much better in the undervalued 'Birthday Girl'), as well as Chris Penn, who has a role that is so ungratefully small that you regret a talent like him. In any case, the plot in this movie does not matter at all. The two adolescent killers, Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt, are the only reason to watch this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty well and they work out well. Too bad they were not in a much better all-round movie. Barbet Schr√∂der is far too safe for such an experienced filmmaker. Bottom line: It's worth renting if you're a genre fan, but everyone else will lead a fulfilling life without ever seeing it, except on network TV with low-cost commercial breaks.
