Ok, so obviously ppl thought that this was a good film from 1955. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the fools who still think so ... His absolute garbage. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. .. ridiculous. The characters are absurd caricatures - but this movie is not meant for satire, I'm sure it should be a serious drama, right? Dean and others are too old for their role. People say Dean is great in this movie and maybe he played his part as well as he could have done. His character should be 16 or 17. But Dean was 24 years old when he made this movie. Seeing him tormenting and throwing tantrums like a 4-year-old boy ... it's pathetic. Natalie Wood is beautiful, but the early scenes in the police station where she cries and moan are unconvincing. It sets a bad precedent for the movie ... and for the rest of the movie, you will feel every time one of those ill-played emotional scenes pops up. <br /> <br /> It might have been good for his movie time, but really, it's a hoax. <br /> <br /> It just has to be a hype about Dean's death, which has over-inflated the reputation of this movie.
