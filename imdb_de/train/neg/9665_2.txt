Interesting? Barely. The "scientific evidence" the film provides for its point (which is basically that Jews are cancer) is so stupid and lame that it's almost ridiculous (if we did not know what was happening at that time). <br /> <br /> Important? Nah I can not imagine that Germans (even at this terrible time) would like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's triumph of the will. Now I was impressed with the movie. This is just stupid trash. <br /> <br /> The best part is a scene from M (one of my favorites ever), in which Lorre (the Jew, as the announcer reminds us so eloquently), a child plays flour and murderer. In the eyes of these filmmakers, this can only be done by a corrupted mind. Uh-huh Did not know that M was Hitler's favorite movie, right? <br /> <br /> No, it's just STUPID. Even for the Nazi propaganda genre. 10.2.
