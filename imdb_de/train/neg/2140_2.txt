The mission of Assassin Hauser (John Cusak) is to beat a Middle Eastern oil minister, whose name happens to be Omar Sharif (Neikov), in Turaqistan, which is run by American interests. Hauser poses as a producer of the trade fair, so he comes to Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes satire can be so over the top that it annoys the most. There is too much going on here: government, politics, music, war, people who are not generally accepted by society, and I have mentioned "war." And that's what we have here - an extremely annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare. I still wonder why I continue with the DVD. Besides, are there so many members of the Cusak family that John Cusak is embarrassed by the family that is there, or is it just me? Offbeat was pretty good at the end. Not here. Believe that John Cusak was involved in writing and producing this filth. Make it what you want. <br /> <br /> There's too much going on in the movie, with constant firing, bombings and screams that you really can not focus on, or was that the point? Probably. It just takes too long to set up the score, which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes. In the meantime, we have meaningless jokes among everyone in the cast. And chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I do not think so, but you know: the boy? Girl thing ???? and they needed something to spend more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, for what they should be (offbeat and annoying), Duff and Kingsley's performances were good. But when I saw Dan Aykroyd's character at the beginning of the show, sitting on a toilet and picking up a dump, I knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well. I was not wrong. I'm sure some will praise this effort, but if a rose is still a rose with a different name, it's also a mess. Remember why I continued with the DVD. I had hoped that the story would somehow balance and save itself. No way. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Gender: No. Nakedness: no. Language: Yes.
