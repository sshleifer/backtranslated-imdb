God, this movie was just so boring apart from the music I really loved. I mean, what was the point in making this movie, please, who reads this review, do not look at this movie, it's a waste of time. <br /> Emraan can act, but was really pathetic In this movie, I'm actually ashamed Being one of his fans, especially in this movie, it was just awful. <br /> <br /> Celina is just a pretty face She can not act at all without lack of talent, and there was no reason to be in this movie, and for the other girl Radha she was okay, but I had it can do better. <br /> <br /> what a waste of time. Please buy the great music and do not watch this movie.
