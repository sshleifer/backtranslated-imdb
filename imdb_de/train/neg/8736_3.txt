The film had a good concept, but the performance simply did not match. <br /> <br /> What is the concept? Well, in terms of story, it's "Dirty Harry" and "M". A child murderer has begun to terrorize a city. The main detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never dealt with a serial killer. The mayor and the police chief are desperately hiring the local mob to speed things up ... to visit places and do things that the police would not be able to do to end this mess as quickly as possible. <br /> <br /> To be fair, this movie really does have some good things to offer. <br /> <br /> Besides the concept, I liked the hiding place of the killer. Norman Bates has his cellar. This guy has a sinister sewer. In some shots, the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls; These scenes often give an eerie, dreamlike quality. <br /> <br /> The show was good too. Dennis Hopper is one of the actors who gets better with age. <br /> <br /> Once you pass it, it's more or less downhill. <br /> <br /> The movie is going up and down way too fast. The actual investigation process of both teams feels very rushed instead of feeling complicated and intriguing. This could have been resolved in two ways: either extend the movie or cut out some of the many deals. Both would have given the crew more time for the actual mystery. <br /> <br /> An example of how bad this is is one of the crucial clues that helps them find exactly the right suspect. This: At some point in his life, the suspect went to a pet shop. That's true. I'm really serious here. It is as if they had gone from point A (the first clue) to point Z (the suspect) and skipped all "intermediate steps". <br /> <br /> Then there are the characters. The only ones I really liked were two pick pockets, which are about halfway through the film. Given the fact that they are small characters, I would call that a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally there is the mob angle. This is the one who worries me the most, because THIS is why I coughed out the $ 3 to buy the DVD at all. I mean, what a catch! In the last 10-15 years there was an absolute oversupply of serial killer kicks. The mob-angle was a gimmick that had helped COULD rise above the rest ... but did not. <br /> <br /> I thought the gangster methods were brutal but funny and exciting at the same time; a bit like a Vigilante movie or something ... maybe they would even bring in some of the latest movie elements. We're talking about criminals. Instead, we get some of the most repulsive protagonists who have dedicated themselves to the celluloid. The detectives question witnesses. What does the mob do? They interrogate and kill her. It's also not that these witnesses are really that bad. I actually found the criminals less sympathetic than the murderer they hunt. <br /> <br /> If the good points that I mentioned are not enough to arouse your interest, I would say that I miss this one. Maybe one day they will use the same story idea and do it RIGHT. Hopefully. I hate it when such a good concept is wasted.
