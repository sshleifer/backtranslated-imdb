This movie was a terrible excuse for ... a movie. Above all, the casting could have been better; Katelyn, the main character, did not look like her TV mother. <br /> <br /> The plot was also pathetic. It was extremely clichéd and predictable. The end was very disappointing and cheesy. (But that's all I'm going to say). <br /> <br /> However, the nail in the bag was a scene where Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) was supposed to cry, but the girl could not cry on command! No tears ran down her face, just a few incredible sobs. She is not a dynamic actress at all. She gave the same false laugh that was identical to that of Hillary Duff on Lizzie Maguire (sp?). That was when the movie did not get too bad just from good. It really looked like she was acting. <br /> <br /> in a nutshell: This movie was really bad! It was a mix of every cliché children's movie from the 1990s that everyone was sick of - only worse! b / t / w, I babbled when I saw it). <br /> <br /> However, you may like it if you are 9 or under. ;)
