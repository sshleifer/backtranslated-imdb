"Horrible People" should be the subtitle of this horrible movie. If you want ordinary people to do ordinary things, look out the window into real life. But if you want to see unwelcome people doing boring things, you have to watch this horrible movie by Mike Leigh. The characters speak at length but never really communicate with each other. Why not? Probably because Leigh wants things we all are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors, and he wants to film real life. But we are not and he failed.
