In the early 1990s, there were many "quirky" and "off-beat" independent films, of which a special subgenre is the semi-spiritual desert thriller. Other notable ones are "Wild at Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn" and, to a certain extent, "Natural Born Killers". Good movies like the upcoming garbage like "Highway 666", "Destiny makes the radio" and this fake surreal anti-masterpiece "Under The Hula Moon". It is a comedy that strives for a certain emotional tone, attained, but goes to the point of irritation. While the pursuit of the spirit world of the desert and casting by Chris Penn are good ideas, the movie is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good thriller, and is not laugh enough enough to really be a comedy. I will not fizzle the end, but let's just say it's bad. The movie is basically a bad side effect of genital cancer. This is the dregs of indie mania.
