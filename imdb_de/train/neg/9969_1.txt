I joined this page to see what comments people would make about this absolute catastrophe of a movie. I did not even move in for a second. The characters were all one-dimensional. They threw every topic that they hoped would catch something. I would bet (and hope) that everyone involved in the teachers looks back with embarrassment. There are some great actors here, but you would never know. Thankfully, it has not destroyed the careers of Morgan Freeman or Judd Hirsh or Nick Nolte or Laura Dern. There was no vision, no love work, just a terrible effort that went awry. BTW: I do not think the author ever went to a real school.
