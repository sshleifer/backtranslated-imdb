I'm a big fan of Western, but this one ... oh, what a stinker! I think what almost scared me off the bat was the crazy dialogue. I think I could have written a better dialogue in eighth grade. And the poor actors! In this terrible dialogue, none of them looked anything but ridiculous. Really, I'm not kidding. Some of it is not much better than what you get in an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably THE "big" star in this movie, and if you called it B Western, you would praise it. This is what might be called a B-minus Western. Pity about Sterling Hayden, who at other times played together with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other great talents. So that he could appear in a vehicle that this poor man was trying to play down for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> One annoying thing in this movie is that all men look like they have not shaved off a week and their faces are all greasy. I know that the guys in the west of the West were not always well groomed, but for a man this is a movie that just says "EWWWWW!" Really, that's a lousy western. Denver Pyle also had to give it up, especially after appearing in so many great westerns. Bad, bad movie.
