the lowest score is a star? That's a shame. I will look for a "zero star" option in the lobby IMDb. To give this movie even a single star is too much a WAY. Am I the only one who noticed at the station the microphones hanging over the funnel head? and acting, or should I say lack of it? Obviously, the talent did not matter when the casting director came to town. The talent show of my little sister's elementary school offers greater reach and depth of emotions. and those fake Irish accents were like nails on a chalkboard. The only thing that could have made this film worse would be ... oh, wait, no, no, it's as bad as it gets.
