Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's miserable apology for wasting film to be recycled as toilet paper, recently destroyed my confidence in the art of the film. At first it was done. Second, people have seen it. Third, some people chose the best movie they have ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, I'm one hundred percent sure it would be 1 billion times as good. Most crappy movies have their moments (even Godzilla had some cool special effects). This movie was the moment when I went to the theater bad. The only thing that could have made this film even worse would be Jerry Springer the star. If I want to stare crap for an hour and a half, I'll take a dump in a can. If someone has not despised this movie completely, I feel sorry for you and your children and your children's children; In contrast to Springer's belief, I clearly can not agree with children who have sex.
