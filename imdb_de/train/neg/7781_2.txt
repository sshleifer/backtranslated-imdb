Hard guys, sexy women, a lot of cursing and a very unmistakable monster rising from the depths of a contaminated lake. You might think "Monster" would be funny ... but that's not really it. However, it is the star Tony Eisley and John Carradine, and in my book it is seen at least once. In an interview with "Fangoria" in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed most of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford too - recording only the pictures with his children Andrea and Glenn (featuring the characters Andrea and Glenn in a movie) ) turned particularly innovative) - got full credit. Considering how terrible the end result was, Strock was probably glad he had not been credited! "Monster" has the look and feel of a television movie from the mid to late seventies, which is why I always like to keep it in the background. As a conversation it falls flat in the face, but as a reminder of another age and a vanished nature of filmmaking it is very effective. The only thing missing is a chase.
