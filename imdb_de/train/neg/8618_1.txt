Incredible horrible movie. I've recently seen a part of it on TV. My chin clicked down as I watched a terribly planned conspiracy and heard stupefying noises. No single lineman line was able to produce anything close to a chuckle nearby. It was so bad that I wanted to exhume Rodney Dangerfield's body, beat him up and scream, "How could you?" I know that many films are shot in a hurry, hoping to benefit from the popularity of a particular actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. It is sad and scary that people were expected to see such trips. The underside of the cesspit, even after television standards on Sunday afternoon.
