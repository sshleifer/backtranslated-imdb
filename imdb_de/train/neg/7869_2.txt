Corridors of the time. The movie you can watch if you are looking for a subtle way of suicide. Some use weapons, ropes or gas, but you want to ruin your brain? Do not wait any longer! Corridors of time are probably one of the biggest mistakes: thinking Christian Clavier can act and give you fun. I do not miss the 45 francs that cost me this poor thing: sometimes you have to reset your rating system to absolute zero. This movie deserves a 2/10, but that's only because I like Jean Reno. Too bad for him, he also plays in Ronin. I think I will not like him ...
