This movie makes Canadians and Britons crazy idiots. The men become stoned / drunk and then scream / beat each other in almost every scene. The women are superfluous for the story? I do not understand what they are for? They spend every scene whirling, or worse, messing around with hypnotized cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are either contentious vulgar vagrants or hippie hippie chicks. It's the default girlfriend, her loser friend, and his ridiculous mother ridicule that we've seen in countless films before. <br /> <br /> Each character here is a captivating, infantile stereotype. Not to mention that they all looked like they needed to take a shower! And the idea of ​​a scene that implies sex with George Wendt? Shiver ?? is enough to gag somebody! I saw the movie because Samuel West was there? but I can not understand why he would have taken such a role. Maybe he needed the money. Ian Tracey is an outstanding actor - the only one with a vague redemption moment, but his talent is wasted here. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot? the three fools trying to get their drugs back? Yawning - or Karl? Who is dead, but who is actually a very living character in the minds of the backward ones (almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, though I'm ashamed to even compare these two films), why bother? Karl is so angry that you find the circumstances of his death satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At the end of this pathetic movie, I thought they could all have gone down with him on the boat!
