Think of a darker version of one of these children's shows like "Power Rangers" and you have this movie from 1990, "Robot Jox". A movie in which you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes from his country wins. The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the said shows, mainly because they are less colorful. Although this movie is not good, it's not all bad to watch. As far as I remember, there are two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the last showdown. There is a turn of action as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the action is not something that will stay with you for a while after the picture is finished. The battles themselves look like huge toys on the rage, but it's still fun to watch them. This movie would also produce a few other movies with similar plotters like the giant robots and the tournament. It's worth a try, but probably not more than that.
