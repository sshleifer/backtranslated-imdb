At first, I saw this movie when I was 7, with a Christian Scholl I attended. Needless to say, I was scared out of my head. Not because it was scary, but because of the content. I was 7. I was the cinematography anyway. This is very bad, considering that I was only 7 years old and I remember it. The only thing that still haunts me is the terrible song "I wish we were all ready". I would not suggest seeing this one. I'll probably only for nostalgic reasons. I'm sure the remake is a lot better. The best thing about this film, however, is when everyone "disappears". empty cars crash, mowers alone ... quite funny.
