I can not believe this movie ever came into existence. I think the director sometimes tries to make it an artistic piece, but that just makes it worse. The zombies look like they've applied too much eye makeup. The zombies are only a few minutes in the movie. After all, there may be five or six zombies, definitely not a nation. The best part of the movie, if there is one, is definitely the credits because the painful experience has finally ended. Again, to repeat other user comments, the Voodoo Priestesses are strange and unreasonable throughout the movie. There's also a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl that makes no sense at all. It is never explained.
