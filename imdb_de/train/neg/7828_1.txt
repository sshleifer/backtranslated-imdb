Besides two days in the valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just another long series of Tarantino prints that have been made since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere created by the film is amusing in the first five minutes, but then the filmmakers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque acts of violence to increase the "hip quotient". It is better if you skip this one.
