I have to say, I'm really surprised how high the movie is. I found it absolutely idiotic. The mother gets "visions" when she touches certain things or people. And one thing that touched her twice made her vision ... she just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's idea was terrible, I thought. She was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job, and most of the minors did what they needed to work for. <br /> <br /> I usually love LMN and I'm very open with movies, but this movie seemed ridiculous and over the top, and it just was not for me.
