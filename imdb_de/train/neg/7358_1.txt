This lifetime-style movie brings the divorced middle-aged victim who eventually pushes the genre back to new depths of cartoon-like absurdity. <br /> <br /> Here's the 40 somewhat home-stay ex-wife of a successful lawyer protagonist (daughter away from college) starts a new life after divorce, supported by a college friend as a kind of opening a new clothing store franchise expansion agreement. She even has a friendship with her attractive, maybe slightly younger landscape architect / gardener (who's black). But then the horror of middle-aged womenwomen, another woman she took over as a tenant to rent a room, begins to "take over her life." <br /> <br /> What this New, Younger Woman Really Does He flirts gently with the gardener and offers him a glass of wine that * pant * really belonged to the divorced! She runs up the electricity bill by not turning down the thermostat! And propped up the toilet! bad in the fridge! And hang her (African) artwork in the living room! And so on, maybe she killed the cat too. Yeah, ok, the extent to which this man does these things is bad enough, but it's more than a little ridiculous, especially as it turns into a campaign. The reality of the character is that every tiny part of this weird woman would go insane (so why did she rent the room - and to the horror of horror, a much younger woman?) <br /> <br /> Allegedly this has become increasingly arrogant ( natch) younger woman insanity occupancy control. And our brave man has to learn something to defend himself against this evil (and of course erotically hot-looking). But there is this problem. Whenever the 20s get used to getting into trouble, she uses her POWER - and flirts or has sex with a man and escapes the consequences. (Well, there's actually something about this ability to do good-looking things.) It's just not * generally * used in a specific way.) <br /> <br /> The premise is given by the device of The 20 moved something that make the divorced person to formalize their lease with a lease she has created. Of course, the 40 do not know something, and the 20 have something helped. The lease gives the younger woman during the rental actually the same right to the whole house, with the additional costs are paid at a fixed price. Although a clearing procedure is soon pending, the 20 will soon receive a restraining order against the older woman, allegedly because she has threatened the 20 something. You know, the judge understands all the weeping ego of the sexy sweet, young thing. Finally, the "heroic" fight of the 1940s begins for THE HOUSE. Woopie !! <br /> <br /> The only realistic or perceptible thing in this film is how terribly easy TROs (or orders of protective measures) are for women to do nothing more than their unfounded statements - though this is generally the case only so easy against men. They are sometimes just as unwarranted and just as motivated to take control of a home as here. In fact, friends who have moved in with their friends can often be evicted from their own homes or condos without any evidence, but only with unfounded allegations of threats and sometimes without hearing his side. Even when there is a hearing, it is routinely impossible to refute claims for threats (to prove them to be negative) when the burden of proof lies with the accused and not with the prosecutor. (This is one of the few areas of American law in which this is true - and this is a signal of over-exploitation of feminists and the failure of an organized group to resist the steamroller.) Of course, this is probably not the topic of lifetime film in this lifetime , <br /> <br /> The absurd premise of this film is based on the explanation that the 20 are a bit psychotic and do not take their medicine. Nevertheless, it makes no sense. She is not looking for the successful lawyer of an ex-husband, although she supports his help (to the ex-wife's anger) in her search. She is behind THE HOUSE (technically, to evict the divorced person during the lease). THIS SECOND YOUNG WIFE IS AFTER ALL THAT'S LEFT AFTER THE DIVORCE, AFTER MATTERS WITH OTHER 20 MAN STOLE HER HUSBAND !! (The ex-husband seems to be unpaved and basically worried after his escape - no matter, he's still lost !!!) <br /> <br /> The protagonist is good enough to look for her age. But her attitude, attitude and focus are so small, frumpy and completely devoid of imagination or vitality that it's impossible to take care of her. Well, a core group of Lifetime fans cares, I think, by the average rating of the few reviews. (I only looked at it because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it was a magnet for the camp, I could not resist seeing how far they would get it.) <br /> <br /> * * Spoiler ** (If such a thing is possible with this film). <br /> <br /> Well, here's a hint. The film ends with the 20 people being rescued from prison by promising to "listen" to their 20 male colleagues and sometimes lovers and "do what he says" and "let him take care of him" (he says to get her to take her medication) - and then tricked him and returned to the house. There she climbs up the stairs with a knife and demonically stalks her archenemy, who takes a bath by candlelight and makes sure that the younger woman is out of her life. There's a fight - and the 40 Mom wins - putting the 20's with a hypodermic needle full of antipsychotic medicine she found. She begins to stroke her, like the mother, and the two women have a connecting female solidarity moment !!! How sweet.
