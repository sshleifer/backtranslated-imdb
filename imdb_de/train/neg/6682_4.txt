This comedy is really not funny. It's a romance that plays so much on stereotypes that it does not matter. It's a capricious film that's so distracted-yes, even then-it has no snapshot. <br /> <br /> The cast is appropriate. More than that is hard to say. However, it is nice that the players are unfamiliar. At MGM, this would have been shown by Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman who has no time for anything other than work could have been any number of actresses. <br /> <br /> We can be grateful that this little-known film will be cast by mostly unknown performers today. And the production values ​​are not terrible. It does not really impress. <br /> <br /> It's a common knockoff. And who wants that?
