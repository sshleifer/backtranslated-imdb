This is a mild, interesting Gore festival of the late '80s with some unpleasant snails tasting of human blood. If you miss the ridiculousness of the whole thing, you might actually enjoy it a little less. The drama is terrible and the plot simply serves to keep the movie between bloody slug attacks, but the movie is not a complete waste of time. The special effects are actually pretty good and the gore is well done. It reminded me of the blob's remake, probably because of the thinness of everything. All in all, you could certainly be worse with one and a half hours of your time, but I would not recommend watching this movie unless you have a strong gut and are involved in such things.
