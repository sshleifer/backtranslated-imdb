This movie was bad, to say the least! The abundance of outstanding cars has been disgraced in this LAME movie. It starts with a race from LA to Las Vegas, which ends in 1 hour and 45 minutes ... in a Ferrari F430. I did that in 1 hour and 50 minutes in a tiny 4-cylinder 140 hp Honda Honda from 1993. Seriously ... this movie does not do justice to these cars. Obviously, these authors are just that and are probably driving their hands at 10 & 2 o'clock below the speed limit. I remember being on the news as Eddie Griffin crashed a $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo into 30-40 MPH biggest SALE !!! He brings his own race to shame. I wonder how many people he likes to orally fell for Hollywood. He participated in a film that depicted Asian Americans in such a negative and false way. Asian women >> cheap money banging whores. Asian men >> lose obsessive players and thugs who are constantly being hit. What the hell is all the fear of Asians? Why the need to always present them in such a negative connotation? I am as fed up as Hollywood Asians ALWAYS present a negative and false pretense.
