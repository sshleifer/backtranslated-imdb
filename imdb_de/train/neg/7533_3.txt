The film had some sympathetic aspects. Maybe too many for my taste. It felt like the author / director was desperately trying to sense the inner conflict of all the characters. Not once, a few times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> This is the job of television, not cinema. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed Sascha Horler's performance as a pregnant girlfriend. <br /> <br /> I felt that Justine Clarke's performance was bad. Their reactions to things felt compelled, as if the director tried to express the themes of the film through the facial expressions of their protagonist. I also can not believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the choice of pop music that has dubbed entire sequences. This is a lame instrument, especially when pop music does not come from a diagetic place to film and / or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly serious. <br /> <br /> That is, there is an airy quality in the film that evokes the Australian heat and local attitude with originality. It creates an atmosphere of warmth and sunshine. Especially through the use of wonderful animation sequences that save the film from mediocrity and penetrate it with passion and artisanal charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious to see why the dialogue feels so overhauled. "Who knows if there is a God, like a guy sitting up in the sky and telling us what to do" or whatever the line was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments was when the friend came home with a bouquet of cricket to tell his wife, "I quit smoking." <br /> <br /> An anti-smoking advertisement? A TAC display with tasteful animation? I had to leave the cinema in 50 minutes - it was all too much.
