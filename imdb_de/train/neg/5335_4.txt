It has been a very long time since I saw this comedy, and I had forgotten how idiotic it is. I would easily put this in the bottom two or three of Elvis Presley's very bad movies. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-blood Indian who returns to Arizona and the run-down shack where his family lives and where his friends party all night. His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offers anything of substance, weird or otherwise. The government has invested in the livestock of the family, but they lack a bull. Elvis sings only a few extremely worthless songs and is followed by a young, crazy woman and her deadly mother. This is just a real slapdash of chaos, and the rundown environment stinks of crap and does not make it much easier. The only thing that confuses me is that Elvis actually seems to have a good time in the movie. Hard to believe, considering he was so mad that he made so many mediocre films.
