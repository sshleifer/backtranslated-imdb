I did not know that Devry University (or ITT Tech?) Added film to their wonderful repertoire of technical studies in the early 1990s. Well, this movie must have been the product of Valedictorian. My boyfriend and I rented the original Boogeyman from 1980 on my Netflix. This movie was on the other side of the DVD. Do not waste your time with this movie. Terribly terrible. The filmmaker adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman dreamed of the first movie about Boogeyman and his victim. The film is over 50% from the original movie. The rest of the movie is the main character who has the bad dreams while her therapist is booming the narrator. These scenes are captured by a filter that is so thick that the characters are lit. They would make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. To sum it up, terrible. Do not look at this movie.
