I love westerns. I could see her all day. "The good, the bad and the ugly" is my absolute favorite. I probably saw "Silverado" for the eighth time the other day because it was shown on CMT. This movie, Shiloh Falls, is without doubt the worst Western I have ever seen. The acting was terrible all around. They do not explain anything at the end of the mysterious compass look. The only good thing I can think of is the pretty Cantina girl. The conspicuously long pauses between the dialogues seemed intentional, only to catch the time to bring the film to an acceptable length. This movie was not even worth the new rental fee I paid in our local movie distribution. I had the feeling that I was robbed and would have refunded a rent if there was such a thing. The only reason I finished it was because I hate not seeing a movie to the end. I turned it off halfway because it was so bad. Ask the director better if you decide to do another. This is the kind of movie that has the potential to distract people from westerns.
