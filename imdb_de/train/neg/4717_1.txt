And how it came to production baffles me. The main character is a disgusting sight that is not exactly funny. I can not stand the character at all. He is a stupid ass who has nothing to offer the show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst cartoon that has surfaced in the last 10 years, no joke. The storylines are poorly written and executed. The jokes are as bad as Disney's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could not like this show anymore, it is awful and should be canceled. Even the title song is bad. The title is even worse. <br /> <br /> It's as if this show was written by a couple of 15-year-olds who took the character for granted and consider it hot when they're really just arrogant and deficient in creativity as well as humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go far and fast!
