The latest rumor is that Vh1 will begin casting auditions for I Love New York 3 in mid-2008. So does this mean that Budah or Tailor dumped New York, or does that mean that New York dumped the winner? <br /> <br /> I know that Flavor of Love will be in season three, now with Flavor of Love 3 and I Love New York 3 ..... will there ever be a true winner? <br /> <br /> I also heard some rumors that Chance WILL will be brought back for Season 3 of I Love New York !!!! I've also heard rumors that New York will be featured on Flavor of Love 3. Hopefully this was not too big a spoiler for the end of I Love New York 2 ... I'm just telling the latest rumor.
