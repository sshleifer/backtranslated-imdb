Holy, damn God, all-damn powerful. This movie was so bad, I thought I was taking drugs. In a bad way ... The character is the poorest thing I've seen in a long time. This movie was more like Lord of the G-strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the movie seemed to be running on a dreadful green screen. My favorite part was when they were in the carriage, and you realize that there is no horse. They flee from alien monsters and move about as fast as a fast jog. Then it switches to a long shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG in general seems to be subordinate to the 1992 Beyond the Mind's Eye. I mean, come on, really. It felt like a terrible episode of Hercules, but without Kevin Sorbo, who would save the day. Worst. Movie. Ever.
