With a cast list like this I expected much better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the movie lying in bed. The best actresses in the world can do nothing very interesting if their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the movie. The plot summary says the daughters are revealed a secret when their mother approaches death. The thing is, she never tells her daughters anything but a secret piece of advice to be happy. All relationships in the film are underdeveloped. I also had the feeling that the back and forth between past and present is unnecessary. It seemed that the idea had been stolen, either from the book, from the Da Vinci code that used the voltage-boosting device, or from the notebook they were using, to the infinite romance of the main characters to create history. In any case, it was a cheap device in this movie because it did not work to create something. It was a way to try the excitement in a movie that has none. I was wondering why good movies can not be written for women. It was really a disappointment.
