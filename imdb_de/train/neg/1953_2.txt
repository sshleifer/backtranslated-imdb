The first episode of this new show was today and it was awful. Not only did Shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture, but she's so far from the original concept and animation style that she's barely recognizable as a "Scooby Doo" show. <br /> <br /> Even in the dark days when Fred and Velma left and Scooby's nephew Scrappy was there, the team was still riddling. Instead, this new show shows Shaggy and Scooby battling a James Bond-type supercar and his followers while living in a mansion. There is not even a van named "The Mystery Machine" (and the teaser for the next episode, which promised a robot-type robot car, did NOT reassure me). How can someone take Scooby Doo and do THAT? <br /> <br /> The show earns two points for two scenes with the entire Scooby Doo group, all of whom speak with the right voices except Shaggy, and even then I'm far too generous.
