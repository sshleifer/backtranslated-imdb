After the already disappointing "Final Conflict" the series is at its lowest point with this very weak fourth entry. At least the third film tried (unsuccessfully) to continue the story of Damien, while he just worked on and copied ideas from the "Omen" (animals are afraid of the Antichrist), the death of a man is very similar to the death of a photographer in the first Movie). What looked exciting and creative there just looks stupid here. And the little girl just looks like a spoiled child.
