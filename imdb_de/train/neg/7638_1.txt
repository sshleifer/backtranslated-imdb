I could not even bring myself to see this movie over. I can not comment on the story because I did not see the whole movie and the reason why I could not watch it was because of the "actors". First, they looked stiff for the most part, and I'm sure their scripts were out of their frame - but that's an insignificant problem. The main problem I have with the actors is not really their fault. Come on, this movie came out in 2003 ... I thought the casting of people who were in their late twenties to play teenagers went out of style with the new wave? I can not see a movie in which one of the first lines of an adult man older than me, "I'm 17!" How can someone take it seriously ????? Do not fall for this movie, walk for 90 minutes and you'll get far more than this movie could ever offer.
