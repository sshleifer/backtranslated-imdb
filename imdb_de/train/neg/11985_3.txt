Have you always wanted to eat worms? Here is a documentary that shows you how to do it! Yes ... the kid eats live worms! And that's about the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has been considered quite boring by previous reviewers. I totally agree here. The movie just does not go anywhere ... unless you like to eat worm! This is a movie that makes it almost impossible to write a spoiler because ... not much happens. <br /> <br /> Now on the technical side: You should have given this child a haircut. Who is he looking for anyway? Bozo, the clown. It was almost funny ... I almost expected him to turn into a shaggy dog ​​or something. <br /> <br /> And besides; The boy was way too clunky to ever look hungry! Should have kept him away from junk food for several weeks before shooting. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie has almost put me to sleep. And my kids could only touch something interesting about 15 minutes before they left the scene. <br /> <br /> I admit that the scenery was very impressive. And if there was a decent story to it, it would have made a hit. <br /> <br /> It seemed safe enough that kids could watch it: the bear scenes and the 'oddball' eyeball were too weak. Most of the kids were scared, and the short skinny dipping scene showed nothing. <br /> <br /> I gave this scene a very generous 3.
