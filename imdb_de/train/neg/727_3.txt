I'm really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started making some of the incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen. I did not even laugh in this short movie, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for God's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Unfortunately, this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones short) with Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning sign for a boring comic is always a gag win. Good night Elmer was boring because he was always pulling the same two gags with predictable payouts. This cartoon, however, is plagued with the second warning sign of a boring cartoon: There are too many dialogues. The cartoon has at least two jokes up its sleeve, but most of them seem to be longer than they are, thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes dinner and comments, "This was a weak road," possibly the most superfluous dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters read text in the later Woody Woodpecker cartoons) counts in mine Book not) Although this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to a superfluous dialogue. <br /> <br /> Elmers Pet Rabbit was not a funny cartoon for me, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and can not acknowledge that he led some climbers during his career, you could enjoy it.
