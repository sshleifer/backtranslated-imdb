As a fan of the manga and anime of Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK etc.) I was looking forward to this album. I had not seen the manga or the anime, so I had no preconceived ideas. Good thing too. What we have here is a series of stupid softcore movies that appeared on cable channels late in the evening with an alarming regularity. While it's tame compared to what ordinary cable viewers get rammed into the neck (our hero's naughty parts are either tastefully hidden behind a strategically taped scarf or adorned with a ridiculous sunburst effect), there are longer scenes of bondage and torture Lend the process just enough palatability to make it unsuitable for the little ones. Although I have nothing against naked female heroes, I do not like amateur movies (there are at least four in this series). On the plus side, there's at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I've seen. No wonder Nagai's TESTICLE BOY never made it ...
