This picture began with good intentions, Bacon, the scientist, to test the theory of invisibility, and Shue is as usual cute in her role. After that everything falls apart, it's now your typical Hollywood thriller filmed on a stage with special effects, minus any kind of humor, joke or soul. In other words, do not waste your time watching this. Get the audio cassette tape with John DeLancie as Invisible Man and also with Leonard Nimoy. Well, that was good, and HG Wells is well served unlike this mess.
