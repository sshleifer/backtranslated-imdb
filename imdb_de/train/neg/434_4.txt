Even his first claim that wishes are always artificial is completely wrong. <br /> <br /> If a Jehovah's Witness refuses, does he get his own documentary on movies? or anything for that matter - it's time for everyone to find something for themselves. Although far more intelligent than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, not too difficult), Zizek's mouth spits as much nonsense as hers, just a different kind. He combines the worst of his two worlds of professionalism: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both areas are known to provide the expert with a comfortable latitude to create unprovable theories without ranting beginning and end and linking concepts almost by chance, abusing the English language by creating a semantics confusion only a mother can love , Example: There are three great Marx brothers, so a "great" idea to connect them to three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego, and the superego. I'm kind of surprised he did not play a clip from "Snowhite" and made an analogy between the seven dwarves and the seven levels of Gahannah (Muslim hell). It's like the premise of Schumacher's "The Number 23": Play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of cockamami theory you want, even if you associate the ancient Greeks with Princess Di 'Death , <br /> <br /> However, there is an entertainment element to TPGTC: When you look like a frenzied, crazy sweat like a pig and spit out insane chants masked as an intellectual analysis, it can be a lot of fun. Why watch "Cuckoo's Nest" or other madhouse dramas, if you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching a funny train wreck. Admittedly, he's almost funny on one or two occasions. <br /> <br /> I've always been puzzled by people desperately trying to turn filmmaking into an outstanding intellectual social science. If idiotic films such as "Birds" deserve so much thought and therefore recognition, the fat creator probably laughs in the grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of films have no intellectual value, and the few who have some intelligence do not need a shrinking philosopher to draw a map to understand it. unless you are a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal films. Hallucinogenic drugs must be quite popular and cheap in Slovenia today ... <br /> <br /> When Zizek showed the bathtub hole in the "Psycho" shower scene, I thought he was saying something about galactic black holes. how they drain the life of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks Janet Leigh's blood. Or maybe he could have said how the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with the blood flowing into the blood instead of menstruation, which is a kind of "wise (Zizekian) irony." By the way, the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really given so much thought to every scene (and the script), his films would not have been the illogical, far-fetched crap they often are. The purpose of these bathtub-hole analogies was to show how easy it is to improvise over "hidden, deep meanings." And if you add Zizek's fantastic terminology of philosophy and psychology and overlay those analogies like wedding cake decorations, you get a far-flung mess that can immediately impress the untrained, that is, easily too impressive and gullible. <br /> <Zizek speaks a number of (unintentionally) funny things, one of the most absurd ideas is when he combines Anthony Perkins' cleaning of the bloody bathroom with "the satisfaction of work, a good job". Do not Laugh ... Neither Hitchcock nor the writer of "Psycho" would have the notion that perhaps Perkins could enjoy a well-done job of cleaning a bloodied lavatory, could ever entertain vaguely while understanding the scene. Talk about how to put words into the (dead) mouth, but in the context of the misinterpretation of what the director had to "say". <br /> <br /> I like Zizek's first thoughts on Tarkovsky's grandiose "Solaris," but then he has a rare good impression to ruin by drawing "anti-feminism" and other nonsense into his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek's attitude to logic is that of a dog over his plastic bone. "I just want to play with it all day!" The logic has its rules and should not - at least not publicly - be raped by people. He seems to regard logic, evidence, reason, and reason as enemies or mere disposable toys. Concepts should either be avoided, twisted to fit the final goal, or simply destroyed. Zizek is the LSD-disturbed hippie, and all his favorite movies are his personal "2001". <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizek is geared towards two of the most overrated directors - and those whose films are often overrated - is LACK intelligence, if anything, such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only diminishes its low Credibility. I was surprised that De Palma did not perform more prominently. this is another lame director who writes inappropriate scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynch's incomprehensible "Lost Highway". There are as many interpretations of this film as there are people who have looked at it. Zizek's comment that the viewer of Trier's willingly accepts ridiculous, groundbreaking physical attitudes in "Dogville" I assure <br /> <br /> Zizek is not only in the process of inventing things, but also the "bleeding" that obviously. Like all "social scientists" (an oxymoron), he packs his very banal "observations" into articulated (albeit spitting) and sometimes complex language blankets. After all, sociology works in exactly the same way: it makes us believe that we are hearing something new, even though it is actually everything we all know, but told eloquently-which deceives the more unobserved listener. <br /> <br /> I had half expected men in white suits suddenly to emerge from nowhere and fasten it in a loony suit ... <br /> <br /> Slavoj Zizek: Once a stalker in one Children's park is near you. <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
