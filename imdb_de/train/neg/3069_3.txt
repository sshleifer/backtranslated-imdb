Yuck! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this film was a well-directed story of a man who was already dead and went through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and did not bother to say it. And there was a naked girl on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version seems to me to be something to which a manufacturer bought the rights and then abandoned them out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals deliberately decided to take them to the '90s and change ethnicities and genders, just to be sweet. The film is not about a burnout that commits suicide in a final step of defiance. It's about a man trying to go to a hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason why this movie was done differently than to make me angry ...
