Oh, what a bad, bad, very bad movie! Kuhwritten by and with Sylvester Stallone - that should have been enough - with too many climbing scenes, dizziness, falls and scene chewing of bad guys and a failed air raid. There are two actions, both lame. One involves a traumatic, failed rescue, and the other is that bad people destroy a plane for prey and kill various harmless people whenever possible. The usually dependable John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the product's terrible fears, reduces himself to the people he does not care about, "Bostid!" in a vague approach to an English accent. Janine Turner, who was upset and puzzling when she played Maggie in Northern Exposure, is sadly wasted as a rescue mountaineer and pilot. Stallone is stable and muscular. No immortal lines in this one. Also no lifelines.
