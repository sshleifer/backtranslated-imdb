I have to admit that I've seen some howlers during my time, but this one is the worst of them. Worry to follow. Sex and violence were used to confuse and distract the really poorly composed film. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the performers look back on the final product and wish that it collects dust on a shelf for one or two generations. In my case, unfortunately, I have the DVD. It will sit on the shelf and watch me from time to time.
