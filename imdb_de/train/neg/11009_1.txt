I rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie might be pretty cool. "Guaranteed to ... offend everyone!" said the trailer. Well ... it insulted me because this movie is really shitty. It's not a comedy, because I laughed for about two seconds throughout the movie. And what about all the gays in this movie? I'm not gay and I do not have a problem with those who are, but what good is it to put so many gay scenes in a so-called comedy movie, if these scenes are absolutely not funny? I suppose the director is a gay man who rejects something or other. So my advice to you: If you want to waste good money, hire a good comedy you've already seen Millions of times you're better off seeing this mother than all the lousy comedies. It's really total crap.
