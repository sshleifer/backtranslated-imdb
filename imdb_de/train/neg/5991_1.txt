ba ba ba boring ...... this is next to the battlefields in science fiction slumberness. genius francis (also known as general hospital laura) has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should say that this movie must be bad .... in this stinker there is ben kingsley (a prize awarded with the academy) and a few other decent actors. You have to wonder what they have got to decide on this horrible movie. The music goes up and down dramatically as if it were a dramatic story. Even if you are careful, the plot can not be tracked. The effects are also mediocre and seem really outdated. All actors speak in a monotone voice and have no dialogue in dialogue. I could go on and on how this movie is bad. At least Battlefield Earth is so bad it's weird, but that's just bothersome. Avoid, unless you want to be lulled to sleep.
