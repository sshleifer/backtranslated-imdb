The main character Lance Barton is killed before his time and taken to heaven. When Heaven hears of the mistake, he gets the body of the deceased wealthy old and white Mr. Wellington. <br /> <br /> A young black man in an old white body who still behaves like the young black man may be funny when you see it done by an old white actor. In this movie I remembered several times: "Chris Rock should be an old white man". <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not work as intended: The "illusion" is not well transported The love story is not believable at all. The fact that all you see is Chris Rock playing a young black man because the old white guy everyone is supposed to see is shown in small scenes is too much of a challenge for "suspending unbelief" Spectator.
