That's really bad. Lamas shows how a second-rate actor does his job. But what's worth seeing is the scene where OJ angrily grabs a policeman by the neck to kill her, while the jukebox plays a song with the text "I have the evidence for you!" Plays. (I want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but not found on iTunes). Talk about looking to the future ... too funny for words. The rest of the movie is forgotten. The score and the songs are more interesting than the script. The same goes for the sequel. This raises the question of why they would even make a sequel. I thought that overseas sales drove many of these B movies. Does not say much about the viewing habits of the world.
