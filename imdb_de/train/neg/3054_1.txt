The NSA, CIA, FBI, FSB, and all other snoop agencies around the world should watch this movie for information on how to spy on people. (As the MST3k commentary says ... "Sanata does not give a shit on anybody!" Santa Rosa's tentacles go far and wide! There are no hiding places in front of the Klaus organization. ") Miles that can hear everything. It's amazing that the CIA does not have Santa Claus on the payroll. <br /> <br /> Satan's dance routine is hilarious. Pitch ... he is so useless. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor of this film is enormous. Very low budget, but so fun to see. I recommend the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version to make you laugh even more. <br /> <br /> They even laugh about the bad luck of the good kids. <br /> <br /> I give a 1 for production quality and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.
