Misleaded by the terrible lie on the cover, "fun as American pie", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for a comedy ... and this is definitely not one. You probably will not laugh once if you are not one of those Jackass-like teens. It's not even an erotic movie that would at least be something for sex ... <br /> <br /> So, what's that? The unpredictable plot deals with a guy who loses virginity (zero in originality, I remember losing it for one). The rest of the characters (ie the girls) come and go for no credible reason. Come on, there are even dwarfs (so simple: "Dwarfs are fun") ... The acting is (like the video in the entire movie) very TV and most girls definitely amateur ... <br /> <br / > Terrible movie. Amateur, poorly produced and not funny overall. Kids and teenagers will like to see friends, because they curse and make jokes. Otherwise, do not think about renting this movie.
