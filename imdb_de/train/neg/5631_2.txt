The photograph on the DVD is so dark that I thought the screen had died. I think I did not see half of the movie. Nevertheless, it was poorly designed and not interesting. I did not find the story related to the title "The Black Widow". I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller, but was not involved enough to look after the first pictures. I rented the movie especially for Willem Dafoe and was sad that he had wasted his talent. I do not think that Giada Colagrande studied filmmaking long enough to make a big movie. She is attractive and could become an actress, but she has too many responsibilities in the film. Although they are married in real life, they lack the chemistry on the screen. Their relationships did not seem credible. I do not understand why the other characters were even included in the plot.
