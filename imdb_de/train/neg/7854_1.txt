wow this is the worst movie ever. The only reason I signed up for IMDb was that I could complain about this movie. I have never left a theater or stopped a DVD, but I almost stopped it (and I should have). but I have watched it to the end, just to let myself down with an absolutely terrible end. Wow, if this is all Wes Craven can produce his time is long gone. I've never seen the first one and I'll never see it. his terrible spectacle with a terrible conspiracy. hey looks like someone is throwing a mirror at us, let's check it. And the sad part is that the movie was completely checked for blockbuster forever when it hit DVD. I feel bad for all the people who saw this garbage.
