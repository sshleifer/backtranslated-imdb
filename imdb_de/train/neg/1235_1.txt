I was really looking forward to Planet of the Apes, but it was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> The settings and masks are great, but that's the only good aspect of the movie. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg does not play, he is only in the movie and looks stupid. The other actors are not very good either. <br /> <br /> But the worst point of all is history. That's absolutely ridiculous! For example: The monkeys lie unconscious on the ground, but people do not attack them, no, they wait until they are up again! This is just one example of the stupid story, but it would take too long to tell them all.
