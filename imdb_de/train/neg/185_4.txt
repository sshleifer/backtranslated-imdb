The five or so really good westerns that Mann made are unmatched as an ensemble in Hollywood. Even John Ford has never done so much with so much quality. The strange thing about everyone is how inconsistent they are. My Darling Clementine of Ford is worth about two and a half of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> The real hero next to Man and Stewart is Chase. Chase is responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase wrote wide land, river bend and probably a few others. But none of them are as finished as My Darling Clementine, but then there are very few films, Western or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Each of Mann's five films has big gaps, or is it six, we see. Bend, Far, man of the west, furies, Winchester 73 and yep, six, Naked track. Everyone has one gorgeous scene after another with pretty stark scenes. However, this also applies to Red River, which is still the largest Western ever built. Perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But The Far Country has huge, huge holes. It is mawkish and only comes to life when Stewart and Mc Entire lock the horns. The rest is pretty pedestrian, with the usual exception of Mann's camera. Mann's camera is a one-man course in cinematography. It's about as much of an eye as anyone who has ever moved behind a movie. It's almost never in the wrong place, never. <br /> <br /> The distant land has an amazing moment. And as always it comes from Stewart. No one in the history of cinema has ever received a corporal punishment with the authority of this man. He is absolutely amazing: look at him in Bend, Far, Winchester and Man from Laramie: In Bend he was beaten up and hangs so believably on a thread that he looks with such boiling hatred, as if someone was evicted from Dachau with such Force shot down by a raft, it looks so convincing that you flinch, and when pulled through the fire in Man, you find yourself looking for burn marks. What an actor. Not to mention the moment in Winchester when he gets beaten early in the hotel room, as well as anyone who has ever done it. <br /> <br /> But that was Mann's territory: look at Gary Cooper fighting Jack Lord in Man of the West. As painful as any fight scene ever recorded. Cooper, while not as convincing as Stewart, is somehow equal if he looks exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, nobody, nobody, but nobody, has shown man in both extremis and man. <br /> <br /> What a great director. <br /> <br /> See every Western he has ever made. They are his true monuments, even though they are all gloomy. So what. When he roars with his great scenes, they are as good as anyone else, including Ford. And his six westerns as an ensemble are the best anyone has ever made, period. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Anthony.
