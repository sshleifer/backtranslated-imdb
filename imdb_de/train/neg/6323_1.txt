This movie is a bad memory of my childhood. This is one of those movies kids show on a rainy day at school when you can not take a break, and you'd rather watch everything, everything else. At least that's how it was when I was in elementary school. I only remember to have this movie HATING. Granted, I have not seen it for about 15 years and they probably will not use it on rainy days, but I'd just like to warn everyone: you should use this to bring your kids to sleep rather than entertain you , Trust me, choose something else. The subject is controversial, but the plot is so tame and slow that I can not remember anything about it except that I did not like it so much that I had the urge, 15 years later, to call you all to it to warn .
