Michael Rooker is a decent actor, but he has no main business except in a low budget movie. He really does not have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has a lot more screen presence and unfortunately is not the main character. Most of the time the screen goes to the brick rooker. <br /> <br /> Danielle Harris (from the Halloween 4 and 5 films) plays his daughter, and she's cute and entertaining, but she's written as if she's not smart either, and one of her stupid mistakes brings one the main characters around. The comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. Just watching what happens to these characters is priceless. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays the Consigliare before the local Mafia godfather, and it's hard to say if he's working on the movie as a comedy or not. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. He seems to be in every extremely low budget action video. Thomerson is also represented in some low-budget comedies. Since there were so many comedians and comic actors in this movie, it felt like a parody. Is it a parody of a Yakuza movie? In some places it is difficult to say. There is certainly very little yakuza action. <br /> <br /> The side cast of Thugs and Goons is threatening and well staffed. Some of these films have thugs that look like they're working in the local comic bookstore or as stock boys at Piggly-Wiggly. Overall, this movie is very uneven. In some places it looks like a comedy or a parody. Elsewhere it works as a good action movie. Then it bubbles to an end. Without the contributions of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, I think this film would be zero.
