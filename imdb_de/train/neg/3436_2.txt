A girl takes a shower without knowing that a serial rapist is staring at her through the skylight. Detective Martin Manners and Orville Stone are hot on his trail, but not hot enough when they find him after he has killed her, raped her and ate the girl's nipple. One would hope that this would be the end of the movie. Not because it is too terrible, but because the level of acting is cruel. Unfortunately, it is not the end and months later the rapist is revived as a zombie by a Satanist Covenant. So he continues where he left off, with the detectives back in this case, this time also a flying baby is after him (do not ask). There have been VERY good VERY low budget movies (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty come to my mind), but this one is scratching the bottom of the barrel. Terrible drama, crappy dime-store special effects, lame attempt at a comedy and oh well, and the end is shit too. <br /> <br /> My degree: F <br /> Eye Candy: Theresa Bestul gets fully nude; Anne R. Key is going topless
