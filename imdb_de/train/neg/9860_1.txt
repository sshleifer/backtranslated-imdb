I usually like movies like these. It's a documentary style, but acting and writing are just awful. The acting is made of wood and stiff and the writing is just such a clich√©, but not in a good way. When writing this article I am surprised that it is a 5.2 / 10 at IMDb. I'm sure most of the voices have to come from relatives of people in the film. I guess if that's the case, you could make some laughs, as it's always funny when your relatives / friends make a movie. In a way, I appreciate that this will give hope to all future writers, directors, actors, etc., because if they can do it, you can do it. Although, maybe you should not.
