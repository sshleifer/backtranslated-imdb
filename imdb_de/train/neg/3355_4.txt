There were only two things that interested me in this film: I was waiting for the deaths of Owen Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones. Catherine Zeta Jones was only there to provide eye candy. Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this movie. Like Jones, he did not matter at all. The movie was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one who played a real role in this crappy David Self screenplay. OK, it was his first and he has done it himself with Road to Perdition. I do not know what the problem was with director Jan de Bont. He did a great job with Speed ​​and Twister. he really got down to work here. Maybe he was still recovering from the disaster. Speed ​​2: cruise control. He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, otherwise this would be the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
