I watched the whole movie to the nefarious end, even though I was so mad at what I saw. I felt the director was screaming for attention and the only way to achieve that was to be as repugnant as possible. Since living in the UK, I love this country, but this movie shows British teenagers in the worst possible way. There is nothing to say, but avoid it, it will make you angry and sick. The participants should be ashamed.
