I had hoped that there would be background information about the Apollo 11 mission. What I got was a decent interview with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission. in the worst tradition of TV production. <br /> <br /> If you could turn off the voice-over and turn the program into a positive testimony to how people can overcome setbacks to reach a destination from the Internet. Normally this could have been great - but I feel like I wasted about 45 minutes of my life watching a 60-minute program. I want to have those minutes back.
