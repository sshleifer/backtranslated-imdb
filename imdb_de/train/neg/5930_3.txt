Hey, <br /> <br /> If you want to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen, try Leonard Cohen! This is just so strong that Leonard can annoy the viewer, who must wonder why he tells all these other (partially questionable) singers about himself. Puleeze .... sounds like she's reliving her diary entries in junior high school - who cares, what about Leonard? Guess what people, if you do something "worthy", maybe someone will make a documentary about you. I found it particularly insulting how the members of U2 are presented, as if that would give credibility to this movie - NOT. Leonard does not need Bono or the Edge to talk about his spirituality. It would have been nice if the filmmakers had embodied a piece of his spirituality through the film. What a concept! I'll give Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker props for their cover versions of Cohen, the rest of the performances were boring and some were unbearable. <br /> <br /> you!
