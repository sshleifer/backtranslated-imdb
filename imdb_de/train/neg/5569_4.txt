I really tried to like this movie. All I can think is, "This guy scares me, I'd get a restraining order." In addition, CODEPENDENCE is displayed in uppercase. Was that really the conversation before the movie was shot? "Let's make a movie that brings two chronically depressed, socially incompetent people into a relationship that deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" What I've seen in life is that the last thing we find attractive on Earth for a potential partner is constant self-pity. <br /> <br /> The mood of the movie is clearly 80-ish; brooding and slow. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments, very few.
