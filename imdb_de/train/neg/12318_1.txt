I absolutely hate this program, which people are sitting there watching this garbage? OK, my dad and mom love it. Lol, but I make sure I'm out of the room before it comes. It's so depressing and bleak, but the worst part is acting. I can not stand all the detective programs like this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. What has become of detective programs with real mystery ??? I mean, who wants to know what happened to fictional characters of whom we do not know anything that died over 20 years ago ??? I wish the BBC would put more comedy on BBC1 cos, since now Dibley's vicar is done, there's more room for crap like this.
