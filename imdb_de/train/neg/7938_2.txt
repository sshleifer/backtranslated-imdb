A family looking for old roadside attractions to add to their father's book encounters an old, rundown, old freak show run by an eccentric one-eyed man. When their family van collapses on leaving the show, they are forced to stay in an abandoned fisherman's camp, where decades ago a prison break took place. <br /> <br /> There have been many films in the 'Freak' subgenre of horror, from Tod Browning's beloved 'Freaks' (1932) to Alex Winter's funny 'Freaked' (1993). These are both classics (or soon with "Freaked"). However, Side Sho will never be. And if it ever reaches classic status. , , Well, it's an obvious indication of the sad state of our genre. From the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17-year-old daughter, who is obviously older than her birth mother, this movie did not have much to offer. The writing was subpar, but not terrible. , , just boring. The direction was bad and the rare freak effects were pretty awful and unbelievable. The acting was miserable and the casting was even worse. Anyone who would believe the age of these two teens in the camp may not have seen a teenager for a long time. There was not enough violence and violence to make up for the lack of other quality. , , and when there was a bit of violence, it was not well done at all. And I can not forget mentioning the ending fight scenes that were honestly one of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. All in all, this is an easy-to-forget and malign horror movie that deserves to be left alone at the end of the dollar fall. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: 2.5 / 10.
