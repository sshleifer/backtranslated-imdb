This movie has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It is a curious film from World War II and serves as an explanation of racism. It is worthwhile to understand the fact that films reflect the feelings when they are produced and not over the period of time that they produce. This means it's a 70's movie, not a 40's movie (WW2). Still, there are some good action scenes of seven seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a dam. At the heart of the story is the Captain, that these men are soldiers and not just a service society. There is a scene that could have come from a civil war movie, not a WWII movie that reflects what the movie is about. The Black Lieutenant gives a German woman an innocent touch on the cheek, and the white Capt gets angry. I enjoyed the movie from a curious perspective, as the stars and the genre were interesting to me.
