Obvious attacks on Microsoft made by people who do not seem to understand intellectual property or the market economy in general. Loony Liberal Tim Robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of Bill Gates and is a cartoonist who orders killings right and left. <br /> <br /> Although Microsoft occasionally practices anticompetitive activities, it is unlikely that they will actually murder people. Therefore, the film is exaggerated and ridiculous from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The "deeper" point seems to be that major technical innovations should be free to the public and should not be subject to the laws on intellectual property. However, this ignores the fact that most of the important innovations would never have been developed unless the market incentives (and rewards) provided by intellectual property were created. <br /> <br /> It's one thing to be against anticompetitive behavior - that's reasonable. It is quite another thing to oppose the competition in the first place, as it is the mantra of the film ("knowledge belongs to humanity"). <br /> <br /> Another example of Hollywood being completely unrealistic.
