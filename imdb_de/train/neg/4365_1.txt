Ariauna Albright is a really good actress, but why she was involved in this lame travesty is a mystery. What could be entertaining ends up being classic boredom. The unique thing about Ariauna is that she looks really sexy compared to her partner Lilith Stabs, who looks good, but it's obvious that she spent the money on drama or beautician drama school. This was a production that screamed for T & A and could be reached in the flow of things with a fanciful script writer. However, Ariauna does what she can and saves her reputation to some extent. The Tempe company should know that if you attract two attractive women in tight fetish cop uniforms, the spectators expect some fetish play and T & A. Nough said.
