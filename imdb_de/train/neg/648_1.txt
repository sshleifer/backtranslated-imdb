The Night of the Final Ball: The most important night for any flat girl made almost entirely of plastic. And so the characters reminded us every ten minutes, when a few minute events took place in their tiny lives. <br /> <br /> There is really no excuse for Prom Night. There is less than anything original about it and I would have given it truly zero or less stars if it were possible on IMDb. The only part of my vision I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of "ghosts". It was much more exciting than anything on the screen before them. <br /> <br /> The plot was basically a guy who was making a robbery. And the thing was, it was not even an exciting raid. If the guy from afar had been scary, instead of a tame Robbie Williams wearing a baseball cap, I might have been a bit worried. The fact that I was less concerned with the characters than the color of the kitty carpet did not really add to the effect. And worse, the rest of the characters were just as one-dimensional and forgetful. The hotel employees did not seem to notice that one of their maids had disappeared and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognizable after his shave. I was incredibly surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person who noticed who he was. She notices this and then falls down the stairs, gets caught in a plastic wrap and kills a pile of paint buckets. Nice. <br /> <br /> The worst part was, I strongly believe that the director has made every effort. He has truly crossed all boundaries by showing no killing. Shocking! And the music does not get me started. It was almost as appropriate as painting at a funeral. <br /> <br /> I really wish Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and stupid predictable. Nobody has a reason to see this movie. Mainstream cinema seems to be downhill, and movies like these make the situation worse. If you feel the urge to see this absolutely horrible movie, listen to my request. Do not do it. There are better things to spend six pounds for. Like a leaf with which you can play ghosts.
