The question of seeing a movie so bad is not necessarily "How was a movie made that bad?" or even, "why did I even see that?" "What did I learn from this experience?" Here's what I've learned: <br /> <br /> - Just because the "rules" of horror movies have been cataloged and satirized countless times over the last decade does not mean that anyone will make a movie ALL of them them, without a touch of humor or irony. <br /> <br /> - If your movie needs to be described as ** loose ** based on the video game, you're having trouble with the script. <br /> <br /> - The black character may not always die first, but the Asian character always knows kung fu. <br /> <br /> - While you're proud that you've found the matrix effect on a budget, that does not necessarily mean that you should use it again and again and nausea. <br /> <br /> - Being Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee a role choice. <br /> <br /> - If a scene is not edited together, just use some video footage from the videogame, nobody will notice. <br /> <br /> - If your cousin's rap metal band offers to write down the theme of their movie for free and politely. <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not people who kill zombies. It's about zombies, killing people in the most cruel ways possible, which makes them scary. <br /> <br /> - White people who can pay $ 1600 to earn a rave deserve death. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know, anything else you'll find out for yourself after j Emand was asked: "What was that?" or "Where are we?" <br /> <br /> - Naked boobs are not a horror movie. <br /> <br /> - A helicopter boom and a license agreement with Sega magically transforms your movie. "Student Film" to "Major Studio Release". Try it! <br /> <br /> - Just because you can name all three "Living Dead" movies does not make you George Romero. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I saw worse movies, but only because I saw "Mortal Kombat: Destruction".
