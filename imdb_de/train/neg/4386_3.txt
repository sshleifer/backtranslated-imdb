With a title like this, you can not expect a great horror movie. That was really bad, even if the expectations were low. The conspiracy is really insulting and stupid: An escaped criminal wears a Halloween mask, and everyone around him thinks he's someone else. This joke may work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not throughout the movie! The actors are not that bad, but their characters are pretty stupid and the story is boring and downright stupid. No tension, no excitement and little gore (very cheap). Satan's little helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically. It got so boring towards the end that I actually stopped ten minutes before the end. I do not care what happened. Amanda Plummer was great in Pulp Fiction, but come on ... that was 13 years ago, and after that she did not do anything decent. No wonder she had to sink as deep as this bitch. Avoid or be warned ..
