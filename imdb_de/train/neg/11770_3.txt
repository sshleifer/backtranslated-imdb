'P' (or Club-P) should actually be called Lame 'L'. Every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that does not do justice to their much-hyped Logline: "Thai lesbians fight monsters." It is rather the story of a Khmer country girl whose grandmother taught her a little bit of witchcraft, with a few strange (but specific) rules: "Do not go under a clothesline," "do not eat raw meat" and "Do not accept money for your powers. " Well, guess what, the girl moves to Bangkok to collect some money as a "bar girl" and manages to break all the rules Grandma has taught him, which triggers a bad ghost, the kills the "foreign underwear" that will pay for their services. <br /> <br /> Although this film can not even be released in Thailand due to its controversial theme, most American viewers will find this weird horror picture as a mix of "showgirls" and "interview with the vampires" like Walt Disney <br /> <br /> If not for a couple of scenes with a lot of blood, the MPAA could probably only do this for adolescents: there are literally televised adult TV rates, though you would expect at least one sex scene, considering that the movie is a brothel and one of the actresses in real life is a Thai porn star. <br /> <br /> As for the "lesbian" angle, there is a short smooch and a few "I love you "to prove that the two main stars are really a couple (brother) and the P-bar must be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls stop their sarongs and Make carnival stunts (there is a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl's mouth ... ooh, phallic pictures). <NO nudity, NOT a real monster (unless you count a five foot Thai ghost with yellow eyes), and by no means should an adult ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD. You were warned!
