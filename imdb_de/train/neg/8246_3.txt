Daddy's girls, Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West, get some great news at the local post office. They do not know that they are being pursued by the burglar Charles Inslee. In the meantime, Father David Miles (from young Robert Harron) receives a message that requires dad to leave home. so, when the young women come back, can they be? home alone. As the vulnerable couple relax for the evening, the local "Grand Ball of the Black and Tans" sets off; and a dark-skinned drinker indicates an additional danger to D.W. Griffith's dynamic duo? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of his better biograph roles and steals the movie from "The Girls and Daddy". Ironically, Director Griffith appears as one of the black-faced extras on the "Black and Tans" ball. "Biograph Girls" Lawrence and West point to later "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); and they are overly affectionate in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate, as the story of a burglar rescued by rescuing his potential victims from greater danger is intriguing. <br /> <br /> *** The Girls and Daddy (01.02.09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
