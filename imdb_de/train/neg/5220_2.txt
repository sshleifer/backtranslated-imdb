A young basketball professor of genetics researches the genetic sequence with human fetuses. He hopes to find a remedy for all diseases and aging. He is forced to complete his research because he has not published. Therefore, the university has difficulty financing it (I think). Then he tries it. He starts a relationship with the single mother of a very annoying little boy. She was the one who demanded results from research. <br /> <br /> At first, he seems to have no effect from the injection, except for some new strength. Then he realizes that he had a memory loss and starts to remember what happened. Besides, he seems very unhealthy. <br /> <br /> As the movie is called metamorphosis, it eventually changes into something else. They do not trust your eyes - either from what he has become, or the absolutely crappy costume that the actor wears to depict what he was made of. Incredibly, there is another change in the business - the end of the movie is really, really absurdly very small part. <br /> <br /> I once saw the video box with a plastic plastic mold glued to the box cover. It may even have had some electronics in it, maybe eyes that light up (the main character's eyes sometimes turn green in the movie). The copy I was looking at had a box that had only tear strips on which the glue had been on the peeled plastic. The novelty box cover, if it had always been that way, would have been the only reason why I had stuck to this movie; I will definitely get rid of it.
