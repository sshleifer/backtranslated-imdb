This is probably the best horror movie ever created since Ed Wood's death. <br /> <br /> I can not spoil the end because I have absolutely no idea what happened. I will do my best. There are some kind of lesbian vampires, but they keep exchanging bodies so that each character could or may not be the character you think he is or it could be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> sound confusing? It's not as confusing as you might think because none of the characters makes sense first. There is no plot, no character development, and random people appear, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard again. There are also zombies that may be the enemies of the vampires, but there is also a kind of dream dream in a psychiatric institution. So maybe none of that happened, and it's all the hallucination of the main character. <br /> <br /> The advantage? Both head girls take off their shirts for a moment. The special effects are just stunning (I especially liked the incredibly slow, awkward fighting sequences). Everyone has a stupid Canadian accent that adds to the general amusement. <br /> <br /> Worth the rental price. We laughed until we cried.
