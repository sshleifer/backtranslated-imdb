Take a look at the 1936 version. As personally annoying I find Charles Boyer's voice, he is more of a comparison with the cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf. I mean, Omar Sharif tries, but no, too sweet and alive. Not only does Catherine Denueve (sp) look too old, she does not look like Marie either - nothing! She is too refined not even to think about loving this man this way. <br /> <br /> The only actor in the entire film who gives the role they play is Ava Gardner, whose appearance as Empress Elisabeth on screen is appropriately short (and looking up pictures of the Empress, there is more as a temporary resemblance), as Empress Elisabeth was historically not so involved in Rudolf's life.
