God, I'm so sick of the crap "cartoons" from America! <br /> <br /> Since the advent of anime, US animators have either produced a cartoon with a 5-year Lazy-Ass drawing style (Kappa Mikey) or a cheap Japanese animation rip-off. No wonder anime beats American cartoons! <br /> <br /> You are not trying! Oh, I heard about it last night. I live in the UK and when I found out that this show was first released in 2005, I never knew that the UK was so up to date with the current shows.
