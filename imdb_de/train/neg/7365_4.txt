Not a bad, but not so good Heistfilm. Kirk Douglas is a recently released safe-cracker who, after rejecting an offer from the mob, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits the circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem follows. Douglas and Gemma are soon pursued by Mafia Goon Romano Puppo and involved in a really stupid triangle with Douglas' infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the tempo moving and there is at least one outstanding and creative chase with Puppo & Gemma. Although it is an Italian production, most of the shooting was done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just in a giallo quickie. The distinctive Bolkan offers a great performance. The music was written by Ennio Morricone and the camera by Tonino Delli Colli, who has managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
