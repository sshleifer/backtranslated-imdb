Someone mentioned the editing. This was badly handled and what started as something intriguing became an incomprehensible mess. Let us first know what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choice for the kind of experimentation they are involved in? And what exactly do you test? There seems to be a big plan that an agency will take advantage of. Acting is pretty bad. Everyone is emotional. Everyone keeps secrets. They often mention that if they did not have the money, they would raise the money. There is a confused minister who launches the script. And further. The biggest problem, however, is the lack of playing fields for the actors. There are some really cheesy elements. These little rooms and these couches. The terrible wallpaper (was it wallpaper?). It was interesting but did not seem to go nowhere.
