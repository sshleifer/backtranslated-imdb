The depths of Creepshow 3 are not particularly explored. It also uses the same technique, in which some of the same actors in the entire anthology are used in multiple roles, which, to say the least, is distracting. <br /> <br /> It also teases the Twilight Zone (with the bookstore) comparable to Serling's late night gallery). Unfortunately, the producers and authors forgot that Serling would build sympathy for his characters before messing them up. None of the characters is particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last section. <br /> <br /> Framing story: Adam West is ... well, he himself. He does not go the Bruce Wayne / Batman Campy 60's route, but he rarely does. He just plays the not very puzzling "Jay" (there is an ominous, scary name comparable to Dr. Terror, Eramus, and The Cryptkeeper) and makes some slightly clumsy / creepy statements. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: Did Rod Serlings see "A Stop in Willoughby"? Then you saw that. The red herring of the Nutso woman is not introduced for any purpose, but even the main character's friend identifies him as a sissy. As well managed as expected, but basically incoherent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: Recalls various contemporary stories from Serling mixed with Steve Allen's "A Meeting of Minds". Most actors are not too bad (except Josh Astin as Cassius who manages to walk, talk and even breathe awkwardly), and the idea is slightly interesting. But like Abernathy, there is nowhere to go. The main character raises some relatively sensible questions, casts a bit (who would not?), And for some reason he lands in a nuclear wasteland. <br /> <br /> Life Replay: Not a bad little piece, and manages to date both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose it says something about people being fascinated by the magic of remote controls. The main character is mildly sympathetic. Nothing substantial innovative here, but it is fine. <br /> <br /> Fighting Spirit: You see the twist is a mile away, but like the main character, it has some heart and it's a decent story of defeat and salvation. <Br /> <br /> Finale: So ... why do people in cold camps end up in silly, lame suits? Do not know And makes no sense. So ... all the protagonists went to the bookstore and were locked up? Somehow the happy ending undermines with the boxer (thanks guys!), And the guy in the first segment has died. How is he caught? Did he visit the bookstore before he died, got caught in a trap and ... did not die? What? Huh I suspect that this is not considered useful because it is supernatural. But anyway ... <br /> <br /> Overall: Not unlike the two newer Twilight Zone series or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time. But there is nothing really spectacular here.
