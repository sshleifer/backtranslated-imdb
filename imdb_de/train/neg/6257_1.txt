SPOILERS Strange people with generous taste have been watching this movie. Allow me to add the following balance: <br /> <br /> Script: Terrible. Since Tom and Dan "get to know each other" and rave about movies, the speech is clearly one person, and I suspect it was the director who worked his words carefully to sound intelligent. At one point, Dan asks, "Did you hear about the HIV virus?" and it sounds about as natural as the question: "Did you contact the nine alien races?". Speedman did well enough with what he was given, I suppose, but Marsden was terrible-disagreeable, unbelievable, and almost complacent and sarcastic in his entire captivity. There is a void in his performances (see also Interstate 60). <br /> <br /> Plot: Spare me! The moments of escape were not exciting, but irritating and weak. Remember Marsden pretending to try the keys in the door and then throw them down: "You're not working, man!" Tea hee. And beware of the semi-black-and-white flashbacks, which are triggered with a soft sound by CSI and other thrillers. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, most dangerous, vicious and offensive is homophobia (externally or internally, you decide) in a movie that uses HIV as a weapon. Tom says that Dan may have lost the condom or not used it at all - excuse me, where was Tom while they had sex? There is a few villainy of the insertion partner who generally acts as a villain of the gay man. <br /> <br /> In total: Attention!
