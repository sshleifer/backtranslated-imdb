Ah, Bait. How do I hate you? Let me count the ways. 1. They try to be funny, but are stupid and unpleasant; Every joke is predictable and expected, and when he comes, he does not laugh. Instead, I want to fling. 2. You try to be dramatic, but you are incredible. The woman exaggerates to a dreadful degree and the "bad guy" looks like Bill Gates and is about as scary as ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine how Bill Gates wants to intimidate someone with a gun, does not work, or? A lawyer, maybe, but no weapon.) Does not fit.) As for Jamie Foxx, just watch him try a dramatic one and to have cordial dialogue is ridiculous and makes me want to fling. 3. They try to be action-packed, but instead they get bored and pull too often. And when the action gets hotter, the tripod for the camera has to be lost, because the scenes wobble more than those in the Blair Witch Project, and I think I'm bad, and I want to fling again. 4. You try to be a good movie, but you failed, you failed, you failed! I would rather walk barefoot across the Sahara, with a pack full of beef and no water, no sunscreen, and Meryl Streep only. This hell would be prettier than spending a minute more time plodding on a wicked guy in Bait with Bill Gates's idiotic story, not even talking about the massive bomb that Jamie Foxx has fired in a car Cliff driven away, but somehow he manages to escape ... just kill me now or do the right thing and promise me that I'll never have to watch a movie that's so bad, never again.
