Alone in The Dark is one of my favorite role-playing games of all time. I remember spending whole nights in front of the PC screen trying to escape from this villa, and in fact, I was sometimes startled when monsters got surprisingly charged. I can not remember a single track record in this new Hollywood genre, though some are entertaining enough to be viewed. And yet I'm such a big fan of the game that I can not resist. My reason was that the movie would be alright if the movie had an action that was very similar to the game. <br /> <br /> Man, that was 90 minutes (that seemed like 300) of my life that I'll never get back. If I had the chance, I would have liked to have her rearrange my sock drawer instead. This is not even in the category "so bad that it is funny". You might think that even Christian Slater had a bit more sense than to join this stink bomb. Well, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. However, if the purpose of this chick is a major role, it is to have a sex scene that I fully understand and support (hey, I'm a guy!). - I've seen more of her body at press conferences. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy. Do not waste your time trying to imagine it. The credibility of the story sinks below "I had no sex with Mrs. Lewinski". Acting is just a few notches above "Street Fighter," which by the way is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would recommend OVER video game. It has a much better story, acting and much more thrills. As for the movie, here is a spoiler - he STINKS! Wait for the porn version.
