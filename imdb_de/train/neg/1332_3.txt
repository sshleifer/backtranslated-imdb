The novelty that Jay Leno consists of four letters is the only memorable aspect of these formal, disagreeable, police partners. In COLLISION COURSE, the comedian with the pelican face and the late Pat Morita is looking for a stolen prototype turbocharger (think car enthusiast Leno played a hand in action?). The two leads try everything, but Leno is not an actor, and Morita's fish-out-of-water routine gets in a hurry. The film is a bit cheesy from the 80's, but its worthy moments are getting scarcer as it fills its more than 100-minute run. Fans of Leno's remarkable comedic talent will feel disappointed; Everyone else will just be bored.
