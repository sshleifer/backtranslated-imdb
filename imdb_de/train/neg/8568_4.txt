DEAD HUSBANDS is a somewhat stupid comedy about a group of women conspiring to push each other away from their husbands. It's not embarrassing at all like some comedies I could mention, but it never fulfills its potential. Imagine how good that would have been if the Farrelly brothers staged Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson. Oh, Carter is based on Jerry Springer? Just curious, because the slogan in the show by dr. Elson "pay attention to one another and keep talking" is.
