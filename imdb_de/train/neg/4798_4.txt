* Includes some spoilers * This movie is a cheesy 80s horror in all its horror. The plot takes far too long to rise from the ground, it never stabilizes and then crashes into the movie after about 40 minutes. For zombie fans, there are a few jewels, but not nearly enough zombies to create a real sense of terror. <br /> <br /> The zombies also take a long time to appear. First, there is a whole half of a movie about mobs and prison gangs. The hero of the film is a former Vietnamese veterinarian, who is involved in the mob. The main lobbyist sets him up and goes to jail. In this prison, they experiment with the prisoners to find a way to heal them from murderous tendencies and criminal behavior. But the psychologist of the badie psychotic leader / military has other plans. He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to ... there ... make super soldiers! After some infected prisoners have killed a few guards and most of the prison has an infected communion wine, the military / crazy scientist guy goes to "Hey, that could be a problem" and calls the ingenious scientist who becomes an investigative journalist, ultra hot female independent female character who naturally invented the original serum. She goes to jail to see what's going on, the military calls some SWAT teams out of safe-haven positions outside the prison, and the hero takes control of the few prisoners with a heart of gold as an uprising breaks out. The hero and the scientist / journalist work together to find a cure, rescue the overseer's children and fight some angry prisoners who are infected and not. Meanwhile, the mob boss has made a deal to go to jail so he can rescue his imprisoned brother. The military is getting ready to blow up the place, and everyone inside is looking for a way out. <br /> <br /> There are many bloody scenes in which people are killed by pushing or pulling through prison bars. There is also a scary beheading scene and a scene with electric shock affecting the same infected Rasta prisoner. The most troubling scene, however, is at the beginning of the film, when a corrupt guard raped a prisoner. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie is a scene towards the end. The hero, the wife and the children try to reach the only escape route. Their path leads to a long corridor with a wall on one side and prison bars on the other side. Hundreds of bloody zombie creatures reach out and grace their hair and faces as they pass by. There are also some good scenes from the classic "few zombies chewing fresh bodies" and "many zombies tearing a guy to pieces". <br /> <br /> Overall, it's worth watching if you explore the zombie genre, since there are so many zombie clich√©s that are worth mentioning; It's practically a manual that you should not do in the zombie movie. But if you are not familiar with zombie flicks and you want to be really scared, then you should look elsewhere.
