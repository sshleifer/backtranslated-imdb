Who created this crap? This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It is such a waste of time and money. I hate how they create low-budget sequels with D-Lister actors and a story so similar to the first one. <br /> <br /> I found this movie in the bargain basket right next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $ 2.99 What an idiot I thought this might be good, instead I watched in disgust as bad-looking stereotypes the plot and script of the first-deprived-to-video production was actually just a halfway decent movie, you have to be on Crackd or something, because I think what most people who saw this movie think, WHAT a burden of CRAP !!!!
