I'm sorry, but I did not like this document very much. I can imagine millions how it could have been better. The people who made it obviously do not have much imagination. The interviews are not very interesting and no real insights are offered. The footage is not compiled very informative. It's a pity, because this is a movie that really deserves fascinating peculiarities. I will say that Isabella Rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets. All in all, this will only be a '4'.
