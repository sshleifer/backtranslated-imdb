Oh man! The first time I heard about this bad show was when one of my friends screamed like an idiot "JOHNY TEST" while we were playing video games. I thought he was confusing "Johny Quest" (one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life, by the way) and changed the "quest" to "test." It's a bit weird that I'm wrong, but actually I was wrong, he did not change anything, he heard about this show. <br /> One day I heard on TV that Cartoon Network would be released, I was not sure what was the plot of this show, so I am myself on my way to look at them, and here's my answer: "I want my damn hour back" (because I saw this crap and "My fitness partner is a monkey") /> This is one of the worst shows, that I've ever seen: first the beginning with the dumbest song in the world, then the plot Oh, where are my manners I did not say the plot of this show It's about a boy who has to have amazingly SMART sisters, the one Have laboratory and experiments with her br /> You know, I miss Dexter's La sincerely b (before being turned into the NEW Dexter, also a total crap). This is a bad copy of this old good show, except that this show is amazingly bad. Do not look at it, make something more productive in this half hour than this crap.
