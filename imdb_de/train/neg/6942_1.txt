This thing is really terrible. There are no characters with weight, they all float in the BG's. The Motion Capture is an excellent toy, but this movie shows that it really takes animations to make an animated film. THE MACHINE CAN NOT DO EVERYTHING EVERYTHING. If you see it as a bizarre movie, you'll enjoy finding continuity mistakes ... IN A 3D FILM !!! It's funny to see how the princess dress moves with other Phisics. You need animators and 3D animators, no data inputs that know 3D programs. Notice the intersections, such as the elbows, as they have lost volume and become deformed. The person who made the character's design (a very good design) certainly suffered as he / she watched them move.
