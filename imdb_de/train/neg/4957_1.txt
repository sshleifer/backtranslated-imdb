I can not believe that some people really like that. Nevertheless, they call themselves Batman fans. Even when it's time to say, it's better than BTAS. What it is not It should be a plagiarism for them to use Batman's name for this piece of crap. It is not Batman. <br /> <br /> The whole premise of the show is, "If you can not beat someone getting a bigger gun to help you?" He uses his batarang and his fishing hook and Batmobile, that's it. He does not always have a new, ingenious technique when he can beat someone. I do not know where the hell you got the idea for a Batbot. or what ever. They ruined all the villains. Mr. Freeze has evolved from a sympathetic scientist to a little criminal who was in a freezer. Catwoman is now a 40- or 50-year-old woman with a dumb costume. Penguin is now a ninja with a 50 foot tall cylinder. The ventriloquist is now called Scarface and makes the dummy the entire middle piece of the character. They even had a stupid idea to make him a giant! wtf? and the two worst character changes are The Joker and Riddler. They made Riddler a goth / retro teen freak. and the Joker becoming an acrobat with dreads. He looks like a Bob Marley wannabe. They've ruined Batman even more and more than B & R! I wish I could meet the creators and / or writers and animators of this show so I could hit them in the head with a metal baseball bat.
