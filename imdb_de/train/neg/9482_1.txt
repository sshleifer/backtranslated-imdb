Do not even waste your time, let alone the rent for this bastard! How it's done goes beyond me. (I do not know why there's a minimum of 10 lines ... I've already summarized this trashy movie, but well ...) The acting was terrible, as if they had all the lessons. The plot was weak, the end ... Feh! I think the cinematography was the only thing that was not totally crap ... well, maybe the sound was minimalist OK. The good thing is, if they could make this movie, even make some money with it, there could be hope for any screenwriter with a REAL idea. So, you all take heart! I think that's also true for actors. If these people were actually paid, you can too!
