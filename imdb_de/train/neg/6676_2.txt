Although I was not the biggest Blair Witch fan, I appreciated that effort anyway. That's why I was looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various IMDb comments. "Unique," "intelligent," "a future cult classic," and so on ... You have to wonder where people come from to describe such a bad effort. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Altered is a weak, weak movie that is not involved in any way. Stupidity is not funny. The horror and Gore is not scary. Whatever the "thinking" aspect that some poor guys saw in this movie was due to serious delusions, since there's nothing profound or clever in this mess. Is it at least bearable? Is the experience worthwhile in any way? Unfortunately, not. To act very badly for the beginning. It's not hard to say that most B-movies work better today. The plot? Boring and messy. Dialogues Many amateurs actually make it better. <br /> <br /> It's really the direction that puzzles. I have not expected much improvement over Blair Witch, but at least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to have worsened over time without paying attention to previous experiences. <br /> <br /> If Altered has a fatal error, this is the main clause. Much of the action takes place in a single location where the main characters are imprisoned, but Sánchez has not given the place any personality. Considering that in Blair Witch the forest plays a big role and plays an equally important role (an antagonist, if you will) like the three students, one would think the director would realize that the same thing is needed here. But no ... this place has no personality, thanks to the sloppy direction and attention to detail. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to save here. The hard fans of "Blair Witch" are better off after Daniel Myrick. Although his output is anything but golden, he shows a better structure than Sánchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are used (unfortunately in weak stories but still).
