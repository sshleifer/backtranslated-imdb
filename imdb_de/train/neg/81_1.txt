Life has done it again. Can we say stupid? I could not wait for it to end. The story was meaningless. The spectacle was terrible! Especially from the teenagers. The story was played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give the actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller. Once in a lifetime there is a good movie, this is not one of them. If you have nothing else to do, I would avoid this at all costs. That was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get her back? I would have scratched my face for two hours against a brick wall and then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining.
