My first test of 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort, who like to explore hidden treasures at the foot of a local reef. One day, after a day of exploration, they are approached by a couple of David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell the young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef, and find a rare artifact about Columbus' hidden treasure displayed at the bottom of the reef. They find nothing on the bottom of the reef and rough areas after a full day's dive , A few days ago, the two hired divers found out they were part of a big deadly plan they can not flee, otherwise they will be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other a core. <br /> <br /> The film also has a backstory about another person (brother of the main character) trying to get things together with his girlfriend. I think this part of the story was a waste of time, including a very steamy sex scene between the couples, which is a complete waste for me and did not have to be shown. However, apart from that movie has some good underwater photography and the colors match well, which is why it gets 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is just a sequel. None of the original actors or characters come back, it has a stupid plot, stupid characters and a boring climax.
