First of all, I'd like to say to all who saw this movie that the actor who played the "transvestite" is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he's a terrific actor, even if he does not say much about that his filmography, he was in several plays and musicals. He currently lives in Terrace B.C. I come from all over the country, he comes to our house almost every Saturday. * laughs * Okay, now for the movie, I would not recommend that to anyone who has NOT seen it, because it's not a movie worth seeing. The main reason why I thought it was a bad movie is that it never stays in its place, it keeps jumping back, so it's hard to follow in some places, and second, it's really boring. Film just does not compare.
