When I saw CBS's "Surrender, Dorothy", I wondered again and again why Diane Keaton wanted to be there (not because it's a TV movie - with the lack of tantalizing roles for slightly older actresses, it's no wonder the Oscar was with the Oscar wins Performers like Keaton turn to television - but because it does not give Keaton a chance to shine). A single mother mourning the sudden death of her approximately twenty-year-old daughter forces the group of young people who had her daughter close at the time of her accident and gradually makes her friends with them. Adapted to the novel, this television game features a group of self-absorbing characters from which one would cross the street to avoid. Besides being rude and weak, these crazy people are unbelievably convincing, as well as the tidy scenario and bungalow near the beach where the kids live (a young man wearing muscle shirts to tell us he's gay) is, hear Diane Keaton say: Surrender, Dorothy "and actually asks," That's from The Wizard of Oz, right? "... no, genius, it's from" Citizen Kane "!). Keaton may have wanted this Making material based on the theme of confrontation with death, she attempts to turn this extremely unlikely woman into a shadow of her own personality (lots of crazy outfits), but she does not go well with the viewer as Keaton has always been very gracious and flexible Here she is a crazy harpy who has not learned many lessons on her voyage of discovery (the movie quickly forgets that it is a dead young woman and becomes an ody For the nervous wreck of a mother who seems to be an over-the-top hippie who has never lost anyone near her). This is the kind of movie actor promoting on talk shows with the caveat: "It should help many mourning mothers out there." I can not imagine that it will help anyone, since it is a downer in itself, confused and confusing. It is disturbed.
