I was not as "happy" as some others commenting on this film: I have never seen anything else from the ... say, "fecund" by Sarno. I agree with many: Some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and (go-go) dancing are not really attractive. Somehow I liked Miss Crank (?) ... she was so homely, she was cute! Acting was also quite outdated, although providing second-language lines may have caused much of this problem. The attempt to follow the plot was a big task: was there really one? I agree with another comment from the heart: For a vampire movie, there is not much blood. Yes, if you want good bloodsucking flicks, check out Hammer classics like "Horror of Dracula" and (my personal favorite) "Brides of Dracula". <br /> <br /> The (inadvertently) most humorous part is where the doctor gets her clothes ripped off by a bat cloud ... that you'll never SEE ... ... the bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> Okay, as a waste of time, if you accidentally catch them cables here in the Great White North, but for God's sake, do not rent it!
