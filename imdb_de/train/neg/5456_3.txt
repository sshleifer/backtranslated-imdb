This is just another movie of those vile movies you'll find on Lifetime TV, which empathically portrays the vile behavior of a disgusting woman. Along with other such unpleasant movies as "The Burning Bed," "Enough" or "Monster," this movie takes a disgusting criminal and tries to show the viewer why he's not such a bad person at all. Give us a break! Here's my question to the filmmakers: If LeTourneau had been a man and Vili was a 12-year-old girl, would you have made a picture that sympathizes with and empathizes with that person? Answer: Hell no. <br /> <br /> Imagine, you change the sexes in this movie, and then you'll see why I and others here consider that worthless garbage. If the sexes were changed, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we would probably see the portrayal of a monstrous and vile man exploiting a young girl, his lax behavior landing him in jail, and his brainwashing victim suffering from the Stockholm syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not get the same treatment in this movie is because of their gender. <br /> <br /> Let's call a spade a spade. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Plain and simple. No ifs and buts or buts. She is a criminal in prison and deserves our mockery and contempt, but certainly not our compassion or our empathy.
