How deep can someone sink in while trying to recapture an old glory? ST: HF likes to show it to you. <br /> <br /> If you're used to seeing what a good Star Trek show was, then you should NOT watch this - Podge, the performers of their characters are weak and, above all, the design work almost doggy. <br /> <br /> If you watch strong captains, do not look here! How the strong attitude of the Federation? Forget it here! The Starfleet is mocked by little flags with SPIKES in their hair. <br /> <br /> While a seemingly mentally ill captain strolls through the opening show, Ensign Spikey attempts to arrange a tryst with an engineer within two minutes. From there it is being mined. No, not even uniforms agree, for heaven's sake. They are too small or too tall, have collars to the chest and TNG Seasons One and Two uniforms mixed with uniforms of the third and DS9 squadrons. The strict discipline and tradition of one of the originals missing in this production except the steps! The only good thing about this show is the graphics, which seem to improve a little every season. OK, I'll take that back. Who uses CG so improperly? The designers of this show. <br /> <br /> Do not bother, it offends your Star Trek feeling, as it did with me. Not even the setback to earlier shows can save this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> I cried openly when I saw that, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head was almost torn. So bad.
