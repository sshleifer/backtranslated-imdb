This kid is pretty bad, but in no way does he make him a guy who outwits the grownups and can thwart thieves at every turn. No, he is less a brat than a child with serious emotional problems. A nice couple who wants to be adopted is more likely to be adopted, and while the husband is more willing to give this child a chance the mother does not have. Through in a bizarre Michael Richards character and the always annoying Gilbert Gottfried and you have yourself a pretty bad movie with a few laughs here and there. I prefer the sequel to this movie because I like the fact that they brought Amy Yasbeck as a more personable character, as there are one or many characters in the film who are not that in the least. Even the boy in this case is quite annoying at first and refreshes him in the sequel. The conspiracy is simple enough, because when the future parents adopt this kid, which they think is great when the orphanage is having a party while they go, they find themselves having a little hell. Added to this little hell, which comes into contact with a convicted person. I am not sure what this character is about. At first I thought it should be his real father or something. Not quite as good, but I will select every Culkin child every day of the week.
