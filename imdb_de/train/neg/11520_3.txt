I did not enjoy this movie at all. For one, I found it simple and, for no reason, rude and vulgar. I also found him hostile to women (against women). The movie really does not seem to be anything, and I found none of the characters sympathetic. Actually, there seems to be no sense in everything. Maybe I'm missing something, but for me this movie is a waste of time if I could have done something more productive and entertaining. Like I use my face as a pincushion. James Garner is in it, as are C. Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones and James Cromwell. Everything is wasted here, and I'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers. John Harrison (from the later years of Three's Company) is also in the film, and it's nice to see her in a non-compulsory role. But unlike her she can 'I'm above the mediocre script. For me Tank is 3/10
