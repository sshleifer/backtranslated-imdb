I'm sorry to go against the river, but I found this movie unrealistic, boring, and way too long. I was tired of seeing Gena Rowland's long, arduous struggle with herself and the crisis she was living through. Maybe the movie has a cinematic value or is an important step for the director, but for the sake of entertainment, I wish I had skipped it.
