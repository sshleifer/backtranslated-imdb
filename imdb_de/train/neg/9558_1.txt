I thought this was a continuation of some species, and it was supposed to be the original of 1983. But a sequel does not take the original action and destroy it. I actually had very little expectations of this movie, but I wasted only 95 minutes of life. No excitement - I actually feel clairvoyant, badly behaved and so filled with technical mistakes that I as a computer geek just could not believe it. They tried to make a mixture of a generic war movie and 24 hours. However, this is not even worthy of a low-budget television movie. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, this is a complete waste of time. Get the original instead. The topic is still valid. Do not leave too much power in a machine. And the drama and plot are much more exciting and engaging.
