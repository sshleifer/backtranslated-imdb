Impressive! I am shocked to learn that it is a small world and that we are all connected. What a waste of 88 minutes. John Dunne put it a lot better in one sentence. "No one is an island." The acting was not bad. The children gave everything they had, but sometimes the thread became so thin that I could not follow it, and the only real "hero" in the film ends up in jail after being tortured by a meter of maiden. I dont know. I just do not understand. Well.
