I had high expectations for "My Beautiful Laundrette", "Bend it like Beckham" and (less) "East is East". The history of British Asians, which fits in with their adoptive home, has had many good runs on the big screen as well as a number of excellent television and radio series (goodness, gracious people, etc.). This falls flat. Despite a good start, it went downhill quickly. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this was a dreadfully typical BBC attempt, complete with strong regional accents, crazy overblown characters, a soundtrack "these were the days" and many "issues" in an attempt to be worthy. <br /> <br /> I huddled in many places in this movie. The letter is predictable. Every possible cliché was pulled out and broadcast. In fact, I find it hard to think about intercultural / intergenerational devices that could or could not be used. The characters were thin and clichéd: the eccentric nonconformist minister; the well-meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the overweight, overbearing aunt; the intrusive Indian parents; the neighbor of the working class; the "wise" profound grandmother; the motorcycle rides rackets The screenplay was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with open racist dialogues of the two racist white characters. And why it had to play in the 70s (apart from the fact that it needed an apology for a 70s soundtrack) is a mystery. Unbelievable characters may become more credible for people born after 1979. I dont know. <br /> <br /> Even with these things aside, good action would have turned this into respectable darkness. Instead, the usual "BBC comedy" suspects were pulled out to prune it. "Bend it like Beckham" had a far better comic drama (and indeed a serious drama) than this with a virtually unknown cast. <br /> <br /> In summary, a lazy cliché script that seems too stupid predictable story. Do not miss it. <br /> <br />
