Who is as stupid as this movie? <br /> <br /> Accidentally killing a watchman ... characters so two-dimensional that a two-year-old could have drawn them ... and better ... <br /> <br /> A red toolbox of death ? Please .... <br /> <br /> Hypothermic faint thugs ... <br /> <br /> Spectacle from hell ... <br /> <br /> Stylistically, this film moves between teenage Comedy, Thriller, Voyeurism and ... female ... (um) Rambo? <br /> <br /> Unbelievable and it is an insult to every thinking person. Do not go, go away, it's more terrifying than you can possibly imagine ... <br /> <br /> And on top of that, trying to be hip by being too graphically in your power ... <br /> <Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny, it's just pathetic and terrible. Good luck for next time. :-(
