This film was reconstructed in 1992 with Conan Doyle's famous novel "The Lost World". And it shows. <br /> <br /> The film starts promising, with a reckless organization that wants to take advantage of the lost world, and Challenger et al. Return to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then go downhill. Everyone is stranded on the plateau, and we have a weak, boring, overlong rehab of the first movie. <br /> <br /> The dinosaurs (which are rarely seen) are just ridiculous. Are we expected to take the stuffed animal, which is supposed to be an Ankylosaur, seriously? And the tyrannosaur seems to be rooted on the spot. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and attack the 1925 silent version of Lost World. Unbelievable in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the twentieth version is the best one and will remain so until someone finally decides on a decent remake.
