OK, so I just saw the movie, even though it was released last year ... I thought that it's generally a decent movie, apart from the storyline, which is stupid and horrible ... First of all, we never learn anything About the creatures, why they appeared, do they do it in our world, and were they really on earth before we were or were they just from outer space? Secondly, the role of the butcher in maintaining order has simply been made so obvious ... Really, how big could the subway have been for a subway station? There were only so many of these creatures, so I think instead of killing innocent people for nothing, they could have just made some tactical bombs, or maybe that would be clear, and a nuke would have done the job. I know it sounds weird and it is, but I do not see killing people as NECESSARY ... Third, Leon acts like Superman, who jumps into the train and fights Vinnie Jones, who was much taller and taller. When faced with the conductor, he does nothing and acts like a weakling observing all abominations. I mean OK, the conductor had an eerie help (lol), but if Leon had been so brave, he would have gone all the way ... I mean, he's risking his life first, then he's not exactly doing it when he does should have done. He could have died as a hero, but he lives as a coward ... that could be the case, but not after he had shown so much courage ... Then comes the police thing ... come on! It was a city with a subway, I bet there must have been other cops, except this lady, other police stations, that was really a bit stupid ... All in all a great acting by Vinnie Jones it's not really built By the way, what did the signs on the chest mean? Vinnie Jones can not make up for the rest ...
