Well, well, you can not just waste time just for a big star cast. some wretched songs that are heard by whom? some pathetically abrupt twists justified by whom? the race against time? You mean waste against time? OK, so first treat your child, then teach him a lesson, wow we do not know who it is. Whoever said it was a brilliant new concept, is probably a different species than the human message that should be given, but it could also have been a stranger who sat next to you on the bus than you for one have decided so wasteful movie anyway!
