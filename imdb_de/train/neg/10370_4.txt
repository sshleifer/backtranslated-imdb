I really regret every single second of the time I've lost watching this movie. Unfortunately, I find it always difficult to turn off a movie as soon as I look at it. Especially if it's a classic or what people call classic. I think this is one of those movies that every movie lover should have seen at least once, that's why I watched it. Do not get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as an actor, but this movie was a big scam in my opinion. No really good action, neither a spy piece nor a romantic love story. Well, not even a compelling mix of both genres. The only thing that led to tensions was that it was uncertain if 'Bogey' and Bacall would end up together or separate. I think "To Have And Have Not" is very overrated and Bogart was shown in many better films in the 1940s.
