After Highlander 2 (which I still deny), I thought it was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I loved the original wargames, but this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original wargames had at least a few hacks that worked. Anyone who wrote this movie knew NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERs except using a word processor. I doubt he or she even saw the original movie. Acting does not even convince. Please do not save this movie in any case. I do not care if the transmitter gets stuck on the TV and you can not turn off the TV. This movie will ruin your life.
