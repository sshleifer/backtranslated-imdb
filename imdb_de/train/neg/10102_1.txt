If there ever was a movie that deserves a big fat zero rating, then it's that bunch of crap. I love zombie movies and even bad movies usually have something to offer, but not this cruelty. I actually felt angry when I saw this movie because it is so insultingly poor that I can not believe that those in charge would actually think that this would be acceptable with scenes of sadism and spanking. People do not react, act or resemble humans in any way. The entire film is also shot in two rooms that are sparsely furnished to resemble the places they are supposed to be. The whole thing is a senseless mess, there is nowhere to go and when the zombies finally appear, they look garbage and do not do much. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie than this, so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before. It's pathetic and undoubtedly the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the worst movie ever. By the way, you'll find that the only positive reviews are 10/10 and you're urged to buy the DVD. I can not imagine that anyone really thinks this is a good movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 and that's generous.
