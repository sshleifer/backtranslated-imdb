I looked at Imdbs Bottom 100 because I thought I never saw anything as bad as Plan 9 of Outerspace or Roller Ball Remake. I was wrong. Ben and Arthur have both defeated. <br /> <br /> This is one of the countless movies I have ever seen, the worst movie I have ever seen. Poor Direction, Bad Characters, Horrible Acting, Horrible Story There's a reason why nobody ever says anything positive about this movie except Sam. Sam was a terrible annoying actor, but his direction was so bad that he might overthrow Ed Wood. The director should remain ashamed of his work stars.
