I find it hard to believe that someone would put this film in the same context as the exorcist. Where the exorcist was subtle and creepy, stigmata was dull, awkward, and too formal. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visually beautiful films I have seen in a long time, but the images do not make it for the downward spiral of the patronized exposure that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this film was highest when compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official website increased that interest. The site has had many stories about "actual" stigmata throughout history. Scene by scene, however, the movie is so obsessed with its quest for "authenticity" that it becomes funny at first and then hard to see in the end. I became suspicious when the priest, charged with investigating potential miracles, walked into the beauty salon, where our heroine cuts hair and obviously flirts with priests. The plot: A woman without faith in God begins to receive the wounds of Christ (the stigmata) and is baffled and annoyed at the ordeal. A priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate the case. Is Frankie possessed by Satan or a jar for Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only wonder in this movie is that it finally ends.
