Yes, I think. It's difficult to say. It's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotions. This film is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel. For a frame there are some stone pillars, some stone seats, a few stone crosses and some stone actors. You have no emotions! The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it's Hamlet, and Hamlet is a wonderfully written piece of literature. The synchronization was really not that bad. The voices held to the boring, gloomy, dreary, fun-loving atmosphere the film radiated. I've seen this version of Hamlet three times on the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000, and on each of the three occasions, I was about to turn off the TV even though it was MST 3K. <br /> <br /> Not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better.
