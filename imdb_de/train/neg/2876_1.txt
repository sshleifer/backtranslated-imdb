I ask for the motive of the creators of this fictional representation of the motives of the BTK murderer. Are you trying to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for that? Do not you think that the people involved in this monster hurt enough? What a gross disrespect and exploitation of the victims! It was like a personality experiment: What bothers you more, the slaughterhouse or the human murders? They used the names of some victims ... this movie was abominable, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this film have used this tragedy for their own agenda! People have to wake up the line and redraw!
