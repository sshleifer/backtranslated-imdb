This is a case of a group of people who think they are so smart that they have a story that is right at the moment. Remember the political conspiracies captured in the years before Watergate and a little later in front of the camera? Most of the films that tried to come on Made-for-TV were so powerful that the conspirators were actually forced into their own navel-gazing. I've never been a fan of The Conversations, where I've had as much time as other conspiracy stints of the time, but Coppola was true to his main character and Hackman was a pretty addictive actor. I mean, these conspiracy movies mostly drown in the character pool of Noir heroes. Many questions unanswered, much incomprehension ... Well, at least Bergman needs a film about such non-visual fundamentals. <br /> <br /> The Next Man is a perfect example of his time: a political soup served with an idealistic character and a terrible conspiracy that consolidated the net around him. No part is interesting in itself and the whole thing does not get better. In fact, from the very first sequences, you can see how bad it will be to stack "Watcha That" murders without ever taking any action. Pedestrian directors in the worst case, since most of the film is a pompous collection of scenes that revolve around violence that is naively brought before the eyes of the beholder.
