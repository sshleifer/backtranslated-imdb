It's the same old "If I can not get the funding for my project, then I inject myself" a monster movie. Here is nothing new. It's very similar to the Jeff Goldblum "Fly" movie. The man manages to preserve a semblance of reason, but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments. Acting is pretty bad. There are people who are stupid all the way and endanger their lives for no apparent reason. The guy always goes back to the lab where he has no access. Then there is his relationship with a young woman and her son. Granted, he looks good, but seems to have a lot of trouble. It's just a pretty big waste of time. Even his Tyrannosaurus suit looks like he's off the peg at a Star Trek convention.
