Even for the cocaine of the 1980s, this is a miserable condition. I do not understand why someone wants to waste celluloid, time, effort, money and the brain cells of the audience to do this. If you want to make a comedy, make it funny. If you want to film garbage like that, keep it for yourself. If you publish it as a joke like this: NOT !!! I mean, it was a joke, right? Please, tell me, that was a joke. You're welcome.
