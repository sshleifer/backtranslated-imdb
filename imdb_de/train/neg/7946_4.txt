A word boring. <br /> <br /> the young Demi looks good, but she is pregnant (- point = D), the movie is not scary at all ... <br /> <br /> the first scenes looked a little crappy I could make better clouds with my laptop and after effects. but that was then ... and now the time has come. Some movies are not getting well ... this is one of them. <br /> <br /> is not worth renting or buying ... getting something better than the Exorcist, ... <br /> <br /> next = D <br /> oh oh the drama part at the beginning simply and simply suxor = D
