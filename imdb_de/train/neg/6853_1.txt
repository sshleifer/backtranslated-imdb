Another Dirty Grade Z-Quickie by Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson's 13-inch Clint Eastwood-style space officer chases an ugly flying head (!) To Earth and gets into a gang war in South Bronx! Mercifully short but dull, with the kindest effects since the 50Ft's attack. You should also have fired the continuity type: Notice how the Thomerson sunglasses disappear and reappear every second shot. Laughing bad, but that's why we look at these films, right? Continued 'Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys is reportedly even worse if that's possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (from ****) <br /> <br />
