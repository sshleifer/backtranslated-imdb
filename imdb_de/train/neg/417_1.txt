I go to the movies every week and check this page regularly, but I've never had to comment on a movie. <br /> <br /> Add to my list of all shocking bad movies - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - I can now add the "Hollow Man". <br /> <br /> From the awesome opening tracks - a ridiculously overlong cast and crew run, along with Alphabetti spaghetti - to the insulting finale - a world record cliche and some of the most absurd dialogues ever to the movies This movie is bleak and only the stunning computer graphics stop you from going long before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> This is not just my opinion - it was that of my friends and everyone around us. When large parts of a crowd laugh and moan during and after a serious thriller, it is clear that the movie is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Not only that, he was sick too. The director introduced the action beyond the limits of the realistic fare for a violent film into the areas of a blood-soaked, blood-soaked B-movie. It's hard not to think of the director as a kind of dirty old man, as the invisible man's path out of the lab and into the outside world was just two attempts to feel some breasts. Perhaps sex could be the first to make him invisible, but apart from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved, he hardly makes an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> [follow spoiler] <br /> <br /> Get past the movies and things are even worse. While Kevin Bacon does a good job of increasingly acting as a "Hollow Man", the rest, perhaps hampered by a bad script, do an even better job than Dutchmen. A longtime member of the team is strangled by an invisible man in a locker. "He's finally caught," a colleague shrugs without a hint of emotion. This goes without saying for the course, and the lab team swings between pure terror and utter indifference at such a speed that you wonder how they came to action. They trudge fearfully through the corridors of the lab, rifles at the ready, but soon after, one of the crew jumps happily down the hall to get blood for an injured colleague. The lead female treats the invisible man with politeness and good humor, even after he insults and abuses her, and there seems to be little response to his outbursts, even after drowning the Pentagon chief. The same woman, the spectacular two and two does not match. <br /> <br /> The script is littered with this kind of poorly functioning pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an apex of movie clich√©s that get fatter and fatter faster as the movie progresses to utter disbelief and amusement at the end. <br /> <br /> The 'eureka' moment on the computer, the undressing of the woman at the window, the looping security video - the list is truly endless - the predictable disregard for strength in numbers, the decision not to favor the two main stars but to simply take them to a place where an impending death is likely, and leave them to their own devices, and the almost dead good does not seem to save the woman, the bomb, and the ubiquitous land of the shutdown timer, the fireball Explosion that burns just before reaching the heroes, the falling lift that stops short of beating, and above all, the immortality of evil. The invisible man was burned to a rag with a makeshift flamethrower, electrocuted, with a pole that had just cut through one of the smaller actors, his head hit, and then the blast, the fireball, and the total destruction of the laboratories Having survived has left more than enough life to rise through the fireball for a final hit at the movie heroes - at which stage the unbelieving audience bends and looks at their watches. <br /> <br /> That this extraordinary bad movie actually made it! The cinema is amazing. Even the name of the movie is as hopeless as the movie itself, and not even impressive special effects come close to storing it, which should be avoided at all costs.
