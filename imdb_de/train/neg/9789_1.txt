You should have named this movie: "Adopted mouse brother, slightly inspired by someone's vague memory, reminder of Stuart Little, who has just emaciated the book, but mostly remembers the cover." it is a better review. <br /> <br /> But seriously, do your kids a favor and let them read the book. You can actually learn something, instead of stupefying what we all know as a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The book Stuart Little is not about a mouse, but about a person who happens to be very small mouse-like. He was born to his parents, not adopted. The book is about his life and his possible departure from home and the journey he undertakes. There's a cat named Snowball who thinks she wants food and wants to eat it, but the snowball can not talk. <br /> <br /> Everything is screwed together in the movie. I think the only things they kept from the book were the boat race and the names.
