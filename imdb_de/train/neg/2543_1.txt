Talk about your waste of money. I'm just wondering why Michael would play a movie in such a turkey. Michael is a great actor, especially in the movie where he plays a man who dies of cancer. when he takes himself for his son to see it as soon as he grows up. Michael is such a talented actor. So what made him do it ??? I looked at it and thought it was really stupid. I guess at some point in your career they have the shitty movies. Especially "The Squeeze" I did not understand ", his character really scared me ... and I really enjoyed" Multiplicity "... that was so weird !!! and he was just perfect for the role of" Batman ". and I liked "Night Shift" and I love "Johnny Dangerously" too ... just a pity that some of them make lousy films ... like this one ...
