I should have listened I was warned and yet I paid for it after reading all the reviews, knowing that the original was "so bad that it is good" and that part 2 did not fit into this category at all could not resist What exactly happened here? The first part was hilarious, it had so much political impropriety, and other crazy, fat entertainment, and this one could not possibly be a worse continuation on God's green earth, not Basket Case 2, not even Troll 2. This is really the worst Successor in history and that's really something considering the groundbreaking qualities of the original. Criminally Insane Part 2 was simply a completely different brand of bad. Recorded on video, zero score, zero amusement value, 1/3 consists of flashbacks of the original, and in addition, the crazy, fat Ethel has lost part of its scope. I mean, frankly, is that a kind of sick joke?!? Thank you, Nick Milliard. 1.1
