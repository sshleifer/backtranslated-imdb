I've heard so much about this movie as it was a great slasher and one of those early 80's movies that had to die for hard fans of most Slasher movies that you just had to see. Well, I've rented it and have to say that although it has turned my attention to most Slasher movies like "April Fools Day", "Friday 13th" and "Prom Night", this movie might have been right up there, with the above, it lacked only the enthusiasm and the potential of the characters as well as the ongoing story. Characters I thought unfortunate to be in this movie were the crazy guy with the frizzy hair crawling all the time around the dorm, and of course his true climatic role at the end with the killer. Another would be the dirty, unsightly guy with the denim jacket. He could have played more roles in this film that would have made the movie more interesting. Instead, the movie played this guy as another loser, making unknown calls while sleeping with his girlfriend, then dropping off and cutting him to the end, which was a waste, I was disappointed in the end. As for the true identity of the killer, when the identity was freed who he was, I just laughed, but it was all obvious and he really made a fool out of himself and after him an annoying character true intentions were revealed. This movie should be viewed at least once for all Slasher fans, but do not spend your hard-earned money in a rare, hard-to-find collector's inventory.
