OK, let's get to the point. We went out on a weekend camping vacation to five recently graduated college graduates (who must have studied the F-Word). They meet someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help him, they decide to set him on fire instead. Nice people. Next, some of them begin to get sick - there must be something in the water in the cabin they are in. The neighbors, however, seem to be alright. Well, when things get really bad, they lock up one of their companions instead of getting help (try the neighbor). Some locals do not like them. They hunt a high speed through the woods for miles until the truck collapses. Somehow ten minutes later he appears in the cabin (how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another type of brain surgeon in the cabin realizes something is wrong, so he hides in a cave to skip that beat. The next day, he decides to return to the cabin. He believes that it must be a kind of shrine. He is dizzy with relief that he has survived (he must have thought it was a 24-hour mistake). Unfortunately, he is being received by some not so friendly police officers. Another couple decides to have sex while the carnivorous beetle conjures up its magic, and the woman realizes she needs to shave her legs (she takes a lot of sick skin with shaving cream). In any case, you have the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people I do not want to be friends with. I was rooting for carnivorous bacteria. Other characters were introduced, which were also amusing, but also absolutely unlikely. Here ninety minutes of good life were wasted.
