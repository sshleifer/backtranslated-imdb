What a boring movie! To summarize, it was basically just Nana Patekar, who beat his daughter-in-law Karisma Kapoor while she was trying to flee the village with her son. Can someone say bored ??? The concept was not so bad, but it was badly implemented. The Canadian locations and some of the village scenes were nicely recorded. Overall, however, the cinematography was too short. The story could have been great, but the movie just seemed to stretch out. There is only so much stupidity that a person can accept, let alone three bloody hours. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie was the song "Ishq Kamina", and that was only five minutes long. Besides, this movie was a piece of crap.
