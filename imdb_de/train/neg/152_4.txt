You can consider a few facts in the discussion as spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg did not deserve to win an Oscar for this piece, and I think the academy was right vote. (Other Oscars for the best actor nominations and those ... of which I have no idea, but it would be hard to justify given what they've been told and what you see in the final product.) How Spielberg does it is resourceful, so resourceful. As I watched this movie, a distinction I made in a film as Art course shouted at me: "Sentiment is an honest, honest emotion, sentimentality is too sweet and unreal, a wrong view of life." That is exaggerated sentimentality. When in real life two people always start to read aloud in synchronicity, as Celie and Shug Avery do, when they sit on the bed and go through Nettie's letters they found? There are examples of this kind of faux behavior throughout the movie: all the men huddled around Miss Millie's car and then jumped off like a flock of birds when they set off; Harpo falls through the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a cheap slapstick gag); the entire troupe of party people moved en masse from the Jook Joint to the chapel, as if they were magically fascinated by the song of the choir ... over and over again. Nothing rings. I even wondered if Harpo's name was deliberately chosen because it's actually the name of his wife Sophia "Oprah", backwards. Spielberg does not have such a "cuteness." <br /> <br /> It's not that Spielberg is not able to show honestly rendered action and emotions. Schindler's list was amazing, deeply touching to me, and I admire Saving Private Ryan for his realism too, even if the story is a bit elaborate.
