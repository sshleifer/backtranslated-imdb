I started watching this movie with high expectations. After an hour, however, I gave up this film because he forced me many unanswered questions. This already started in the opening sequence and only got worse. <br /> <br /> Why should you bury the Hollander under a statue? Why is there an Italian gift? Why did the peasant woman save the Hollander? Why did not he run after his salvation for his life instead of falling in love with the peasant woman? Why did not the peasant woman save the Hollander at a time when the farmer was not there? Why did these supposedly illiterates understand the Italian language? Why did the Italian comedian know about the gold of the Hollander? Why was he hiding it in the cloaca amid the evil farmers? These and many more questions came up, and none of them seemed to be answered in an acceptable way. So I suspect that I totally miss the meaning of this film, and I associate myself in no way with the story.
