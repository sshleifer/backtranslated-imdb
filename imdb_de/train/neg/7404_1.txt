I was initially interested in this film after reading a review that said that the film reminded the reviewer of Silent Hill. <br /> <br /> As a great Silent Hill fan and disappointed with his movie debut, I thought I would give this a chance. Note, Fearnet lists this movie as "Dark Floors" only, not its full name. When I saw the name "Mr. Lordi" in the credits, I immediately thought about the band (I had some college friends who liked them), but did not think it was important and quickly put the thought aside. <Br /> <br /> The movie starts off strong. Despite the fact that DEATH was done "scary little girl", the good use of audio and the feeling of isolation really started to put the story together. The tense atmosphere quickly built up and every hint indicated that the film was excellent. Since monsters are the real stars of horror, I could not wait to see what lurked in the halls of the hospital where the main characters were. <br /> <br /> And then the first monster showed up and I found myself very suppressed. By the time the second appeared, I hesitated that it looked as if it had just come from a Megadeth concert, and the stupidity brought me completely out the window. <br /> <br /> As the film progressed, the atmosphere remained intact, and history made you wonder what was going on, but the fear was pretty much nonexistent. But I had the hope that the end was worth it. Unfortunately that was not the case. When the movie reached its climax, I was completely unbelieving, and I immediately recognized the great evil in his last revelation ... Lordi's singer? Serious? <br /> <br /> Was that the reason the movie calmed everything down? A bunch of poor souls being hunted by Lordi band members in a hospital? The stupid monster design suddenly made sense. If you want to be so stupid, you can also by the members of Marilyn Manson or even KISSEN. Not to mention that I'm pretty sure I saw the end in one of Lordi's music videos a few years ago. You had to make a whole movie out of it? <br /> <br /> The worst thing was when I found out what was really going on, all I could do was yawn. I will not "ruin" it for you, but I can say with certainty that it's probably a plotter that you've seen before. Most likely more than once. So if you are not a big Lordi fan, stay away from it. It's not scary, it does not bring anything new to the table (though it does a decent job borrowing from other horror movies, mainly Silent Hill). And I can not stress that enough, LORDI is the antagonist. LORDI Talk about a buzzkill. <br /> <br /> Actually, it would be better to try to be scared of Slipknot music videos. In other words, it just is not possible.
