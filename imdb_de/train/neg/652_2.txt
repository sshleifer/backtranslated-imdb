I think it was an overrated PG-13 crap! At least the performance of BRITTANY SNOW was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were good as well but other teenagers in prom like the main friends were not that convincing. The murderer was so stupid and looked so stupid. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginal. The movie was also very boring and very overrated. It was not exciting at all, I almost fall asleep. It's another bad PG-13 remake, it's really a horrible IMO movie. The end was so stupid and the climax was very hectic and boring. The movie is also pretty slow. All in all, the only good thing about this manure festival is BRITTANY SNOW. I think she also performed well and IDRIS ELBA, but it was also a terrible movie and a terrible remake. Well, that's just my opinion. I gave it a 2/10.
