The King Maker is a film about a series of real (citation) events that took place during the Portuguese occupation in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and artistic direction are commendable, the film does not impress the viewer. In particular, the acting was extremely bad. Some of the actors are keen to shed tears, and the real and false accents are extremely irritating. The story was too stupid and too stupid to be true, and it seemed like a history lesson. The movie could not even capture that kind of royal and centuries-old air, and it looked more like a failed attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. Last word? Costumes and art direction give the film a fresh breeze, but the execution was extremely bad and the actors could not even trigger natural emotions. In short, the movie sounded more like Hullabaloo than a script.
