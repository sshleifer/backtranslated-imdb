OK, I am blessed. I've seen two very strong stage productions in New York with the original cast, and another at the San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock!). Compared to both, the film is almost unsurpassed. I've stuffed the last two evenings through the DVD and I'm still not done. Far too much foreign dialogue and too many added scenes and people. Yes, the four big performances are pretty good, especially. Mrs. Streep. However, the comparison of the stage with the film is definitely an example of "less is more". The thickening of the play, to satisfy the need of the cinema audience for landscape variety and specificity, was a bad decision. Please, please, please find a stage production near you.
