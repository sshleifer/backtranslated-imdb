With this ABC family attempt of the hit blockbuster "cheaper by a dozen" comes an unpleasant git story, flat plotlines and cheesy comebacks. With about two good actors among many Wanna-Be's, this movie was a big disappointment. It's a Hollywood wannabe ditty of a bad act anyway. Then, because they needed many actors, that meant they were probably more lenient. Acting was not a five-star game. The plot moved pretty fast and the turns were bad and had a terrible timing. The connection of the characters and the "end relationships" were also too muddy and clich√©d for me. Save and rent something better.
