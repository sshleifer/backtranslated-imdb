There is no artistic value in this film that deserves an award. Well, no audience deserves it either. Ironically, this is one of the awards for cinematography, but frankly, the camera movements are, to say the least, worrying. With each frame, you feel that you are getting the "full picture". It's like someone cutting off your vision from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I'll be honest, I could not bear to watch the whole movie. The most absorbing part was when I saw the soldiers celebrating in their barracks and persuaded one of the soldiers to drink alcohol. These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Take my advice, stay away from this crap.
