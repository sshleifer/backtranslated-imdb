First of all, I'd like to say that if I honestly rated this movie from 1 to 10, I would rate it -4. It's not that I'm a strict critic, it's just that this movie is so bad. Everything from story to direction to editing is awful. The story is not even halfway decent (you can not expect much, since it's based on a video game, something I did not know I would go into the movie), but directing and editing made it even worse. The film cuts in uncomfortable places and goes to scenes that are completely independent of the previous ones. Some, like a fast sex scene in the middle, do not even make sense to be included in the story, as the characters have no feelings for each other. You could go into this movie and expect to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half, and you'd still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay for the movie, you are wasting your money, and if you pay nothing, you still lose one and a half hours of your life. So do yourself a favor and do not look.
