This was a nice try, but it is too presumptuous and too boring to go beyond low budget spending. The use of virtual sets is almost working, but in some places it fails miserably. You have used the small budget well, I think. I just wish the story was better. There are many areas where you can see what they are aiming for, and it would be great if they actually hit these markers, but they do not. Confusing and incredible story. Also bad DVD transmission. I do not need much to see a movie in a session. I had to switch that off. It was too boring. I can do slow films. But just make it appealing. Visually, in terms of history, acting, etc. This was missing in all departments, so it never came to a gripping experience. Maybe the next attempt of the filmmaker is better.
