This film is about a Japanese woman who has a calligraphy on her skin. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely bizarre. I do not see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The plot transforms an ancient art form into fetish pornography. In addition, the scenes shot in Hong Kong certainly show bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the film, I keep thinking that "The Pillow Book" insulted Japanese culture and the Hong Kong area. <br /> <br /> "The Pillow Book" is a perverted but boring movie. Stay away from it seriously.
