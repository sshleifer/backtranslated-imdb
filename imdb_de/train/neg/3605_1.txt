the cover of the box makes this movie look really good, do not be fooled. The splatter university came out in 1984, which was the last good year for horror, but this movie is shit. The characters are so annoying. Only the teacher is cool. There's a conspiracy like no movie, who the hell would ever produce that waste of a movie? Wife, we all know we have to have a female survivor, if you break the rules, do it in a good horror movie and not in that waste
