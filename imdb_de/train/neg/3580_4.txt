Most reviewers' memory banks must have made a short circuit when trying to remember a gemstone from this cubic zirconia, because virtually everyone has managed to misrepresent Walter Thornton of Lloyd Bochner when he was in a fit of abusive Anger in the phallic garden hurls nozzle at his new wife, Jerilee Randall-Thornton (an almost comatose Pia Zadora), with whom she was sexually assaulted earlier in the movie ... but I make my own progress. In any case, poor Lloyd would have been able to growl this line at the speechless audience as much as he was his emerging co-star. <br /> <br /> Hard, as most of us would think, these days, nobody in Hollywood sets out to make a bad movie. This is certainly not the most defensible argument, since there are seemingly so many of them coming out. On the other hand, there is this kind of film that you have to imagine during the creation time, from writing, casting and directing, to being cursed with the cinematic equivalent that was tried to shoot during the Ides of March. <Br /> <br /> THE LONELY LADY belongs to this category and presents itself very well considering the circumstances. Here we have all the ingredients in a recipe that are guaranteed to produce a monumentally fallen souffl√©: Pia Zadora, a singer / actress who is taken so seriously that she is taken seriously so that she will do practically anything that distinguishes her from her peers this movie has certainly done!); a somewhat high-profile novel written by the Trashmaster himself, Harold Robbins (by THE CARPETBAGGERS and DREAMS DIE FIRST); a cast that probably thought they were so happy to have ever worked that they tried to play this mess as if it were Clifford Odets or Ibsen; Also, a director who was most likely a rented gun that kept the chaos moving just to pick up a paycheck (and probably contractually required NOT to demand the use of the "Alan Smithee" -Monitor to protect what was from Like Lamont Johns LIPSTICK, Meir Zarchis I SPIT ON THEIR DEGREES, Roger Vadim's BARBARELLA, Paul Verhoeven's SHOWGIRLS or the grandmother of the really bad filmmaking, Frank Perry's MOMMY DEAREST, THE ONLY LADY, are still often debated (mostly with Disgust, dissatisfaction) (shocked laughter or a unique combination of all three), but also defies Hollyweird's dissection, description or even pretzel logic, nobody is sure how it was, how it was ever published in a single theater or why it's still here and it's almost impossible to get rid of it, but take it or leave it, it's here to go stay. And I do not think that lovers of really good BAD movies have it otherwise.
