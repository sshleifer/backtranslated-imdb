If you are not between 10 and 14 years old (apart from rating R), there are very few things that you like. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we should really see him more) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can look at her surroundings, but unfortunately it is. Bad Real Estate Bad Trades Worse Writing and Delivery. The special effects are bleak. While the whole situation is a funny and terrible joke, the significant individual embedded situations are all equally dreadful. When we look at the plot parts, there are some incredible action sequences in some movies that make you dizzy, and there are some that make you moan. This movie contains only the latter. There is not much left. I'm so glad I did not pay for it. Despite all the hype, I can read and think, and when I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I had no expectations, but was a bit worried. But like a train accident you can not just look away. And without expectations, I was disappointed. Bad. Not even "so bad, it's good" material. I'm very tolerant of bad movies, but that makes "Six String Samurai" (which I liked) Oscar-worthy. <br /> <br /> No, this piece about CGI waste is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. As it is currently rated at 7.2, I am completely baffled. Brainwashing or destacking the voting system is all I can think of as an answer. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but suffice to say that I saw a train accident tonight. I have to wash my eyes. 1 out of 10
