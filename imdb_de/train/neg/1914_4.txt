It is not bad, but it is not good. it's just entertaining. <br /> <br /> as a comedy it should be, it's awful. Not much laughs, as every joke in the movie has been made a million times already. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, since all the actors in the movie are usually great, but none of them really do much. and the end is shit.
