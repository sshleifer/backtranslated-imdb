I went into this movie and hoped for the best. I like wartime musicals in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball have done a good job with their roles; however, the authors gave them boring dialogue. The love interest between the two had not really grown; only suddenly it was there. I did not think much of the music; The best number was the excerpt from Spike Jones with "Der Fuhrer's Face". The one full number Spike Jones did had little of his great musical comedy; pretty tame stuff, even with the monkey. Bert Lahr's comedy skits were endless. <br /> <br /> There were parts to enjoy: Lucille Ball was a real eye-catcher, and there was a good selection of players who really deserved more time on screen.
