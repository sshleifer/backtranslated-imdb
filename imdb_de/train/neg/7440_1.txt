I'm going to be the second person on the record who, after years of using the IMDb to watch movies, was motivated by Nachos movie The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot was on the edge of nonexistence, and none of the "puzzle pieces" added up in any way. The acting was ridiculous and the writing was embarrassing. How this film went back and was created is completely unknown to me. The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hilles cunning and repeated use of the f-word. (and brilliant sound design) If I were given the option to watch this movie again or be plagued by wild holes, I would have a tough choice. I am disappointed that I can not give 0 stars.
