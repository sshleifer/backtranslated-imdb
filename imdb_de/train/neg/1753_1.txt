Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings have profoundly influenced my life as a Christian, and I eagerly awaited to watch this movie and learn more about his life. Words can barely express my disappointment. This film was disjointed ... he had no background about his life, no historical context, and nothing about his great writings (other than a brief, entertaining reference to "The Cost of Discipleship" by a colleague at the beginning of the film). Instead, we experience How he enjoys jazz (apparently in the US) and chills with his friends before deciding to return to Germany. Apparently, to show his human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part in which he stands up for his faith. Instead of emphasizing that, we get a very poorly played romance with a 17-year-old schoolgirl. Whether that actually happened or not, it should not have been a major part of the movie. Now we are still waiting for the dramatic part or a narrative that explains what his writings are about ... or something to let us know a little about the size of this man. Drum roll ..... Wait ..... .... wait ..... ZIP. Nada This kind of movie gives "Christian Films" a bad name. All they had to do was set up a structure for the film, with some background knowledge ... even a few voice overs or flashbacks preaching his works. But no ... we got that. Hardly fitting for a hero of faith.
