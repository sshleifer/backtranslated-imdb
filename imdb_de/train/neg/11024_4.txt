I first saw this film in the Soviet Union, and many erotic scenes were simply cut out by the censorship committee. Then I saw it in full in 2000 in Poland. Yes and? The conspiracy is unbelievably unwise - two men survive the genetic disaster and are on the planet full of feminist, straight and basically strict ladies. The men are now trying to fight it, and then all the stupid stereotypes follow - sex drive, persistent male craving for sex, feminists shown as complete idiots (you may agree or disagree, but idiots are certainly not), and so on , Even the star Jerzy Stuhr is an achievement that comes from wood and is strangely bad - he draws only listless faces and repeats sentences like "I'm in the elevator with a naked chick and I have not done anything with her!". It was supposed to be a comedy, but instead it turned out to be a hazy farce that was full of predictable jokes and under-the-waist allusions. Do not waste your time with it - it's just bad.
