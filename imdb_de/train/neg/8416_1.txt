It makes sense to me that this film is inspired by Hollywood, because in Hollywood this is often just a popularity contest. It also makes sense to think that people who like the movie react only to the myriad songs you spit out, rather than the content of the story. However, this film is overrated and overused. Eddie Murphy just looks ridiculous. By no means do Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar performance that so many rave BEFORE the movie is out. I can not believe that Condon is just nominated as director for the Oscar when he has put together only one album. Glitz does not replace a nothing action. A lot of songs do not make a movie.
