I admit that I do not expect much from a Roger Corman movie. In general, I expect a lot of running and bad scripts. But in this case I am pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by Beverly Garland) who takes over as the sheriff after her husband's brutal murder. Ms. Garland herself is a pretty good shot who killed one of the killers the next day at her husband's funeral. Your first task is to close the local bar that violates the city's curfew. The owner of the bar tries to buy land before being bought by the (hoped-for) railroad. However, Mrs. Garland is a thorn in the side of her plans, and the law firm hires a man to kill Mrs. Garland. Due to Ms. Garland's role playing her role honestly and realistically, there is no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers "She's the Sheriff" jokes. With the exception of some faux pas (the front door, which opens from the inside out, jeep tracks and the two riders waiting on the screen for their cue to ride around a corner), the film is quite passable as a film award. Corman, however, could not resist filling his film with rider scenes, similar to other films. <br /> <br /> Sterno says Gunslinger is a horse opera that pays off.
