I agree with most other people. A waste of photons and valuable time. <br /> <br /> It's hardly worth the joke the paper was written on. The only highlight from my POV is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("No matter, I have forest dying anyway") This reminds of old times with RTL Saturday night. It's hard to describe the performances of the actors, as most of them do not even seem to have a good time during the production and just "do their thing". The camera is alright, the plot is ridiculous, I think you would be ashamed if you talk about it with a lot of beer. Aside from that, I yawned all the time, wondering how such a script could even look like for production and waiting for the end. My 9 year old son was happy, but then he is so happy at this age :-) <br /> <br /> However, a 1 point rating is almost here 1 point too much ...
