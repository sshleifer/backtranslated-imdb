This movie is worse than most of the movies I've ever been through, and I've been through a lot. Absolute nonsense. It is a terrible, forced dialogue; meaningless plot developments; really "scary pictures" scenes that are more like a high school art project than a horror movie; 5/10 at best attractive women; long, boring sex scenes with said women (do not forget what you know about virgins, especially those with one-sided fake breasts); mumbled, hard-to-understand language of some characters; and they actually used the masks of killer klowns from Outer Space during a masturbation scene, which should be a saving grace, because the movie was pretty funny, but it is not. Veden Fell is the worst villain in the history of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one.
