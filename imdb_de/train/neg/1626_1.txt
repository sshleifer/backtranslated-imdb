This movie has recently appeared on local television here in South Africa and I thought I would even warn those who enjoy watching bad B movies (which I do) that this is not even amusing. The property is about a couple visiting a house in the countryside. Some strangers appear and .... The problem is that most of the film, which was apparently filmed in the early 1970s, consists of extremely wide shots of people walking from A to B in real time and awfully slow. This makes the movie boring in the extreme and expected blood and gore payoff never just happens. I'm really curious - how many people actually saw it from beginning to end?
