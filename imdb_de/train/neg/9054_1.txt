If you hate redneck accents, you hate this movie. And to make matters worse, you see Patrick Swayze trying to be a redneck. I really do not like redneck accents. I like Billy Bob Thornton, he was good at Slingblade, but he was annoying in this movie. And what name is Lonnie Earl? How much more Hickish can this movie get? The plot was stupid. I'm not usually so judgmental about movies, but I did not like this movie. If you want a good movie from Billy Bob Thornton, go to Slingblade. <br /> <br /> My mom found this movie for $ 5.95 at Wal Mart to my grandma for Christmas. It could be that I usually can not stand redneck accents or Patrick Swayze. Maybe if Patrick Swayze was not there. I did not even laugh in the movie. I laugh about something that's usually stupid. If someone had shown you smashed fingers, maybe I would have laughed. The fingers of the people smashed by an accident always make me laugh.
