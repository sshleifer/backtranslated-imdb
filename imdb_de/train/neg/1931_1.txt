I have seen this with great expectation. Unfortunately the dialogue is absolutely stupid and overall the film is far from arousing awe or interest. Even a child can recognize the missing logic of the character's behavior. Today's children need creative stories that inspire and "dream" of events. That's exactly what films like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many children imagined becoming Jedi Knights and lighting their own lightsabers?).
