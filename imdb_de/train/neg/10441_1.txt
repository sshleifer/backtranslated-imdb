I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snakes "took over" the plane. <br /> <br /> At first I thought it should be a "one" for the comic relief. But then I realized that I could watch the three jerkers for free and could laugh even more! <br /> <br /> What respect I had for Samuel Jackson was irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood once again shows how far away they really are from reality. When I was a kid, we caught snakes for fun. The only thing snakes would do is crouch down at the bottom of the hold. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth the trip for blockbusters. Be warned: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your stupid butt. <br /> <br /> If you really want to be scared, I propose the descent. If you fancy humor, head to your local stand-up comedy club. Your worst performance will be a million times better than this garbage.
