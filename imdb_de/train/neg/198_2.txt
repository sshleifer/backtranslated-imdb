Burt Kennedy used to be a very good director, but you would never know this clumsy mess. Not only does this film look cheap, it's cheap too - most of the fighting scenes are lifted from the far superior "The Last Command" of 1955, and the footage recorded thirty-two years earlier seems more contemporary than anything else in the picture. The few action scenes that were actually filmed for this film are unstructured, confused and incompetent and look just as inferior as the rest of the image. This has the look and feel of a bad student movie (and the budget did not seem to be much more). It moves like molasses, acting is mostly either over-the-top hams or under-the-top comedy - although Raul Julia does better than most other performers - and she's full of trouble historical inaccuracies. In addition, it is far too long. If you want to make a boring movie, do it in an hour or so and handle it - do not stretch it for more than three hours, as is the case with this work. If you want to watch a good movie about the Alamo, check out John Wayne's version of 1960, or even the 1955 movie that stole his action scenes. Hard to believe that six producers made a lousy film. Skip it.
