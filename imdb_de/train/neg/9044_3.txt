I really wanted to have this movie, but so much of it was stolen / borrowed from other works - some of the loans are painfully blatant. The New York Times review pointed out that her singing frog awfully recalls the famous Warner Brothers cartoon ("Hello my baby, hello my darling," hello my ragtime gal ...). But I challenge everyone to see the animated Robots from Fox / Blue Sky (2005) and find no ridiculous similarities in: Storyline - A young inventor who grows up, and a single innovator sells all the great inventions. <br /> <br /> Cityscape - Extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic cityscapes. <br /> <br /> ... Robots ... - The Servant robot in the Robinson household has a very similar design to the robots and both films have a kind of retro-futuristic look. <br /> <br /> All of this seems to be in sharp contrast to Disney's disgusting quote, suggesting that the company was a steady innovator who never looks back (which contradicts her entire catalog of films) The 90s, which were pretty much clones of each other, with some minor changes in plot and ethnicity.) The filmmakers do not seem to let the story alone. instead we are constantly sending objects and sounds in our direction even though we do not have the attention span for anything less. <br /> <br /> The villain is really well designed and brilliantly animated, and it's a pleasure to see. The rest of the film seems to be mixed up many times. Some landscapes look like CGI from the mid-90s. <br /> <br /> The movie actually starts with a classic Mickey Mouse shorts. At the end of this animated cartoon, we are reminded that Disney has never had much interest in novelty or good storytelling - they seem to believe that simply putting something on the big screen is just proof of their virtue.
