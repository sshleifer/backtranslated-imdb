This romantic comedy is not that bad. There are a few funny things here and there, and there are some memorable characters in it. <br /> <br /> However, acting is amateurish (with the exception of the banker). While some scenes are a lot of fun, others are just embarrassing. In particular, I found the "romantic" part of the story bad. All in all, I think it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies. It's not a really bad movie and the end felt pretty good. Just do not expect anything out of the ordinary. Fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
