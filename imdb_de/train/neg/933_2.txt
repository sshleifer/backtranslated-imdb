Undeveloped / incredible action (by the time I found out where it was going, that did not interest me anymore) bad casting. (Come on ... William Macy as a batsman?) Bad Director, (Have you ever seen Tracey Ullman playing so badly?) (If I had to take care of what to do with the unethical, incompetent, reckless John Ritter- Character happened?) Bad script ... (I'm really not looking for a formula script, but that was really terrible The only real good thing was the boy.) Ten lines? Is not it alright if your comment contains less than ten lines? Why are not I able to say what I have to say in less than 10 lines, is not that arbitrary, why is not it OK to have less than 10 comment lines?
