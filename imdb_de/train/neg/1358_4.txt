The words "Swedish" and "action movie" do not mix. This becomes more and more obvious with every attempt in the genre. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works at a military airfield with top-secret computer systems. One day, foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he does not do as they say. They want the secret equipment and do everything they can to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie has ups and downs. And in Swedish action movies there are usually no ups, just downs. I think something in this movie showed some quality. At the beginning of the positive comments I can mention that the film is technically well done. The images of flying aircraft and helicopters are well received and look very good. The spectacle is of very different quality. Shanti Roney does a decent performance, while Maria Bonnevie is as usual stiff and unnatural (I wonder how long the Swedish directors will use them, even though she has the acting skills of a wooden board?) Stefan Sauk is ridiculous as a "cool" special force Man coming to the base for investigation. <br /> <br /> And what about the action scenes? Well, as I said above, the scenes of the planes and helicopters that fly are nice. Besides, there is not much to talk about. And that's a common problem with Swedish action movies. There just is not enough action. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's the culture of filmmaking. I do not know, but it negatively affects the experience. Because honestly, the story and the acting is not good enough to rely on this movie. <br /> <br /> I rate this 4/10 for exertion.
