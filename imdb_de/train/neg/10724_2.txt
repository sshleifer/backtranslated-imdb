This is the perfect example of something great going bad ... So can anyone advise you to look at it? Well, I was somehow committed to the fact that in the Tiff competition was (I still can not believe it won) anything but interesting .. what is it? Well, the first half (one of them) represents three characters: a hooker, a musician and a kind of civil servant. The first two lie about their trades otherwise .. do not ruin a good evening) includes some old boobs and strong drinking .. but maybe you will see it very differently ... the jury of the Tiffs (did they drink vodka)
