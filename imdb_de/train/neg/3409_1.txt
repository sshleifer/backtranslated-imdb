It is rumored that NASA's Technical Advisors laughed at this movie for several hours when they were asked to keep the picture believable. After all, you will not get on the shuttle unless you are a politician or a crew member of the shuttle. Also, the Space (Cadet) camp is located in Alabama, not Florida. The truth is that everyone on earth will win billions in lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible. This movie was intended for children and had to be written by a film, as it is unaware of the myriad restrictions and requirements for access to KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> This is the most useless movie of all time, and it was a well-deserved flop.
