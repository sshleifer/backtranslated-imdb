Why should a person return to a person who gets their teeth kicked, not even twice, but over and over again? This film teaches us that we must accept love to find abuse (not forgiven but fully accepted). My goodness! No wonder my first relationship lasted only ten years. I obviously did not hug my inner masochist. <br /> <br /> As Bucatinsky's writing debut, there are many wonderful aspects to this film. However, to justify the reunification of Eli and Tom, more character development would have been helpful. We are never acquainted with Elis masochism, in fact we believe that he is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is very obvious.
