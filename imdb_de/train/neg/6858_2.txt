John Huston's Wise Blood was a dreadful distortion of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could have imagined. Of the extremely horrible theatrical performances (and not you, "Oh, that was made on purpose, you just do not understand it!") Until the music that more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this movie was outrageous. I looked at it at the beginning with no bad intentions and actually expected a pleasant experience. But the false representation of the Southern characters, from the ridiculously fraudulent Southern Pub to the weird way in which their beliefs were portrayed, was inexcusable. Until its end, which had no character at all, it failed in all places where O'Connor's book shone and swung. The actors portraying the "southern" policemen might as well have eaten stifled hot dogs from New York's street stalls and quoted godfathers. The redeeming theatrical performance was Ned Beatty's vivid and still-portrayed portrayal of Hoover Shoates, a religious artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ without Christ and seeing dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is best known for its creepy, religious undercurrent that undermines Faith's seemingly lifeless corpse. Mr. Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, as understood by me and most of her fans, if I can be so brave as to say so. I admit that I can not know exactly what the author wants to convey, but I have enough affection for her and her works to remain a fan. If I looked at Wise Blood as Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the garbage. To Flannery and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. Forgetting .... that will take some time.
