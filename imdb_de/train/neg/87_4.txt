I have read all the books of Love Come Softly. Knowing that films can not use all aspects of the book, but in general, at least they have the main point of the book. I was very disappointed in this movie. The only thing they have in this movie is that Missy's father comes to visit (although both parents come in the book). That's all. The plot was so twisted and far-fetched and yes, sad, from the book that I just could not enjoy it. Even if I did not read the book, it was too sad. I know that Pioneer's life was tough, but the whole movie was a downer. The rating refers to the same family orientation of the movie that makes it great.
