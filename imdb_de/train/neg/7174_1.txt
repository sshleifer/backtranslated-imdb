I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definitely determines: this movie is awful! From acting to the unrealistic animation to countless mistakes. I had hoped that the flaps would have been extended by a part of the imagination (flaps can not be extended without motors). The landing gear can not be lowered when you have no power. This tiny little fan was not enough at any stretch to lower the suspension. The only thing that I thought was special was when they landed, the rear wheels were put on and then the nose was broken off, causing the aircraft with the two rear tires was suspended in the air. How did the captain brake the tires that did not touch the ground with the left and right brakes? Did you forget the spoilers? Word to the Director: Find out * Everything * You can try on planes before you take a "plane" movie. I'm sorry, but I give this movie 1/10.
