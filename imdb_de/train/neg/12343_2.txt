Oh brother. The only reason this very irritating movie can not avoid the full "bombshell" of me is that, at least as a first Three Stooges movie, it's remarkable (when he was not alone yet and still with that painlessly dismal Ted Healy trailed). , But even as a long-time Stooges fan, I'd say that young Moe, Larry and Curly are badly used here as three crazy assistant janitors to Mr. Healy's larger chief janitor. They are not constantly shown through the film, and their stupid, back-and-forth stints paint them more like crazy, overactive cartoon characters who are too trying to be amusing. <br /> <br /> Most of these toothaches pertain to Jack Pearl, who tries in vain to qualify himself as a man who embodies Baron Munchausen, a chuckle from the audience (here is a good example of the level of humor: "I disagree! "" For what reasons? "" Coffee grounds! "). His buddy is nothing but a young Jimmy Durante, but even Schnoz himself is boring.
