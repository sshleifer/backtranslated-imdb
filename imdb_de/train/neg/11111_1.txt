Do not waste your money on this movie. Do not even get in your car and think that you might see this movie when others do not appeal to you. If you need to watch a movie this weekend, visit Batman again. <br /> <br /> The script was awful. Perfectly written from the random horror film format. Given: a place in a confined space, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who finds all the clues that honest police officers can not put together, and an innocent and overly curious, but beautiful and strong woman, with whom many are nearby The audience would like to call his girlfriend. Mix them together, add a lot of badly executed gore, and what the hell, let's get some freaks into the storyline for a little spin. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible and the characters incredible - Borat was more credible than this. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can hit a bullet out of the person after she was shot without the person who was shot flinching ?? ? I am in the army. We need the stuff for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, and I would put it in the decimals of the rounded numbers to keep it as low as possible.
