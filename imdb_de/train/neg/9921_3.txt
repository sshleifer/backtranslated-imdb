Strummer's hippie past was a revelation, but overall it felt like leaving a trail behind. Campfire stories work best for the intimacy of a campfire. There were just too many boring old anecdotes and too much stuffing. I love The Clash and Joe because I have not reunited and sold their songs yet (FU Mick Jones), but this doc got me tempted to tell more. The use of campfire storytellers without a proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent. They should have been interviewed alone. Even with Strummer's "Radio-DJ-Voice" the film could not be put together. And can someone explain which flags fly behind the campfire scenes? After the fantastic "Filth And The Fury" I hoped that Temple could deliver. A Joe Strummer document deserves more.
