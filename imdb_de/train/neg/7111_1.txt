- A newly married couple moves into the house of the deceased former wife of the man. It does not take long for the new woman to feel like someone does not want her in the house. She sees skulls everywhere in the house. But if the husband investigates, he can not find anything. Is someone trying to bring her back to the asylum she was recently released from? Or is the dead woman's spirit trying to get the new woman out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I have seen The Screaming Skull without the support of the MST3K crew. And I'll probably see it that way the last time. Can you say stupid? I do not speak boring normally - I'm talking about how grass gets dull. There are big parts of the movie where nothing happens. The screen could be empty and I could have had just as much entertainment from it. The characters roar with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. The screaming skull could probably be marketed as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> - The actors do not help much. Most of them provide lines with the conviction normally intended for a primary school game. I have not looked, but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this film has ever experienced anything of cinematic value. I will not even go into the script the actors are supposed to work with. Let's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever spoken in the movie. <br /> <br /> - You have been warned! Either avoid this at all costs or at least look for the MST3K version.
