What exactly happened during the 11th World War in New Zealand, when American troops were there? <br /> <br /> This horrible story of 4 sisters was really pathetic. Can you imagine occupying Joan Fontaine as an older sister of Sandra Dee? Fontaine looked more like her mother. Even funnier was that Fontaine gets pregnant in the movie. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, who had such great chemistry four years later in The Hustler, have no scenes in common in this film. Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington to walk around there, even though she is married. Woe to her when her husband returns from the war. Jean Simmons is widowed and finds a romance with the very muted Paul Newman. There is even a romance for the young Miss Dee here. <br /> <br /> The picture has little to no meaning. Are you trying to say that everything is fair in love and war? If so, they have done a poor job selling the product. <br /> <br /> The conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is quickly resolved. That should have been done quickly with this disappointing 1957 film.
