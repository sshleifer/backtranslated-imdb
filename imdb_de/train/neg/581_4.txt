Before I move on, I have to admit that I'm a big Bon Jovi fan. In fact, I was interested in the DVD case at all. I probably would've bought it anyway, because I was such a big horror fan and enjoyed the first vampire title so much. <br /> <br /> But that's not half as good. Not even Jon could save this movie for me. My main problem would be that it's just not scary. Apart from Jon's character Derek Bliss, none of the other characters make an impression and you do not care if they die or not, especially the annoying vampire / drug addict woman. The female vampire is just not scary or sexy. She looks more like an anorexic 14-year-old girl, no wonder she's so desperate for blood. Another big problem is that everything is simply "too bright". There is no atmosphere or fear. I know that the first vampires set up in New Mexico were not exactly the twilight zone in terms of horror, but they still managed to be dark if need be. This movie has no such tension. <br /> <br /> The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants Berzier's Cross to walk in daylight. However, the story has less cool pieces this time around. It is not a wow factor to know that this is the master of all masters - the original vampire, as in the first movie. You really do not care who or what this is. There is no army of masters. Instead, she hides in an old ruin that looks more like an attraction in Disneyland than in a spooky temple. <br /> <br /> So you really have it. Lack of fear, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting stories. A real disappointment for me personally.
