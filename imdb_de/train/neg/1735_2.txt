I feel that the producers of this mess were out to make the most painful, ridiculous Western ever made. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can think of to describe it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side you have beautiful color photography and beautiful and well spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the cripple), who behaved so well in an annoying role that he was so abominably written that no actor could perform well. The production values ​​were pretty good, which only served to highlight the terrible story and the script. <br /> <br /> Things I hated: Stewart Granger looked as little as a Western figure, with his British accent, neatly cut outfit, and stupid, flawless, always white, necktie tied around his neck. It got boring as the citizens and his son Granger constantly harassed and insulted, and he never spoke or answered. I know that we need to expose unbelief and honor the Western as a symbolic morality, but he broke the spell with ridiculously unrealistic and predictable scenes, with the worst ending, where Granger miraculously, quickly and single-handedly dynamite around a canyon When the bad guy's cattle come by, Granger plants himself in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamite from a great distance to make slides to bury and scare the cattle and the bad guys who seem to destroy everyone, except the two bad guys Worst of all is the plot that is loaded with scenes from soap operas. Nothing in the movie seemed believable: I could not believe what this conflict was about. The villain went to market with his herd and wanted the cows to chew some grass on the way; I can not understand why something could not be clarified. Do you need a land dispute? Do not bother to see it.
