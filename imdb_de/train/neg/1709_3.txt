I got a copy of this movie and thought it was the 1964 movie with "Zombie Bloodbath" as one of its alternate titles. Perversely, this movie actually has a better rating on this page than the previous title. which may mean that the other one is really bad! This movie is also pretty bad; Of course you can not get into a movie that calls itself "Zombie Bloodbath" and expects a masterpiece. In fairness, it does justice to the title with the amount of gore being shown. which is not helped by the cruel acting and the stupid plot. It's just your average nuclear spread that causes people to turn into zombies, and so on. The movie starts with a sequence in which people melt and you know pretty well what you're up to; Zombie garbage of low quality. The movie has a lot of gore and it's a really good job, otherwise the movie would have been really boring. Zombie Bloodbath also looks really cheap and has been compiled by inexperienced filmmakers! The main influence seemed to be Romero's superior day of the dead, though it could actually be anything that brought zombies and blood. It all boils down to a typically predictable and meaningless end and overall I can not say that I was impressed!
