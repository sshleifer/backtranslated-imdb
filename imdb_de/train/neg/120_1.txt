When I saw this movie for the first time, I quickly noticed the actress who played the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely terrible. Lucille Ball was an amazing comedian with incredible talent. To think that a legend like Lucille Ball was portrayed in the movie is terrible. I can not believe from all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy. The producers chose Rachel York. She could be a good actress in other roles, but playing the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It's pretty hard to find someone who looks like Lucille Ball, but at least they could find someone who's a bit similar in looks and talent. If you have noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the Chocolate Factory or the Vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way - her expression, her voice or movement. <br /> <br /> To top it off, Danny Pino, who plays Desi Arnaz, is terrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He is short and thin, his accent is unreal and his acting is again incredible. Although Fred and Ethel were not alike, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. <br /> <br /> Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is poorly told. If people want to understand the real situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching Lucy and Desi's biography of A & E, reading the book by Lucille Ball herself, or PBS 'American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, "Before the laughter" would be the better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Laughter" is much better in comparison. At least a similar aspect is shown and nothing.
