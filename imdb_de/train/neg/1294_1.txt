The central theme in this film seems to be confusion as relationships, setting, action and social context lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel does not seem to be in his element, and lacks the usual impeccable clarity, direction and intensity. What makes matters even worse is the name of his character 'Che', and we only hear (directly from the narrator) that he is not 'the' Che, but only a guy named Che. The family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film. Once defined, the family is divided - the younger generation goes to America. So clich√© Other reviews explain how the movie portrays the impact of the revolution on a boy's family. However, the director's political stance is at best dim and we are never quite sure who is responsible for the bloodshed. So they lost their property (acquired through gambling winnings) - so what? Turning a film about the Cuban Revolution, if he refuses to take a political stand, is a strange and cowardly choice. Not to mention that the movie was in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they did not get permission to shoot in Cuba. And if family life is the most important thing here, it would be great if we could find out who's who - we'll all be introduced to everyone at first - a cheap way to make the relationships across the movie clear! The drama was mostly flat, made of wood and unbelievable, the timing was over everywhere. The "special" visual effects were confusing and distracting. References to American films - and the black character of the Greek chorus - are absolutely gratuitous, intellectually obtrusive, and altogether out of place. I just watched the whole movie because I was waiting for clarity or something. It never happened.
