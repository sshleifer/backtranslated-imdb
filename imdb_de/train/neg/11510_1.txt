It's not my fault. My girlfriend let me see it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive to say about this film. There's been an idea for many years that Madonna could act, but she can not. There's been an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a great director, but he's only mediocre. Completely embarrassing. <br /> <br />
