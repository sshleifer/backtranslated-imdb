One might wish that such a good idea as the "invisible man" works better in the age of fantastic special effects and is handled more carefully. This is not the case. The story, the characters, and finally the entire last 20 minutes of the movie are as fresh as a crazy science film from the early 50s. There are some great moments, mainly because of the amazing special effects and the mere idea of ​​an invisible man following the streets. But soon we are back in the tight confines of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the movie is not just predictable, but schematic. <br /> <br /> There have been many remakes of films or TV programs of the last 10 years, some of which have their appeal. However, it becomes clearer and clearer for every film that the idea of ​​nuzzling crazy oldies like Verhoeven (who has his moments) is a bad one. It is obvious that the money here is the key question: the time and energy put into the script are far from sufficient. As a result, "Hollow Man" is seriously affected by clichés, juicy characters, predictability and lack of depth. <br /> <br /> However, in addition to the special effects, I was especially impressed by the cursing. In this kind of movie, modern producers are very interested in children seeing them. Therefore, the language (and sometimes violence and gender) is very much attenuated. When the whole world blows up, the good guys go "Oh damn!" and "oh my god". "Hollow Man" gratefully rejects this kind of hypocrisy and the characters have the freedom to say what seems most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural answer to something that went wrong is cursing - but it makes it more believable if somebody actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
