I did not want to see this movie at first because the trailer looked like an ordinary and anticipated movie ... but when I recently had the pleasure of discovering the surprising "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité" that was beautifully staged and written by Laurent Tirard (scriptwriter of "prête-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to give it a try. I thought, "prête-moi ta main" would be as good as "mensonges ..." And it's absolutely not the script is not bad, but it's not as well directed as "Mensonges ...", the actors are not so generous (especially Charlotte, as boring as she usually is) as Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac And frankly, I still do not understand how such a crap can be so successful with such a casting ... Anyway, the story It may have been an excuse to make so many interesting acts, but it's not as good as Tirard's "Mensonges ...", though it's also written by him. Simple, not surprising and lazy work. Totally overrated!
