Sondra Locke stinks in this movie, but then she was a terrible "actress" anyway. Unfortunately, she pulls all the others (including her then true friend Clint Eastwood) into the drain. But what did Clint Eastwood think when he agreed to join in this film? It's an extraordinarily weak story, basically no story or plot. Add bored, bad acting, even from the usually good Eastwood. There's absolutely nothing except a few arguments and as far as I'm concerned This movie is at the top of the pile of natural sleep aids. Wow! Could a movie be even more boring? I think drying paint or growing the grass is more fun. A real stinker.
