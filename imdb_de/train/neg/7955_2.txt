Carrie Fisher has said more than once that she made this movie during a lifetime when she had a severe cocaine problem and she does not remember much. That would explain why she made this movie, but it does not explain why someone else in the cast or crew did that. I can not believe EVERYONE had a coke problem. This must be one of the absolutely worst movies ever made, and that says something. "Director" Tim Kincaid or "writer" Buddy Giovinazzo can not be blamed because it is obvious that no one wrote or directed this image. Apparently, it came together only spontaneously, as there is little evidence of coherence, consistency, design, conspiracy, meaning, intelligence, or anything else. What's really amazing is that there were some real professionals involved in this project. Co-star Robert Joy has done a great job in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both industry veterans. Marks was also a director and not a bad one. It is incomprehensible why they were involved in this steaming heap of offal. Tim Kincaid, the supposed "director," has made a lot of cheap science fiction and horror movies, and after seeing most of them, I can tell you that none of them are good. However, this is by far the worst thing he has ever done, and that's a big achievement for him. Everything, absolutely ALL, about this movie has the 12th rank - at best. The cinematography is terrible, the play is ridiculous, the "special effects" make "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like "Spider-Man", the story is banal, distracted and stupid. Do not waste your time looking at the video box, let alone renting it. A total, annoying, total dud.
