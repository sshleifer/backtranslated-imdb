I will be brief. Thanks to Greg, who helped me to put it succinctly: Captivity is about a guy who uses a girl's drink to drug him, imprisons and tortures him and then pretends to be a prisoner to have sex with her to have. That's the only twist and punch in the movie. It's torture as a rape in slow motion. And it's not even a good movie. It is not so bad that it is good. It's just bad. <br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that critics have a "spoiler code" that they dare not break, even though some were tempted to resort to this code because it is so mean , Why NONE had the kojones to get up and say, "This is rubbish, and that's why," is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Do not give your money to these poop merchants.
