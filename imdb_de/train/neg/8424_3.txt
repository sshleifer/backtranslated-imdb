This film can be judged from three angles: as a story, as a profile of Amin, as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> It fails as a story, mentions in the passport the coup that threw Obote, the expulsion of Asians, and the Entebbe hi-jack as a backdrop, but not in a timely consistent timeframe. <br /> <br /> As Amin's profile, it could be interesting because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good and if this was a better movie, he would get an Oscar. (He got it - proving that Oscar voters do not see the films they vote for.) She ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel that watched Amin and the history of Uganda from the doctor's point of view. Instead, it tells the fictive story of the Scottish doctor and his impossible love life from the perspective of Amin. But the narrated story is the one incident in which Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictional thriller, there is no action to keep it together. The beginning is taut - it takes cinematic freedom with the novel, but sets the story. The character of the doctor is clearly defined, but loses in the second half of the movie that suffers. Why the doctor decides to stay in Kampala is poorly explained - seduced by power? Why he does not make friends with anyone is strange. The character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the Scot has the matter instead of the black doctor - a ridiculous entanglement, which does not even seem easily believable, but the authors of the film can bring the cruelty of Amin close. The man named Horse-Bit in the end is ascendable. <br /> <br /> Finally, in 1971, Uganda left on the left, not right, the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the equator tusks ?! <br /> <br /> Conclusion: If you have never heard of Amin, you might want to spend two hours watching this movie to appreciate Forest Whitaker's acting, but the last hour will make you confused. If you know Uganda or have read the book - do not watch the movie - it will only depress you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so foolhardy, he was not.
