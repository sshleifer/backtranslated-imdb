"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another "feeling of well-being", so-called "heart warming," and the outstanding reviews show that ABC had time to assemble. <br /> <br /> I understand the problems that these families are going through. I'm sorry for that. But would not you think that four widescreen plasma televisions, three flat screen computers, an indoor pool that occupies half a backyard, and cabinets full of expensive designer clothes are too big a BIT for any family? Sure, these families have been through a lot. Sure, they deserve more beautiful things they had before. <br /> <br /> But honestly, the things Ty Pennington and his crew put into these houses are enough for a whole neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really irritates me about this show is that Ty and his crew always say something good about every little thing that relates to the family or the condition of the family. To tell a wheelchair user that he or she is "so strong" or "very brave" becomes really old after a while. That may sound rude, but believe me. Watch this show and you will see what I mean. <br /> <br /> All in all, this show is overrated. If you want to see it, continue. This comment is just a heads up for what you would see.
