The biggest thing that drives me to hell is that Zues takes LOW commands. But she speaks German with him. The two languages ​​are completely different, it's like saying "Well, he's taking French orders" and starting to speak Spanish. James Belushi makes you feel more like a comedy actor, not a detective in the least. The role just does not suit him, even if it's a comedy. <br /> <br /> For many stereotypes / predictable. Typical comments or comebacks. <br /> <br /> If you do not look at these things, this could be a nice movie if you ever see it on TV. But I would not recommend renting it.
