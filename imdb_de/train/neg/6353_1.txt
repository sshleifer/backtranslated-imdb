For a comedic writer, Woody Allen really lets the paying viewer down with this meager attempt at character development. There are a few fun moments, but no more than one would have listened to their drying tennis balls. Will Ferrell wastes his time in this movie, which does not show his usually funny delivery. Amanda Peet did well, but did not have the space to move in this otherwise smooth movie. The film is so heavy and boring that it can not be worn, but if it was worn, Radha Mitchell did it. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy movies that keep going through a scene, and you do not really accomplish anything except to show that your author can occasionally write a few transient dialogues, you'll love the movie.
