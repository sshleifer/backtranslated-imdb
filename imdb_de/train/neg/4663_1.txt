This movie was just bad. I love war movies and can usually get away from most movies and find something that I liked, but this was not one of them. This film lacked content and intensity. Okay, I understand, the Finns did a damn big fight and that's great, but the story is badly told. You have no real connection to the characters and there is no real action to follow. They just go from one random scene to another, nothing flows into the story that is being attempted to be conveyed. If you want a war movie that fascinates you and amazing enough without battle scenes, then I would suggest "Downfall" (WWII German Film). Or if you prefer a great story and a lot of action, I would suggest "Brotherhood of War" (Korean War / Korean Film). These two films will not disappoint you as they did in the winter war.
