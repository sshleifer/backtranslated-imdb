Visually disjointed and self-contained, the director has apparently decided to seek faux-depth to extend a 5-minute plot to an 81-minute snore party. <br /> <br /> The moments that work in this movie are VERY limited and the characters do not even feel real. How could you feel like a protagonist who became so surreal? <br /> <br /> Essentially AND stylistically, everything feels like a quirky dream sequence. Shattering irregular camera work, unpleasant silence and gaps in the action, and what about the little spider image crawling across the screen? Anyone who has thought of this must return to film school. It did not add meaning, just cheese, and did not even work stylistically with the rest of the movie (assuming the movie even had a style, which is a close call). What a flop.
