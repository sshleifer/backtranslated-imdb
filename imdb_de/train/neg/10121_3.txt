The bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money when traveling. Her life becomes more exciting as she establishes relationships with the exotic Betty Amann (for Mr Kendall) and the lonely Percy Marmont (for Mrs Barry). But they stay as boring as before. The bored-looking director Alfred Hitchcock attempts to arouse the well-titled (as quoted in Shakespeare's The Tempest), "Rich and Strange," by ordering some camera trickery. An opening homage to King Vidor's The Crowd is the highlight. The low point may be the couple eating on a Chinese prepared cat. *** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
