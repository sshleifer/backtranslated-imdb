This movie was awful. I gave him the high score of 2 because I've seen worse, but very few. <br /> <br /> From the clich√© beginning of the film in the beginning to the start in the end. This film used everything from the film making bag, just like a child with too many toys. There was the endless, boring, repetitive narrative, slow motion, still image, flashbacks and stitched-up images, etc. - none of which made a boring movie. <br /> <br /> It's called "16 years of alcohol," but there was little alcohol or drunkenness, and no picture of retreat, where the film jumped everywhere without a coherent sense. The story was poorly written and extremely presumptuous and the direction was just as bad and it is a shame that people gave up more money for more films by Mr Jobson, who was previously known for a garbage group and on TV, which makes so much sense Movie does. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a big struggle to see it through to the end, but in the hope of getting better, I was drawn to the bitter, but it was a waste of time and I would have done it better not disturb.
