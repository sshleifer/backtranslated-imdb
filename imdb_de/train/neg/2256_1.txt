I have to admit that maybe I saw five minutes of "Jerry Springer". I do not consider myself a snob, but I truly believe that I see more than what's in his show. You should try to rise above it. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as part of a social science event that I conducted. I was told that this movie had very little to do with Springer itself. Rather, he focused on the lives of those who would appear on Springer. In fact, if you handle it better, this movie could be a fascinating look at how pathetic these people's lives actually are. I have to admit, I felt a little empathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). That's all she has in life. How sad that she feels she has to go to Jerry's show to fix it. <br /> <br /> I am really sorry that Molly Hagan appears here. Did you notice that after this movie she was mainly banished to "B" roles on TV? I'll say that about Hagan. She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that she is very serious in her acting and tries to play her roles with great empathy. The problem is that Hagan can not carry a scene alone. She just does not have what it takes to play a lead role. Her best work will always be Angel on "Herman's Head" (a show that was not great, but her heart was in the right place) and when she came to "Seinfeld" as Sister Roberta.
