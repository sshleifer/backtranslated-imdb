This version is pretty bleak, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and since childhood. The tired, throwaway acting style of William Hurt is totally unsuited to the courageous passion of Edward Rochester. Poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored, petite teen whose braces hurt! Also, I can not believe that they have eliminated Edward's great marriage proposal scene at the end of the book, one of the most moving moments in the literature. I appreciate that they finally used such a young, simple woman to play Jane, a character who was supposed to be a worldly 18, but if you want to see a version that is closer to the personalities and passions of the novel , please read the 70s version with George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was too old, tall and pretty to play Jane, but no one touched Rochester's character the way Scott did.
