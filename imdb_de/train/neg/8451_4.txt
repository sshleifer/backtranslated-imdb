I have to admit that I liked the first half of Sleepers. It looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. A superior Hollywood movie. But ... Nobody mentioned this (at least in the last 20 comments) when it came to the scenes in the courtroom and Brat Pitt's character followed his plan to save his two friends, who are rightfully accused of murder cheated on me. This movie insulted my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warn spoiler !! <br /> <br /> Why did someone accept his false alibi, which the priest witnessed? If these two men had been with him, why not tell them during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were a judge or member of the jury, would you believe it? Is it wise to divulge the motive of the murderers? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but in the end the story is very weak and that annoys me. This movie had great potential. 4.10
