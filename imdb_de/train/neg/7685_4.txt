Confusing melodrama from a William Gibson story, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark faces the posh, upscale rural nervous asylum in which his easy-going wife fights with the self-styled Queen Bee Lillian Gish and Widmark himself has the straying eye for coworker newcomer Lauren Bacall, who reunites her husband and her life after death Child. Multifaceted and confused, in a random time and place, and with a love story "David and Lisa" hidden in the plushy swamp. Although Widmark and Bacall have good chemistry, this script does not give them anything to build on. For exactly one hour, most of the dialogues are about what to do with the curtains in the library (this thread is not used as a symbol, but is a red herring in a non-mystery!). The picture hopes to show the fools that different people come to when working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right, but unfortunately the detour Minnelli discovers this stew is neither informative nor enlightening or entertaining. ** from ****
