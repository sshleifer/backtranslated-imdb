You can say to yourself, "Don Johnson as Elvis, can that work, is it possible?" It seems like a terrible decision, but I should be open-minded, maybe I'm surprised, maybe he can do it. " , "<br /> <br /> NOT! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor, but he's a terrible Elvis, too short, too weak, too sharp ... Well, you have already imagined how bad he would be, plus a black wig and a hardened eyeliner and mascara, and it's a big, embarrassing mess. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say is, that Johnson's acting is decent and that his personification is so far away, after a while you do not even think of him as Elvis anymore, you see him as another crazy pop star instead, then the movie will be seen at this level. > <br /> Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideal as the tall beauty queen Linda Thompson is cast in. But she is attractive to herself and plays a role with the honesty, elegance and intelligence we expect from all her roles in their performance, they m KISSING be some kind of dope to stay at a dope, abused the dope. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in this story. We have heard it many times. If you are looking for new information or insights, you will not find them. It is told as a love story - one unanswered: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
