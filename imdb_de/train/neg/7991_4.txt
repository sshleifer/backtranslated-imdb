Paint for numbers, history and mediocre action that are saved by authentic colors - and a few moments that are truly wonderful and heartfelt. It effectively captures the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood, and is very sensitive and inventive with the cultural conflict that the main family experiences. Unfortunately, this germ of a good movie is aimless and extremely imprisoned. Enchanting conspiracy that allows it, religious conflicts, a conflict over a road project, the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a group of racist hooligans to integrate at least three different carnivals, the complexity of local church politics and so on and so forth. And all of this does not even include the actual central plot, which is all about the hopes, dreams, and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point in their lives. I was really shocked to realize it was going to happen over a summer (and that so much film was done in 1.5 hours!). <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film is melodramatic, every action point is predictable, important events that change life happen and then forget about 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are extremely unpleasant. Most shocking is the fact that one of the characters is involved in a terrible crime (in a completely predictable "turn") and then completely forgiven and the entire incident is forgotten from then on. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced only to die a few minutes later and provide another "turn". It's all completely mechanical, right up to the end, tying all loose ends (not all, just the ones you're interested in the movie for).
