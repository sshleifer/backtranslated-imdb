Bob Clampett's "Porky's Poor Fish" is a comic with terrible puns and a nice moment or two. In Porky's Fish Shoppe, 'Porky's Poor Fish' is located in an uncomfortable area between a black Porky cartoon and one of the then popular Merrie tunes. Porky, typical of many of the early Porky cartoons, is far from the star and only appears in a rather stilted opening music number and the climax of the film. For the rest of the time, the cat is a scratchy cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal, but gets more than he expected. Unfortunately, the audience gets a lot less than he expected. Like sometimes in the series of books brought to life, the limelight is focused on punning signs that might work just as well in a non-animated medium. Laughter is in short supply and while the comic is currently being rescued by Clampett's energetic direction, there is little to recommend "Porky's Poor Fish" over the other subordinate Porky cartoons.
