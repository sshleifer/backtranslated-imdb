Since most of this movie's reviews were from the screenings that took place ten years ago, I'd like to add one more recent, the movie Open with stock footage of B-17's bombing of Germany. The film was cut to Oskar Werner's captain (Captain) Wust character and his film When Adjutant takes cover on the way to Hitler's leader Bunker, they are discussed by bunker personnel. Subsequently, the film is cut to one of many conference scenes with Albin Skoda, which gives a decent impression of Adolf Hitler's performance "Ultimate" Victory, while Werner's character is slowly shown to recognize that the inhabitants of the bunker are involved in a fantasy world - Some non-bunker events are shown, the most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a Russian and a small advance through it subplot with a young member of the Flak unit and his family's survival weakness - this movie suffers from a series of inaccuracies that a German film should make only 10 years after the Second World War did not contain; the actor who shows Goebbels (Willy Krause) wears the same uniform as Hitler, including the Armadler.Gebebbels wore a brown Nazi party uniform with swastika armband - the "SS" soldiers wore the German camouflage dress The well-documented scene in which Hitler awarded the Iron Cross to boys of the Hitler Youth is shown to have taken place inside the bunker (it was done out in the courtyard), and finally Hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a Belgian tanning model. Emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/art...7805 & lang = DE 1922 - Most agree that this was a Walther PPK. English: emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/art...2934 & lang = DE. German: emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/art...2934 & lang = DE The drama also seems to be totally inaccurate because of the drunken dance scene at the end of the film is remarkable. This piece is shown as a cabaret sketch, with an intoxicated wounded soldier (his arm in a splint) making music during a time of goose bumps Nurse makes a combination of striptease / belly dancing, all by candlelight ... that is actually embarrassing too see. The most unbelievable is when Werner's Captain Wust makes an audience with Skoda Hitler alone, Hitler is shown draped and slumped mad on a wall-bench, as Werner's character begins to interrogate him, Hitler begins to scream, bringing an SS guard who brings Werner's character has been fatally injured with a shot in the back - this fabricated scene is not based on a genuine historical account. Werner's character is killed in an anteroom while Hitler prepares his own end, Hitler's farewell to his wand is shown, but suicide is in off-screen, the last second of the film shows how Hitler's pyre smoke is slowly becoming a ghost Oskar Werner / Captain Wust - this movie is more allegorical than historical, and anyone interested in this period should watch the newer movies such as the 1973 remake "Hitler: The Last 10 Days" or the German film "Der Unterga If you would like a more detailed account of this dramatic story, these last two films are based on eyewitness accounts from "First Person Eyewitness" with "Hitler: The Last 10 Days" from Gerhard Boldt's autobiography as a staff officer in Bunker and "Downfall" from the Memories of Hitler's secretary put together. The script for "The Last File" comes from the book of the American Nuremberg War Criminal "Ten Days To Die", which is more a compilation of events (many obviously fanciful) than eyewitness history - it is surprising that Hugh Trevor Roper's report "The Hitler's last days "was never made into a movie.
