I almost drowned in CHEESE when I saw this movie. In fact, I could not finish it. I want my money back. Another weak attempt in Hollywood to develop a new idea. Good thing I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. You should give Nic Cage a hat and a bullwhip. Swashbucklin '. Cage's performance in "Raising Arizona" or "Leaving Las Vegas" beats this "lemon". People who are fully and fully marketed (and most of them are) should love this movie. If this movie had been animated, I would have taken it seriously. I would rather pay to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it. In my opinion, this was an incredibly stupid movie and it made an even sadder attempt to conceal this fact.
