"A scientist is discovering signals from outer space that appear to contain information about a series of seemingly disjointed natural disasters occurring around the world, hoping to discover the source of these signals and who is behind them, the scientist and his team of scientists are exploring Woman on the Way Find the intended receiver of the signals, and what the couple finally finds out is a small remote monastery with residents who are not really who they seem to be, "the DVD cover's summary. Kirk Scott (as Andrew Boran) is the scientist who intercepts foreign news on his computer. He suspects that a series of "major earth disturbances" could be associated with the strange space static. Mr. Scott and pretty blonde Mrs. Sue Lyon (as Sylvia Boran) investigate the mysterious signals from space. They discover the priestly but sinister Christopher Lee (as "Father Pergado") and other stupidities. In view of this, "End of the World" is remarkably boring. <br /> <br /> *** End of the World (1977) John Hayes ~ Kirk Scott, Sue Lyon, Christopher Lee
