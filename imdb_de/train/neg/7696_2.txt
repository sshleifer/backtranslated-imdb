Yes, stupidity! I'm watching and still have a bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too many unnecessary "addons" to a story, too many stupid characters (I suppose they wanted to get a comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much of everything. Too bad to spoil one of the divine stories from "Arabian Nights" like this one. Childish, naive (both on a bad way) and many magical mistakes. I do not think this could last a child of five years more than ten minutes. Princess is adorable, but should be tongueless because the actress does not know how to play a role. The rest of the cast is even worse ... our "bad guy" is really bad. Too bad that the "good" is not better. Of course, only light in this darkness is David Carradine, who unfortunately falls far below his level, but at least keeps his abilities as an actor / "fighter" at the top. I'm still sorry to see him in something like this, but I'm glad I saw something throughout the charade, so thanks, David. Only for him I give this fiasco these 2 stars ... I would give more for him, but that would increase the final score of the entire film. The rest is so bad that I might like to grade it, but then there is no note-lover here, and I think that would be too much.
