This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I wanted to go to Tape 4, but I put it through. I consider myself a masochist now! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit billboards? I found the lead actor (George Calil) particularly incapable. Apart from the bad acting and the eager camera shake, I thought to use the events of September 11 as a reason to shamefully and "Larson the Lunatic Implodes, anywhere on a screen in your area" for the victims of September 11th to disrespect. With a phone call from Larson's wife, Sarah, allegedly from one of the day's terrorist planes, was appalling. The camera shake did not make me sick, this cold-hearted stunt did it.
