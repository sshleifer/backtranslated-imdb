This film introduces a series of characters and their relationships in the first half hour. None of them arouse interest or positive response. I waited for the intrigue to begin, hoping that things would get better, and stuck to the bitter end, but there was no reward for that. It's not worth it for me. Not that the story was so bad. I think you could say I have problems with the script - d. H. I thought it stinks. A look at the credits shows you that there is a pretty strong cast here that has been unsuccessful so far. Most of the old professionals in this film do a good job; I had not seen much of the actors before I particularly liked Deborah Kara Unger. That's about all I can say about this picture.
