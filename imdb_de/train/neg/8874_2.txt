but there are not too many of them. Probably the worst "major release" movie I've seen in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. It makes no sense to comment on the plot, the cast or the acting. The problem is beyond that. It's the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind (not the funny way) of everything that happens on the screen. I do not know why I gave it 1/10 instead of 1/10. Probably because of Steven Martini. He really tried. Conclusion: 95 minutes with a few brain cells flushed down the toilet. Avoid at all costs.
