First of all, I have no idea how this movie got on the big screen. It's not even the low budget SCI-Fi channel movie, it's just awful. Me and my friend, who loves action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc., have been expecting this movie with a Transformers with Dragons and careless entertainment. All we got was an hour's lesson. The CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot is so terrible with acting, it made up for it. It's basically a Chinese leg of dragons that return every 500 years ... Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No, the plot tries to be deeper than it should be, and not only leaves holes, but with magic and a very small real war between dragons (rather big snakes) it just gets ridiculous. The director has tried to add some humor to the film, which fails. Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing (along with all five viewers) and could not believe we spent money on it. The short trailer on TV makes up for most of the action, while Mist makes up the rest. I've seen a lot of B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say that if you want to laugh for an hour without interruption, look at this. <br /> <br /> Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I do not drink ... but it would have helped before I saw this movie
