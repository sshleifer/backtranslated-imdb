I did not expect much from this movie - a funny little distraction. Wuthering Heights could become a plausible modern story - nice and soapy, melodramatic and fascinating. However, this film decided to throw away the talents of people involved in a simpering version, so it was amazing that they had the courage to even call it Wuthering Heights. It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are essentially unlikely, mostly not compassionate and often cruel to each other. It changes the nature of certain characters - Isabelle, for example, in the novel - had no connective bone in her body - they have subtracted their blind idealism and made them a scheming whore. Heathcliff is a terrible person who psychically tortures most people on his way, but in this version, Catherine leaves her daughter in his care. The dialogue is banal and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver anything with straight faces. Instead of depth or actual feelings, we know that they mean something when they scream someone in the face. I have read critique of the version of the early '90s, "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights," in which Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche participated. They said that an intense dark gothic story became a sudden limber. Slightly valid comments, but the MTV version goes one step further and uses the basic story structure to deliver nippy beach lovers who are into really bad music.
