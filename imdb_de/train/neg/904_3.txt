"Stella" with Bette Midler in the title role is an intrepid tear-hunter. Stella Claire, who lives in the hinterland of New York, works at night as a bar girl, pours and dances in a saloon of a worker. One night, Stephen Dallas, a retarded medical internist, woos Stella and impregnates her in the course of her affair. She disdains both his marriage and abortion offers, sends him to a lucrative medical career and pulls her own daughter into poverty. Flash forward 16 years and the daughter has become a beautiful, loving young lady. Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture, still maintains a meager but caring relationship with his daughter and? The drama and script writing are so exaggerated that you make a groan in almost every scene. The main culprit is Bette Midler, close behind is John Goodman as her alcoholic.
