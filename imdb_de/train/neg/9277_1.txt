I saw the omen when I was 11 years old. I enjoyed the trilogy. When the chance arose to finally see one in the cinema, I did not miss it. I went to the movies and knew that what I was about to see was not a movie release, but a movie made for the TV. As a fan, however, I could not resist. But this Omen movie, which I saw at a midnight show, did not stir, it made laughter. Rising Dialogue such as "It is written, when a baby weeps during baptism, rejects his God". What a nonsense. No decent set pieces. Faye Grant, so good at V, is wasted with this script from hell. No surprises and no fun. However, I laughed out loud several times when it was bad. Truly Pathetic.1 out of 10
