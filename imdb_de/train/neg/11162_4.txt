Jack Black is an annoying character. This is an annoying indie movie for 14-year-olds. Do I have to write eight more lines? Ana de la Reguera is fine to see as a Mexican nun who is more content with getting ahead of rude advances from Jack Black. This movie is a PG 13 version of an indie movie. I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film deeply explores Mexican culture. I'm just choking on his cultural rudeness: Jack Black is just so rude. A white guy like Jack Black is not my most valuable envoy in Mexican culture, so to speak. Mexican wrestling culture is not the most transparent scene a white guy is looking for. I suspect Mexico is culturally more opaque than Jack Black presented here. <br /> <br /> I think IMDb has changed my review. Has anyone else changed his review as well? Just one question.
