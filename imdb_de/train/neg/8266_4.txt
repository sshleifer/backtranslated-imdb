What the * bliep * is this with this movie? Could not you find a better script? All in all a "nice" movie, but ... it was done more than once ... until the end I thought it was okay, but ... going back to the past ... * barf * SO piggy. .. I was waiting for the fairy godmother to appear ... but wow, that did not happen ... which is good. <br /> <br /> I loved Big with Tom Hanks, but seeing such a movie in a new shape with another kid who has wished that he / she is older / bigger; that's just pas√©. <br /> <br /> Just watch it until it's on TV. Do not get me wrong, but that's not all
