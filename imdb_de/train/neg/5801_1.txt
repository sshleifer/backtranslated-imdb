Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter, cynical journalist who investigates the unexplained. He travels to this small town where it is said that a witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing the community. <br /> <br /> His car stops, he takes refuge in a small building and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly she transforms into a demon, and he kills her, and the city wonders who killed this woman ... who, I think, was the witch, but I'm not sure. Ivan is now being persecuted by her mind or something, and he must have confidence or something to defeat him. I really hate Christian movies. They are usually filled with lame actors, stupid action and minimal effects. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian movie, but a stranger as well. The spokesman for Ivan made the film weirder than terrorizing, because he is so high and whiny. You will not miss this movie.
