I'm a big fan of seventies Italian movies, and I would not hesitate to count the beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of my favorite actresses of all time, so I went into this movie with some hopes. However, it quickly becomes clear that this is a largely meaningless film that will not go anywhere. Of course, nobody would expect to expect much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying, considering that it's pretty boring and none of the characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a "rogue". in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles things. That's basically the whole story of this movie. The film has a real "seventies style" and the idea that everything is very carefree comes into its own. It sometimes seems that the directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson have tried to convey some point, even if this point does not look very good. It is always a pleasure to see Barbara Bouchet on the screen and that is the case here as well. She is definitely the best of the movie and the sequence in which she hangs naked from a car is the best part of the movie. Overall, The Rogue is likely to appeal to people who love the 70s style, but unfortunately, they have little else to offer.
