Just as a director of Altman's experience could ever expect to spend time with a lead character who is neurotic, a whimper, a moron with no redeeming qualities - this is the central puzzle of deeply confused work. A monstrous garbage. In addition to this crippling error, the plot line requires a serious concentration. The setup that the Branagh character enters is obviously so obvious from the beginning that we wonder if the author and the director have completely lost their respect for the audience. This latter edition is the focus of the film: it represents the direction of self-love with the deepest contempt for the taste, values ​​and intelligence of the viewer. Very unusual for Mr. Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
