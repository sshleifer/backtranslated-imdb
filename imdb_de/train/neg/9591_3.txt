If you've read the original novel like me, you'll probably hate this thing. <br /> <br /> The film version of _Absolute Beginners_ is a nightmarish conglomerate of 1980s anachronisms that seeks to create a "period piece." In the late 1950s, and without repetition or homage to that era, it resembles US monstrosity of "Dirty Dancing" from 1963, except that the film was financially successful despite the equally amateur script writing. In addition to being "under the face of the 1980s," the characters have been altered, rearranged, and replayed to such an extent that the only features they share with those of the novel are the least superficial appearance and, of course, their appearance are names: Suze transforms from the storyteller's elusive ex-girlfriend and promiscuous Negrophile, who willingly marry a closed old queen for money (to her own entry on the first pages) into an unfortunate and naive "Eve" -archy type seduced by fame and glamor, exploited and somehow cheated by her boss, who surprisingly did not get a Van Dyke and a pointy hairstyle. She and the narrator who was renamed for the movie in "Colin" (after the author of the book, Colin MacInnes) are also in a relationship. <br/> <br /> Big Jill's character, a lesbian woman who still seems to be "fuck" "In her mid-20s she is a pimp for young, bubble-headed lesbians and one of the storyteller's closest friends, who gives the narrator open wisdom With only a few in a way, "extra called" reduces one-way lines and tons of funny outfits. <br /> <br /> The fabulous Hoplite, a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel, is also reduced to the point that he is pointless in the movie, camped-up and anything but ignored. <br /> <br /> The narrator's father in the novel is a kind of sad minor character, but in the movie he was played so much that he did the moodiness of the sombre neighborhood is optimistic and strangely temperamental, and the messiness of his marriage with the narrator's mother seems to be ignored for practical reasons. <br /> <br /> In her favor, the music (for what she is) is good composed, and you have to Production and writing teams acknowledge that you are actually using a line from the book ("... some days they will write musicals about the 1950s ...") as inspiration for writing A musical, but in the world Of the poorly stored musicals, this is among the worst performed. Unlike _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_, critical diagram elements are treated as retrospective. Unlike _The Apple_, there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogues. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say that it's "80's" because it was created in the 1980's. The movie version of _Annie_, released in 1981, pays tribute to the look and feel of New York City in the 1930s, and _Napolean Dynamite_ manages to capture a scary 80's look and feel despite using a movie. Low budget in 2003 ( Although this was not explicitly stated in the 1980s, those who have lived through the decade can not deny that the film "feels very much in the 1980s"). It was obviously possible to do something good out of this, especially considering the iconic status of the source novel in the UK, but it is most obvious that it fails disrespectfully in the look and feel and handling of the source material. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the novel and have no intention of reading this novel, you can enjoy this' 80s anachronism, a shameful parody of Soho London's modernist jazz set from the late 1980's 1950s represents. I can definitely see what the writing team has tried, but it could definitely have been better. With Boy George as a household name and mixed racial and chart-topping bands in the UK in 1986, they definitely had no need to beat the characters the way they did in the end. I would even go so far as to say that the authors did what both the book and the movie harshly criticized - it ended up being a group of adults craping and treating the targeted teenage audience like two-bit Idiots, to make a quick buck.
