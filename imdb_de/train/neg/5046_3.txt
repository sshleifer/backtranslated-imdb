The lethargic direction ruins an otherwise compelling epoch in which the wondrous Zhang Ziyi plays a prominent role, as a woman who in 1928 joins an extremist group in China shortly before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and joins a former lover who is now working for Japan. Every bit of drama and forward movement in the story gets sucked on by director Ye Lous's somnambulist director. The characters stand for hours, stare at each other, say nothing, handheld cameras are forever on faces that show endless reactions, much longer than necessary, edits repeat the same reaction: Triple redundancy. We do not know anything about the characters at the beginning of the story and receive little new information throughout the story, just silence and static shots of lovers who do not speak, who interact with each other through silent dances but do not share an obvious emotional intimacy. A very sleep-promoting movie.
