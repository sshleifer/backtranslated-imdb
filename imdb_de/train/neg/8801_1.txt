The Frankenstein monster (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy) consists of corpses (deleted scenes) of corpses (Anchorman) and is definitely not a sight for aching eyes (something you wanted to watch twice). Maybe even once for that matter.) Most of the time, the relativity of the scenes in WURB is made relevant by a third-person spokesperson. Even more disturbingly, the characters in WURB do not agree with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of Anchorman (in the opening speech that is said to be WURB shortly after the original). At the end of Anchorman was Burgundy grown since the beginning of the movie and hugged to have a hybrid fellow anchor / lover. In this film, he returns to his immature antics with prank calls to Veronica (obviously those are the same scenes from the original Anchorman that were put together in WURB.) <br /> <br /> The part that matters at one Film, a constantly evolving story, is a bank-robbing clan with no cause known as an alarm clock. These scenes are almost painful to sit through. This part has been deleted from the original Anchorman scripts. <br /> <br /> The majority of the other scenes in which our Channel 4 news team is involved are clearly alternative / deleted footage of Anchorman scenes. They go to the same party as in the original, the same original group that scolds a woman in the team scene, and the same Cat fashion show segment that Veronica had against reporting. <br /> <br /> Burgundy is making her first date with the drive-in movie outside San Diego and dinner at his favorite Tinos club. None of the characters mentioned that they had been to the autoclass before and when Burgundy comes to Tinos with Veronica, he presents it to her as if they had never been before. Oh, and they wear the same clothes as they did on their original date. <br /> <br /> Still, I have to pay tribute to the filmmakers - even though WURB is nothing more than a clever way to present deleted scenes associated with narration. Between the two Ron Burgundy stories - this is the weaker one. In retrospect, it is quite a feat for Anchorman to climb out of the ashes of WURB. You stay stylish, IMDb. Thanks for coming over.
