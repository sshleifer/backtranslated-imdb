Rebar is an astronaut who goes to Saturn on the world's first space mission, but since this is a horror movie, things get ugly and he's the only survivor to return to Earth. He is affected by a bizarre condition that causes him to slowly melt and lose his mind if he does not regularly consume human flesh. He kills what appears to be the only nurse in the hospital and flees to the neighboring city for more victims. </ Br> I liked the premise and the Monster and Gore effects are actually pretty good, but the space scenes are simply put together from NASA footage and the hospital looks curious like a warehouse. A very weak script, little character development, and generally poor demeanor prevent him from rising above anything but a mediocre slasher movie with the novelty of having a live candle as a killer, and more or less has only its bloody effects, to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, exclusively for the most hardened monster movie fans.
