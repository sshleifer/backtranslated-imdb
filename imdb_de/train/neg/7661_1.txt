The title of a bad movie of all time is distributed quickly and often. Mostly it's an exaggeration of the fact, but I'd like to welcome Alone in the Dark on the short list of real candidates: Plan 9 from space, Battlefield Earth, and the adventures of Pluto Nash. <br /> <br When I looked at the 90-minute hole, it was hard for me to even stay awake, although I tried so hard to laugh at the movie. But I felt alone in the dark (I wanted to try to avoid the pun, but I could not resist) as I looked around and hoped to see Mike Nelson and his two robotic friends. Unfortunately, my friends and I had to deliver a comedy throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie itself. Let's talk about the actions and effects, as this should be the only positive part of the movie. The movie features evil creatures that cross between the Xenos in Aliens (they even call them Xenos) and the creatures in Pitch Black. They can accidentally make themselves invisible (and I assure you that it is coincidental) and will be hurt by light. There are also small centipede creatures used to control humans, turning them into something that resembles a zombie. All are shown with outdated special effects that in 1997 would have been mediocre. The action scenes are chaotic and can not be tracked. People randomly shoot on a bluescreen stage or blank set on monsters inserted in a post. Light flashes quickly on a dark screen, causing your students to burn out of overload while bad rock music is humming in the background. <br /> <br /> And those were the highlights. The story of a paranormal investigator (Slater) whose idea of ​​looking tough is wearing a black T-shirt with a trench coat and not shaving for 2 days. An archaeologist (Reid), who is rather incapable. And a government agent (Dorff) whose lines contain a barking order. All three should be ashamed of their performances (not that they did a good job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. I think Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers of the movie. The film contains the strangest love scene I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Then comes the story. Honestly, the parts that make sense are not interesting at all. The rest is illogical at best. The action holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars. The film begins with text and a voice that explains the background story. This opening lasts more than a minute and already the viewer knows that there is something terrible. This opening speech is later repeated in clumsy dialogue in a very awkward and cumbersome way throughout the rest of the film. And the end made no sense. Not only did it make no sense in the world of film, it simply did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Finally the direction of a Uwe Boll. Shame, that's all that can be said. He shook the camera to simulate tension. His lack of direction with the actors. Just look at Reid in scenes where she is not the focus of the shot. The Complete Waste of Special Effects for Bullet Time Effects Finally, I decided to use voice-over to explain something that was painfully obvious to viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 1.50 to see this show in a second run theater. And while the laughter I and my friends provided was worth every quarter, I would advise people to stop paying for that movie. Grab 3 friends and split the rental cost and rip in this movie. <br /> <br /> Be ashamed, Uwe Boll. Shame on you Tara Reid. Shame on you, Christian Slater. Shame on you, Stephen Dorff. Shame on all who connected with this movie.
