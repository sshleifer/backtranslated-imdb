After a long time in space, searching for the remnants of the planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who got married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). In the meantime, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is planning a wicked plan. He used crystals he had stolen from the Fortress of Solitude to create a new land and flood the US The unforgettable Christopher Reeve or television programs like "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville" - a big expectation for the return of Superman in this Bryan-Singer version. Unfortunately, the terrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, numbness and overvalued in IMDb. Besides, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is a bit ridiculously ridiculous. Twenty-two-year-old actress Kate Bosworth is falsely mismanaged and plays the role of a seasoned reporter and experienced mother of a five-year-old boy. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a teenager Clark Kent in "Smallville". The character of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a silly cartoon. Last but not least, Kevin Spacey, though a great Lex Luthor, is 45 years old, older and older than the rest of the cast. The stupid conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
