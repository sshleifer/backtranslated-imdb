When I started watching this movie, I was looking for subtle metaphors, but I soon realized that this movie was actually about people in one go. The interactions between people are like the ones you can see on the street every day, and if occasionally a more interesting situation exists, the dialogue is stilted and boring. It's not that I do not understand how this movie depicts the way people interact, but that they are very boring in this movie. If you want to see and analyze this type of relationship, it is best to buy a ticket and see people on the train. It's realistic, but you would not go into a movie to watch a movie where you sit and watch the movie.
