If you've ever seen the Dukes of Danger, you know you never had to worry about seeing drugs, curses, or rude behavior by young children. If you've seen the movie, you know that's no longer the case! This movie was terrible! Main characters who use drugs and think it's funny and cool is certainly not what I call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and just turned it into garbage. Daisy, who flirted a little in the original show, now looks and acts as if she's on the street corner to get paid for her services. I was so excited to see this movie before it came out. After 15 minutes I was ready to go. I thought it would have to get better, but it got worse by the minute. I wish I had never seen this movie before. It was a good show and left nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth. Do yourself a favor, look at something that's worth your money, because it's not just a waste of money, but a waste of 2 hours of your life you'll never get back!
