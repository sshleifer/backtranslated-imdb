I usually enjoy Loretta Young's early films: her acting was light and airy at the time and she knew exactly how to wear clothes. But this is just a loser from the beginning, apart from a funny side role of Glenda Farrell. Young is a hatmaking girl who persuades her writer-husband (Paul Lukas) to become a bridge champion. It's not the most cinematic of games, and the long, talkative middle section in which their marriage breaks up almost kills the movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is an interesting piece. When Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their top game, flight scenes, trains, football matches and even a mid-air diver freezing in anticipation of the event show a series of fast shots. It is the earliest use of a still picture I have seen in an American movie. I wish the rest would be so imaginative and funny.
