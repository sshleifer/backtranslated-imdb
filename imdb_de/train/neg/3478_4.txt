Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to be lonely this Christmas. Drew is not just a millionaire; but also offensive and guilty of being very grandiose. Drew returns to the homeland he grew up in and offers $ 250,000 to his family, the Valco, to be his "family" during the Christmas season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) hesitates but is greedy enough to accept Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say on this matter, but learns to love Drew ... not the same as daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), but that too has room for change. Drew's girlfriend Missy (Jennifer Morrison) is looking for Drew and wants her people to get to know his family. Real fun awaits you as a happy Noel becomes a fun, dysfunctional nightmare. Other members of the cast: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is weird, if strange.
