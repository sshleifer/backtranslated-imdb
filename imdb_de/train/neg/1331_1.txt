The Collusion Course is even worse than the typical "Bad White Capital Capitalist" of the week. This movie is less pleasant than a toothache. Jay Leno can act. He is good at his underrated debut film, The Silverbears, in which he gives a performance based on the requirements of his character. This movie is so bad Leno's character, a hypocritical buffoon, is less annoying than Morita's character, a hypocritical fool.
