Born in the '60s, I grew up with the "Movies of the Week" television in the early' 70s and loved the creepy films that were regularly screened, including "Crowhaven Farm," "Bad Ronald," "Satan's School of Girl "and" Kolchak "The Night Stalker" etc., but this one is just stupid, this is obviously the writer's attempt to use the terrible Manson murders of a few years earlier. "Dirty" movie stars Dennis Weaver from "McCloud" and "Duel" is known as the father who has his family camped on the beach, and the family meets some hippies who for some reason choose to terrorize the family, the reason for which is never explained, and Weaver's pacifist stance is too heavy For God's sake, call the police, beat hell or something, just do not sit there moaning about it Acting is pretty lame, the story is amazing, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini, but that's about it. Ignore this if it's ever aired on TV.
