It would be quite difficult to understand something as fades as THE SENTINEL. The problems are numerous. The result is terrible and full of plotting holes. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays as Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who "took" one for Reagan during the assassination of his life. Years later, we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse family, primarily as guardians of the First Lady (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise when we see Pete's close relationship with the First Lady and a sudden threat to the President himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). If Pete fails a polygraph test, he will be exposed by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series) as an angry agent. During the assassination attempt by the president, Pete starts fleeing his own people. His only confidant is the First Lady, and she's reluctant to tell anyone about her affections (which is why Pete did not even stick to the polygraph). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he simply trying to gain time until he can kill the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while being run by the secret service? <br /> <br /> The only big, overwhelming problem with this movie is that there is no reason why the presidential threat is at stake. Is not that what the movie is about? That would be thought! But the audience is never informed why the killer wants to kill the Prez. Hmm. Forgot to write that somewhere in the script? <br /> <br /> And what about the new partner of David Breckinridge (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? Apparently she was stuffed like a piece of $ $$ Candy into the movie. What was your goal again? Did she do anything other than look good in tight pants and a low-cut blouse? <br /> <br /> There are so many problems with the basic requirement of The Sentinel that it is ridiculous. The action is too easy through the "What the ...?" Answers that are sure to be voiced by those unhappy enough to watch the movie.
