A movie without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a gangster for money. Then they cross it twice. In the meantime, he falls in love with the dead woman's wife and, without knowing that he is the murderer, moves in with her. Then he kills her "accidentally" when she finds out. Then, in a kind of WALKING TALL heroism, he takes revenge on the gangsters who double crossed him. The first problem is that if the drifter agrees to take on the job by hiring, he loses all sympathy, worthiness, and heroism. We can not accept goodness in him, and consequently the rest of man has no moral center. We just can not care about a guy. And the woman (nicely played by the returning Kari Wuhrer - the Sheriff in EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS), a high-class lady who does a homeless mission, similarly loses some compassion when she leaps straight to bed with the homeless drifter weakened condition after the death of her husband). And if she finds out he's the guy? what is she doing? She locks him in her house (as if ALL houses had locks that can not be opened from the inside) and insulted him. Stoo-Pid. However, George Wendt is great in his role as a beefy bat. Director Stuart Gordon was much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
