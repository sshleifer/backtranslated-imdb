If you remember the filthy details of this creeping, gloomy "movie", it's like digging into your chest cavity with a rusty, salted spoon. Perhaps "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was somewhat predictable, but this pitiful apology for a movie is just one of the most shameless marketing prerogatives I've ever heard of. A boy who fights spies / terrorists when he is alone with the chickenpox in a suburb of Chicago? Ridiculous! Why did this movie have to be done? I'm the guy who thinks even horrible movies are not a waste of time, but learning experiences. However, this is actually a waste of time. It should be avoided at all costs.
