My girlfriend and I saw this movie as "Premiere Surprise", which we bought as a ticket to preview a movie before it opened here in Denmark. We sat for the first hour or so and then we left! The meaning of the film seemed to be simply the era (and club 54), but at the expense of character development, of which there was none, and the act of which there was little /> Rarely have I been to the characters in so indifferent to a movie! <br /> <br /> But the music was good. So if you want to hear good music and improve the mood of the 70s, this is fine. But do not expect to get a plot of credible characters. <br /> <br />
