An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and terribly attacked during a nocturnal encounter on a forest road in Shropshire, England, by a group of two-dimensional psycho-thugs. The man and the woman who were attacked are planning a revenge attack on their assailants ... <br /> <br /> Completely repulsive voyeurism garbage that somehow expresses itself as a "thought-provoking" drama while it actually does comes across as sub-Michael Winner cr * p (you only know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been cast if that had been made so easy in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is horrific and devastating, but Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose into every last globe of his sexual malice. His camera remains hungry on Anderson's naked body during and after the robbery, while the script poundes almost all the characters in a rushing sea of ​​two-dimensional clichés. His script forces his characters to behave in a way that further alienates the viewer from the "victims" by forcing more terrifying situations into their faces (Adams attacks on Sophie and Alice after the incident, Alice after the suicide bombing) confession of confession). <br /> <br /> The dilemma comes from the performances of the central protagonists - Dyer is a terrible actor who has neither light nor shadow as a young male victim of the first attack (he lands there Eastenders, my words, but Anderson is extraordinary Even as the cruel script forces her character to behave in a deceitful and ridiculous way, she somehow delivers an exceptionally compelling and intricate characteristic as a selfish, arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and has to retaliate. <br /> <br /> A vile and pointless film almost saved by a convincing central female performance.
