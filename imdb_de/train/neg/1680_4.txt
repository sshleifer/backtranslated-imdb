Even with a cast that has credible names like Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland does not make sense of this movie. It barely crosses the surface of the incidents that occurred in that July night of 1981. Kilmer only goes through the moves, while hopefully John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth both failed in the other two main roles; as Holmes wife or underage girlfriend. The rest of the cast has such small roles that it is impossible to obtain dimensions from them. Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Frank G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott, and a Paris Hilton came along.
