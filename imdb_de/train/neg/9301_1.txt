Spoiler ahead, if you want to call it that ... I would almost recommend this movie, just so people can really see a 1/10. Where do we start? We start from the top ... <br /> <br /> THE HISTORY: Do not believe the premise - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people understand what the mysterious events are. It's a draub, easy, go to the cabin with no intensity or "trouble". <br /> <br /> THE SCREENPLAY: Usually I give indie screenwriters respect is crap. The story is flat - you will be the whole movie without emotions. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable with the lines "Woah, you made me totally crazy" and "I was wondering if you ... um ... if you want ... hm, would you join me in the Shack coming? "I want to shave each hair individually and feed it myself. <br /> <br /> THE CHARACTERS: SAINT SHEAVE !!!! Some have described the characters as flat, I would like to go one step further and say that they actually have a reverse arc. They are actually starting to work on a parallel universe and are almost starting to work backwards ... <br /> <br /> THE ACTORS: The actors are worse than the characters. They take bad characters anyway and add terrible high school drama. The "Woah, you made me totally crazy" was called monotonous and slow - as if it were dumb. I could complain for hours about the actors. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: An eight-year-old would be disappointed with the lighting of this movie. In areas too shady, bleached in others. The director should not use light as an emotion before he learns to properly illuminate a basic scene. Small steps! SOUND: How many sound guys do you need to make a really crazy movie? 9. With so many sound guys, this sounds amazing, but the opposite is true. There's a scene that really stands out, these guys drive in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angle ... WEAK! CAMERA: Learn to use it. Anyway, I do not have room to complain ... rent it - I dare you ... rent it and learn from it ... leave it 1 review..it deserves it. <br /> <br /> Sign out ...
