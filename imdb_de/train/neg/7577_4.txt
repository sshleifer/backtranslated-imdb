This is only reasonably attractive for fans of "Bad Movie" entertainment. It pays off for 70s pop culture students: the fashion, the furniture, the attitude, and the great "women's lib" moment of the early 70s, when it was still fresh and new that an independent, independent woman existed <br /> <br /> "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) had a financially rewarding career when she became dumb (after all, it's a flight attendant, but a waitress at 30,000 feet - and that's the case for the male as well) had several men slept around, could protect himself and others (with karate) and was tied to nothing. This is the kind of emancipated woman who frightened the juices of anti-feminists, those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband. The "sexy stewardess" was a mighty archetype from the late 1960s to the 1970s (Geez, even on "The Partridge Family", I remember the swinging bachelor Ruben Kincaid, who was always associated with stewardesses). From this perspective, this silly movie is an important pop culture time capsule of pre-AIDS free-love, lib of the women, swinging seventies. The plot is pretty awful. And for these cavemen in the audience, there are only a few naked breasts.
