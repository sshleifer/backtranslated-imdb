As I watch the movie, I'm not sure which disestion to take. There is a reason why a writer should not choose his own work and should act only in it. You can not do everything. I felt that the story in this movie really suffered because the director wore so many hats. Mrs. McTeer is the movie. To complement her amazing talents, her portrayal of this woman was the reason why I was engaged. Here's a British actress who can do it all. In my opinion, conflict is what constitutes drama and a great story. I felt like this movie did not have that. For the characters, everything was easy, there were no real obstacles that prevented the characters from getting what they wanted. Watch the movie for the sweetie, but especially for the brilliant performance of Ms. McTeer.
