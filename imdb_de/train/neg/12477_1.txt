This is one of those movies that you and a couple of friends drink beer, eat pizza and laugh at. Unfortunately, I found myself alone here. My friends and I rented a big movie block and never got to see this movie. It was back and I thought it was a waste not to see it. I did that and I was impressed with how absolutely terrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> Well, I love bad movies pretty much and would probably have liked this movie if the "hero" would not have been so horrible. I had hoped for the whole movie that he had put down that stupid sword and had someone kill him! He does very few heroic things in the movie. He's a beefy, disgusting, stupid thing. He has less salvation qualities than the villains. And what about all the naked chicks? I mean, I love naked girls as well as the next man, but this movie was a little over the top in this section. <br /> <br /> Well, if you love bad movies and you can handle a disgusting "hero" "Then I'm sure you'll like this hit of a movie.
