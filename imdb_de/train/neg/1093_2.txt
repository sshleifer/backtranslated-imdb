Kitten Natividad, a film famous by Russ Meyer, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has found that she has breast cancer, and goes to South America to get special fruits (Crockazilla?) That should have healing powers. After coming across some of these fruits (which are apparently plastic bananas on stalks), chastity has some mystical magical powers that make them super heroine, especially The Double D Avenger. Note that she also wears a pair of underpants as a mask. That sounds pretty good when writing. Well, the design leaves much to be desired. It seems that Chastity owns a pub and a local strip-joint is angry because she takes her business away, so some of the strippers (including Haji, also Russ Meyer movie fame) come after her to ruin her. Of course, Chastity resigns as Double D Avenger. See how she turns a "Wonder Woman" spindle to transform herself into her outfit and lose her balance through excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame double impulses fly like there is no tomorrow. With the inhuman title song being played over and over again, it looks like a twisted '70s live action' children's show with adult content, though it's not rated, but PG-13 is likely to get through in the worst case scenario , And it's probably a blessing that the faded stars were well covered. This makes the Chesty Morgan films by Doris Wishman in comparison positive. Special appearance of Forest J. Ackerman but something. Very stupid, and I never buy a movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10.
