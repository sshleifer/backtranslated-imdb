The case is the best part of the movie, but the purchase price alone is not worth it. I expected a movie based on true story to be just a shot on the home video hodge podge of poorly shot clips associated with pathetic drama and unrelated slaughterhouse scenes. The video scenes had many rewind situations that were probably used to extend the feature rather than effects. I started the review before halfway through the movie and waited until it was over, just in case it had a better ending, but deep and lo and behold, it only got worse. If I could mark it a little lower, it would have been a negative ten. Learn from my mistakes and save money and time.
