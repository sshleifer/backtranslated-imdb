As a Hammer executor, I was scared of the time when I needed the courage to watch this movie and the subsequent Holiday on the Buses. I had watched the movie One the Buses and thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was full of all the horrible comedy British TV screens had plagued in the early '70s. I do not know if that was because I was now familiar with the characters and had enjoyed some situations that knew how they would react. I found Blakey especially funny, though I could not swear in the trilogy at any point, he said his slogan, "I'll get you Butler." Wear skinny and these three films could be compared to an early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, there the second movie is the best (though this is probably the only way to compare it) Only people who want to watch this movie are probably fans of the TV series who will undoubtedly enjoy it, and Hammer executors like me. To the Komplettisten I would say that this film is not so bad and I think bad hammer comedies.
