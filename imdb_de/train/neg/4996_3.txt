I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie, but wow, has this gone crazy, or should I say "just stupid". This is just another example of outdated humor. It may have been funny in 1940, but not now ... not even close. Dick Powell is always interesting to see. I especially liked him when he started switching from his boyish look and high voice to the Busby Berkeley musicals, where he is mature and sounded. <br /> <br /> He was good as "Jimmy MacDonald", but the rest of the cast only played dumb characters, the worst being the boss (Raymond Walburn) of the Maxford House Coffee Company, who always had to scream. He was brutal to hear and was a big drawback to the movie.
