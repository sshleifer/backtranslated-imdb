This is a fascinating horrible movie. It makes so little sense that it forms a strange internal logic. Well, it would happen if it did not shoot further into the back alleys until it finally collapsed under the weight of its own indecision. The film can not decide if it's a straightforward "man turning into a monster" shoot (as in all the 1950s "The Incredible") - or a horrible, big movie about conspiracy theory or a mystical movie afterlife contact story or ... or what? Make your choice. It's just a mess. Grotesque grotesquely over the head and in all directions, with the loose ends flapping everywhere. It was as if Tobe Hooper had taken David Lynch pills. Unfortunately, he did not take enough.
