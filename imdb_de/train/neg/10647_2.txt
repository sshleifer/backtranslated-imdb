The last Tarzan movie starring Johnny Weissmuller (who has surprisingly aged one year after "Tarzan and the Huntress") is bad, despite all the little things you can add to make it look better. It is obvious that RKO made a great farewell to Weissmuller by photographing in MÃ©xico in a beautiful landscape with a top star of the country (Andrea Palma) and multi-award winning cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa and bringing the renowned composer Dimitri Tiomkin to Die Score. Although it may have cost less for filming abroad, it looks more expensive than any other RKO film in the series. He uses the beaches of Acapulco and real pyramids like Aquatania and impressive decorations for all scenes related to the temple of the god Balu (especially the exterior, built on steep rocks.) Kurt Neumann should have remained as director, instead of Robert Florey, the the pace is very slow. Neumann had done a good job with "Tarzan and the Amazons", "Tarzan and the Leopard Woman" and "Tarzan and the Huntress" and ended his career as a director of the classic "The Fly" the year before his death. while Florey became a television director after a career of a few notable films. If Weissmuller looks tired, the chimpanzee who plays Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, a disgusting postman who sings hateful songs (with a Caribbean flair, in a place supposedly Africa and Mexico) was turned!) Boring and decidedly doubtful taste, it was a sad farewell to Weissmuller's Tarzan.
