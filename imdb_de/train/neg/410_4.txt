Unfortunately, one of the best efforts ever made in the area of ​​special effects is completely pointless, as it was placed next to a clumsy, stupid and equally pointless plot and an inappropriate clichéd script. Hollow Man is a pretty useless movie. <br /> <br /> Virtually everything that is seen here has been put to death - the characters, the idea, and the action sequences (especially the elevator shaft!) - with the only truly intriguing element of The Movie is the impressive special effect , However, it is the very same special effect that is made over and over again, and at the end of the film, it has also been put to death. I had hoped, before I saw Hollow Man, that the Invisible Man theme, which is hardly original in itself, will be the basis for something new and interesting. It's not like this. It does not take long for the movie to turn into a well-known bloodbath and mass of ineffective histrionics - the mound of clichés jams so fast that it's almost impressive. <br /> <br /> In addition, Kevin Bacon does a pretty useless job and his side candidates barely do their best. Good points are a passable Jerry Goldsmith score (but no competition for his better performances), a rather interesting use of thermal images and special effects. I was tempted to give this movie three out of ten, but Hollow Man owes its effect one level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
