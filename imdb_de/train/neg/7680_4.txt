Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie from an artistic point of view. The plot is quite predictable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too exaggerated. Anyway, the movie does not seem to have any artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think that this is a commercial thing. Including a character from French-speaking Switzerland (the actor is the leader of the band with which he is traveling in the film - the band is called SENS UNIK) - seems to address a larger audience. A direct German-Swiss film would not have sold in the French part - and vice versa. What really annoyed me was the product placement throughout the movie. Some scenes are reminiscent of advertising clips! <br /> <br /> I also think that the topic "Teenagers who use drugs without any other goals in their lives" is a widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be worked out with greater care. I hope Samir has enough money with Snow White, so that his next film shows his true artistic ability.
