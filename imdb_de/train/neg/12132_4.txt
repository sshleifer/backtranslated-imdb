A trio of low-life criminals, led by Matt Dillon, botched a nighttime burglary. They escape, but cross over quickly with the police, who happened to pursuing a terrorist. Of course, the police confused the gang of burglars with the terrorists, the real terrorist escapes, and the burglar have to look at a little dive bar in a shelter, take hostages, not knowing why the police want to arrest that. And guess who else has chosen as a refuge for the night the bar? <br /> <br /> Incredible? Absolute. And from there it goes downhill. Spacey has acquired a good acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen and M. Emmett Walsh, but they are all wasted. Mainly because the characters get stuck in the bar and everything they do for the rest of the movie is controversial. Endless and aimless. Long before the end of the movie you have no idea made about what happened to them.
