As a fan of silent films, I was looking forward to seeing this picture for the first time. I was pretty disappointed. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before, the movie seems to be a long, long commercial for the Maxwell automobile. <br /> <br /> If the chase scene was only half as long as mine, I might have enjoyed the movie more. But it was getting old very fast. And while I realize that the reality in movies is often stretched without affecting the viewer's enjoyment, what about the Mexican bandits? I mean, they're chasing a car through the mountains, a car that usually moves at one mile an hour, but they can not catch it.
