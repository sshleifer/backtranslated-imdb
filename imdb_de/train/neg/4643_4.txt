I borrowed this movie on DVD. I knew the film would not comply with what he promised me on the back of the case, but when I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was there, I had to hire him. It starts off well, with the premise that snuff films are broadcast via cable. The main character, however, has nothing to complain about, and the end of the movie really does hang you. There are far too many unanswered questions. There was a great scene in the end that totally surprised me, but overall this is a very under-average movie, but I think it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee.
