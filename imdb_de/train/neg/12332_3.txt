The film looks great on paper. A romantic comedy involving a desperate lover in a smuggling thriller should be a generic cross gold, especially with this superb romcomic cast. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid Lawrence Kasdan just gives his two stars too much rope though and they go and hang up. Adam Brooks' script may be to blame, but one would expect it better from Kevin Kline of A Fish Called Wanda. Instead, the two ping-pong elements are separated, and the unlikely budding romance is never satisfactorily reconciled with the reason why both are traveling in France. Jean Reno is friendly with co-stars -a-heart and I guess I wish he was a star with a part. Mind you, he made this Pink Panther remake (s!), So he agreed ... 3/10
