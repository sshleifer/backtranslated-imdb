In this unforgettable little thing, 40-year-old Norma Shearer plays a flighty, girlish buddy in Monte Carlo, involved between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame the film's failure on the boring, melancholic screenplay or director George Cukor, who is never interested in reviving the film's generally comatose state. Most of the time, though, it's the fault of Shearer himself, who desperately wanted to play "young" games as long as she could get away with it. Unintentionally, "Her Cardboard Lover" becomes a bizarre monument to the vanity of an aging woman.
