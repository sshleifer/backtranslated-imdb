I bought this movie on a car boot sale, so I did not expect it to be a pretty horrific movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977). However, it did not turn out to be particularly enjoyable; instead, drama and general film were ridiculed, such as the way the "invisible murderer" assassinated his victims and how all killed people happen to be young blonde women. It was a stereotypical horror movie. I say that for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blond women in danger, the majority is killed. 2) One survives by creeping around in the dark while being persecuted by the killer. 3) surprise surprise, help comes in the form of a gun! <br /> <br /> By using three simple points, I've saved you two odd hours by summing up this poor excuse of a horror movie enough not to have to see it.
