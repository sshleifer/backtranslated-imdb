The Slackers, as featured in this movie, are the three college friends Dave, Jeff, and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna, and Jason Segel), who are about to graduate without passing an honest exam, but successfully come to an end go. This is true until the end, when it is unlikely, but the most sympathetic character of the film Nathan (Schwartzman) finds out what they are up to. Nathan begins the blackmail to make amends with his dream wife, as he can not under normal circumstances. The only problem is, when the trio starts to work on it, Dave falls in love with the beautiful and kind-hearted Angela (James King). Unfortunately, no brilliant genre film. Schwartzman makes it easy to watch the movie because his performance is brilliant. King's performance is average, I think she was hired to only be there with her gorgeous look. The Slackers is reminiscent of American Pie with a different direction. Jokes are as shallow as in American Pie. But are not they all used? I think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they run out of originality. Overall a few smiley moments, but a horrible movie in terms of acting (except Schwartzman) and theme. * out *****
