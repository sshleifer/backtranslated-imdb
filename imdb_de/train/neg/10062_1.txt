Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ ERS !!! How could you do this to me? I can not believe it ... this movie is actually worse than the first one. I saw this with my brother in the theater because my mother forced me to join in ... oh god ... where do I start? The action sucked. The tuning voice SUCKED. The animation SUCKED. The end really sucked. If you liked this movie, ALSO SUGGEST. And for Futuramafan1987, who said that this is the greatest movie of all time, you are a TOOL, SIMPLE AND EASY. This is not a movie for everyone, but the ten-year-old boys with the Game Boys who think Pikachu is God. I still cry until today when I think about that horrible shit of a movie ... and then there was Pikachu's adventure. In fact, it is one of the most boring experiences of my whole life. Do not look at this at any price. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Go out, find any copy of this movie and burn it. Burn them all and then rent a good movie like Aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even back to the future!
