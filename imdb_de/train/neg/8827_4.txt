I love the 80s Slasher movies and I remember when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" was pulled out of our cinemas. I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of them on Fear.net. You Better Watch Out was what I expected from these movie types. The quality of the special effects was ridiculous by today's standards, the character development too long, but all in all, it was funny to laugh out loud! <br /> <br /> The scenes in which he loses it, because Santa Claus, aka Dad, opens his mother and later, when the mob actually shows flares - not flashlights like in the 80s, but real torches! - really tickled my funny bone. However, the scenes in which he examined the children in his neighborhood gave me an eerie feeling of a different nature. I also liked to find out who some of these character actors are. It took me a while to figure out that the main character was the lovable teddy bear from Brothers.
