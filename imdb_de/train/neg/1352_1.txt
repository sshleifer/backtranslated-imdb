Eytan Fox, who generally leans on the side of the apologists for Israeli politics, has made quite a few interesting films in the past, such as "Walk on Water" and the simply wonderful film "Yossi & Jagger". However, in "The Bubble" he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to extremes. <br /> <br /> Far from giving a standing ovation to this film, the people of the movie screening I attended quietly got up and left. I also left calmly, annoyed at such a ridiculously one-sided film that translates self-preservation into racist bullying and racist bullying (and terrorism) as the outbreak of legitimate anger. meaning that the Arabs are being abused by the evil Israelis so that they are furious with a steady stream of unilateral Israeli aggression against them, and therefore they should not be held accountable for their actions /> This movie was not worth the money that I had paid for the ticket (in fact, I was thinking of asking for my money back) and was essentially an Israeli contribution to the Palestinian film Paradise Now. If you want to be an anti-Israeli, then watch this movie anyway, as it really justifies such a belief system. The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and, even worse, by such a talented Israeli director is a shame. In fact, as Israel can be surprised to be considered a pariah state, if the Israelis themselves make such anti-Israeli propaganda, they believe in it. <br /> <br /> What a shameful, awful little movie!
