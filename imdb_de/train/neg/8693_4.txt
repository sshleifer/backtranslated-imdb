I'm from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and have been living in Arlington for several years. This movie was so far away that it looked like Arlington. I saw mountains in the background of a scene! Texas has no mountains. I think that happens when a movie that should be in Texas is filmed in Canada. The accents are also very bad. They should have got actors from Texas to play the roles. There are many aspiring actors from Texas in Hollywood. The movie is really sad because it's a true story. I pray that the killer will be found and sentenced. The one good thing is that before we die, we now have the Amber Alert, which helps to find missing children quickly after their kidnapping.
