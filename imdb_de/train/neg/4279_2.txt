I found a DVD of "I Dream Of Jeanie" in the $ 1 bucket at Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was the "story of Stephen Foster," as a musician and music educator, I had to see it. I had no idea in which year it was made because it was not on the cover, except that it was a remake of the 1939 Sewanee River. Bill Shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes laughable. The man has NO testosterone and is a weakling through and through! It's hard to believe that Stephen Foster thought that music publishers did him a favor by releasing his songs ... without paying him for it! Besides this ridiculous performance, there's a nearly 20-minute segment of Ray Middleton and his black-faced "Christy Minstrels" performing Stephen Foster's songs that were hard to see, to say the least. I can not believe anyone would consider this film suitable for reviving in our present time. This is embarrassing and should be forgotten. Luckily Stephen Foster's songs will NEVER be forgotten. In addition, Eileen Christy's account of Jeanie was certainly the highest point in this deepest part of Hollywood history.
