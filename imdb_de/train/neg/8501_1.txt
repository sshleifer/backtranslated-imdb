<br /> <br /> This movie is shit. It reminded me of the movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which I also found extremely boring. And "Semana Santa" is an even poorer movie in every way. <br /> <br /> Only good in the cast who is doing something for this film is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the great old ladies in European film history. I loved her crazy looks in "Suspiria" and "Inferno" (Dario Argento). I will not deal with this movie anymore. I'll say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly ...
