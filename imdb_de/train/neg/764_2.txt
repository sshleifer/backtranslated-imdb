The script for this Columbo movie seemed to be pulled straight out of an 80s soap opera. Deep character movies are great, but only if the characters are convincing. And in this movie, the only thing convincing was my desire to change channels. The rogue's dialogue sounds as though it were written by a novelist. The big Lt. Columbo himself is not far from his famous, lovable, self-absorbed, crumpled self; and the bride / abduction victim is a whimpering, one-dimensional distressed woman (she hunkers down in front of a tiny scalpel that is held in the hand of her kidnapper - come on! hand and kicked him in the you-know-what in 2 seconds) , In every sense of reality, this character would at least have tried to fight back a bit. Speaking of reality ... The story revolves around a kidnapping that is handled and resolved by the police. The police?? Give me a break. Everyone knows that the FBI takes over EVERY case. This was NOT Columbo, just a superficial and absolutely predictable crime drama into which our well-known Lt. Columbo was enrolled and extended to 2 hours.
