I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and loved the movie so much - even "unmystied" - that I decided to watch the entire series of "Deathstalker" movies. I bought I and II and refused to laugh. <br /> <br /> There was nothing funny about "Deathstalker I" at every level and when the credits rolled I was embarrassed and regretted that I had bought it! Too much ugliness and nudity. I think that either "DS 3" was a much cleaner production or MST3K was really much edited because I had expected something similar, d. H. Dumb and carefree and easy. I was wrong. Even at $ 6.99, it seemed a waste of money. I did not even open "DS 2" because I'll return it tomorrow. I'll probably just throw this DVD away because I can not give it back and nobody wants it - including myself! So, do not worry about it. Even the nudity (much of it, by the way) is boring and icky.
