I grew up (born 1965) and watch and love the Thunderbirds. All my colleagues in the school have been watching. We played "Thunderbirds" in front of the school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. Nobody wanted to be Alan. From 5 count became the art form. I took my kids to watch the movie, hoping they would get a glimpse of what I loved as a child. How bitterly disappointing. The only highlight was the snappy theme. Not that it's comparable to the original score of the Thunderbirds. Fortunately, on early Saturday morning, a television station is still playing repeats of the series that Gerry Anderson and his wife have created. Jonatha Frakes should give up his director's chair, his version was completely hopeless. A waste of film. Absolute nonsense. Although a CGI remake is acceptable, it replaces puppets with Homo sapiens subsp. Sapiens was a big mistake.
