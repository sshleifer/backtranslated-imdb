This movie is really terrible. After watching the ads, I thought it might have its charms ... but it did not. The girls can not act and they can not sing either. The soundtrack to this movie is full of their songs, and it's not a pretty sight, Terrible Story, incredible storyline, one of Disney's worst movies from FAR !. Ally is not a bad actress on "Phil of the Future" so I do not know what happened in "Cow Belles". And her sister, AJ, seems to drive with her sister "fame" and she shows no talent. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the girls are finally learning a clich√© morality, but this is too late to save this movie. <br /> <br /> Awful
