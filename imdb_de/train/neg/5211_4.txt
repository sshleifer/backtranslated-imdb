Ha. No doubt, Tommy is the bad guy here. I do not know why, but for some reason little children in horror movies tend to act as little butts. and since they are children, they will not die. because they are annoying. But these are few and far between. <br /> <br /> At least on the movie. Can not find this movie on DVD? surely you can! You just have to buy the DVD pack from Chilling classics! You will not only get Metamorphosis for $ 15 on DVD, but also 49 OTHER FILMS! what a bargain! pff. OK. I've finished advertising for those cheesy films. Let's just say, this movie is not worth the $ 15 alone. <br /> <br /> So we have a chemist. Yes. Because all chemists look as good as this guy who plays Peter. He tries to develop a serum to stop the deterioration of the body. The college he works on wants to pull the plug on his project, so he tries it out himself. But because this is a horror movie, he soaks it up and starts an incredibly long transformation sequence that needs almost three quarters of the movie. To unpack the film, he gets into a relationship with a woman. Who has a son? and she was never married! scandalous! But of course Tommy is one of the most irritating characters .... no. I take it back. He is the most irritating character. Much worse than the old, crippled guy who wants to take over Peter's job and make fun of him while he's in the hospital. That's right, even as an old cripple you can still be the bad guy. <br /> <br /> So we see Peter accidentally kill some people in visions until he realizes he's the one who does it and just decides to kill everyone on his way to get back to normal. In the end, however, he becomes a lizard. Yes, I do not ask. The end really does not make sense. And if you hope for a really good payout, you will not get it. <br /> <br /> This is not a horrible movie ... it's just frustrating because there is no good movie payout. If you already own the 50s movie pack and it's next on your list, you can not play Snoozer, but you can not play a great movie either. Just sit back, relax and have a snack. Because this movie will not let you jump out of your skin so fast. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis receives 4 out of 10 artificial silk heads.
