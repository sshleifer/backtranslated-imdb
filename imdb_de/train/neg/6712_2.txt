I think you have to give some points because you have the courage to write a musical for a history lesson, but how about decent music? <br /> <br /> Should Howard DeSilva's caricature interest other children? <br /> <br /> Is William Daniels Campy contemporary (for the time) a style of acting that addresses a demographic structure of the 1960s / 70s? <br /> <br /> Do we need all the "jokes" about NY & NJ? (I hear the blue-haired Broadway crowd gasping for cue.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, I think the whole thing is old-fashioned, boring, and the acting too much for the screen
