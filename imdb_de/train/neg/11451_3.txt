Okay, friends, a serious movie fan is expected to see all sorts of movies, both the bad and the good, and this movie has put me to the test. I will not chop up words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The acting was bad. The always wonderful Sissy Spacek has not improved this movie. In fact, I was wondering why I ever saw this filthy, trashy movie. Why did I waste my time and money on something I suspected was bad? The answer, of course, is that I am a film fan and therefore can not avoid what else should be avoided. I'm not going to waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateur movie, except to say that the quality of acting was, politely, sub pair. A serious movie lover may want to take responsibility for watching this movie. Otherwise. Staying home, not wasting time, reading a book, doing chores or having a good sandwich.
