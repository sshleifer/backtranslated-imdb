While it's early to say how the series will develop, I can say that the pilot was less than I thought. There is still potential for the series. When I saw Voyager for the first time, of course I thought it had potential - but it was very disappointing. But my courage tells me that Enterprise will not be as bad as Voyager. <br /> <br /> As for the pilot's impressions ... <br /> <br /> The pilot had some good ideas and good ideas. I liked the introduction. The opening speeches of the show were interesting, with the progress of the exploration and a matching theme song. Scott Bakula is excellent in the role of captain. <br /> <br /> Where I did not succeed, it was largely that the story lacked the "feeling" of embarking on a great adventure. The storyline of the episode itself was more of a "generic" trek story with the themes of "exploration" and "first step towards space", just as background and subtext. If you worked out the clues that this was the first deep-space mission, the plot would be hard to distinguish between the eras of Enterprise, TOS or TNG. The central conspiracy did not reflect the big theme of the series and did not do it justice. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy of the first mission would have been big enough without the "action". Instead of isolated clues to the new of exploration, they could have been history. Get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh, for a TV show that makes us THINK again). Let's feel the excitement of "the wind" and "the sea" instead of distracting ourselves with a rescue and an abundance of shootings. There was far too much shooting. <br /> <br /> We felt that people are the "newbies" in an established school. New children on the street, in contrast to a largely unknown universe. Unfortunately, the Klingons landed at our door instead of finding them. This meeting could have been much more historical and sociological. How do two such different societies interact? Do not just show it, show it! <br /> <br /> I had to consider it as a "trek with a good crew and limited technology" and not as "the first bold steps into the unknown". I wanted to see something new and fresher. The series promises to have a new concept, but so far I have not seen this new, great concept. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to say once again that the series has potential. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is wonderful. Blalock has potential. The overarching theme is the most interesting since we first saw Kirk in a world before Apollo 11. If only future episodes can do justice to this great and wonderful theme, we will have a show that will create new legends /> You shoot an arrow in the air ... good luck Capt. Archer. <br /> <br /> To the producers: Take more RISKS AND MAKE US * THINK *! :-)
