My kid makes better videos than this! I feel deprived of the $ 4.00 spent on renting this thing! There is no date in the video case apparently designed by Wellspring. And what's worse, there's no production date for the original movie that's listed somewhere in the movie! The only date given is 2002, which leads an unsuspecting renter to believe he is getting a new movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad from an angle that it was outdated and irrelevant for any period of time, but just when it was made I am amazed that everyone has the time and the expense for the Would take marketing as a video. It may be of interest to students studying the counterculture of the 1960s, the anti-war, anti-establishment, start-up, entry and exit cultures; But if you read the back of the video case, there is no indication that you are getting exactly that. If you make the mistake of hiring it, it's probably best if you are drugged so that your mind is closer to the wavelength of the thoughts of the directors Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind, I can tell you that it does not get better after the first scene. I'm sure you'll fall asleep long before the end.
