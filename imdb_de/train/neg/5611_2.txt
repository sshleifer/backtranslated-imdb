Personally, I found this movie terrible, at first it was barely objective and offered a side of the debate. The only people who were portrayed as the site claiming to exist were some people who came from a Billy Grahm revival. Second, it strongly diverged from its purported theme of whether Jesus (Yeshua) existed to talk about how violent Christianity is and show scenes from Mel Gibson's "The Passion." In the end, the director interviewed his former headmaster of a conservative private school and tried to persuade him to give the children faith there. Oh yes, and the techno music has the film difficult to watch.
