Unfortunately, this was shown last week on Star Movies here in Thailand. It is completely garbage. As another member said, this film is a good example of how not to behave. I have not played a movie that bad in a long time. The actors (can you call them 'actors'?) Are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say, to really understand how bad acting is, you have to watch the movie ... but that would be torture. <br /> <br /> I shudder as the main actress pretends to be her lines and the rest of the cast with its accents (false or artificial) is just as disgusting. Another actress with the wrong British accent was pretty, yes, but the good gentleman, her accent was terrible. Mix this with their (missing) acting and you have a disaster. She should not have said anything and I could have accepted her as a pretty girl. Oh, we've just come to the scene where the main lady's lover says, "Really me?" after a forced crying scene of her. Ridiculous. No, really, I just laughed aloud. <br /> <br /> The sets and art directors give the film some savings. Some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are pretty nice (apart from the actors). <br /> <br /> The old magic potion lady? What?! Another member mentioned the "modern" love song from the movie. Completely unsuitable for a piece that was shot about 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that at the time of its production in Thailand, the film was considered a "big budget". I would be seriously annoyed if I were the producer of this film. This just shows that money is not necessarily a good (or even mediocre) movie. <br /> <br /> I would give the King Maker a 1 out of 10 points, but the costumes and sets make the movie a rating from such stores. 2 out of 10.
