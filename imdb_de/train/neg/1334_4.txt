So I finally saw the movie "My Left Foot" last night, after my mom had told me for years how amazing that is ... The central accomplishment of Day-Lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing, but anyone who has only one has minimal contact with his other The work should not expect anything else. <br /> <br /> The fatal miscalculation in my eyes was being obsessed with proving that man's normalcy; The film decided to show him as a complete and absolute sucker. On the one hand, I can see that this is a logical correlation; Humanity always has the ability to be offensive and disability should not mask it. My only wish is that impartial viewers will not forgive deviant behavior and assume that the circumstances make this automatically forgivable. They do not do it. It is normal to behave, and yes, disabled people behave - but they do not do it because they are disabled. They do it because they are unreasonable. Physical impairment does not give you the right to cause a seizure in public just because someone you love rejects you. <br /> <br /> There are certain things that it is unwise to do, whether you are handicapped or able to tacitly allow someone to boot a football right at your head just to install it , is one of them. (Granted, once I saved a punishment from the star striker of the school with my face, but I was already part of it at the time.) It was not acceptance.) Participating in a brawl is different. If you realize that your father only grants you fellowship after you have been able to jump metaphorically through physical hoops, masochism is one step too far. All these things are stupid, and if you go through them to prove bravery they are no less stupid. <br /> <br /> So yes; It's no jerk because you've overcome obstacles to achieve great things ... Being a good person takes precedence. An inspiring example of handicapped people should appear at the bottom of the list.
