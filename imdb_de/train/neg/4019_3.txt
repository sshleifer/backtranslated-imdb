Dakota (1988) was another former vehicle of Lou Diamond Phillips. This movie is similar to the later movie Harley. There are some differences, but they are the same. I do not know who came first. I think it remains one of the secrets of life. But both are troubled "kids" who are trying to turn their lives there. Instead of bicycles, these are horses. They are basically one and the same movie and both are hellish cheesy. If you are a serious L.D.P. Fan then I recommend you to see them both. You get some extreme raids and attitude from L.D.P. If you are a game, go for it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except for L.D.P. Fans !!!
