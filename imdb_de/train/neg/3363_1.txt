The original movie (dated 19 ??) did not show a "monster", only "scary" things were recommended. <br /> <br /> However, this version shows every aspect of a "sick mind", including unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> The "mystery," as portrayed in the original movie, was the scariest part: you simply did not know what caused the strange things that had happened. By showing the face of the "old man," this gentleman has completely disappeared. Worse, the special effects (weeping children's faces made of wood) are ridiculous. This is a stupid remake, too obviously too spectacular to even be as scary as the original
