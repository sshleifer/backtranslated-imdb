Well, I finally saw it. I did not leave when it first came out, because frankly I was scared. Worried how bad it could be or how disappointing. Although not as bad as Menace and better than clones, it was not particularly memorable or satisfying. <br /> <br /> I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. It was a movie experience that I will never forget. A timeless tale of the bored peasant boy who only knows that he was meant for more. He saved the princess and the galaxy from the evil threat as he was accompanied by the wise wizard, the rogue pirates and the various comic relief - all in one room -Opera setting. <br /> <br /> And Lucas is not in favor of using an old formula. It's an old formula, just because it works. And in his honor, he gave him new phrases that made him something very special. <br /> <br /> Then came Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale. The darkness came into the picture and we learned one of the greatest movie turns of all time. The big bad guy Vader was Luke's father. Wow, nobody saw that coming. Of course, I'm convinced Lucas does not, until it appeared in the script. Go back and watch Star Wars again. If you know what you know now, especially with regard to the first three episodes, you can see if it really comes together. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the problem that I have. Revenge is an entertaining movie - huge effects, lots of action and good fight scenes. But a movie still lives or dies on its plot - the story it tells. Oh, sure, really good acting can save a faint plot, but it's a faint plot with bad drama - a burden no director can overcome, at least not as bad as I'm forced to realize George Lucas ( the man has succeeded to conduct some of the worst performances of her career by some very good actors -. Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Samuel Jackson <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ****** having a too much to overcome for him, * the plot. Oh my. understand it is already hampered what happened in the first two films, so it's an incredible burden.. <br /> <br /> first We have found Anakin as a child on Tatooine, the product of a virgin miracle birth - the "chosen one." Well, this detail is never explained remotely - in fact, the best explanation is Yoda's observation that Maybe they were wrong. Alright, then good. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now this prodigy turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence that is. And he will return to Tatooine and never know he was from there? Impressive! How is it with it. Test the old willing suspension of unbelief there, or George? Anyway, we have this other kid, moody, irritable, lamenting young adult, who somehow has to become one of the biggest villains in movie history - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - the good that falls out of favor just to finally achieve something Redemption in the end. <br /> <br /> What, please tell, is this happening? He has the dream that his wife will die at birth. Sure, he lives in a sternumspannenden civilization that treats gravity as we treat gasoline, but it is the "dark" before, perhaps to ask a doctor, maybe, maybe just this futuristic society this could do something about this problem? No, the only thing he can think about is killing some kids because the villain at the root of all the evil they've chased for two movies tells him he has the mystery of immortality. <br /> Well Of course he does. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. <br /> <br /> How can Lucas expect us to see and be touched by such stupidities? How can anyone expect us to be interested? Damn, why would anyone want this brat ever saved or redeemed. I wanted Kenobi not to kill him, not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid. Oh, by the way, Amidala finally dies. At birth Why? Well, they do not know. The doctor, who is a droid and even points to the incredibly high technology to which this society has progressed, offers only the conclusion "it has lost the will to live." Oh, okay, of course she has. Maybe she finally realized what kind of dweeb she was sleeping with. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We have Kenobi for all this. He knows about the birth of Luke and Leia. He knows who his father is and knows what happens to them. Also knows the role of R2 and C3PO. And yet, as Luke approaches masculinity in several years and turns up with 3PO and R2 (strangely enough, 3PO's head is wiped away, but not R2's - why ????): "I think these droids are yours," Kenobi, Who knows that the Protocol Droid was constructed by the one he believed was the "chosen one" and Apprentice of the Emperor himself, and who was accidentally built on this planet says "strangely, I do not remember him one had Droids ". <br /> <br /> Oh, good grief. <br /> <br /> Lucas just thought it up when he went. After presenting VAder as Luke's father, the story unfortunately got out of hand because he did not know what the story was. The storyline of episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. Nothing that Palpatine had ever done was reasonable. And none of that is related to the story he originally told in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's an afterthought and it looks like that. <br /> <br /> I can not rate this movie highly. It reminds me of Triple X. A funny movie, but completely forgotten. I'll remember Star Wars forever. Fortunately, these and the two previous ones soon fade.
