Oh, where should I start ... this movie was just awful. The writing was bad, the drama was bad, special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie, but I did not understand that! I thought it was decent enough because I'm not picky. I have seen several bad horror movies. In fact, my goal is to see all the horror movies, no matter how awful they may be. At one point in the film I made a comment on the "corn syrup blood" and in the specifics they actually admit that it is check syrup (brand name corn syrup ...) (blood, nudity, crazy murderer, stupid features), but everything was missing to do it really well. The author should either take lessons or just give up!
