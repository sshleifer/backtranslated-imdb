There are films like "Plan 9" that are so bad that they have a charm, there are some like "Waterworld" that have the same inexplicable draws as a car accident, and there are also some like "Desperate Living" which You hate to admit that you love. Cowgirls do not have these redemptions. The cast has enough talent to make almost every action worth seeing, and from what I've been told, the book is enjoyable. How could this movie be so unbearably bad? At first, it seems that the director has brought together a cast of names that is nothing but what the 20 things will bring. Then tell them to make their best imitation of Kevin Costner. Open the book at random and start shooting what's on the side to make sure the vast expanse of America is in no way interesting. Finally, give your brother-in-law the cut order because the meat packing plant has just dismissed him. He has twenty years of cutting experience. <br /> <br /> This film now lays the foundation for me. It's so bad it's not even good to be bad.
