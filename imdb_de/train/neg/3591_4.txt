First of all, I'd like to say that I firmly believe in fanpro stuff. I see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of decent efforts. So, I have a flaw for fanpro stuff, which means I'm missing things that I normally would not plan well. <br /> <br /> So to ST: HF. First of all, the good things. Enthusiasm is an essential part of making every show believable, and the crew of the various ships all seem to enjoy themselves with their roles. Next, the effects are not bad for self-brewing, and nothing makes you falter. The stories are not so bad. Nothing particularly innovative, but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing story arcs. <br /> <br /> But it has a lot of mistakes. <br /> <br /> First of all, although they obviously have to tear down Star Trek footage, backdrops, music and effects, I see no reason why they break down just about every sci-fi music ever produced. Everything from aliens to starship troopers makes it an orchestral head at one time or another. Similarly, much of the footage from other films, dutifully CGI, to make it look different. For example, the Gray Warships, though disguised, are obviously Star Wars Star Destroyers. And the station is obviously also the Ticonderoga naval combat station by Starship Troopers. Likewise, sound effects from various Star Wars movies appear in combat between fighters, as well as animations about footage. I think in a scene in the first or second season, you even see two TIE fighters flying past during a fight, which makes their suspension of unbelief hardly a felony painful. Although everyone is improving over the seasons, it is expected to make a grimace on the screen, especially in the early seasons. They have also made some interesting acting decisions. Let's just say that the food replicators in this show are constantly "baked" and left at it. <br /> <br /> Make-up effects are generally very effective overall. But they should mercilessly kill the person who has chosen cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks, except for background applications or "passing" shots. They are just unrealistic. Every time I saw one of them (apart from trying not to laugh too much), I always expected that the unfortunate soul who wears it draws a gun and announces, "This is a stick-up!" In one scene, a "Cardassian" actually speaks while carrying one of them. Not only are the lips not moving but the mask does not even have an opening where the mouth should be. Someone has to be beaten for it. If they had not taken a craft knife, for God's sake! There are also some well done, but unintentionally funny make-up jobs, such as the look of Herman Munster. <br /> <br /> Writing is coherent, but nothing new. Instead, the script runs like a sequel to DS9, with the ships departing from the DS12 on various missions. The new enemy "The Gray" is not very threatening and the plotline he is involved in is effectively a revision of the Borg threads. Starfleet meets the horrors, the horrors are immensely powerful, Starfleet barely flees with their lives, then through technology they find ways to fight the enemy, and so on. Everything done before with the Borg. The point at issue is dialogue. Star Trek writers have long had the opportunity to write "technobabble here" in a script. Usually, this is a representation of the latest plan to combat the enemy using "quantum phase discriminators" or "isolytic charges," etc. In other words, nonsense that tells you that they are pertinent to the case and that there is a solution. <Br /> <br /> The words are really just gibberish. I have no problem with that, but where ST: HF makes a mess of it, they're putting real comments into that concept. Tactical advice like "We need to regroup" sounds good, but not if three characters are already in a group. Asked about the situation, one hears a tactical officer answering "We count three battleships." He actually had to count her? Come on! I expected the questioner to ask him, "Are you sure?" or "Can you check that again?". My favorite favorite commentary is: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we build bi-directional communication?" <br /> <br /> Commissioner: "No, we can only send and receive ..." <br /> <br /> Well, duh! ..... <br /> <br /> After all that said above, the show improves over time. Season 1 and 2 are pretty bad, 3 shows an improvement, but at 4 & 5 it's starting to get noticeably better. The sixth season looks quite cheap so far. <br /> <br /> However, I have a problem with media selection for the shows. Quicktime is shit, frankly, and the sooner you switch to the DivX / AVI format, the better. Some of us actually enjoy watching our downloaded shows and watching them on a decent screen and not looking at a small QT window on a computer monitor. Quicktime not only makes this difficult, but the resolution of 320x180, in which the shows are shown, can not scale well. In fact, the shows are quite unsurpassed, as if they were a tenth-generation VHS tape copy. The least they could do was add a high-resolution download option. Anyway, the show has promises, and I even start liking some characters. But that's 40 episodes, so I'm not sure if that says so much about character development at all. <br /> <br /> But what can you say, it's free ... <br /> <br /> PS: Out of 28 votes, 19 people rated this show 9 or 10. Hmmmm ... we have the seen the same show? Or are you 19 years old every three years?
