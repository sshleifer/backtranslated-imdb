"Gone With The Wind" is one of the most overrated films in history. It's a movie loved by mothers, grandmothers and shut-ins who go to the movies every five years. As a zombie movie it blows. There's no confusing corpse in sight, and it's awfully easy in the Gore department. On the other hand, "Zombie 3" is a large number of confusing corpses and quite generous with its bloodshed - so it's better than "Gone with the Wind." It is not overrated either. Most reviewers have no idea that it is garbage. However, it is not boring garbage. After a terrorist steals a virus, he drops it while being tracked by a helicopter and the chemicals run into the ground. The terrorist who was exposed to the evil brew hides in a hotel room, where he slowly turns into a carnivorous zombie. One of his first victims is a cleaning lady. As soon as she's bitten, Lucio Fulci breaks the hell out. As is usual with a Fulci film, acting is cruel, the plot is full of action holes and the blood is abundant. It turned out that the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, which explains his rather schizophrenic nature. It is also poorly recorded, poorly edited and the sound design is flat. Nevertheless, it is saved by his cheerful adherence to the wildest murders and his impatient pace. Definitely worth picking up if you're a total undead. Or do not you like "Gone With The Wind", undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.
