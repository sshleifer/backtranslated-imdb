This quasi-J horror movie followed a young woman as she returned to her children's village on Shikoku Island to sell the family home and meet old friends. She finds the one, the daughter of the village priestess, drowned a few years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. The bonds between the dead and the living are already weakening and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. Nothing was extraordinary or even very good at this movie. In contrast to outstanding J horror films, the tension does not really build up, the result does not seem to be overly threatening and the endpoints are absurd. <br /> <br /> This film is like white, slightly cooked rice long, so it borders on pulpy. Sometimes you get that in poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a bit too long. In the end, you eat it because you need it with the meal because what Chinese or Japanese food is without rice, but it almost ruins the meal because of the sticky, sticky tastelessness of everything. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
