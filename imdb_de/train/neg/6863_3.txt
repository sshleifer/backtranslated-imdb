Oh my god, I give this movie three out of ten stars for the following reasons. The final sequence is again handled very effectively and it was absolutely funny. For this, these three points will be awarded. Besides, it was cruel. It should not be so funny, that's obvious, but syncing, playing the dubbed voices, the dialogue they said were often funny. The actions taken and / or not taken also lead to much merriment and / or throw things on the screen. For example, when the whole city is slaughtered and a small group of people are standing on a balcony, as if watching a glass of cooking, or the "attempted" escape from the church they are interfering with. <br /> <angry mayor: I think there's something going on outside, so you should go upstairs and look out the window. <br /> <br /> Hero: ok. <br /> <br /> evil mayor: now is my chance for an idiot to go outside and fight with fire that is completely ineffective and hacked. <br /> <br /> Insert sequence in which this happens. <br /> <br /> evil mayor: damn, wait, I'll get this little kid, and she'll go outside and scream Pappa, who's supposed to blame the fact that those lazy bodies are not just scary strangers, but in fact zombies without flesh or skin. She will lead her away and I will flee! Insert sequence in which this happens. <br /> <br /> Hero (above): He's trying to escape again, fool, and he left the door open, he's stupid, that's a nice view. <br /> Woman: Where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> Hero (now below): I do not know, I can not see her anyway and she was not out because I could not see her even though she was out there and I have a look at the whole Neighborhood, and she stands right out there, where on earth could she be? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, anyone would throw things on the screen after ten minutes. So watch the first movie with some friends, have a few drinks and make sure you're completely blind when watching this movie, and you can only giggle at the stupidity of everything. and there was not even a decent blood, such a shame.
