This title seems more like a movie exercise than a movie that should be released to be seen by the public. It must have been fun for Dafoe and his wife to work together in a movie for the first time, ignoring the fact that people could actually see it. I felt it was 90 minutes when I was anxiously waiting for an action to develop or even begin. <br /> <br /> Try to incorporate this movie into a genre, and you will not do it because it lacks the beginning or end. I've seen arty films before, and that's not nearly artistic, abstract or original, it just seems to me pointless. <br /> <br /> I think it speaks for itself, when The only people who rated this movie at 10 were the age group under 18 years old. Undoubtedly for the constant senseless erotic scenes the movie insisted on throwing us. That is, if you can call it erotic. It certainly had no taste.
