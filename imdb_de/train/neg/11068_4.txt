Dahmer, a young confused man. Dahmer, a confusing movie. Granted, I drank a couple of beers while watching the movie, but that does not explain why I got so bored with this movie, beginning and end, the only meaningful part in the movie was the explanatory text at the beginning and at the very end of the film. The in between, what the movie would be, is just boring pictures and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see real murders, everything is just a collection of allusions. Sometimes you just get the feeling that Dahmer is dreaming the whole thing, but you know that he is not, because it's based on a true story, and it actually happened, at least most of it. But what happened? It is not easy to say. <br /> <br /> I do not encourage people to waste time on this film. I <br /> <br /> did not like it a bit and I felt cheated when it suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
