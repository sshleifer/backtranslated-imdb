This movie seemed to have it all with good camera, sound, film, sets, music and costumes ... but drum roll, Gary Stretch spoke! I do not know if it was his bad drama or just a bad script, but would say it was both. Given his role in this role, I found it hard to anchor him to the end. I wish he had died in combat or one of the sword / knife quakes. <br /> <br /> Then it was the impetus for the conspiracy to kill the king because the king had no dinner and sex with him queen? Pretty boring. And to go to extremes to kill her own son? And then to drive her lover as the king's successor? I see one or two threads here and there of historical bytes, but the way in which all of this was presented was crude. <br /> <br /> I do not know Gary Stretch of anything else, but he was terrible. I've read another user's comments about dubbing audio, but I do not think he synced ... after all, he speaks English, right? It was really awful. The lines were read directly from the coroner table ... flat. It could be that he simply does not have the voice to carry out tone fluctuations. Apart from that, I have seen it to the end, so that the film had at least an "interest". It could have been more if the script / lines and the casting got more work done. The scenery and the film crew together with the high-quality film make this film out of all. Cast and story were all trivial. I give the film crew a 10.
