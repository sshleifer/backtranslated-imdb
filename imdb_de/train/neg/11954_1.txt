This movie was awful. Throughout the movie, I was confused and did not see the point. I had to go to this page and read the review to finally understand what it was about. This movie is not worth watching. It's not just sick and disgusting, it's totally stupid! Please do not look, unless you are one of those who like watching bad movies. If this film questions Japanese society and its values ​​and roles, then this is a country that I do not want to visit or want to know. This is a totally sick movie !!!!!!!! I did not enjoy it, because it made no sense. My friend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror. It was a total disappointment.
