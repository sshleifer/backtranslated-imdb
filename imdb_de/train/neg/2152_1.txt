This movie tries to be hugely clever, and Tarantino-like <br /> <br /> But before you do that, you'll need solid cinematic fundamentals. These include good sound, editing, set design, etc. <br /> <br /> lets the sound speak in this film. absolutely cruel I've never been so distracted by a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> and before we talk about low budget, film in Chile etc., we have to keep in mind that nowadays much better than the desent sound is possible. somewhere. And there is more information on the technology before the sound in this movie is just bad. especially the foley is inappropriate and inappropriate, the atmos is just as awful. I've heard at least four loud clicks during the movie due to poor sound editing. The noise in the cars is terrible, the sound of the closing car doors is terrible. The sound of the lady is wrong. Foley is either overboard or just not there, as if the sound person was bored and gave up. the rooms are wrong. all this is wrong <br /> <br /> and yet not to interfere with creativity restrictions, at the same time the film bravely tries to be clever. For example, the sound of the aquarium is used in the following street scene. We hear sounds when we should not. Sound edits precede visual sections. Every trick in this book is used, and yet the basics just do not exist. <br /> <br /> In terms of editing, we have scenes with heavy jump cuts, we've been paving around with the timeline, etc., yawning. All of these techniques are mimicked to a great low standard. <br /> <br /> Overall, Mix Mist is the Sound Mist. and so is the movie crap. How can a movie with so many fundamental flaws for awards and high praise be considered? Chile's cinematic new wave? the best creative result that Chile has to offer? I hope not, and I do not think so. <br /> <br /> My theory is that Chile's more selective and better talent avoided this movie like the plague because of its daring content. Likewise, for the same "dirty" reasons, the movie has probably received so many unjustified criticisms from so-called "World Cinema" lovers. They probably revel in their flippancy. Of course, film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality. <br /> <br /> this movie is garbage. It's all mouth and no pants and never deserves a rating of 6.8. The movie has all the production quality of a cheap tarantino, new wave inspired porn!
