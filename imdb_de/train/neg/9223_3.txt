From the Nepotism Capitol of the world is another flea strip in a smart wrapper. "CQ" tells of a lame, disjointed mess of a story that is little more than a pile of silly cartoons, a baby and the man Davies walking around trying to make a stupid science fiction movie. I can not imagine why anyone wants to spend time on this ridiculous attempt at filmmaking. (D)
