Someone could probably make a great documentary on the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictionalised version manages to remove something authentic and interesting from the trash TV phenomenon. There are dozens of famously bad movies (such as "Manos: The Hands of Fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this drab, witless waste of film. Seriously, why not get a documentary on the Jerry Springer Show that would start answering some of the real questions, like: Who are these people? What happens to her life after her performance on this show? How did the mayor of Cincinatti find himself here? <br /> <br /> One good line: During a "Guidance Session" for guests: "Guys, I can not stress this enough: NO WEAPONS!"
