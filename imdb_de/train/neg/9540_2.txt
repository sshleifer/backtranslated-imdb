The only reason to watch this film is the brilliant performance of Thom-Adcox Hernandez, who is rarely used in the film in the film. As usual, Tom Villard is good too. Otherwise it is c ** p. The Possor does not even exist, how can he magically change the letters on the theater tent to spell "The Possessor"? Lame.
