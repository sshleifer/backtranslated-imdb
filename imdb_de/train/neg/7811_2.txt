So do it: Believe in God and repent of your sins. Then things should change within the next day or so. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this movie is just a bad replay of a drunk's crappy life. His mother dies. His stepmother is a b_tch. His father dies. He drinks. He marries. He has children. He is still drinking something. His wife gets angry. He disappoints his children. The woman threatens to go. He calls a Reverend late at night because he wants to kill himself. Then, after the repetition, we get the "left behind" -like subtle message. <br /> <br /> "He needed a paycheck." This is the sentence that I had to repeat over and over again as soon as the credits began to roll so that I would not lose my respect for Madsen. Madsen falls to his knees and asks Christ for forgiveness. Then he goes outside and actually says that he sees the world differently. He tells his wife that he found God and that's good enough for her. Flip scene four months and the woman is tired of going to church. Finish the movie while Madsen walks past the bar and pronounces a mono about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. Last Moment He gives the bar a small wave of dismissal and sends a special congratulatory message to a gay Miami Vice after school while the camera freezes. See why I had to repeat the sentence. "He needed a paycheck." <br /> <br /> Man, this movie is bad. The production values ​​of the B-Grade 80 do not help much. The script could easily have been an episode of "Touched By An Angel." It could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials. The play is made of wood and never believable. Even Madsen, of whom I'm a big fan and the only reason I've been through this, makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he does not know his a $$ from his elbow in front of the camera. After 45 minutes, I was discouraged. This thing was like homework. I just wanted to put it down and say, alright, I saw half of it. That's good enough. But no. If I was sitting by cheerleader ninjas, I could sit during all that time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I do not give this thing a 1 refers to two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great to see the opening title "Introducing Michael Madsen". Sue me. 2) Some of the dialogues are so bad that they are classic. I'll end up with some quotes so you can enjoy them too. <br /> <br /> That's it. To sum it up, this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the shit. But hey! Appearance! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, EXECUTIVE GOAL, MY BOSS'S DAUGHTER, etc.). Now I have to watch Reservoir Dogs again and watch Madsen torture a police officer to get my respect back. See you then, kids. <br /> <br /> "This stuff makes me blind, but I'll drink it anyway" - Madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> understand! Everything seems so nice! "- Madsen goes outside after confessing to God <br /> <br />" I'll go downtown later and get a Bible and I'll get a haircut, too. "In your hair
