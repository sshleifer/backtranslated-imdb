I saw Written on The Wind starring Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone in the lead role - Robert Stack was terrible - just damn terrible - he was supposed to be a charming millionaire in jet-setting - instead he came like an idiot from the word The plot was stupid and overworked and the 3 "romantic" leads had no chemistry. Somehow, Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress - though her dreary Campy character was boring - Splendor's older sister in The Grass thinks, full of malice and bitterness and no charisma. Director Douglas Sirk overreacted the entire cast through the dialogue, which was felt to have been forced, and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. Had a cameo by the actor who played Get Smart's boss
