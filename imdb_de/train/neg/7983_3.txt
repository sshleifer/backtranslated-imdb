In the sum of lingering and filled with more subterranean than Swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-author says he wanted to mix genres - in this case, drama and comedy. Well, at least these two mix like vinegar and oil. Besides, the comedy is not very funny and youthful. Besides, the movie is not really realistic. Freedoms are taken in relation to the legal system in which French citizens are persecuted against their will and the apparent ease of escaping with drugs in French hospitals. I saw this movie on my big TV screen at home and shouted at the movie to keep going. Toward the end I carried the last long speech that one of the main characters gave to the son of his former lover. At the time, I was exhausted by the absurd, confused conspiracy of a dead lover, a marriage of convenience, and a nutty ex-lover. Sometimes the storyline changes to the families of the two main characters and then returns to one of them - either Ishmael or mainly Nora. To the detriment of the public, the views change again and again by Nora and Ismael, her former lover, who is locked up against his will in a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films here, none of which is well developed. The epilogue does not really include many of the dealings and seems to wish the viewer to believe that Nora will somehow be happy, although given their circumstances in real life, the chances of a snowball chance in hell are the same. The actors do their best and are appealing, but that's not enough to overcome all the glaring mistakes of bad writing, editing, and lack of focus.
