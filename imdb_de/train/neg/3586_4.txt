The autobiography of the zoo founder in NYC is very cute at first and would be a great family movie if he stayed there. However, we are becoming more and more involved in the reality as gorilla becomes a wild thing that is not easily accessible to the wishes of its "mother" - this could scare younger children, in particular. Scenes in which Buddy tries to hurt Gertrude. pretty fast solution in the end. below average.
