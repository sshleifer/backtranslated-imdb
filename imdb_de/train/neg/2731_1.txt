Really bad and easily the worst episode I've ever seen ... ever. <br /> <br /> They tried to make amends by giving the "we know we do this routine". That would have been funny if the "Simpsons" had not done it. And it would still not be good if they even had the idea. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks took place as part of the usual fantasies of the characters (mainly of J.D). The flashbacks were not even from actual events that took place, just compilations of J.Ds fall or I do not know ... Elliott's fall. If I wanted to see a scrubs compilation I would go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life. <br /> <br /> Scrubs finally fell into the trap that most sit-coms must have, and they disappointed I managed to go five and a quarter years without an episode like this one. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that Scrubs would not have to be some kind of sit-com. <br /> <br /> And just as a passing thought: why the hell was Dr. Cox bald?
