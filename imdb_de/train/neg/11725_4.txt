STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) hides on his ranch in Montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist. Then he is again approached by the agency to travel to London to try again. His target was arrested there and under heavy police protection - but they do not want him imprisoned - they want him taken out. Everything is going well, but then the mission is botched and when a chief police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance), is killed, Dial falls at fault. Hunted like an animal, he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett), who deals with her own affairs and becomes his ignorant buddy, while he erases his name and finds out, who betrayed him. <br /> <br /> This latest installment of Snipes direct on DVD came out of nowhere, with a minimum of advertising for even so little time (I can not remember having seen any ads or trailers anywhere.) And according to Snipes' story of Duff DVD aspirations, this could have been like one Snoop Dawg would tell you was hot. But I felt compelled to try anyway. It's not one of its worst, but it's no better than some of its better ones (The Detonator, 7 Seconds, says it all). <br /> <br /> At best, this is slightly exciting, with a minimum of action, all in the way of a cool dialogue and sniping not exactly in the lead role. Also, in a lead role, it's pretty clear that dance has just come out for salary review, and this is generally one that none of the performers in any of their resumes will cry out for the hills. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of talk about the fact that in the end, the only "contract" that interests you is when Snipes ends up at Sony and all the other DVD action movies. **
