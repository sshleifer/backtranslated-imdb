What a horrible movie. Again, rotten tomatoes have a good rating. Do not be fooled by the positive comments. It was not scary. That was not funny. It was not smart. It will not even attract your attention. I wasted only 2 hours of my life seeing this crap festival. The computer generated monster was interesting to see the first few times. After about 15 minutes it was no longer entertained. The dialogue was terrible, must be a translation thing. Another negative that struck was the idiotic Americans. 3 were portrayed and lacked in character, intelligence and judgment. Now I will write a few lines to fill this up as we need to have 10. The employees in the video store should have beaten me because I brought this title to the counter.
