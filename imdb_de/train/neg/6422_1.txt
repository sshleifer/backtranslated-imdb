"I watched this movie last night and do not think I'll ever think about the actors involved, because this movie stays in the back of my mind." <br /> <br /> The above statement can be considered as a good or a bad thing. I mean every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie, I think of "A Few Good Men," which is a good thing. Well, every time I see Ron Perlman and Kristy Swanson, I will think of "Tinseltown", which is a very bad thing. <br /> <br /> I've taken that and thought it at least could make me giggle and Arye Gross and Swanson and Perlman already mentioned I thought it at least was not bad maybe something intelligent or. You could say that the film with a budget of the size of Wheeling, Indiana was (Where exactly?) Made, but maybe they were using every dollar to make a good movie. NOT CORRECT. <br /> <br /> This movie is neither funny nor entertaining. It's just there and takes 84 agonizing slow minutes. <br /> <br /> The characters are paper thin. Interested almost NONE of the characters, and because the main characters are two Hollywood writer with a dream, all of which are two writers with a dream who wrote this dream, you need to know about them. Okay, the two REAL writers know everything about the screen versions of themselves, and they find that the audience does the same. They do not even think about character development except to try and tie their story to Gilligan's Island. <br /> <br /> The plot is not original. Two men live in a warehouse where one man is storing a bed, and there are about twenty other people living there. The rest of the story is unimaginative and stupid. Have you seen "National Lampoon's favorite deadly sins"? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a TV writer who can not find a good story for a TV movie, so he creates one. Now replace the screenwriter by the television writer, you can transform Mantegna in annoying actors who are half his age, and take the comedy gone, and you have this film. <br /> <br /> The actors are trying. Kristy Swanson is perhaps 10 minutes in the film and still delivers the best performance in the film. She is still hot, but it would help if she actually made a STAR in a movie instead of constantly doing CAMEOS. I do not think the actors were to blame because they have bad material. <br /> <br /> Watch National Lampoon's movie, but stay away from this movie.
