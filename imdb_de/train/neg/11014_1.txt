This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. That says a lot, considering some of the decisions I've made when renting movies. <br /> <br /> I received this on Netflix, based on the fact that someone I went to high school with is upstairs without. The topless scene lasted about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as pungee sticks under my toenails, while Roseanne had to hear Big Spender sing. <br /> <br /> The "skits" are stupid and consist of the worst kind of youthful bathroom - humor and dressing rooms, and it's such a blatant (and poor) rip-off of The Kentucky Fried Movie that you beg for it That Big Jim Slade rushes through the movie wall and save us from the stupidity of "Vince Offer" (whoever that is). <br /> <br /> If you're not a masochist, avoid this garbage heap.
