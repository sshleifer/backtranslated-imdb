"Raw Force" is like an ultra-left and perverse version of Love Boat, with additional Kung Fu battles, denied cannibalism monks, white slave trafficking, energetic zombies and a lot of lousy plays. No wonder this movie was included in the recently released "Grindhouse Experience 20 Movie Box Set". Anything fanatic seeks to fit into a completely incoherent and seemingly improvised script! The production values ​​are extremely poor and the technical aspects are pitiful, but the extent of violence and sex can hardly be described. The film opens in a tropical, sunny place called Warriors Island, where a group of taunting monks raise the dead for no apparent reason, unless they become Kung Fu fighters. The monks also buy sexy slaves from a shabby businessman who looks like Hitler, supposedly because the woman meat gives them the necessary strength to increase their zombie army. Tourists on a passing cruise ship, including three martial artists, an LA police officer and a whole host of gorgeous but gloomy ladies, are being attacked by the Hitler's thugs for planning a trip to Warriors Island. Their lifeboat washes the island anyway, and the monks challenge the survivors with their zombies for a combat test. Okay, how does that sound for a crazy midnight horror movie chaos? It's not over yet, as "Raw Force" also has piranhas, wild boat orgies, Cameron Mitchell in another embarrassing lead role, and 70-year-old exploit duchess Camille Keaton ("I spit on your grave") in a most insignificant performance. There are a lot of poorly recognized bleedings, including ax massacres and beheadings, hammer blows, and bad taste romance. The waste value of this movie will literally make you speechless. Of course, the background of the evil monks remains unclear and they are not even punished for their questionable hobbies. Maybe the movie ends with "To Be Continued" instead of "The End". The sequel never came, unless it's so dark that IMDb does not even list it.
