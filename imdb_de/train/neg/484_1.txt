I was disgusted about this movie. No, not because of the graphic sex scenes, but because Artemisia Gentileschi destroyed the image. This film does not contain much truth about her and her art. It shows a piece of art she made (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but shows that she was admitted as a testimony to the rape process when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you understood that from the movie, probably not. Tassi was not a noble character. He RAPED Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept false allegations of rape in order to prevent her from suffering during her torture. According to the rape records, he continued to claim that he had never known Artemisia while she kept saying, "It's true." <br /> <br /> I encourage you all to go out and find something out about the real Artemisia and find out what it is really about. Do not put all your knowledge on this fictional movie. I'd like to encourage you to investigate, Artemisia really has an interesting history behind it and some amazing artworks. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie, but experience the true story of Artemisia.
