Well, it's better for you to go through this amateurish, threadbare and pokey-colored movie about a widowed middle-aged mother who has something more in common with her young adult or older teen daughter than she wants. In Tunis, Mom plays around in the apartment, gets nervous and decides, albeit reluctantly (she just can not help herself), to put on the costume and dance in a local cabaret. Meanwhile, her daughter takes dancing lessons. The common denominator is a Tunisian drummer. This movie is so full of filler that I've seen the DVD at x2 and have read the subtitles, run fast through many of the ordinary dance and loooong footage of walking (they run everywhere) and even more running and just at x4 just to get around, just to get this boring, uneventful and inexpensive movie that was due to some pretty critical gossip. Imagine that. (C-)
