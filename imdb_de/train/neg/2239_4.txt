The plot has already been described by other reviewers, so I'd just like to add that the reason for the film was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undisputed splendor the sexiest, prettiest examples of posh totty dedicated to cellulite , Their era and their ilk come close only to the equally exquisite Jane Asher. What about actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who, like me, admired Gabrielle, their scenes in this movie will not disappoint. She has a great figure and none of this is left to the imagination. Overall, the movie is very poor and very cheap in its time. The song that covers the opening song seems to go on forever and is appalling.
