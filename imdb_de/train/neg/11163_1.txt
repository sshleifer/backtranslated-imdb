We loved School of Rock and Jack Black. We could not wait to see this movie. It was the only time in my life that the movie was so bad that I wanted to get out. My husband hated it too. The only funny parts were in the followers. My husband and I wanted to stand in front of the cinema and tell people to save their money. The writing was terrible. It had all the horrible stereotypes of Hispanics that should be absolutely offended. The movie was not that long, but it seemed like an eternity. The people in the theater were so restless and silent that it looked like the paint was going dry. I let my husband stay because I was sure there might have been some redeeming parts, but there were none. Save money and time.
