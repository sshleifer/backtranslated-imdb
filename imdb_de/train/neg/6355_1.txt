I could not wait to see this movie. About halfway through the movie, I could not wait for the movie to end. All (white) actors delivered their lines, as if Woody Allen had just said, "Say it like this ..." It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really speaks, and he does not stumble over his words like Mr. Allen. The comedy of this movie was just as boring as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining. I have to admit that I've never been a big fan of Woody Allen and this movie definitely did not convert me. I think his writing was as bad as his direction. This movie is considered one of the worst 10 movies I have ever seen.
