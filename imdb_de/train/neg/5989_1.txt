Wow, I paid Â£ 3.50 to see this movie in the cinema. Can not believe I wasted my time. Acting is worthy at best and the special effects are crude. Probably the worst script in history, some extremely embarrassing quotes I've ever heard in my life. I swear to god 'swept away' is better than that. Madonna should have won and Oscar compared with these guys. I want to go back one and a half hours of my life. Honestly, people do not see that, even a toddler would find this movie an insult to his intelligence. I found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to say who is more wood. Please do not waste your time with this movie you will live to regret it.
