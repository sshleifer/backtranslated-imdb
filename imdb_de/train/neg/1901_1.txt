This review may contain some spoilers. <br /> <br /> The remake of the classic 1974 hit chase movie "Gone in 60 Seconds" starts well. Actually, it is well played and the plot moves pretty well. But even a big Hollywood budget does not change the fact that the original plan was more credible. For those who do not know, the original conspiracy had used thieves as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect that? But even with a change to almost every aspect of H.B. Halickis Original, the remake is a very good movie, until we get to the final chase scene, the part of the 74 release that made it great. This version is watered down for only 10 minutes and culminates in a monster special effect that sets all credibility apart from the hunt. While the original chase was very believable, the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunts. The remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes. My tip, if you want to see a vintage car tracking movie, put the original in the bargain box at your local distributor and stay away from the new remake.
