The most embarrassing moment in this movie is when Brady Corbet says 'You have blossom' at the end of the movie. I practically died. I'm still not sure why the scriptwriters inserted that line there. Should it create romance? Because it almost made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I've never liked the original Thunderbirds before, but a Thunderbirds movie had the potential to do so much. This movie does not work. If it did not have the big draw card of the Thunderbirds brand, it would have gone straight to TV or post production. Maybe even before. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits slip up and they play Busted's song "Thunderbirds are go". I can not believe I wasted $ 7 on pay-per-view.
