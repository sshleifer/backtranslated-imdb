I have to say that I'm a huge romantic. So I really wanted to like this movie. So I write my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment I felt at the sight. The Leap Years tells the fateful story of Li-Ann, who falls in love with the polite Jeremy and pledges to meet each leap year. A very romantic premise, based on a great short story and a cast that does not feel like another Jack Neo movie. Why is it so bad? First, I believe the filmmakers believed they were making a music video because they chose to replace storytelling and all true emotions with cheesy montages, predictable actions, and stereotypes. I am both upset and ashamed when I was one of the first in Singapore to see The Leap Years, but those of us in the cinema would agree that our muffled groaning spoke volumes at the crisp performances. My hope was to see a romantic movie that surpassed Forever Fever, the best Singaporean romantic comedy yet, and did not even come close to The Leap Years. Some blogs called it The Crap Years, which is tough but ultimately true. Do not waste your money or your feelings like me. The movie lets you give up love forever.
