I'm an avid B-rate horror movie fanatic and have seen my lot of slasher imagery, so I have a considerable gauge to judge this movie. It is easily one of the best horror movies of the 80s. It's not as scary as Night of the Demons, it's not as bloody as re-animator and the camp value of There Nothing Out There is missing. That being said, this movie has no value. Remember that the movie artwork is for a completely different movie. The still images on the back of the DVD box are not taken from this film. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (Violence is great, but we've seen it all before.) A killer kills Nubile students and occasional members of the facility by slashing their necks and all the other tired methods of murder, to use the horror films). <br /> <br /> Nudity: None. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes - who cleverly changed her name to Forbes Riley after the film - who accepts a position as a lecturer at a university, people die and Forbes believes the killer is targeting her the libido-mad student? To be honest, it's impossible to care because the script has not worked out a character outside of Forbes. <br /> <br /> ACTING: $ (horrible at all levels.) This slasher has a school-production feel - a high school because college students could make a better movie than this one.Forbes, as well as Seminara, has a small talent talent as one of the students, but all others are of "extras" of acting.
