Laughed a lot - because it's so unbelievably bad - sorry people, but definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... I know it's a low budget, but still: The actors behave like soap The Dialogues are Absolutely crappy and the last time I saw such weird pictures was ten years ago at a youth video festival in a landfill. I really appreciate that people gather and make cheap movies, but at least some quality should be achieved. But at least a good thing: The first three minutes of the movie were quite interesting and looked okay - and the score was really worthwhile. The DVD cover has promised a lot, but that's by far the best this movie has to offer ...
