I can not say that Aag is the worst Bollywood movie ever shot because I did not see every Bollywood movie, but my imagination tells me it might be good. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be an artistic attempt to commit suicide on behalf of the director, and I'm convinced he was successful in his mission. No actor in the A-list outside of this film could share the same payroll as he does for all the humiliation this film has to carry. <br /> <br /> But let's not just blame the director, here's the cameraman who looks like he's rehearsing for the amateur home film maker of the year. There is the dramatic score that you want to carry to the next scene. The lighting man, who must have held a cigarette in one hand and a light bulb on the pole in the other, hoping that the flame that burned the cigarette would amplify the necessary light in every scene. And of course the actors! Some of them are by no means newcomers, otherwise everything could be forgiven here. The ensemble of actors in Aag has been put together to promote a new beginning and a new dimension in the reconstruction of India's most popular film "Sholay". One must not forget that these actors were not forced to this movie, they are an A-list and willing participants to something that, let's be honest, it would surely have had high and eager public expectations? So the question arises, Amitabh aside (for now), did the other actors really believe that their performances even tried to improve the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this vile disgust of a movie? Do not be stupid, of course not. This was a demonstration to the public of how much money talk actors can make to run. <br /> <br /> I really hope that all those involved are satisfied with what is real, a vulgar attempt to recreate a classic film that can only bring everyone to their senses when looking at the original.
