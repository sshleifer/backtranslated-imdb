This film blows - let's see that now. There are a few scene gems in this pile of crap, but no one can redeem the weak plan. Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and behaves similarly. I usually hate Colin because he's generally a fairy, but in this movie he's okay. There were two lines of action in this film - one about a kid flinging stones through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a mustache. Let's face it - this movie has no damn idea of ​​what he wanted to say or where he wanted to go. The storylines of the characters intertwine on several levels, but are by no means worthy to be included in a script. The whole thing is weak and meaningless and then there is occasionally an OK scene. But overall - Do not bother unless you love Irish accents so much that you can see mediocrity, and it will be saved if everyone sounds like the Lucky Charms Elf - an American fetish that has some really fucking movies catapulted to success.
