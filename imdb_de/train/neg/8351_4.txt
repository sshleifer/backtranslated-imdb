On average, even for monogram standards. This mystery (a remake of The Sphinx) has a weird plot that is not too much decoded - you'll see through it in about ten minutes. The two leads have some nice, airy dialogue at the beginning, but John Hamilton is hopelessly boring as the villain (perfectly staffed Lionel Atwill got the role) and Warren Hymers shit is pretty annoying. But for a five-minute appearance of the incomparable Mantan Moreland, it's worth noting that Nicodemus, the janitor, defeats the defender in a hilarious performance in the courtroom. You must pass it to Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; He was not a great director, but he would always beat up a routine programmer with a dumb Variety.
