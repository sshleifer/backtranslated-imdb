I appreciate the need to hire unknown people for this kind of 'horror' movie, but they should hire at least some real actors. The sergeant is particularly guilty of using his monotones to level every single line he has. But let's be honest, the lines are not really important. There is not really a recognizable action, so most of the writing includes the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and another bad language instead of the proper dialogue. <br /> <br /> The "story" as it is, consists mainly of seemingly random blood and death, with a few startling "surprises" that happen about 10 minutes after the target's appearance. Not only that, but there are several blatant storylines and continuity flaws (why go in there, did not he have a gun, was not he dead?), So the whole movie looks like it was the number of hours that were needed to repair it has been shortened. <br /> <br /> Another movie that simply relies on blood and blood instead of a real cinematic experience.
