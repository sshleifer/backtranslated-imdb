I watched this movie when it had 6 voices and it was 7.2 or so, but seriously, that's a horrible movie. Let's break it. The first thing you notice about this movie is that it was filmed on a digital handheld camera owned by a novice at a community college. The next thing you'll notice is that the actors are all friends of the said newcomer (he probably met them in the pub the night before, and the third thing on the list is that they're getting terrible and trying to stuff many songs into this movie at intervals of 30 seconds ... all the digital editing is done on the PC of the said freshman ... probably with Windows Movie Maker ... This movie was awful ... overbearing, had an undeniable bad script and did that too I would not recommend the movie to anyone I know, but I condemn the author and the director for watching this movie for an eternity in hell.
