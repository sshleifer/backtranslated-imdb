"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person and his rather bad life is pretty well documented. This movie, which pretends to portray its life, should have used a fictional character, because the overdramatized events deviate too much from the facts and the chronology. Not only that, it ignores some interesting details that other versions have included, such as the fiasco of public relations in North Y. and its religious conversion. It is true that he was by Luciano, Lansky et al. Was executed. al. but that is as far as it goes. The scene with exploding panels in which Luciano portrays the execution of Bo Weinberg in his own home with the support of his mother is ridiculous. There's also the scene where Dutch approaches his own mother to pay Leg's Diamond protection. It just does not work. The character of Mrs. Fleggenheimer does not work either. This movie does not need a spicy Jewish mother for the comic relief. The lame portrayal of Legs Diamond was humorous enough. I'm sure the man is turning in the grave. By the way, Dutch did indeed kill people personally, but he was not Rambo or 007. The scene in which he wipes out the brewery is absurd. I dont know. Maybe it should be a comedy and I just did not understand it.
