"Anything that could be a great documentary"? Yes, if you are deaf, dumb and blind. Everything but meaning, joke, visual style and interesting topic. Also. , , <br /> <br /> Seriously, folks. This is a movie that is completely unreal. An adventure document without adventure, a war document without war feeling, a camping arrest without joke. It means nothing, feels like nothing, and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters. No wonder it has so many IMDb fans! If you go in, you know that a movie with the great Skip Lipman has no culture, no intelligence, no joke (except for a caustic juvenile joke) and no recognizable human emotions. just adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! Avoid. There are too many real documentary films and too little time to waste on toilet lifts like "Darkon".
