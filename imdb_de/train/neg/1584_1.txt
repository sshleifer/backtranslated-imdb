I read the Running Man from Kings Books as Bachman and felt for the main character John and his family. This movie could have been so much more. Difficulties? It was filmed during the big action movie madness. I saw the movie and was in pain during the whole thing. I felt nothing for the character and less for his cause. Yes, it had funny scenes (or ridiculous), though I think it did not save the movie in my eyes. As you read the book, you can feel the pinnacle and fire in John's heart as he receives his last vengeance. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a low number. It might not have been so low if I had not read the book.
