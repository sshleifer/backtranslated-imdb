The Crater Lake Monster is without a doubt one of the most frightening, amateur films I've ever seen - with Manos, the hands of fate in terms of bad acting, useless directing and production levels at the kindergarten level. In this movie, a dumb looking, animated dinosaur dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum, California, and begins eating the local hayseed. In the thrilling climax, the creature, who is referred to by a local as "a giant alligator with fins," lumbers the lumbering crowd to chase their presumed lunch before a bulldozer kicks it a few times and dies of boredom. Every character in this movie is an idiot. A pointless subplot shows a hick going to a liquor store to buy 4.75 liters of ripple; Instead of just buying the bottle, the idiot shoots the cashier and another onlooker shoots a cop, gets chased to the lake, all to be eaten by the monster. Unlucky close-ups of the monster show that it is nothing more than a piece of polystyrene. There's a fake magician struggling with a fake British accent (to make him seem more legitimate), two overly limping Redneck boat tenants, a few kitschy "prehistoric cave art" made with crayon, and annoying background music. In a painful scene, the fake magician and his stupid wife / girlfriend / accomplice manage to extend the movie by another 4 minutes, pointing out how many stars the stars can see in the night sky, even though it's obviously still daytime. Even with constant forward this moovie hurts and hurts. MooCow says the smokers call, because this cow pie really stinks! : = 8P
