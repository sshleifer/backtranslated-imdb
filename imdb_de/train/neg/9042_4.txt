I wanted to like this movie. But it falls apart in the middle. The whole premise is good and binds well, but the middle is tangent. The people I was watching got annoyed when it went off course and hoped it would end sooner. Another person actually fell asleep in the middle segment! During the Schtick parts, which had nothing to do with the plot, I dreamed in other places. I bought it for eye candy and it delivered so well, but it lacks Pixar's writing and soul. I think children under the age of 8 will enjoy the ride on Face vaule while they miss the action. People old enough to follow a plot will find miracles to return quickly and easily. Edit most of the middle section, make 50 minutes, and it would be a solid strip. I wish I had better things to say. But not me
