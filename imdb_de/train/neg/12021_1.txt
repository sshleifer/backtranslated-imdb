That may be a bit tough for me if I say that, but unfortunately it is true in his career as a director. Just look at what he has done so far. They barely get beyond the 3-star mark. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this film, her performance carries the entire movie. I hope she gets a "blockbuster" and breaks into the big league of actors, she clearly has the skills. Greg was not that impressive, a typical TV style. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the film is classified as horror. The only "horror" are short flashbacks, and they last a maximum of 2 to 5 seconds with some blood inside. Personally, I would call that a drama / thriller. <br /> <br /> But no matter how interesting the story is, bad directing, editing and acting (by Lucy) are destroying them. You do not really get in touch with the actors, which is very important in a story like this. You just sit there watching nothing. It's like watching a bad TV soap ... actually, I think the TV soap would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: Stay away from this movie ... or better, just stay away from everything Michael is Hurst is with you.
