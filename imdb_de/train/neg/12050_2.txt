I read some positive reviews about this movie and was really surprised at how awful the whole thing was. The film is a mixture of an AIDS-related story and a kind of "Ghost" / "Blithe Spirit" story. He can not always decide what he wants. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a gay couple with an "open" relationship - Simon can have anonymous (but safe) sex next to him if he wants. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon do not seem to have sex anymore. When Mark dies, Simon - who has been rejecting his father for years - tries to suppress his feelings - to erase his memory and become only a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was very different. But Mark returns in a ghostly form and thwarts his various trysts as he gets Simon to open up and admit his true feelings. Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish SOB for whom he can not feel empathy. Most of the movie. By the time he is more sympathetic, it's too late to take care of it. On the other hand, Mark Demi Moore follows traces of "Ghost" by crying violently throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a bizarre sound change after Mark returns. Suddenly we get some lame attempts of humor, like the TV program "Bewitched". But that does not take long. As soon as Simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes more and more moody, with amateurish attempts to rip your heart. The finale, with a gilded muscle-boy angel leading a crying marrow into the sky, while the shy, mourning Simon waving goodbye, is startling, mainly because it's not intentionally funny.
