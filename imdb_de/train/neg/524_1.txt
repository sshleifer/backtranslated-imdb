"The 40-year-old maiden" exists in a world that I do not understand. A world in which an electronics specialist can tell his boss he should be "stupid" and send videos of his bare ass all over the store and not be reprimanded. A world in which it is really funny to drive drunk and smash into the cars of other people. A world in which it seems alright for a boss to sexually harass their subordinates. A world of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without funny jokes! I am absolutely shocked by the apparent chorus of viewers who liked this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not very funny at first and extending beyond all rational thought. The scene with the growth of the breast went on forever. <br /> <br /> Apart from Carell, the characters were totally a touch. And the romantic elements were well thought out, especially the scene where Keener finds porn in Carell's apartment. That was just lame. <br /> <br /> And I found the sequence "Aquarius" totally annoying and exaggerated. I hated this movie hated!
