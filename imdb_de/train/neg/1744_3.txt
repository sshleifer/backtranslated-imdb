I saw the 1985 Malayalam movie "Boeing Boeing" (which was probably inspired by an English movie of the same name) a long time ago. The basic story of Garam Masala is the same - but it is pathetically told that the classy jokes are replaced by routine jokes found in normal Hindi films (the director probably adjusted that to the taste of the Hindi audience ) ... <br /> <br /> I have not seen the English original. But the Malayalam film (made by Priyadarshan himself), which at the time was an uncompromising comedy, was really fun. Of course, the show of Mohanlal, Mukesh, and Sukumari (who took on the role of chef) was so natural and spontaneous. <br /> <br /> I'm probably too excited about the Malayalam movie that I can not tolerate even the minor mistakes of being a Hindi remake. But I still have the feeling that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have overreacted. Paresh Rawal has done a good job - but not close to Sukumari. <br /> <br /> But all in all, it's OK to compare it to other recent Hindi comedy films.
