Unlike Endemol USA's two other recent game shows (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs. 100), the pace on this show is far too slow for what is happening on screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 vs. 100 can get away with slow steps as the games can always change or end the tempo. Any action the player performs carries risks, the rewards vary greatly, and it is difficult for players to leave with a significant amount of money. Suspense is usually used well. <br /> <br /> Show Me The Money, on the other hand, is too slow. When a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can be sure that nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes. It would greatly help the tempo of this show to reveal the correct answer FIRST, and THEN the player has to pick a dancer instead of losing time and talking about what happens if the player gets the wrong answer, if we all know that they are right. Random dance is a filler that actually feels like a filler. Too much time is wasted while not enough happens ... and the fact that players can not finish the game prematurely guarantees that much time is wasted. Oh, and I have no interest in seeing Shat shake his groove thang, especially after I've had dinner. <br /> <br /> I'm a lifelong game show fan, but even I was struggling to sit for an hour. It requires either major changes or early retirement.
