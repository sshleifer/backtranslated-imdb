Sheesh! What a horrible movie. Dodgy camera work, a script with more corn than kelloggs and clucking so you could open a pig farm with it. <br /> <br /> To tell the story, it does not know which audience it is - we have Cornel Wilde - or is it Corny Wilde? - go into his soapbox about the dangers of smoking, when someone lights a cigarette, my dear, and in another unpleasant scene we have the evil Lobo, who forces his um, if you like, "male friend" to striptease in the Bikini. Tell the kids this ... <br /> <br /> Take an overly fictional action of the type Treasure Island-cum-Jaws, and the result is a movie that's so funny that it's so funny - me should not expect a Special Edition DVD, however, soon.
