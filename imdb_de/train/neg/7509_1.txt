"Why?" <br /> <br /> This simple question had to come into the mouth of every New Yorker in the 12 months of horror that David Berkowitz created in 1976-77. The same word will surely become the same startling question later in the summer, when people leave the theater and show the banal and exploitative "Summer of Sam". <br /> <br /> Director Spike Lee is trying to weave the story of a misleading set of criminals in search of the famous psychopath who has paralyzed New York City for over a year - with a clear and graphic depiction of the killings, the Demons in Berkowitz 'head and the frustration of a futile NYPD manhunt. He presents an ensemble of despicable losers who hear their own "barking dogs" while living a life devoid of love, honor and humanity - unlike Berkowitz. Lee buzzes the audience in almost every scene with, "None of us is as we seem". Lee is often a white establishment critic and perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene in which Mira Sorvino, who plays with a cheating husband with a cheating husband (John Leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man in the back of a big black Cadillac An Italian mafioso tells a black detective that the midfield catch of the famous Willie Mays was "lucky." Lee even makes sure that he recites the racist thoughts of a middle aged black woman who declares, "I'm glad that it is a white man who kills all these whites, because if a black man killed all these whites, the biggest race would be turmoil in NYC history. "<br /> <br /> Aside from a superb opening reception of a disco (reminiscent of recordings of Martin Scorcese's" Goodfellas "or Orson Welle's" The Third Man "), this film has no soul, no meaning and no He shows characters on screen without human decency, and although we do not know anything about the true victims of this horrible spree, Spike Lee seems to say that New York City earned what it deserves during that fearsome, boiling summer over two decades ago <br /> <br /> "How can anyone harm such devastation in his beloved city? "How could anyone show such hatred for his fellow man?" <br /> <br /> Are these the right questions for Berkowitz or Lee? <br /> <br /> You decide.
