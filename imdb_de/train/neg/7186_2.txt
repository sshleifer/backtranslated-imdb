I'm sorry for all fans, but this is a useless movie. Acting is bad, even if it is made of wood, it outstrips early the fright factor and does not work exactly. I think there should be a turn in the end, but it ended up being irritatingly confusing. What the hell? The guy who killed everyone was one of the hunted? Try again. <br /> <br /> It's hardly original and not as well suited as a straight slasher. And that says something. <br /> <br /> I think, who made the castings, who wrote the script and who ever thought of the concept should be mercilessly shot down and deported this movie. If someone does this at a party, throw the disc out the window and make a good horror movie, such as Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
