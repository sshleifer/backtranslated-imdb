This is a film that seeks to retell Thai history in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it inspired a lot of Thai films that I saw and enjoyed, and where Thai actors speak Thai and martial arts crazy. Well, that's none of it. This movie is completely shot in English, is full of anglo-actors and has such terrible production values ​​that it is ridiculously bad .... but not funny! Who can we blame for this garbage? The drama, dialogue and most sets were pretty bad. Some of the fight scenes looked like they were being choreographed by the local high school drama club. The special effects were also mostly bad, but some were just cheap animations that were patched on the screen and provided a particularly cheesy effect. There's a big, epic outdoor fight scene where a few thousand extras in costumes walk across a field, but when we see the two armies clashing in combat - HA! What a joke! The movie shows some beauties. What a pity that they did not show any more skin. At least that would have appreciated the guys. Do not bother.
