I remember seeing this movie in 86 'when it first came out and what a horrible movie. The acting was cruel, the conspiracy was so weak that she should have flown away in a breeze. I think it has brought me to sleep more than once and I was not tired of what I remember. Please avoid at any cost that all your teeth are taken out without any narcotic effort, which would be more entertaining. It's just a pity that I could not rate it zero or negative. I wish I had not wasted my money on the video library, all I could say was that the tape on which it was was still brand new. It was hardly surprising as the movie was so bad. If I remember correctly, I sat and saw it with a girl I wanted to go out with. The fact that she was sitting next to me still was not enough to keep me awake. So bad was this movie.
