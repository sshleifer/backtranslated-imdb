Nobody should ever try to customize a Tom Robbins book for the screen. While the movie is alright and the performances are good, the dialogue that works well when spoken is crap when it's spoken. In other words, no one would probably suggest listening to someone else's name as if they were written on a pearl in Radium. Notes to the book: Most of the parts have been reduced to a fifth of their size in terms of background history and current history chopped off the book, and the ending is very different (and unpleasant) from the book. Most of the actions in the book have been lost, including the one that makes everything meaningful in the end, and there is more than one reference that makes sense in the book, and the viewer says, "Huh?" Unfortunately not a worthwhile effort - the script should have been read, compared to the book, to be burned, and all actors should be sent away to do something much better. I greatly admire Gus Van Sant, but not even anyone of his caliber could have made a decent movie out of such a complex book without doing a miniseries.
