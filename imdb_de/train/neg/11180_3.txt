The only good thing about "People I Know" is that it is a perfect example of films in which Al Pacino should not play. The first big twist I had was the way Pacino tried to portray a Georgia accent. Sometimes it was weak and unattractive, while in other segments it seemed too exaggerated. Dialogue and character interaction were terrible, along with a faint plot. The minor cast has perfected the movie and kept the movie interesting, and within an hour I still saw no sign of solid action. The story is a total boredom, and I had to hit my face a few times to stay awake. <br /> <br /> This movie will surely bore you ... at all costs.
