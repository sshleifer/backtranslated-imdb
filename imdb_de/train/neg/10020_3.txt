Vijay Krishna Acharya's "Tashan" is an over-emphasized, stylized product. Sure, it's one of the most stylish movies, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this movie. Why? The film's script is an amateur like a 2-year-old baby. Screenplay is king, without a good script even the best director of all time can do nothing. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner "Yash Raj Films" and by Mega Stars. But nothing in the world can save you if your script is bland. Thumbs down! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor is an experienced actor. But how could he fix such a role? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact he is the only saving grace. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks gorgeous and lets you all get up. Saif Ali Khan is not due here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. 'Tashan' is a boring movie. The film fails at the box office, you should stay away.
