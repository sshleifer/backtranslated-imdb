Stilted, stagy, strange and opaque, if visually striking ... a would-be erotic fantasy. Really boring, far too much male nudity (including father-son incest) and just a kind of shameless futility. However, I must confess that certain passages of dialogue taken on their own terms have a lulling, insistent quality.
