I rented this DVD after seeing it in search of something else. When I saw the title on the jacket, I could not believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book about a year ago and I really liked it. I even admire Yalom's work in general. (I'm a clinical psychologist.) I may have seen 30 minutes of this movie and had to turn it off. I am not sure if I can take much more. At the superficial level, the wrong accents, as others have commented, are simply distracting at best and irritating and in the worst case vapid. The drama is boring when it should be passionate and funny, if it should be serious. The portrayal of Lou Salome is plain and simple, and the brilliant Freud is nothing more than a student. I see very little of the spirit of the book that has been taught so far. I was hoping to recommend this film to my students. I'll refer you to the book instead. Imagine.
