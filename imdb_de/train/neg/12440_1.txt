This is the worst brain-damaged, ultra-cheap, super-stupid, stupid, meaningless garbage I've ever seen, an incredible trash instant cult status among fans of the bizarre. If you think that Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... Let me tell you, looks like "Citizen Kane" compared to this one. Â¿Special effects? ... again "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it's really bad. But if you are looking for unbelievable movies, then this is for you! I'm a fan of American International for so many glorious horror movies, the Price Corman Poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff, but with "Star Creatures" they drop to Z level. Of course, my 1 in 10 works in reverse order if you want to watch bad movies for fun (the guy playing an Indian chief is great). So have fun and enjoy ... if you can.
