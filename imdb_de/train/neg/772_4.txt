This movie is not as good as any of Christ's films I've ever seen. And I am quite astonished that Pilate in this story wants to end Jesus if Scripture (as well as the other films) says otherwise. It also lacks a very important topic: the resurrection. In none of the other films is this very important part skipped: the faith of all of us Christians lies in this event. As Paul says in one of his letters, "If Christ is not raised from the dead, our faith is in vain." A very impressive scene in this film was for me to see the remains of the palm trees used on the streets when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jesus was NOT a myth against my Jewish co-commentator. And indeed, he was also a JEW. There are many documents (religious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or should I say that God becomes a man) that has actually changed humanity. I strongly advise him to read by Flavius ​​Josephus, the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st, because he is a historian. Century.
