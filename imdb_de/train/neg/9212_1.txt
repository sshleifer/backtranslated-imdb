The only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is. With an action that makes an average middle school writer look good, and acting almost equally well, it gets my lowest score. One of Tom has very early films in which he did not seem to have the pleasure of being picky. The best special effect of the movie is a man in an incredibly fake rubber monster costume.
