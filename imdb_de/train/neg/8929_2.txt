Adapted from a Gore Vidal novel (actually one of the great American authors), the Hodge-Podge makes THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN and VALLEY OF THE DOLLS look like Fellini artworks. Raquel Welch, with an incredible figure (and she's actually not very tall) in a lead role (with the exception of KANSAS CITY BOMBER when she was pretty good), played Rex Reeds (a bad movie critic, not a critic), an alter ego just surrounded by Drag Queen (great chick) Mae West, the horny John Huston, a young and "naive" Farrah Fawcett (Pre-Lee majors, what a shame), and other various Schleich azoids who pretend to be they have nothing for them to split apart old movie clips (ie Widmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne) ... ONLY so that they can continue to bleed the lives of everyone. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10. Best performance = ?. It's so bad, it's worth it to see!
