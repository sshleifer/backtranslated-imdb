I recently looked at Grendel and am compelled to put together a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> Grendel is another version of Beowulf, the thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic. The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of harmless and uninteresting movies, and the previews promised a fake low-budget mini-epic, but this one did not let me change channels. It was amazing, overwhelming, bad. I watched fascinated and horrified the train wreck, from which you could not tear your eyes. I reached for a notebook and could capture a part of what I saw. The following information may contain spoilers or only save your mind. You were warned. <br /> <br /> - Just to make it happen, Beowulf's warriors wore horned helmets. Trivial problem compared to what came afterwards. It also seems that the helmets were in a garbage can and passed on to the passing actors. Fit, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> - Marina Sirtis had apparently been blackmailed into making the film of the Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey. She managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns had already done the rest of their make-up. <br/> <br /> - Ben Cross pretended not to be embarrassed as a king. His character, Hrothgar, must have become King of the Danes just minutes before the movie opens, and he has not yet had a chance to scale the crown. <br /> <br /> - To facilitate the return of the actors No tables were waiting at their daily workplaces to even change their hairstyles. The variety of hair included cornrows, sideburns, Buzz cuts and a mullet and served at least the distraction of dialogue. To prove that this was a multinational occupation, they were all asked to keep their chosen accent. <br /> <br /> - As is usual with this type of movie (at least since Mad Max), leather armor was a requirement. In this case, it was strange, badly fitting and brand new. <br /> <br /> - The female love interest Ingrid, played by Alexis Peters, followed a long-standing tradition of hot women watching The volume was turned down completely. <br /> <br /> - The unintentional focus of the film was a repetitive, compound crossbow with exploding bolts. It never had to be loaded and even had a recoil on firing. He succeeded in destroying the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, the historical fact and the conspiracy of history all by itself. <br /> <br /> - Hrothgar's palace, Heorot, was apparently designed rather as a Nordic long hall and built by craftsmen who drowned with Atlantis. <br /> <br /> - Beowulf arrived in a two-masted, star-studded ship that was originally part of a set, home to the Danes, the two were the Santa Maria and the Pinta. <br /> <br /> - Prince Unferth observed the approach of Beowulf with a telescope. Before you could recover from this amazing innovation, you had to see the ship from his perspective. From the point of view, the prince was in an airplane. <br /> <br /> - Interesting Fact 1: In Bulgaria, fire (as in a fireplace) creates light without heat. This explains why you could see the breath of the actors, whether inside or outside. <br /> <br /> - Interesting Fact 2: Dark Age Dancing in Denmark looks like slow dances I've attended in 8th grade. <br /> <br /> - Fun fact 3: You too can make a catapult with a timed release shotgun. But do not expect it to hurt anything. Incidentally, Beowulf was apparently a veteran of World War II and shouted "Incoming!" to destroy all remaining suspensions of unbelief. <br /> <br /> - Grendel was so excited and always in the nose because he could not leave a footprint as CGI creation. Even in the snow. <br /> <br /> - Grendel's mother ("Hag") was in a bad mood because she was a single mother and the junior had not inherited her wings. A recessive gene, I suppose. Incidentally, we can now make a well-founded guess that Grendel's pop was probably Swamp Thing. <br /> <br /> - Grendel and her mother chose to accidentally kill their prey, fly or take their prey, just by reading the next few pages of the script. <br /> <br /> - Interesting medical fact: When a nasty animal is struck hard enough by a mythical animal to be thrown fifty meters at a stone, there are slight scratches on its face that do not bleed much. <br /> <br /> - The Legend's Sword, with which Beowulf sent the Hag, was as long as he was tall and had enough steel to put a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge. Fortunately, the wobbiness dispelled all concerns about its weight. <br /> <br /> - Best line of the movie: Prince Unferth had just been impaled by Hag and spat half a meter of blood. Princess Ingrid cradled him gently and said, "Everything will be fine, my prince." So much for this job in the triage clinic. <br /> <br /> I feel better now.
