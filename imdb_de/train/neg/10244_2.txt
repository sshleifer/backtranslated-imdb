I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and give my word. There was nothing very precise about the character played by Michael J. Fox # 1. # 2 If I ever let anyone use a room for an afternoon delight, I would be fired immediately! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very clear ethical and ethical behaviors that we take seriously. # 3 Similarly unreal was the concept that at the end of the film, Doug simply removed his golden key emblem and passed it on to another co-worker. We deserve these keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge that you are allowed to wear. There is a whole application and review process to join our organization. <br /> <br /> This movie does nothing to destroy the unfavorable perception of a concierge as nothing more than a money-hungry mercenary. In short, it's a disadvantage for our organization. I am happy about comments.
