The TV Guide described the plot of SEVERED TIES as follows: "An experiment with a severed arm goes awry." So I immediately thought it was an arm that has its own head, as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS or THE HAND or someone who gets an arm transplant, as in BODY PARTS. Both premisses have been tested, more precisely, tired and tested, so I was curious to see how the producers approached the story. I actually thought that they were shooting an arthouse movie like PI, which was made at the beginning of the movie with B & W photography, but the makers seemed to have had enough of that approach after 20 seconds and decided to do a splatter comedy similar to To make THE EVIL DEAD. I can not say much, except that I did not like THE EVIL DEAD movies and did not like SEVERED TIES. It's really unfair that movies like this one use an obscene amount of gum when the third world screams for condoms
