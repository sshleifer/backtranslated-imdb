Can someone make good CGI movies besides Pixar? I mean, the animation looked like 2006 standards and even after 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they spent their entire budget on Hugh Jackman. Whatever their reasoning is, history really shit. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat being flushed into a toilet. Yes, I know, it seems stereotypical. Then the sewer mimicked the ways of London - to a degree. Make a promise to jewels (????) and a bad (?) Frog and you get a pathetic attempt of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I want to say something that entertains me. Maybe the connection in the movie? Or maybe the happy relationship with rats. But nothing did. It had the talent, but it blew up. D-
