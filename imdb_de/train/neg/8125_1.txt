"The Bat People" is a really bad movie that deserves MST3K treatment just like the other movie "The Creeping Terror". Therein we find ourselves in a kind of mountainous terrain full of bats. We see a lot of things happen, like bats flying and attacking and so on, station wagon chases, emergency room mishaps and more! All this plus the cheesy mediocrity of the 70s (hey, "Mitchell" here!) Makes "The Bat People" one of the best of the last "Mystery Science Theater 3000" episodes of the series! Moviewise, it's terrible. It should be avoided like the plague, unless Tom Servo and Crow are looking with you. <br /> <br /> "The Bat People" - more like "The Bad People !!!!!" LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
