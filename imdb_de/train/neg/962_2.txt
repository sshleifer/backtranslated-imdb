If I look at it again, it could be that I get physically ill. The movie is so annoying ... unless you believe in psychology, reincarnation, and the other hocus-pocus that this promotes enormously. They call it the "recycling of souls" here. Puh-leeze. <br /> <br /> This story has been shot several times with films like "Heaven Can Wait". It was also much better. Too bad she was wasting the talents of Robert Downey, Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. <br /> <br /> At least it's a pretty tame film, linguistically speaking. That's about the only quality of redemption for this movie.
