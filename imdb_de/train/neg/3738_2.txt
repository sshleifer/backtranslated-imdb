That's how the title should be. <br /> <br /> This movie combines weapons, explosives, and thoughtless killing to make an action movie flop. Let me comment on a series of questions: Answers give a deal. <br /> <br /> What happens in the movie? People die. <br /> <br /> Is that it? Yes. <br /> <br /> What is the plot about? What action? <br /> <br /> What's the point of the movie? Killing is the only solution. <br /> <br /> What are the characters? Extremely flawed and contradictory to her own personality. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some beautiful Panavision cameras for filming. <br /> <br /> If you want constant murder and greed, watch the movie. If you are repulsed by such a low level of "entertainment", "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, the action stinks, the characters are not worth it. The story is absolutely resilient and nothing fits together. <br /> <br /> This proves one thing: the actors, directors and whoever contributed to this film is certainly not "Made".
