This is not one of those reviews of bad special effects or technologies or obsolete that only the stupidest people could relate to, but rather a look back at the storytelling that most of us are really interested in. <Br /> <br /> The plot is about a combination of members of the WWII Allies and the German Navy as well as two civilians (hero and heroine) who are pushed together on a German submarine and land in a wild dinosaur land /> <br /> The manipulations are not so bad for movie standards, and we know from the plot that realism will not be high. What films like this need are believable and likable characters, along with some sense in the actions. <br /> <br /> Both are missing in this film. For a full-length movie, only 6 characters are given at any given time, and 3 of them are barely studied. McClure's hero is no longer "routine" and does not make sense in any era. <br /> <br /> The female seems to be looking for an answer to a puzzle about the land of the dinosaurs that she has entered, but the puzzle is not much of a puzzle, and we might be less interested. <br /> <br /> Much failure in a movie that should have been even better for his time.
