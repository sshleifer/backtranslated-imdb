I will not mention anything about the plot, because although it would be very predictable anyway, the one noteworthy plot reversal is given away everywhere, in the movie commentaries, in the storyline, and even in the overview on my Netflix cover. I might have enjoyed it more if I did not know that. Could be. This film has a deceptively good cast, most of which were credible with the more limited material they were dealing with, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts. It was impossible to like William McNamara, but that was clearly intentional. And there were some quick nude scenes by Callipygian Lenore Zann. None of this, however, brings the slightest recommendation from me. Does not one of these good actors actually read these scripts before signing up?
