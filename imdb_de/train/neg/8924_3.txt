It was a disappointment to see this DVD after so many years. For me the main problem is the uneven script. <br /> <br /> Although it's funny and hip, it's rather boring, unsteady and lifeless. Many of the jokes just sit there without sparks and energy. <br /> <br /> The performers are well received by Mae West and Rachel Welch. Roger Herren in the role of Rusty shines (too bad he did not shoot any more films). But for my money there is just too much of John Huston, and poor Rex Reed has little chance of fighting. His character seems to be confused to walk around the sidelines and wonder what he's doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The low user rating should give some idea of ​​the public opinion of this piece. Vidal's original offered a lot of potential that was pretty much wasted. Not even the "classic" movie clips have done much. All in all a rather under-average effort, and it probably will not get much better over time.
