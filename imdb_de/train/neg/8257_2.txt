"A Gentleman's Game" uses the game of golf in a country club environment to illustrate a teenager's discovery of honesty, prejudice and other life lessons. I thought several times, I know where this movie would lead, just to prove me wrong. Unfortunately, I am not so sure that the filmmakers knew where to go. The defining moment in this film is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise mocks "The Karate Kid" and exposes any idea that he will be a mentor to the youthful golfer. In a sense, it is refreshing that this film does not follow most of the simplified and revised film formulas. But too much is still going on. In the blink of an eye, human beings drop all courtesy claims or do not care for the things they believe in, or are exposed to something far less reputable than their place in society. Unfortunately, there are often no solutions for these moments. And apart from the fact that the club serves as their background, there is no real continuity or link between them. It's a shame that writer and director could not save a better movie, especially given some talented actors and the potential in the setup.
