The storyline of 'House of Games' is the strongest: a successful author and psychologist is cheated by a gang of crooks, but when she discovers the evil part of herself that has the thrill of what she's doing, she takes revenge after all . It's about the playing field, but somebody has to take responsibility for being a puppet. It must be the director Mamet: Lindsay Crouse had a varied and fairly stable television and film career, so they can not always occur so badly. She's supposed to go from a sexy, cool, controlled professional woman to a calculating, nasty, fast lady who enjoys the change from a beige pants suit (which she seems to wear, including underwear, to three days) to a flabby flower Summer dress leads. But everyone seems to speak his lines in the same precise and precise way; I can imagine that Mamet wanted to make sure that not one syllable of his dazzling script was overlooked. The effect is disturbing and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and tension that he is likely to attempt. Sometimes 'House of Games' loses any connection to how people actually behave or speak, and only becomes a mechanism to wipe out the plot. The chunky Vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack does not help either. The bottom line is that the only entertainment is to guess the result, and the sooner you do that, the more likely you'll get bored of the two-dimensional robotics performances. And they smoke too much !!!
