Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation? <br /> <br /> There are some amazing actors (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but they are clearly improving their money. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert performed in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks appropriately embarrassed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see a "watchable" adaptation of Cartland, the Bonham Carter One is the one to choose ("A Hazard of Hearts" - what a title !!) Gilbert is the weak link, but Bonham Carter is appropriately beautiful and of course can act, and the rest of the cast plays it with the tongues in his cheeks (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg).
