I really liked this show once. That is, until I have recognized all the mistakes in it. It is so unrealistic. I know it's a fiction, but it's not the least believable. Here is the reason. ** Spoiler in front of the people ... ** Should one really believe that a child like Yugi would descend from a pharaoh in ancient Egypt? Come on! He is the biggest nerd on earth. And what's wrong with the hair of Pharaoh (a.k.a. Atem and / or Yami's)? Lastly, I checked that the pharaohs were shaved (except for a few hairs on the head) and wore fancy hats. <br /> <br /> And we're supposed to be convinced that a bad, wealthy kid, Genius called Seto Kaiba, can legally run a successful business while he still has time, in a modest little school like "Domino High "to go? Puh-Lee! First, he would have to be legally grown up to run a business. And that would not really make him a boy genius too much, since he would be the only adult in his class. And secondly, why should he attend a school like Domino High if his business is clearly successful enough to attend a chic snobbish academy? Besides, the subplots with his little brother are so juicy and lame. Every time you turn around, the kid was kidnapped by idiots for evil. * Yawn * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is the poor kid living with a useless dad. It says that Joey earns all the money to attend school because his father is an alcoholic, but you never see Joey doing anything resembling work. He does not even mention the work. And his sister Serenity is an idiot. Why would she choose a snob like Duke (who dressed her brother in a dog costume and demeaned him publicly on television) to a nice guy like Tristan? Is she really so unaware? Various characters on the show are seized by demonic forces, their souls are stolen by demonic forces and fall prey to a mental illness. (Oh, that's kidproof, NOT.) Tea is the typical woman next door whose sole purpose is to be Yugi / Yami's girlfriend. And while she has some cool points, she simply does not have enough time to shine as the main character. <br /> <br /> The animation is just awful. All characters look sick and anorexic. The perspectives are terrible (especially if you take close-ups of someone's hand) and the colors look good, but not outstanding. <br /> <br /> But the worst action hole in the series was the fact that Yami says Millennium Puzzle can send souls back into their bodies. If so, why did not he save Yugi's grandfather when Pegasus stole his soul and spared the effort to get it back? <br /> <br /> All it really is is a commercial one for itself. The only plus is "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series" by LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please. Make something more valuable. For example, take a look at the shortened version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
