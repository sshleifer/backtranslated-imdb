By all accounts, this could be an interesting movie. With a score from the mighty Cradle Of Filth, with their frontman Dani and hyped up as "the future of British horror," I expected Alex Chandon's Gore Fest to grow to hype. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is either cliché or inappropriate. The construction of the short story was done to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. Granted, the idea of ​​'the sick room' was a shame on my back, but like most films, it was disappointed by poor script writing and acting. Chandon can not write a dialogue. Every sentence with the Chief Inspector of Police is brimming with curses and insolence (the typical "Cop on the Edge" formula, weird, I'm sure I've seen it somewhere else ...) No, Chandon, you're not Tarantino. Or scorsese. It sounds bad. Add ridiculously to OTT, who is acting with very dodgy casting (do not get me wrong, Dani Filth is a great vocalist and musician, but he is not an actor), and the performances are pathetic for the vein contracting agonizingly. Give me Bruce Campbell every day. <br /> <br /> The overall visual effects are poor, with a few gruesome CGI effects and terrible gore effects (for God's sake, Peter Jackson felt better, and that was less budget over ten years ago) and editing filters, screaming at TRANSFER! As for the often misaligned use of Cradle Of Filth's score ... man, they should sue. <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously and tries to build up atmosphere and provoke terror and incitement within the audience. Too many good horror films from the seventies and eighties do much better with better gore effects (eg, maniac, zombie-meat-eater, afterlife, suspiria, etc.), making Cradle of Fear secondary in my mind. <br /> <br /> I hope Chandon can learn from this horrible ghoul of a movie and then make some quality horror that really scares. <br /> <br /> Good luck next time.
