- Bad stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake that I thought this was "The Twilight Zone". The flashbacks are pretty useless. Part of the movie he thinks he's feeling better about when he pulls his anger out the window. I want to get to know the casting director and if he was high because acting was disgusting even by adults. A kissing scene in this movie was even shit. This movie killed the book. The book was great. I highly recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good Stuff: I do not know what I can really say. There are some exciting parts to get you started, but they are quickly shot down by bad stunt work and acting. <br /> <br /> - My verdict: Do not pay attention.
