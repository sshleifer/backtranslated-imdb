With such films you know that you will get the usual jokes about ghosts. Eve as a ghost is pretty funny. And the other actors do a good job as well. It is the direction and the story that is missing. That could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better. The only problem is that there are not many jokes. Sure, I laughed a few times. Apart from the talking parrot, there was not much creativity in the film. I blame the director who does not use the premise to its full potential. Eva certainly has the comic ability to show more, but she did not get a chance. Overall, this movie is perfect for a Sunday afternoon. Otherwise it can be completely skipped.
