I have two very big complaints about this movie. <br /> <br /> 1. That my local distributor has saved a very hefty porn in the suspense category. (If I had known what it was, I would not have hired my time, and yes, this movie is a softcore porn.) <br /> <br /> 2. The title has nothing to do with the movie. No one in this film does anything that is deviant or obsessive, let alone a combination of the two. <br /> <br /> Actually, these three main complaints are that for some reason I've seen the movie long enough to discover the second item on this list. Boy, I regret it. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake. This movie is worthless in virtually every way.
