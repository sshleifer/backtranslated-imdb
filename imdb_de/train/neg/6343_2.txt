Maybe I'm not a cultivated one. This and Closer are two of the supposedly more cerebral films I've seen lately, and both suffer from a torturous amount of exactly the same problem. The dialogue is wrong wrong wrong. Nothing that comes out of the mouth of a human seems to be credible from a distance. Maybe the way this movie is set up is how it should feel, but it was hard to beat. And boring. I left after 20 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I stay with Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen fix. When I encounter this on the Teevee, I'll turn around and try to find an episode of Quincy instead.
