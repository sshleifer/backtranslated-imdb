Whoever wrote the two or three glowing reviews was either involved in creating this movie, the term was used loosely or the bankroll was used, and if the latter was the case, I'd like to get my seven dollars back! The actors, again used loosely, are awful, in fact, almost none of them has done anything that is a relief. The scenery and all about these cries, we had $ 7 to work with and a day to do it. Was this shot in someone's backyard? Everything about this project says, low budget. The actors were at best D-list. Do not waste your time unless you want to take them back and try to get the rent back. The main actor looks like the punk of the 70s, who married his grandmother Dummee Moore. My local blockbuster video store lists this as the most returned movie with sad comments attached. Even as a 99-cent rent, this strip collects dust. Someone really must have owed some favors. This is a super stinker and I give him 10 shit.
