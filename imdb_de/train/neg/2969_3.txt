The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the film is fine, even the director. The main problem is the castings, which turned the film into an almost local and regular clich√©. Apart from the small role of the father, Rafael (impressively played by Asi Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in top form. The role of the older blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh, but without any intensity as the lead role. therefore, the figure she traded had become mild and unremarkable. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal than a real movie. But it's a good point from which we can start and make big improvements in the future.
