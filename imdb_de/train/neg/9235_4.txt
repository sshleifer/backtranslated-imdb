This woman never stops talking throughout the movie. She remembered each line and delivered everything without a bit of natural emotion. She also has a very blurry lisp and the pitch of her voice sounds like nails on a blackboard. This movie has far too much Betsy Drake and not enough Cary Grant to carry everything left over from the film alone.
