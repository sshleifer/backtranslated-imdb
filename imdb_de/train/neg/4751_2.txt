When I saw the teaser trailer for Wendy Wu, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on the Disney Channel, would do martial arts, and I was fine with it ... until I saw the movie. The action was poorly structured, the film could not imagine it, the fights were unrealistic and sucked along with the plot. If you're really thinking that this is a would-be Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a girl who's the offspring of other warriors who were women, a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become a returning queen fighting an ancient evil , The idea was just not so original, the film is a waste of time.
