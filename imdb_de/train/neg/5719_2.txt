This movie is very similar to the movie hostel, with * BAD * acting and little suspense. The gore elements are there, but you do not really feel anything for the characters, so the violence is not very effective. Some parts are just weird ... like forcing a snake down someone's throat. What about it? Is that supposed to be scary or bloody? It's just kind of stupid. As for torture, there really are not any (except the guy who was flashed in the beginning, which they do not show anyway). The villain always says "Let her die slowly," but the butcher kills them all very fast. The deaths are all relatively fast. Yes, I looked at the "Unrated" version. Overall, not the worst Gore movie I've ever seen, but not good at all. You will miss nothing if you skip this.
