I tried to watch this movie without really going through it because it is believed that it has "good" news; The problem is that it is obviously made according to a certain interpretation of the script. An interpretation will, in my opinion, mislead a lot of people. Besides, I'm a movie madman and the acting in this movie was totally unacceptable. Never before had I wanted a negative score to rate a movie. So if you want to be incessantly preached by those without authority then you should definitely get this movie. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love Scifi, as the title will also deceive a lot of people. This was an unfortunate movie because the basic idea had opportunities and these opportunities were wasted. The only quality to be saved in the film is that I realized that the character in "Time Machine" was probably supposed to show some more moral outrage over the strange behavior of people in their future.
