Connie Hoffman is very pretty and sometimes attractive topless. <br /> <br /> That's it, people. The only reason you should even think about whether to watch this movie or not. <br /> <br /> These 70s sexploitation pieces are sometimes very entertaining due to their dating (flared pants, big hair, zapata mustache, etc.). This is not. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad and the idea of ​​having a senior senior man is exceptionally bad. <br /> <br The title referring to a sex comedy is grossly misleading. <br /> <br /> I heartily recommend avoiding it like the plague.
