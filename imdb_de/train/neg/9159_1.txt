If an author gives 2 credits before the main title and 15 more credits before the movie starts, and the first shot shows the author rolling around on a bed in a Lycra cycling shorts, it's no surprise that the author has noticed this of body that should never be seen in spandex. The kind of appearance that could be useful for a homosexual aversion therapist. Others have given this thing the court that deserves it. The most miserable moment for me was the moment when LA's voyage was marked by an airplane landing on a seemingly LAX; and the return was designated by a shot of a Fedex cargo plane.
