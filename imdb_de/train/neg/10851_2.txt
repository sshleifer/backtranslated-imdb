This movie was made for fans of Dani (and Cradle of Filth). I am not one of them. I think he's just an imitator on the Black Metal band (but I'm not a fan of Black Metal anyway). When I brought this DVD case with me to pay for it, I convinced myself that the less authentic something, the more it tries to convince. So I figured I had a rubber roller coaster ride and do-it-yourself splatter with a weird background. Well, that's what I like. <br /> <br /> I came home and packed it. My patience lasted 15 minutes. Insane camera work and DISGUSTING quality. And that was then (2002), that it looked as if it had been recorded with a Hi8 camcorder. I left it on the shelf. Maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice backdrop for this ... image. <br /> <br /> After a few months I came back (in said environment) and saw half. Then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me. My aversion continued to develop. I noticed how funny Dani (1.65m, 5'5 "height) looked in his platform shoes tearing a robber's head (Yeah, crack, his head apparently did not have a skull) No point, but I'm still not finished, so I was not positive. <br /> <br /> After a few more attempts, I finally managed to finish this movie - a few months ago ... (yes, it took me 5.5 years). So - Dani was indeed funny, as Satan / Manson / super bad man's HELPER and the movie DO NOT make sense - see that our bad guy does Dani with bad things I think he's just very, very bad Actually, they are both and that's about it all. <br /> <br /> We have a couple of short stories involving Dani's character My favorite It was about a man STEALING someone's leg because he considered it Yes, exactly. <br /> <br /> The actor's ROCK BOTTOM The C GI is the worst thing I think. and, boy, is Stingers CGI (baaaaad). The story has no meaning. And the quality is ... Let's just say it's not satisfactory. The only thing that may keep you watching is unmotivated violence and blood. Blood and offal are pretty well done. You can actually see that the movie was made there and then moved on. (Example - Dani 'The Man' Filth takes a stuffed cat - fake it as it can - and notices it ... and then eats what has fallen out.) Why? We never know, but we know this cat must have been to illegal substances as his heart is almost half that size.) <br /> <br /> You might think after my comment that this movie is so bad that it's good, but it's just bad , Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points. I added one for Gore.
