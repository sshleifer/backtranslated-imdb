Please take a minute to read my entire review. I'm not knocking on the movie itself - just the DVD versions that are currently available. <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I really wanted to give this movie two stars. I mean, how could it possibly be just one in ten ?! <br /> <br /> Here's how it works: An epic adaptation of Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" with historically accurate combat scenes, courtesy of the Red Army, and an extremely faithful scene-by-scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult but it pays to endure seven hours - if you have seen that. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you can not see this movie - as far as I know. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to watch the DVD version of RusCiCo - widely considered the best available version because it's a mailbox, and restores scenes cut from other DVD releases , <br /> <br /> But it's one of the worst movie prints I've ever seen on DVD. The picture is muddy and inconsistent, often unsteady. It's almost bearable if you set your brightness, color, and image strength to a maximum ... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also inconsistent, loud in some areas, virtually noisy in others. <br /> <br /> And in terms of languages, this is a HUGE problem for Englishmen - the Synchronized option has some good actors, and some really horrible ones whose performance and parts of the movie just do not get dubbed will randomly slip back in Russian and even back to French. <br /> <br /> The subtitle option is not much better. The subtitles do not appear under the picture, but directly above it - which obscures the beauty (or what is left of it) in the landscape. In addition, subtitles are often a poor translation (a shame because the script has tried to knock Tolstoy's real words so close to it), and subtitles also appear to be only partially out of place. <br /> <br /> Even if you turn off most of the color, brightness, and picture adjustments, and turn up the volume and select subtitles * and * English, you'll still get an annoying movie, See and Hear. <br /> <br /> Can the content overcome that? Maybe it would have been possible, but at seven o'clock - who can stand this long? <br /> <br /> Maybe somebody comes along with me and restores that - and maybe I'll see a masterpiece then - but for now I just can not give more than a star to something I only share the first 12% could watch.
