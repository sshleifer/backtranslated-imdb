As an avid fan of Cary Grant, I expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter as AMC billed him as a comedy. I have never been so disappointed in a movie! Cary's usual charm and effortless comedy are AWOL from this entire film; he looks tense, bored and just not himself. Mississippi's character is one of the worst stereotypes I've ever seen - his accent is terribly over the top (and incorrect, depending on which part of Mississippi he claims to be from) and when it surpasses a line, it is a few decibels higher than any other performer. Mississip tried to make a name for herself in the film as a lovable tramp, but in the end he succeeds only to affect the already feeble action. Mansfield is more like an obscene blow-up doll than a Hollywood sex kitten, and although she was never known for her acting skills in Hollywood, this movie screams she never had that ability. Ray Walston's character was sweet and finally ended. For four men on the shore, it was the most indescribable holiday I have ever seen. I've watched this nightmare to the end, and though I can not spoil that for anyone, I'll tell you it's the most absurd thing you've ever seen. The film seeks to arouse patriotism and guilt towards the fighting men, but the film misses this point due to its weak plot and weak cast. Sorry, Cary!
