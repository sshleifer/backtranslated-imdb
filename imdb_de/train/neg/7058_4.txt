I came to NEW PORT SOUTH and expected a replacement movie about the Columbine School massacre, similar to the ELEPHANT by Gus Van Sant, and certainly the summary in the TV program that says a student sociopath rebelled against the system, made that impression, but this is a very boring movie where little happens, so be warned <br /> <br /> The story is about Maddox, a high school student in Chicago who decides to use what he perceives as an authoritarian regime , The main problem is that the character is signed and the actor who plays him, Blake Shields is not able to eliminate script errors. They feel that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler, Saddam, or Bin Laden, but he never does anything but act as a vicious, lecherous teenager, and it's impossible to believe he could bring disciples together. The subtext of you, in which you overthrow a manipulative authoritarian regime to replace it with another manipulative regime, is too obvious, which means that NEW PORT SOUTH is a totally unconvincing drama that is not worth your look leave
