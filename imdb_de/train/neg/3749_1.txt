Wow, I love and respect pretty much everything David Lynch did. However, this movie is similar to the attempt of a first filmmaker to make a pseudo-art video. <br /> <br /> To give you some examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is usually a visual filmmaker, but he had little visual art content (empty walls, "up shots"). with blanket in the background) 2. David Lynch is usually very proud of the audio signal, and you could even hear the humming of the video camera. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's very hard to believe he had anything to do with this movie. If not ... <br /> <br /> ... that's a joke on David's side, forcing fans to search his website (for hours) just to find that jerk. I hope so, because at least this idea is funny.
