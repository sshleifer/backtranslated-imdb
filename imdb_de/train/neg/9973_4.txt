"Problem Kid" is one of the dumbest movies ever made. It's not the worst (though some people will not agree with me), but it's not the best either. It's about a devilish 7-year-old boy who falls victim to comic devastation to a childless couple (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck), who steals him silly. This movie is too stupid and unbelievable because I do not buy for a second that a kid might be as indecent as the kid in this movie. It is unimaginative and absurd, although I have laughed several times (I really do not know why). But I can not recommend this movie. I know that I am too nice. If there's a positive thing about "problem child," it's better than the sequel, which was just awful. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
