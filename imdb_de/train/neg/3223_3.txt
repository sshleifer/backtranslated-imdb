LOL! Not a bad start. I thought that was original, but then I discovered that it was a clone of the 1976 remake of KING KONG. I never saw KING KONG until I was 15. I saw this movie when I was 9. The funky disco music will get stuck in your head! Not to mention the title song of the film by the Yetiern. This is the worst creature effect I've ever seen. At the same time, this movie remains a holy grail of B-movies. Memorable quotes: "Take a sedative and go to bed." "Put the Yeti in your tank and you have the ability of Yeti." I remember seeing this movie on MOVIE MACRABE hosted by Elvira. There is a scene in which it was the other way around like KING KONG! In KING KONG he grabs the girl and climbs up the building, but in this movie he climbs down the building and grabs the girl (who has fallen)! Also around the year, another KONG clone MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977) came from Hong Kong. There are many traveling matting scenes and motorized body parts. This movie will make you laugh. It's like I said, just another KING KONG clone. PG for violence, language, thematic elements and some scary scenes.
