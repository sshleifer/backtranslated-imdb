I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially because Juhi Chawla is there, she is a great actress. <br /> <br /> This movie contains six stories. It's a new concept from Hollywood. So it's not a new article. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (Priyanka Chopra) is a dancer. She wants to become famous and makes a friend to interest the reporters in her. Then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and claims to be her boyfriend. Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress. If she screams, I'm angry. Salman Khan can not play comic roles. But in his serious areas he is wonderful. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He gets into a mid-life crisis and is attracted by a much younger woman, forgetting what he really has in life. his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil kapoor and Juhi are born actors / actresses. They are amazing. But this story is too thin for her. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) will marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but he gets cold feet and blows out the wedding. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). She gets an accident and suffers a memory loss. Now she no longer knows that she loves her husband more. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. He meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz), a white woman who falls in love with an Indian man, but just wants to marry an Indian woman. Raju has to bring Staphani to this man, but falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> I never liked Govinda's movies. He is very annoying, not funny. But in this movie I really liked him, as if he had grown up in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! There is Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal, who is currently married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He wants to have serious action with her, but every time her family gets in the way. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor, but he is funny! I like his films. <br /> <br /> Now here is the problem. All these stories are not interesting. Making a story out of six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there, the stories touch, but are not relevant to the characters. <br /> <br /> My conclusion; Priyanka can not act! Let go of the woman in the Bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more films, this role was too small for him. Salman Khan can not play weird roles, but really serious movies. This is written about his life as an actor. This movie is a shit and a waste of good actors and actresses like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham Bachchan and you just let him sing a lullaby.
