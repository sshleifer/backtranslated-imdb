Do not see this movie Bad-looking and stupid gore effects. A complete waste of time. I had hoped to see many cool murders and hot girls, instead the director relied on animal murder videos to shock you, the observer. Disgusting. The killings are pretty lame, basically strangulation. A woman stuffing worms into his mouth, one he puts in the face with raw hamburgers and strangles them. BTK = BTK Broiler, new sandwich "Burger King" ... ha ha. I do not think this movie relied too much on actual fact. I mean, he was a real BTK killer who did not carry a lot of rodents, scorpions and worms ... and oh well ... a butchered cow's head too. Imagine that.
