I give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was ... pretty boring. For about 50 minutes we have the outline of the storyline ... In the War of the Worlds, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10 minutes? Then it was real action! It's like this: "Let's go for a walk in the savannah and catch the beautiful sunsets!" And maybe a message like "Do not kill elephants!". Very ecological. I would have expected that from a "new" Steven Segal movie, not from this one ... The lead actress makes me think about artificial suntan, dyed hair and too much foundation! And I have not seen a scene where her hair is messed up or she is sweating or her clothes are dusty. She just does not look like a 19th century woman! And in the bar looking for our hero, Swayze alerts the commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and it became famous in the next few years. Livingstone and other explorers went to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So if the action does not take place between 1896 and 1900, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a nice impression .. as a nutshell - hard outside, but cuddly soft inside. Not that I'm cuddling with a nut, but you understand what it's about. He really manages to face this beaten puppy several times. The film stank. Way too long and always boring. do not look at it Do not buy it! It's a waste of money!
