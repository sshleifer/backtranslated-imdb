The movie is only worth it if you stop it after half an hour. It starts with fun conversations in a bar and lets expect a good, funny story to come. Well, I can tell you that it will not come. It will turn into a movie in a few minutes that will challenge your patience and shame for the actors to an extent that you are unlikely to enjoy. <br /> <br /> In an interview, I heard that the director in this film wanted to express the sense of a loss of identity that he believes the majority of people in this globalizing world are experiencing. I was surprised to hear that. Am I living in the same world he lives in? OK, a lot of people walk in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and everything, but that does not make me feel like I'm losing my identity. What does Khrzhanosvky mean, that we are nothing more than the clothes we wear and the movies we see? Am I short-sighted or is he? <br /> <br /> Well, my voice: the good start of the movie saves it from getting a 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.
