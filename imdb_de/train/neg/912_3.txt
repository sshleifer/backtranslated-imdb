... for one of the worst Swedish films of all time ... forgive me for being boring. <br /> <br /> At first I did not see the first one (I was bored, that's why I saw the second before the 1st), I hope the first one is better than this, he was with strange cut scenes and very strange action changes filled. For the people who saw this and think 4/10 is high (believe me, me too), but it made me laugh a few times because it was so bizarre, and I still laugh when I do think of the punk that came up with this idea. What's next "Det sjunde inseglet II". Non-romance or book-based episodes do not often get great and this is a perfect example. <br /> <br /> OK, I'll be honest with you: I laughed a little got some decent jokes and slapstick humor. But do not buy it, rent it. Just make it or download from another idiot. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director is probably already being laughed at ...
