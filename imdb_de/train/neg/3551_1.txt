This movie is just awful !!!! Slow, slow to get to the point and wooden figures that just would not have been there. The best part was the show by Iron Maiden, which was sung in a video in a theater. The end was worth seeing and waiting for, but that was it !! The characters in this movie have almost put me to sleep. Avoid it !!!
