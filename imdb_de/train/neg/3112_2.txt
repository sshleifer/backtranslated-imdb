Let me say in the beginning, I will try not to put too many spoilers in this list. I usually enjoy Robin Williams movies, but this gem was not one of them. It was billed as an exciting thriller. The night listener was anything but. To be honest, there were 6 people on the opening day of the theater, two went out, for a good reason. The film was in my opinion badly written and staged. The acting was fine, but again there was nothing to work on. The film is about a storyteller reading a good book of a dying child. But * creepy insert here * No one can verify the existence of children. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to find the author, but all he gets is a headache and apologies from the janitor of the boys. That's it, that's all. They wait about one and a half hours and the movie ends. It had as many thrills as a visit to a dentist. The homosexual overtones or overtones had nothing to do with the story, and the movie had a bit of obscenity, but it seemed to be thrown in for no reason and made little sense. In the end, I really can not write a decent review of this movie because there was nothing, it was as intriguing as drying paint. I gave him a 2 because the acting was fine for what it was worth, and was not directed by Uwe Boll.
