What a powerful start to a movie when Julia Roberts character is slapped in the face by her abusive and anal man, played by Patrick Bergin, and I felt ready to make a powerful film on the same level as Farrah Fawcett's The Burning Bed experience. Well, as the summary says, I was misguided. This movie was nothing like The Burning Bed that had power, and Farrah played the role of a woman you really felt for and felt her pain and need to survive. Sleeping with the enemy turned into cheap thrills after the first act, when Roberts faked her death to escape her husband and moved to Iowa. Her husband initially believes she is dead but becomes suspicious that she may still be alive and sets off. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game in which Julia gets a home in this little town in Iowa and changes her identity. Of course, it does not mention how she got the money for it. I was not so interested in the movie. She meets a guy (Mr. Nice wimpy) and falls in love with him, and her husband finally fetches her, but only when he switches her soup cans and straightens the kitchen. I expect to give the public a cheap thrill. But I did not care if she was a battered wife because, as I said, the movie betrayed the public. If it had stayed that way, maybe I would have felt for her and her situation. Of course, the husband is killed and everything is good for little old Mrs. Roberts. If only the real world were close to it ... See the burning bed and you understand what a movie about domestic abuse should look like.
