Camera work - Why is the camera in this movie so restless? This is annoying and distracting. Edit - The flashes of the stills were much too short. Many of the other scenes were too short. Just blink. Sound - the background music was too loud and obscured the voices. You should not have to rewind and play again to capture what you said. No one checks these things and gets them to do it again. Reduce the volume of background music in the future. Is the adjustment of the relative sound levels the task of the editor Julia Wong? The plot had far too many loose ends. The basic story had potential. I think the movie needed more work. Was it rushed? Maybe they had no money left. As with many movies, it started out great, but went out towards the end. I really do not understand that, you know that you have the storyboard before it goes into production. Why are not all loose ends included in the storyboard? ,
