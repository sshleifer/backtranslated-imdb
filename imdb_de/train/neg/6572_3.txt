In my opinion, the title of this film should be changed from "Only the Brave" to "All About Lane". I was watching this movie a few months ago and was pretty disappointed with the result. Although I appreciate that the director made a film about the men of 442 - a topic that has been talked about in the film industry for a long time - the acting in some parts of the film was rather stale. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were all great. The director should NEVER have seen himself as the main character of the film. Sorry Lane, you're just not a movie actor. Stay with what you are good at - playing theater. The appearance of Gina Hiraizumi in this movie was also terrible. She should never have been allowed to speak and her appearance was not suited to play the role of Miss Nisei Queen. There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why were not they cast for this role? Another big problem with this movie was its action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers do not look like they're fighting German soldiers ... let alone someone. Granted, this was a low-budget feature, but since it was a war movie, is not it really important to show fights? This film was a worthy attempt, but definitely not worth much circulation.
