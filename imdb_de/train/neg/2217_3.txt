As the imitated Russian scientist two-thirds of the way in the film says, "I came for science." This pretty much sums up the reason I've seen this movie - everything that pertains to a half, half hammerhead shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation by an impartial aspiring scientist. Or, as they say in business, my girlfriend's brother had the remote and the rest is history. To say that the special effects were bad would be detrimental to the field of special effects. This is 2005, it's not difficult to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background. Yes, that was charming and cutting edge technology when Hitchcock turned "The Birds", but in 2005 it just looks. Spare me the cheap attempt at Sci-Fi and do the service of actually attempting to voluntarily suspend unbelief. <br /> <br /> However, after you slandered the overall concept of this movie, let me tell you that, sad as it may sound, it's probably worth your time. Last but not least, it is a tour de force of bad sci-fi - training for the new movie lover and certainly a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies in their time. <br /> <br /> The crazy, hunchbacked, crazy scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it's a good idea to spoon blood into the nearby water does not only make me question the intelligence of humanity but also the ability of "B" filmmakers to come up with plausible storylines from a distance. <br /> <br /> This film also pretty much fulfills one of my many years of bad film fighting - bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If that were not 2005, I would do that. Be angry about the fact that this movie was a kind of bad metaphor for the Cold War. I mean, you might as well have Khan on the bridge of a Klingon bird of prey, introducing leaching into Chekhov's ear. <br /> <br /> One of the moving lines of the movie is when the chick without a bra insists on "Charlton Heston," "Waiting for Tom," as he tries to lift the escape helicopter off the ground. The thing is, Tom wastes the bad sunglasses guys with his endless banana clip tied to his Kalashnikov or AK-47 in layman form. <br /> <br /> Like the mad scientist at the end of the film, "My goal is to develop the human species" - suffice it to say that this film has only contributed to the development of humanity. The weak Freudian credentials that the mad scientist voiced when he prepared the female protagonist for a pair with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst science fiction we can find something to laugh about.
