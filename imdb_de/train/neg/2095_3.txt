Battlestar Gallactica was so great because of its dense writing, great looks, excellent actors and interesting stories ... AND yes, hot men and women just lazy in and out of uniform. Lazy writing Actors smoke a storm to give them "character". Outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being somewhere else (yes, that's a Ford Focus sitting in the background). Many, many teenage scared. There are plenty of naked women (but in the background, I'm sure they'll be cut for the show) and a little look at some men in towels. None of the actors except Polly Walker interested me at all. For an hour and a half, I was still wondering when it would be over. <br /> <br /> So, what exactly should bring me back? The science fiction? That's terribly easy. The actors? Apart from Polly Walker's beautiful turnaround, not much interesting is being done here. There are not even "hotties" in the cast except maybe Esai, although he's quite old for the younger set, being over 25 years old. I loved BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica, and I think I'm right. I predict a very short run for a series, unless they really sharpen their pens at SciFi and set out to produce more than The OC on another world.
