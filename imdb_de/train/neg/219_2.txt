It MIGHT have been a good movie if he had explored something more interesting than just the surface of a lesbian relationship, if that was the meaning of the movie. ..Coincidence? I do not think there is nothing original in this movie that could support it, so they had to use something that is already famous. You know the recipe. The other actors ... well, I just do not know what role they should play. Most of them are well-known people in Romania, and I must mention that some of them are not even actors (eg Mihaela Radulescu) plot + the opportunity to use bad language to shock = love sick ... too bad. .. but the idea was good ... and I seriously abstain from commenting on the title ...
