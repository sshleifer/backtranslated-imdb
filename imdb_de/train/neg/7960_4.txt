I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a small child. I slipped down very early in the morning, started watching HBO, and The Raft (Segment 2) terrified me well. This time I still enjoyed The Raft, though I could not say if it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short film. The other two segments were completely garbage. I can not believe that somewhere a producer was paid to make this garbage. All I've achieved is to ruin another childhood memory. Creepshow 2 is now among cycling among my list of kids' classics. 4.10
