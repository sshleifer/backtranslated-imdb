A bad movie. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of bad special effects, lots of rushed scenes (for example the airport one) and a really unpleasant time. (Charles Dance) is terrible as the bad guy and he is much better at (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) Do not make a weird joke, and I've heard that this submerged one had success, great success !! !! I will never understand why or how ?! In a television interview I (Eddie Murphy) himself heard when he was nominated for an Oscar in 2007, I regretted it weird !! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey ... it's the 1980s!). Well, no, my friend. It is the cinematic stupidity that has made many RAZZIE films over the years, be it in the 1980s or 1950s! <br /> <br /> There are two reasons why I write about this movie. The first is that I'll never forget the long brown, intriguing legs of (Charlotte Lewis), especially when she's in bed before the bad guys attack her house. They only wear a blue shirt and OH BOY it should be. But how strange! How did I see her in the following films and was not she so beautiful anymore? !! Anyway, the second reason is that I've recently found the title of this movie on my list of the worst 100 movies ever. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Bad movie, Greeeeeat legs.
