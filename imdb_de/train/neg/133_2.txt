The reason I saw it in the movies was that it was a preview, otherwise I would never have seen this terrible teenage Slasher movie. I mean, do not we have enough of it yet? At least they did not take Scream and Scary Movie themselves seriously! The plot is shitty and acting is the worst I've ever seen. (Only Godzilla can compare that to what is the only movie that competes to be the worst I've seen in the movies with this movie.) <br /> <br /> There are so many storylines in history and The girls are so similar that you do not even know who was killed and who was not. (and you do not care.) The only one I knew in advance was Denise, and she was the most talented actress I've ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> far away from this movie as possible. (2/10)
