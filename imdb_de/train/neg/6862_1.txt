This superior inferiority to the original, stupid Blind Dead movie is another trash bin dust. So many people have played these films so high that I can not believe what they say about them. Since I was a kid, I've heard how scary and awesome these movies are, and I've seen them all and been thoroughly disappointed. Was any drug from the '70s or you just do not know how boring this oil is?
