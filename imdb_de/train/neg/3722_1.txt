I remember when I was forced as a child to watch this movie from a Southern Baptist preacher (yes - literally FORCED) - and even then I loved his awfulness. It's supposed to make poor idiots "saved". The only thing that "saved" me was the fact that it finally came to an end and I was able to lead a real life. <br /> <br /> Check out the chapter for this movie in Sarah Diamonds book "The Politics of the Christian Right." FASCINATING. And certainly more interesting than the movie!
