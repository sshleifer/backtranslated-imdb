Nut Case Murders College Students, Can a New Teacher Stop Madness? Believe me, you do not care Collect this movie just is not art. But worse than this splatter university is not even suitable for amusing garbage. Splatter U is so badly made - the story is pointless, the characters are projectiles and the whole movie has no imagination. It is needless to say that there is no tension or atmosphere or fear. This idiot is not even brave enough to be nude (for the cheapest thrill of all). This endlessly flawed Slasher offers nothing to entertain (not even cheap laugh) and becomes a complete bore. Bottom of the barrel folks - even the hard Slasher fans will want to think again before watching, let alone pay money for this film strip. <br /> <br />
