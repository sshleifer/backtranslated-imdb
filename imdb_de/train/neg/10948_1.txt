What did you think in "Cannes"? One of the most irritating films of all time. Every detail of this movie, no matter how pointless, was shown. If I had to watch her put on those boots again, I probably would have screamed. If this movie was about showing how wretched Rosetta had a life, then it would be covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits would have to run. But no, we always had to see countless superfluous scenes. The whole thing was full of unpleasant and not sympathetic characters. You deserve the misery that Rosetta was. And to think, I've given up "Tumbleweeds" to see this overheated boredom movie. It was like watching grass grow, but that's more exciting.
