After 30 seconds, you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap tee. The story comes from great movies like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills have Eyes". I like these kinds of movies, even if they are well duplicated (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But "Side Sho" is hard to see: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally out of place. You do not care what happens to the characters. The so-called bad guys are not at all interesting and rather stereotypical. How about blood and blood? Well, there are some, although it's pretty cheap and the action is very bad. 2 points, just for blood and blood, but understand that this is hardly worth a look even for the dog dogs.
