Well, what can I say, there are B-grade films and there are B-grade films, and that definitely falls into the latter. However, as it is obvious that even the creators of the film know that this is not a credible movie (look at the end credits), this can be forgiven. He accidentally mixed his genetic material with some experimental acid, which unites and then gets lost in the snow. The killer now takes on the shape of a snowman - if you can believe that. The snowman, Jack Frost, is the country town sheriff who puts him behind bars. In this way, Jack Frost kills half the city. <br /> <br /> This film is not really scary and the effects alone remind me of the B-grade movies of the 50s. That alone is worth watching. A movie to pass the time.
