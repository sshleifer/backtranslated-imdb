An absolutely cruel adaptation of the wonderful children's book. Raw and inappropriate humor, some scary parts, and a disgusting side story about the mother's friend who wants to send the boy to the military school to get him out of the way, make this totally unsuitable for the children who most likely want to see it (3-8) years. Do not waste your money, your time or your good judgment.
