In a word ... catastrophic. I give him a star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women, otherwise forget it. Corman's worst effort, no. Ben Vereen would have had to permanently erase his name from the occupation. I can not believe that this will now be released on DVD (as of 15.02.05) with "Wild In The Streets" - another retro stinker. I woke up sick in bed this morning and decided to watch a movie to cheer me up a bit, scan the digital channels ... The premise looked interesting because of B-movie sci-fi, hippie culture and Rebellion likes teen flicks. It seemed somehow familiar to me and with Ben Vereen in the cast I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a terrible start to my day. <br /> <br /> Now that I've seen it, I now know why familiarity has crept into the recesses of my newly awakened brain. I remembered that as a 14-year-old (I'm 45) I had seen upcoming attractions for this movie, back in the early / mid-seventies at Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists ... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even groaned loud how bad this movie looked. Acting: terrible, story: terrible, cinematography: almost terrible, music: terrible, sound: terrible, director: a joke. If you watch the video after my warning, remember ... "I told you." "Gass-sss" is the perfect title for this movie ... you feel gassed after watching this lazy movie - or maybe you should be put in a "gas chamber" to waste your brain. I've seen homemade Super 8 movies that shame this movie. Definitely a new addition to my Top Ten WORST films of all time ... up there (er, down there) with "Tentacles". <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
