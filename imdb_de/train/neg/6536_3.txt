This DVD seems to be directed at someone who simply hangs them up and plays them in an endless loop in the background. It is organized as a series of music videos of the Grand Canyon, which are set to different pieces of Tangerine Dream music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the TD music is boring and the transfer to DVD seems rather blurry and muted. A DVD too expensive for what it is.
