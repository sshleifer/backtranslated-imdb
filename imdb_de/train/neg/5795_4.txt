"Lies" tells of an affair between an 18-year-old Bucktoothed student and a skinny, 38-year-old married man, in which the two protags spend about half of the screen time with naked sex and hokey whipping and the other half through the pathetic naive draws action that seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes. With a very poor production value, including obvious sanitary ware and inappropriate softcore sex, as well as a messy comedy and drama mix, "Lies" quickly becomes obsolete. With almost 2 hours of running time, subtitles and so little substance "Lies" is simply not recommended. (C-)
