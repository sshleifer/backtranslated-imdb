This was shown at the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, although it was left over for reasons best left to the powers. There seems to have been much said that it is the first Thai-language film made with Thai actors and crew, but directed by a Westerner. I did not bother to be honest as this movie is boring, boring and boring. Why suggest something, why an idea is shrouded in mystery, why subtly evoke a feeling when you can hammer home with awful voice-overs, obvious shots, and exaggerated scenes? As a director, nothing is left to the imagination Spurrier awkwardly swirls endless clich√©s. No hints, no guesses, it's all on screen, no need to use our ideas. I wonder when the "scary" piece comes? No, you will not, because the soundtrack is becoming more intimidating and is mounting to a crescendo of ominous. Damn, I make myself words to describe how bad that is. Wonder if the summoned demon is real or imaginary? Why tax yourself - it's really a snake, and yes, it really bites into the crotch, and blood spurts everywhere. It's a strange, restless movie for a variety of reasons. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but it's not scary - the bumps are signposted and obvious. It could be a devastating attack on the more Saxon side of Thailand, but the director has a sloppy, greasy style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teenagers. Maybe it has thrown itself as the virginal vest that has put the seed of doubt in my head. Or maybe it was just a pair of pants. Uninspired, bland, repetitive, cheated - all candidates for the best description, but boring seems the most appropriate and honest. It has all been seen before, probably better, often with more thought, rarely with less imagination or stray light. We are sorry. Thumbs down at every count. Really terrible.
