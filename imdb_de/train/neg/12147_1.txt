This is perhaps the worst attempt of a zombie movie I've ever seen. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any review found on this website is obviously the work of the filmmaker, filmmaker family or a friend of the filmmaker. How does this movie suck? Let's count the ways ... <br /> <br /> The plot? Incoherent. Dialog? Awful. I will not hit the effects as I understand that this is a low budget. But was there even a zombie that was not obese? Come on! And why does this truck have a Massachusetts plate for a movie playing in Rhode Island? Continuity, find a few. <br /> <br /> The girl is dancing while the soldier is standing by. Please do not put the sister of your ex-girlfriend or your friend naked in your movie. This was an ugly movie that was filled with ugly people and did not even mention Romero on the cover. The next time you decide to make a movie, do not do that.
