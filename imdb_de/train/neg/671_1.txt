Bad drama, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no suspense, no original settings, it always uses the same cabinet / under-the-bed / person-behind-the-mirror tactics, repeating and repeating itself boring and NOT in an anticipated way, and the fact that NEVER ever "really" gets killed (at least not on screen), which in turn triggers any suspense that comes from it, and everyone feels even more cheated on money for theirs Spend a ticket ... it's a horror movie without horror LMAO. Most of what you see is what someone looks like who took a ketchup bottle and sprayed it over a plastic wrap. <br /> <br /> You need to be a teenager who sat there screaming in the theater and scared to have fun doing this, or you were up / drunk at the time. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I have a life and do not mind writing reviews, unless I really really hated something or really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> But this movie is WONDERFUL and I feel obliged to warn you NOT to give your money to Hollywood and to encourage this kind of filmmaking! <br /> <br /> It's one thing to borrow a "bad" movie from the Weinsteins at Blockbuster, another when you have to assert yourself in a theater. <br /> <br /> Also in case you want something remake nostalgia, forget it! This is NOT a remake and no redesign. It's neither scary nor captivating, nor is it satisfying enough to be "funny" as others have claimed on IMDb ... it's just stale and booooring. <br /> <br /> Here's what you'll take away from this movie: Remember the scar on Brittany Snow's head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech must have a sexual affair with JS Cardone from "The Forsaken" has got another role as a killer (because he's as scary as my poodle, and too cute to kill just anyone) and for some reason (duh) anyone who returns to the hotel suite will never come back What kind of person would not be worried about the Prom if she decides to announce the candidates for the Ball King and Queen, and the fiercely competitive girl just does not appear. This is my warning to you. Do not waste your money like me. The "original" is shit too, but it's more of a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, even though it's not nearly as bad as this piece of crap (I'm sorry to sound vulgar or rude, but if you will understand why I say what I say).
