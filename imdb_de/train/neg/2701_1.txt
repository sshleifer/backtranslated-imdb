First of all yes, I am white, so I try to move easily in the always sensitive topic of race ... anyway ... White people hate Black people = BAD but Black people hate White people = OK (because we seem to have earned it !!). Where should I start? I wish I had something good to say about this film, apart from unintentional comedy scenes: The notorious scene was Ice Cube and Co. Fighting with some really big, really strong, really angry and scary neo-Nazis and win !!! the neo-Nazi was twice as big :) and the hunt! The hunt is priceless ... This is NOT a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not deliver ... This is a racist film in which all cliché clichés are confirmed, the white eyelash type being maltreated by his husband black Roommate automatically turns into a skinhead ... cmon just awful I regret having ever seen her. <br /> <br /> Save your time and the terrible experience of a poorly written, badly handled, boring and clearly biased image, if you're busy with the topic, go to Rent American History X and this is now a movie
