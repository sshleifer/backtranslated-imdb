Who made this nonsense, missed the point completely. Jane is a silly comic strip that pervades without being gloomy. <br /> <br /> This gigantic chaos tries to be funny and exciting, but it's just a mess. There is no decent performance in it ... even the normally reliable Jasper Carrott is painlessly stupid. <br /> <br /> The American guy whose name escapes me is as bad as in Flash Gordon. <br /> <br /> Maud Adams tries as a villager, but she's a bit long for this kind of thing. All these things would not matter if the girl was sexy or funny or personable. It is not. Kirsten Holmes then disappeared in the dark and all the better. <br /> <br /> I've done more entertaining things than flushing the toilet. Avoid
