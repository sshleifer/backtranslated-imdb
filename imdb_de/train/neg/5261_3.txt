I have read some of the other comments and have to agree with those who have not reached the end. I thought it went pretty well ... until the end. It kept your mind going and then flattened it. I have no idea what went on in the last few minutes of the movie, except a complete mess. It's as if they no longer have the money to make a happy ending, so they improvise. First, they had a mysterious thing that made people disappear, then they had a guy talking about Area 51 (which makes you think about aliens) and then, after they got crap. I thought the actors and actresses were doing well. However, if you watch this movie you should end up disappointed.
