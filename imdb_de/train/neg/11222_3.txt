Cybil Richards conducts another Full Moon / Surrender Cinema masterpiece of eroticism. This time, Jacqualine Lovell (dressed in a rather silver outfit) has the job of destroying all evidence of sexual activity. However, she can not resist looking at the tapes, and she somehow likes them. The sex scenes are well filmed and set for an excellent soundtrack (at least for this kind of movie). The cast is mostly awful and above all very average. Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and manages to lay bare her breasts and fumble between sex files. It also fits in with a little lesbian activity. To be honest, Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare. Here she looks great naked, but is in her silver clothes that tells the "drama", much more attractive. Absolute garbage movie with Lovell and soundtrack the only true salvation features. Mediocre even for Surrender's performance and clearly a new budget, which is also low for them.
