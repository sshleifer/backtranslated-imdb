After reading the other reviews for this movie, I think the High Markers are likely to be paid studio minions because the movie I saw was absolutely terrible, with wooden plays, dull scripting, and sudden, predictable directors, One of the few pluses Be the stunning backdrop as this film offers some breathtaking scenery with great views and dramatic skies and wide-open prairies. If the most memorable element in a movie is the part that stands behind the actors, this must be a warning sign of quality. All in all, an absolutely uninspired complement to the Western genre, available even at a very reasonable price, available on DVD. best avoided.
