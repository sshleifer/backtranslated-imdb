Humm, an Italian movie starring David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I did not expect much, to be honest, and I took even less than I expected. That does not mean this movie is the worst I've ever seen because I've seen worse things, but the plot was mostly confusing and uninteresting. Besides, you will love some special effects, they are really cheesy and bad. Now I just want to see "Troll 3" by the same director, but it sure is not worse.
