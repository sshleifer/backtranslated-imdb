There has been much talk about using Rohmer's digital technology to "fill in" the background. Sometimes it works well, especially noteworthy is the scene where Grace and her maiden from afar see the king's execution. At other times, the film has a strangely amateurish look that resembles a home video. The biggest drawback, however, is that the mere artificiality of the staging scene creates an alienating effect on the viewer. We know that what we see is not real. So how can we feel for the characters? To be honest, I did not care what happened to the lady or the duke. <br /> <br /> The other big failure I regret is the performance of Lucy Russell in the lead role. She is in virtually every scene and the film's success depends on her performance. OK, she speaks a foreign language, but she is unable to express real feelings. Her emotions in the scene, reminiscent of her friend Mme de Meyler (a brilliant performance by debutante Helena Dubiel), when she saw her head on a pole, caused embarrassing laughter in the audience. Also pay attention to their hands when expressing feelings! All in all a very disappointing movie, especially given the positive reviews on this site.
