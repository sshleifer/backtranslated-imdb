I've noticed that all the other reviews in this movie mention how "healthy" and "entertaining" it is. These people have to leave the house more often. I do not know why they care about that shitty, dull, mindless piece of fluff. Pat Boone has absolutely no acting talent, and his inability is surpassed only by that of his co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (another reason to refute the insidious practice of inflicting a talent on an unsuspecting audience, a foul habit that unfortunately exists until today). A good side cast (including Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon) tries very hard to make sense of it, but to no avail. I have noticed that two directors have shared loans, although "credit" is not the word I would use (not even "director"). In terms of "healthy conversation," there are many of these types of films without tormenting your loved ones by forcing them to take the game. Find one of these movies and skip it.
