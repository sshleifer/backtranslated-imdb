Obviously disappointed turkey, a mixture of anti-Nazi musical (!!), pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie, who are faked with a big, big problem: it is deadly nonsense. In addition to the single-digit I.Q. Plot and dialogue, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." is the berserk casting. Gene Wilder (Star AND co-author) tries it all: he plays a romantic lead role (with his looks !! and his age !! He and Woody Allen were supposed to found a club for unsuspecting, mirrorless, aging comedians), and he tries movingly and witty and poignant and wise to sing and dance, and he manages to have NO !! A looong shot from his good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> For a while I thought I had shortsightedness because everyone in the movie always says Cherry Jones is this pretty hot girl and Michael Cumpsty is this amazing stallion !! The man who plays Claire Bloom's male secretary is a charming skinny actor as sexy as a chair, and is the object of the two leading ladies' passion !! Mike Starr's over-the-top performance as the most incompetent and phoenixiest cop you've ever seen deserves to be among the 10 most vile performances in recent film history. The saddest comment is to see the wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa completely miscast and offensively wasted. At least, I hope that both stars paid their bills home with this flop (and then fired their agents). No wonder the prodigy Sukowa returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood had in store for her! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how a really bad script turns into a really bad movie with a berserk casting director, study this - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
