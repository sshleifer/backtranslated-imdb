Hawked as the most offensive movie ever, guaranteed to offend anyone, you know what? It worked, I'm offended that we've been pumping up money to rent it. Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all the cops were true about the movie we saw on TV. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that have driven this garbage on us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the shit, but have been drawn into this. Since then, we have beaten up suggesting hiring him, and his film selection privileges have been lifted. Nothing remotely funny about this movie ... even the scene "Dickman Adventure" was at best a sophomore. Color me p *** ed. I thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason ... no ... it was just crappy. NEVER SEE THIS! for some reason. Not even with a lot of illegal substance, this movie would be funny. That says a lot. Please for the love of all that is holy, if you appreciate your reason, never look at this movie. There are many things - stupid, meaningless and worthless, to name a few. But the main thing that it aimed at: offensively funny - it failed miserably. Crash and burn ....
