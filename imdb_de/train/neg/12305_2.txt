I'm watching this movie on WTN because that was the channel the TV was on when I turned it on. It is a not very credible and rather boring story about the wife of a minister (Alexandra Paul), who falls in love with a young stallion / drifter (with a washboard abs), played by Corey Sevier. It can be an action or not. Corey often takes off his shirt and Alexandra faints. I feel like he's up to no good and that's why he's confused with the skinny Alexandra Paul. That's not really important, because as I said, he often takes off his shirt and I just got a look at the buttocks. The soundtrack contains a lot of saxophone, which is just painful.
