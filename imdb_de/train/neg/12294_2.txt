I only saw this movie for the setting. It was filmed in an old hotel of which a friend owns shares. The plot was predictable, the drama was mediocre at best, the horrors were all rough outs, not real scares. I do not remember much about the plot, and I think that's because it's not 'much to remember. They did not even use the hotel in full ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is on a peninsula. At low tide you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay, which is actually an eerie sight in the morning or late at night when the wind howls through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The Best To watch this movie, you'll need to see the remote control in hand, so you can go through the action scenes (and I use that term casually) and pause in the beauty of the environment!
