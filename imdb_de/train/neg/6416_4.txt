SOME NON-SO-SPOILY SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> Why do people who are disoriented or sick or anxious cut themselves off in a club right through the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who in the know would hide under a bed if someone invades his room? <br /> <br /> How often do you knock on a stranger's door and if they do not respond IMMEDIATELY, open the door, go inside, call a few hello and then start walking through their belongings. <br /> <br /> If you were being persecuted by someone you just discovered to be a murderer, what would you do? Do you creep quietly under a wooden platform or hidden between metal tools? Do you naturally run silently to a rotted old barn or other dilapidated structure? <br /> <br /> I could talk about almost every thriller that came out in the last few years, but since this is the "The Return" site, of course I'm talking about "The Return". I saw it for free because I'm working in a movie theater and doing the "scary" movies. I thought that would be tolerable ... except for the worn clichés. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really monotonous and somehow sees "Huh?" through most of the movie. The details of the plot are slowly being released throughout the film, and it's almost enough to make it interesting, unless there were not enough explanations as it went on, so I was almost up to the last 2/3 lost from it. <Br /> <br /> If you're a die-hard thriller fan, it's worth a visit at least once. If there's nothing better in the theater and you really want to watch a movie then it's worth a matinée ticket. If you thought the trailer would look like an interesting movie and you can not wait ... wait.
