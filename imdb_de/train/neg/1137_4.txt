I tried twice to get through this movie. The first time I was successful - and it was like pulling teeth - and the second time failed despite a great DVD broadcast. The problem? It's just too boring. <br /> <br /> If you can get into the dramatic court scene that occupies most of the second half of the movie, you've made it, but it's hard to get there. There are some interesting conversations by "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) during the process. The end is touching as Lincoln walks away and she puts his memorial statue across the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful story, done well and so on .... but it lacks a spark in the first half and discourages the viewer in there. I suppose the real Abe Lincoln was much more interesting than this movie.
