No matter how good his "message" is - this movie is a terrible train wreck - terrible acting, lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to stutter - he's miserable. You see the extras on the DVD and how he is being tracked by a camera - he just sucks them in - he loves to be the center of attention. He's a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some of it, as Carr had shown this movie in youth centers and New Age churches in the city - where the damaged people who sought reinforcement and attention chattered about how the film touched them and maybe did - but as a film itself, it is choppy , predictable and sappy
