It's been a while since I saw Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but now he is the husband and Jude Law the lover of his wife. The story is still the same and it's a fantastic piece. <br /> <br /> During the film, I always had the feeling of seeing a play. That's one of the reasons why I do not like this remake of a classic. When I watch a film adapted to a piece, I still have to feel like watching a movie, not just a piece. Director Kenneth Brannigan has made some great films in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason was the look of the film. The design was modern, stylishly clean, uncomfortable and cold. I never had the feeling that someone lived in this house. The photography was not bad, but the lightning was terrible. Sometimes there was blue light, dark, green light, so as not to nicely round it off for the eyes. Michael Caines and Jude Laws show their best side. I really want these two guys to play together on stage. But I have to confess that I was never a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was the middle part. I remember that this part of the original was still very mysterious and simply wonderfully directed. I tried to see it twice and always felt in the middle of sleep. The end part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems to be more of a film for critics than for the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than Sleuth (2007).
