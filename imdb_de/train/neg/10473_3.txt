I looked at the omega code with a group of other Christians in the range of about 15 people. We all expected a good deal of Christian film art. What we got was a painful, lengthy and rather boring attempt to make a movie. It has good-looking production values, but it also has a bad spectacle, a weak script with lousy dialogue and no real sense of direction. From the first 15 minutes on we all knew that it would be a long night. We all hated it and some people in our group called for more cheese than "Anaconda". None of us could believe that the movie took less than 2 hours. Eye-catching effects and crisp cinematography can not save this bad movie. I would give a 3 out of 10, and the rating is just so high, because I rented the vile "movie" Werewolf (1996) the evening before I saw this movie.
