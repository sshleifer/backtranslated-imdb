For me it's just a soap opera. I think that any portrayal of lavish people can be considered a "social commentary." But in the end, I just do not care how you characterize this movie. None of the characters is very sympathetic or captivating. I did not feel chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, she loses herself in the illness. And while Dorothy Maguire witnesses a complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) turnaround on the witness stand, history is not enough to arouse my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology come to the fore, this story is grim, melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is noble in wood. This is Lauren Bacall's least committed role and one of her worst accomplishments. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack provide more inspiration, but their character is mean and pathetic. Robert Keith is the most likeable character as a loving, relentless father of two abused, grown-up children. Most interesting, however, is the strict-looking Robert Wilke in a small role as a bar owner. He is best remembered as a bad stooge in countless Westerns, but here he is an honest, sympathetic guy. I take my social commentary with an interesting, captivating story and a few sympathetic characters.
