For this review a list with good and bad points. I start with the bad. <br /> <br /> Poor points: the casting options (especially Burt Reynolds as boss Hogg), the acting of the ill-chosen cast, the storyline, the idea of ​​bringing the film to the present day, the direction that Cut, the soundtrack and, above all, the idea of ​​making a feature film from a television series whose launch was not so good despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good points: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that's it! <br /> <br /> One could make an analogy here. In the scene where Jessica Simpson stretches out as Enos onto Michael Weston as Daisy Duke asks, "Enos, where are Boss Hogg and Roscoe?" She says in her blunt judgment where they are could have asked just as well : "Enos, is this a good movie?", The red bikini would have pushed his verdict to say yes, even though he said in his head, "No, not really". As well as she looked in the bikini she could have been naked and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film. Stay away from Hazzard!
