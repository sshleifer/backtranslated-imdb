"Giant" is one of the most boring, too-long Hollywood devices of all time. Many scenes seem completely unreal and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted in this big Hollywood production. A central thought in this film, that a rancher would ever drill for oil on his land, is absurd, and I know that because I'm from Houston. A few scenes, especially Dean, who serves Taylor coffee, can redeem this otherwise boring movie. For a much more accurate and interesting account of how modernism has changed Texas ranches, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's big gigs) or "The Last Picture Show."
