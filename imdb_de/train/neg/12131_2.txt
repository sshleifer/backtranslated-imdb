Kevin Spacey is very talented, but directing is not his strength. I had high expectations for the movie before I rented it. Maybe that's why I did not like him that much. I admire Spacey's attempt to make a movie that usually plays in a small environment, but it's not the attempt that counts. I found the movie boring, boring and outstretched. Acting was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done a lot better, especially since he is aware of most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films. The only thing that impressed me about this movie was the one stop of the car accident from the top. The centerline of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved along the line and past the wreckage. However, this recording was very "usual suspects" and my guess is that Spacey had the idea of ​​this earlier movie (which is very good). If you want to watch a fantastic movie set in a small setting, take a look at Hitchcock's lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have seen it before the shoot.
