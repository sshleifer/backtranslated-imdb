This should have been a movie about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk and the equally glorious Olympia Dukakis. That would have been a worth watching movie. Instead, it's a Paul Reiser vehicle with a little falk. The wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie, but you hardly know it. I assume Reiser has the impression that he is a huge movie star and needs a suitable vehicle. He is not. Even more annoying is that Reiser has taken the trouble to put some of the best female character actresses on the canvas and then push them into his background. Dukakis will only be released in the last 15 minutes, but when she does, the screen lights up. The story is about Falk and Dukakis, but we are exposed to a pointless, stupid, absurd road trip in which Reiser has to show how sweet, precious and oh-so-deep with psychological insight (wrong!) He can be. For example, in a restaurant scene in which Reiser hoped to be "Cassavetes-like," there is a ridiculously false confrontation between Reiser and Falk, so obviously ridiculous that I felt ashamed of Falk.
