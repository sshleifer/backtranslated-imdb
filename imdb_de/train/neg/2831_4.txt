I recently saw this with my wife and found that it's better than Caine thinks, even though it's not much cop. Britain's biggest movie actor does not seem to be particularly interested in this role, which is a pity since he could have raised her with more conviction in his play. Rex Harrison seems to be even less disturbed, maybe not surprising, as his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better, but his on-screen time is sketchy and his character is not well written. Beverly Johnson is a beautiful woman I've ever met, but there is little to do. Perhaps the film would have gained a lot if he focused more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically he plays a comic character that does not match the serious tone of the movie. The music is bad and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos (his career has been based on that for decades). Richard Fleischer must be to blame for not directing this more effectively an excitingly unpredictable director, and this is one of his weaker films.
