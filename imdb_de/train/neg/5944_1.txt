Not exactly my genre, this street-to-DVD action is one that I only experienced because a friend put it on while we had some beer. I'm relatively outgoing and a big fan of Eamonn Walker, so I sat back to enjoy myself. Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone, an ex-con who becomes the street fighter for unclear reasons that evolve as the film progresses. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> What a boring movie. I understand that movies like this do not depend very much on the storyline, but do they have to be in such a stupid, predictable and totally silly plot? It may not be important, but gummy bears annoy me. Better no conspiracy and pure action than a purebred flea-magician of a story. Filled with a completely unfounded and relentless sentimental hubbub, it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin-skinned turkey stuffed with rotten guts. I should probably mention at this point, which of course is the drawing point of the film: the fighting. The battles themselves are rather poor. Bone manages to eliminate well-established street fighters in single strikes (one or two big tricks are the ludicrous attempt of the filmmakers to correct this inconsistency); Fighters who never come to the conclusion that one attack after another is a foolish trick. Even this is repetitive and stupid, arms broken and faces with a steady readiness that we see again and again. <br /> <br /> A run of the mill, a movie about numbers that deserves its full value directly to the DVD status, absolutely nothing new and everything we have seen over and over again. And not very good either.
