A young American girl visits her Irish roots and fights against a Druid witch she wants to own. Sounds fascinating, but after an interesting start I got lost and spent most of my time wondering where it would go. The film seems to fluctuate in two directions - do we observe the efforts of the Irish-American woman who fought against her alcohol problem, or do we see a horror movie about a wicked witch returning from the past? The director does not seem to decide. The two do not seem to gel and in the end you will not get anywhere. This could be done so much better and the story seemed to come to an end. That was boring and disappointing.
