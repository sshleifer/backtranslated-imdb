OK, I admit I saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which I'm a big fan of), but I'm not one of the people to automatically rate a 1/10 MST3K movie. Although I hate many movies they play, and some are among the worst movies I've ever seen, I actually enjoyed some MST3K movies. That being said, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. (In fact, it is no wonder that the authors of MST3K themselves commented that this was one of the worst. Do not believe me? Check their website.) <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is a good example of what NOT to do when filming. The dialogue is very bad, the acting is worse, the cinematography is pathetic. The direction (which is perhaps the best in this movie) is bad. <br /> <br /> The tempo is the worst part of this movie. A few times in this movie, the audience had to wait literally minutes for something to happen. Although minutes do not sound like a long time, they can be included in a movie, especially in this one. I'm sure it should create a mood, but I was just very bored. It really felt like ten minutes later. <br /> <br /> If "suspending unbelief" means I'm almost asleep during a movie, "then there's a lot of that, but THE SCREAMING SKULL is so terrible that I could not care about anything at all, what was actually going on in the movie and the "suspension of unbelief" was indeed nonexistent. <br /> <br /> One of the worst and probably most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
