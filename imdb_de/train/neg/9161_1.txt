What does <br /> <br /> production values? ...Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> History? Do not get me started. <br /> <br /> After many years of posting on IMDb, I never thought I would see a movie so bad I really wanted a lower rating. I've always found at least one reason to see merit - if only in the intent or effort of the writer, the director, the cast or the producer. In this case, they are 'It's all the same guy (!) Who really has to get a handle on the matter, at least what this worthless waste of video tapes proves is that he has no talent. I mean, it would be a reasonable excuse if this was the "production" of a junior high schooler for his first movie class, but the named "artist" behind the muck was twenty-six at the time of this miscarriage. <br /> <br /> How was this ever done? Who ever wrote a check for it? Do not be fooled by the cover sheet: there is not even something that resembles a good sex scene or a good "exposure" of the hunt on this cover in the distance. <br /> <br /> Two Final Items: There was a second when this "movie" had a redeeming value: The previously mentioned "talent" is outraged by his lover. I rejoiced And I learned one thing from this "movie". There are times when something is so bad that it is really funny. But not in a funny way; it's just sad humorous. Very sad, humorous.
