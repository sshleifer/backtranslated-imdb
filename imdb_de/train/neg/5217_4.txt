Meet Peter Houseman, rock star professor of genetics at Virgina University. When he's not playing on the court, he blows his head and drops panties in his classroom class. Dr. Houseman works on a serum that allows the body to constantly regenerate cells, making humans immortal. I would also like to be immortal if I look like Christian Bale and have the sweet female love that only VU can offer. An assortment of old and ugly university professors does not care about the beloved Houseman and blocks funding for his project for lack of results. This leads to Peter acting as a guinea pig for his serum. To my astonishment, there are side effects and he gets this, metamorphoses! in something that is embedded in our genetic DNA, which has been displaced for millions of years. He hosts Dr.'s Crush Sally after knowing her for a whole day. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He is a mad little boy. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis is not a horrible movie, just not a well produced one. The whole time I looked at it, I did not miss the fact that this was shot in 1989. The look and the impression of the film are at the end of the seventies. It does not help that it's packed with movies from the '70s, as Metamorphosis is part of Mill Creek Entertainment's 50 chilling classics. There is basically no difference in film quality. The last five minutes are pure bad cheese, which saves the movie for me at least from a lower rating. Pay attention to computer terminology such as "Cromosonic Anomaly". No wonder that Peter's experiment failed. Your computer can not spell! This is worth a look, followed by a trip to your local tavern.
