Do you remember when Harrison Ford was Hollywood's biggest star because he made great movies? These days feel like an ever-distant memory. <br /> <br /> Although "Hollywood Homicide" is by no means terrible, it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy movie. It's a comedy that's not particularly funny, and an action movie that's not particularly exciting. An overabundance of land can not cover the weakest of the central plot. <br /> <br /> Ford seems to have more fun than his recent projects, and he can usually wear the movie. Hartnett is appropriate, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford in terms of chemistry. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Hollywood Homicide" is a rather amusing variation, but just barely. Challenge Ford and it's not even that way.
