I read the back of the box and it was spoken by Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "wonderful! That will be great!" I was so wrong. The story was totally screwed up. Actually, I still do not understand it. It just seems to me that all the characters have been drinking, smoking (Opium?) And having sex. These are not good movie qualities, but please! Where was the story? I got myself to finish the film, and yes, it increased towards the end, but then the movie was almost over. Rent it if you really want. Just do not trust the back of the box.
