"See, I know this is shit right now, but the pain is temporary, the movie is forever, whatever you do now is burned in celluloid for all time and for thousands of years." ?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> This was originally a film for Steven Spielberg, the director who hired several scriptwriters to adapt the script to his themes. So we have a dysfunctional family threatened by a confused monster in the form of a recently released prisoner, Robert De Niro. Like Jurassic Park, Poltergeist, and War of the Worlds, the dysfunctional family is struggling to defeat the beast. The beast is the founding of the father, a lawyer who did not defend De Niro during his trial. <br /> <br /> In typical Spielberg style, the father kills the monster undermining the family and is immediately released from his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and just about every "father" in the Spielberger Land, the father demands his paternal duties in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg likes so much. But Spielberg's picture was eventually abandoned, and the project was instead handed over to Martin Scorsese, who at that time was trying to compete at more commercial prices. The result is arguably the worst film in Scorsese's filmography and, ironically, enlightening. <br /> <br /> The mistakes or dropouts of an artist are often very enlightening and show the inner workings of their art. If the story does not work, the characters do not connect, or the images are not scorched, we find ourselves in a kind of inner core. These ?? The remaining carcass - that's what the director's cinema is all about. <br /> <br /> Now "Cape Fear" is an impersonal movie, so we have no thematic connections to the rest of Scorsese's filmography ("They've already sacrificed." Me! "exclaims De Niro, but the film themes of the Catholic Salvation are cookie cutters.) What the film does is, however, is the kind of language his filmography is hanging on. Watch Scorsese's camera whip up and down desperately, zapping desperately on doorknobs and windows to create tension, and how his characters scream loudly and for attention, but more importantly, look how the film does not give a sense of space.A showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on a nearby sound stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and can not be found in any major There is no context for the picture, and there is no geographical sense of everything in the picture m still create a spatial environment. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is that Scorsese's camera must always be tied to its central character or closely connected. For the world to make sense around the character, his camera must be focused on the character. Resnais can lead you around a French hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance through a street and a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can create a complete cityscape of the future, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and most other directors can create a feel through the combination of close and shot angles, but not Scorsese. There is no poetry in his films, no sense of space. He is all about the character. They break the leash, leave the boxing ring, the taxi, look away from De Niro and everything collapses. He just can not get rid of this very documentary style of shooting, which in a sense is a prerequisite for action film. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to fix this problem with "Gangs of New York". The space and the sets become the central character, but even this self-confident spatial experiment is sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis, with the actor pulling Scorsese's camera unstoppably like a moth to a lightbulb. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Even as a generic B movie, this is an ugly, vulgar-looking movie. Take a look at the dull pictures, the intact tensions, the stupid rotors with special effects and the hard fistfighting showdown. Nevertheless, we have Robert De Niro to make up for the slack. De Niro, who gives Scorsese his body like a tattooed Christ, gives the film his only great scene. In an improvised romantic sequence with the young Juliette Lewis he puts his thumb in his mouth and kisses her. A kind of symbolic rape runs away from the girl, both aroused and rejected by the interest of this man. <br /> <br /> But De Niro's performance, so delicious above the summit, simply can not be imitated by Scorsese. They need the operatic sound and baroque visualizations of someone like De Palma to achieve this. But Scorsese? No. <br /> <br /> Worth a visit.
