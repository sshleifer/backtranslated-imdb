I just can not believe how many people compare this to the first movie. It moved me to leave this comment! This is just an obvious attempt to exploit the success of the first film. The dialogue is appalling and by no means as authentic or captivating as the original film. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the portrayal of the French police ridiculous and the characterization of Doyle a mile from the first movie. br /> <br /> How many drug lords in your opinion personally go to the docks to see a delivery? The ease with which Doyle finds his husband is simply pathetic. Like all French policemen, they only drank coffee until Doyle emerges from America and does real police work. What a joke. Go to a foreign city and discover the largest Crims in the city with a travel map and some tourist pamphlets. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A really terrible sequel, whoever thinks differently is crazy.
