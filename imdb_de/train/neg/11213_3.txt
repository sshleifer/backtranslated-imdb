OK ... I see a lot of bad movies. I am proud of this fact. Often there are some jewels in the B-bombs. But this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. I like a good horror movie ... but one with a conspiracy and a sense of movement. The opening scenes seemed to be pretty good. Decent music and pictures. Then it goes downhill from there. One of the main characters has a disability (tinnitus). Now this threatens to reveal his secret. They were too much in the focus of the film. So, what did he ring in his ears and accidentally leave an earplug where he should not have been. There is no need to bring it further. So this guy has an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the table. Instead of letting everyone know about his affair, he decides to drop the body. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well, after seeing her sister over and over again (as a zombie like a ghost) and even pointing directly at the body, she finally finds her. Now the body is safe and she has to deal with the only suspect who killed her. Bad is that she did not have a big plan. Just to pretend that she was her twin and hit the guy where the body was dumped. The idiot did not even believe he had killed her. So everything is revealed there and even though she had a weapon ... somehow she manages to strangle herself. So the last scenes of the movie show the "ghosts" of her and her twin who are going out of the water. You want to tell me in this movie that the bad guy wins. And not just one but two innocent people are dying. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie: Pictures <br /> <br /> Bad things about the movie: Music sound effects long and elongated plot low action spectacle of some not all actors
