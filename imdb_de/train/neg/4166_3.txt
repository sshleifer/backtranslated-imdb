Complete waste of time .... This movie is not a comedy, it's not a drama, it's not romance ... at least not even a teenage comedy !!! Story ... there should be an end ... but it is so disappointing! If the movie does turn around at the end, I expect that turnaround will make the movie even better (eg, "Fight Club"), but that turn makes the movie even worse ... If I watch teen comedy, and I prefer that I do not often, I expect lousy jokes and a lot of nudity ... Jokes are too bad and there is no nudity ... You have only one ... very good looking I have to admit ... girl, and that's it ! And she has dressed the whole movie! Drama is bad ... like soap series ... do not waste time! There are pornos with a better story and acting! <br /> <br /> (Sorry for my bad english)
