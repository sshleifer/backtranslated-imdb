I'm not going to wrap this movie up for all the myriad technical details, it would take two days to sketch how it's not possible. Others have already pointed out all the relevant stupidities. <br /> <br /> In view of that, I could still have enjoyed it, if not just all the maudlin, disgusting, annoying, wistful Disney feelings that are nowhere so far away, but nowhere more than in space, where the smallest mistake can mean instant death. The "crew" as well as the "real" astronaut were equally guilty of all their fat nonsense above all else. It completely ruined the value left by production. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that NASA let out this junk so that so many people get so much wrong information about something that matters to them. If you have not seen it yet, save yourself the irritation. Take a look at Apollo 13 again. At least that was somehow trying to be real.
