I'm sorry to say that I think it's not really possible for an Enzo to really compete with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The weight advantage of the S7 would be just too big. The S7 has a power ratio of 3.93 lbs / hp while the Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp. The S7 low end is also much better. I'm sorry, Ferrari fans, but the Saleen just get so much better. <br /> <br /> As for other parts of this movie, all I have to say is that it's so inferior that it's pathetic. The story is too weak. The action in this lemon is worse than in daylight. <br /> <br /> I can say that it is a kind of jewel as far as it is a treatise on negative psychology. This film is nothing more than a clear definition of what narcissism and sociopathy are all about. The point is that these rich punks get their stones out of the sky, while for all innocent road users they show only traces of fake remorse when they cause injury or even death. Rating because it did not force me to actually go out of the theater. I also think that an amazingly beautiful blue-eyed brunette, the leading woman, can save her from the utter abyss ... although her vocals would not put her on the cover of "Variety". ps: The guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO the Skid Row version of James Vanderbeek.
