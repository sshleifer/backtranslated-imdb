I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this one. I could not believe the other reviews and I thought it should not be bad to look at it at least once ... but believe me, that's it. But why would you want to make a movie like this new? The basic idea of ​​a good horror movie is that it should either have an extremely smart script or be extremely graphical. This movie does not fall under this one and just stays stupid. I only watched the movie in the hope that it would eventually become interesting, but it never does. <br /> <br /> So this movie is a big NO for both horror movie fans and Cage fans. You could probably turn up on TV for that.
