I really saw and liked the first two. Especially because the second is not just an attempt to make another as good as the first. And it's a story that stands alone. You do not need to know the first movie. I also liked that in the "Free Willy" films. <br /> <br /> But ... the third one here is absolutely useless! I tried it with a friend of mine because we liked the first two. We decided to stop after a good half hour. The movie is okay, there are some funny parts. But for what? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two films. What Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is a tough attempt to have even more fun on the first film than it already had, and tell the story from their perspective. But for what? I would really like to know. You know, the idea that they're both in the cinema and seeing the first one is really nice. What comes next is usually unnecessary. I think a lot of people liked Timon and Pumba, and so did I. For me, however, many parts were very constructed to be funny. No chance, most of it was not funny at all, at least for me. By the way, what was the movie about? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to make the first movie more fun? I tend to choose option B and I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you want to see stories like "The Story Behind Xy" you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" by Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. This is really funny and no attempt to get more out of "Hamlet" than it is.
