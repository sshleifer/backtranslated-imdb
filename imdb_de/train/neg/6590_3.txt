The reviews I read for this movie were pretty decent, so I decided to give it a try. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about a ghost seeking revenge on group friends. The story is stupid, mix two parts of Ringu with a part of Prom Night, a pinch I know what you did last summer, and add a tiny splash of Single White Female - mix it now until it's completely nonsensical. There is nothing new about this plot, and the clich√©s that I have loved so much were not even entertaining this time. This movie jumps too far into the past and from the past, and after I understood everything, I realized that it still did not make much sense. The characters change from a healthy mind to a psycho killer in the blink of an eye. Speaking of characters, they're all your stereotypical favorites - the greedy, selfish lawyer, the egocentric actress, the baseball star, the video voyeur, the bitter girl, the creepy, silent chick, the cute girl, a damn black cat .. and I did not care about any of them. Maybe a better writer could have got the movie working, there were some decent scenes, but overall the movie was a mess. I should also mention a specific "videotape" that would be impossible to shoot. <br /> <br /> This movie is by far not the worst asian horror but it is still pretty bad. If you just want to see some scary pictures in the dark, or just want to laugh out loud at some or just scream, "you're stupid!" on a movie screen or just let another Asian horror beat you in the sleeve, if anyone asks you how many you've seen - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent plan, look elsewhere.
