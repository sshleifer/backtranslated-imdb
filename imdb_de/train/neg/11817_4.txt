A pretty average scifi movie. The plot was more or less obvious from the start. Although the drama was reasonably good, writing was very clichéd and ideas from numerous films were used. The basic idea: Scientists working on a space research platform save a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf They are orbiting. On board you will find a stasis capsule that happens to be random at this moment. After 2 or 3 minutes after the man awakens in the pod, you realize he is a total maniac. Something that completely escapes the research crew's three-member crew ... <br /> <br /> After that, any movie in which a psychotic lunatic terrorizes innocent victims becomes rip-off, and overall, I think Speed ​​2 is a better one Exploration was the topic that I did not think was a good movie. <br /> <br /> No good movie, get aliens out and look at that again. <br /> <br />
