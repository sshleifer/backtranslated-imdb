I give author / director William Gove credit for finding somebody who finances this ill-conceived "thriller". A good argument not to waste money with HBO, let alone cover-art DVDs and blurbs. A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco add nothing important to their CVs, although the artistic direction is not halfway bad. The dialogue will leave you with awe at his imagination; This is storytelling in its worst form. No tension, no tension, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, no nothingness. A couple of attractive and often naked women are boring, but this is definitely a movie that works best as a trailer. I'm sorry for the guy who made this thing green. Good for late at night, only for zones. You were warned.
