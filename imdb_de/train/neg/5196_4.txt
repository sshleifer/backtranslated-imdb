Although technically more polished than the previous film in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, this is a weaker escapade in both an action that is less exciting and a leading man who just does not have the Ray Milland charisma. <br /> <br /> That is, several actors and characters continue their roles and manage to keep the flag in the air. John Barrymore is also present and appears throughout the film in a series of fancy disguises. Anyway, it is another never-ending night for BD as he and his cohorts try to save the poor girl he intends to marry. The hints are stupid, but the supporting actors often make them entertaining.
