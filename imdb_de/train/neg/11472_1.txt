Everything about this movie was awful. In the beginning, this film had a pretty good cast, and I find it impossible to make such a great cast the biggest catastrophe of the gangster movie genre. The soundtrack was like a very bad slapstick comedy. It had this music throughout the movie and it got pretty annoying
