It started with an interesting premise. I like Civil War stuff and old secret societies. The further the movie progressed, the more I realized that this was at best a B-movie. In the last half it quickly became a C-movie, then D, then F, then "I wish this was not a rental car so I could put it in the microwave!" I can not say that the show was awful in every case, only the most. The letter however ... I never read the book. Maybe the book is well written. The script was written by a 10-year-old. It was ridiculously flat, the dialogue was monotonous and uninteresting, the characters as interesting as a 5-pound sack of fertilizer. I really hated this movie, as did my wife. I am a Christian and have no problems with films promoting or supporting Christianity. This movie has done a great deal of damage to the cause. Terrible, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I recommend Superman 4.
