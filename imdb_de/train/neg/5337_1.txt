There are so many negative reviews about "Stay away, Joe," I just can not stand still and let this injustice happen. Here's a page you have not heard before. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's films are, for one simple reason, my guilty pleasure: they are perfect films for pure relaxation, as I do not have to think when I see them. That is, I do not have to worry about missing a complex drawing because there is never a proper drawing to start with. I can just take my shoes off, drink a beer, sit back, turn off my brain, and enjoy all the general craziness and catchy, loose Rock'n'Roll songs from the greatest decade of all. <br />> In my books, "Stay away, Joe" definitely falls into the category "that bad is good". If you are like me and appreciate "the trash value," this is the ultimate camp experience of the 1960s. It's so bad it's almost surrealistic to watch, and if you think it can not possibly get worse, it will surprise you in the most conceivable ways. In the end, you are so amazed by all the new stupidities that you just do not know whether to laugh or cry. In a nutshell: I love it because it's so damn amusing that there was once a generation that really made such films. Still, I still give it 1 out of 10 - as soon as it reaches the 100s, it becomes a bad movie classic.
