Out of shame, out of shame, a good actor like Joseph Fiennes let himself be thrown into this piece of disgusting drip. The movie was not only bad, but really awful and had no redeeming quality. The plot (was there one?) Did not seem to go where. The Russians played stupid kill or kill games, and the rest of the cast should be annulled for their pathetic achievements. I gave up about 3/4 of the way and turned it off. A "1" for terrible only because nothing is lower. Do not waste your time with it, you will not miss anything.
