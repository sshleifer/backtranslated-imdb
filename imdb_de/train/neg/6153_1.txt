Let me first say that I saw this movie as part of a bargain. I was really bored on a nice 1997 day and rode a bike to film distribution. I asked the employee about the worst movie he had in stock. Without hesitation he brought me to "Lucky Stiff". He told me that he would forgo the $ 1 rent (he said it would be wrong to ask for more) if I promised to watch the full movie. So look at me for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is awful. God terrible even. I do not have to go into details of the plot, read the other reviews. The jokes do not make sense. The acting was terrible. I know it should be a comedy, but the main character's stupidity was exhausting. You might try to make it laugh, but it's so bad it's not even funny that way. Avoid!
