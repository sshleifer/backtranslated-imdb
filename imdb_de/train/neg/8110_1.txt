I think Phillip Kaufman read the Notes version of the Kundera novel in the cliff and then set about making that movie. Okay, of course it does not have the stamp of the original. Kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept and his ability to go in and out of stories he constructs. This movie does not even try! The one dream sequence of Terezas, which is so important to the atmosphere of the book, is being reworked and makes no sense. And, and that may be a minor point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks very similar to Ben Stiller in this regard (I know it's not a real complaint, but hey). A perfect example of the Hollywood appearance of otherwise beautiful literature.
