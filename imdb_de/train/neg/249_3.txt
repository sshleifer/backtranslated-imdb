I saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised at how bad this version was. Do not get me wrong, George C. Scott was great as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fail so much. Sometimes I could not stop laughing at the stupid spectacle and the repeated line: "Merry Christmas to all!" At other times, I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a Charles Dickens short story about a rich man who does not consider Christmas a hoax. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts who finally persuade him to celebrate Christmas. I can not understand how this movie was written with such a bad script in five minutes, so good can be rated. Instead of this trash, I recommend the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged. That was funny at least ...
