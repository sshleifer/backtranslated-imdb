This movie was so relentlessly bad that I could hardly believe I saw it. Direction, editing, production and script all seemed to be as if they were made by high school students who do not know so much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sense. Great emotional moments and climaxes (as formerly between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (as hinted at at the beginning) come out of nowhere and are not arranged as if they were made more elegant and effective film. The characters are unfortunately underdeveloped, so it's difficult for us to connect to them. Surprisingly, the drama is not all that bad, but the awful scriptures cancel the relatively convincing performance. The film plays like a particularly bad TV western / epic and sadly reduces the fascinating (true) story that he tries to tell. I have read many reviews that consider the film important for Australian citizens because of the issue. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon does not make the movie any good. Nobody says the subject is not good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was a very important historic event for Americans, but that does not mean I defend the film and say it's good, because it was still bad. All in all a failure, although Heath and Orlando are beautiful to look at.
