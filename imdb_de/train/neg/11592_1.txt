I'm still trying to figure out if the previous rate was worse than this or vice versa. Since I've watched this movie almost fifteen years ago, the fact that I do not remember so much is not a good sign. Maybe it's just because I only saw it once or twice, but I doubt it. If there is anything the movie should remember, you can be sure that I would remember it. <br /> <br /> At the time of this film's release, the franchise was still dying, so it was assigned to him in the media. It's never a good sign that teen pop magazines contain explanations of plot fundamentals. Such an article had to explain that Freddy was too weak to infect the dreams of adult humans, so he decides to pursue Alice's unborn son. So far, so good, but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience. It should not be left to a non-contiguous publication. <br /> <br /> If you take advantage of the trifles made in part three of Freddy's conception, you can half expect scenes to pull that joke out of the "horror for toddlers" category, but unfortunately that should not be. It shows the sheer idiocy of the American rating system that a piece of B'harni-type trash could get the same rating as a truly scary piece like the original. <br /> <br /> At this time, the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, Lisa Wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent action. Or she looks just competent compared to the rest of the cast. Given that her last role was in "All New Adventures of Chastity Blade," I doubt she really had anything else for her. Even poor old Robert Englund has been in better productions than in the past fifteen years. <br /> <br /> With the decline in box office, there has been a steady decline, and not only for this franchise would this be the case. I thought the studios would realize that filtering the films made them non-salable , In fact, just like its immediate predecessor, this film was neutered in such a way that it not only did not attract new audiences, but also managed to alienate the core audience that originally supported the franchise. However, the fifth part must be credited with some merit that he did not have the bright, glowing feeling that made Part Four so insulting. <br /> <br /> I gave A Nightmare On Elm Street a fifth out of ten. By trying to appeal to anyone, or the MPAA's idea of ​​everyone, he manages to address no one. As with parts two and four, one could remove it entirely from continuity, and no one would notice the difference.
