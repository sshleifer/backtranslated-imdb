I ordered the film from Korea because I was a nerd and interested in how it developed. <br /> <br /> After seeing him, I can say that I am ashamed to have had any part of it. I am not only ashamed of myself, but of all the others involved in this mockery of British comedy. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable from start to finish, boring, boring, monotonous and frightening to the point that on several occasions I actually looked away from the screen in disgrace. Until you actually see the movie, it's hard to imagine how unromantic and funny a romantic comedy can be. <br /> <br /> It's not just a bad story, it's a bad movie. In one scene, you actually see a runner or assistant director showing the S.A. devices when they are going through. Details I will post in the section "Goofs". <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it filled me with emotion (disappointment, anger, embarrassment?)
