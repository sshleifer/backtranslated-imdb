I'm a fan of the Nightmare series, but this one is terrible. The deaths are so trendy. If you saw that 20 years later, the entire Nintendo scene is outdated. I like the flashbacks. I think they should have been doing a prequel while he was still alive. That would have been more interesting. This is a movie that you can take or leave. Depends on how much free time you have.
