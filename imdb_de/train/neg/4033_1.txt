It hurts me to write such a devastating review, but that's just how I encourage these people. First of all, just because a movie is made on a small budget, it is not automatically good or lovable. In fact, the small budget in this case is probably the film's only performance by preventing large sums of money on a one-legged racehorse from being wasted with the shit. Have you ever seen a comedy in the theater? Have you ever heard people laugh and think, "what the hell are you doing?" Well, even these dwarfs did not laugh. Halfway it got so bad that my cat took his first bath. This is not a movie, these are kids ... no monkeys make pictures that feel like they're moving to France. I have to go, there's a clown at my door .............
