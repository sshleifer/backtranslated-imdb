I saw mom ... well, she was not kissing Santa Claus right now; He has his hand on his thigh and evil thoughts in mind. That was enough to emotionally scare a boy who wanted to believe. He grew up to be a bitter man who was upset about the quality of the manufactured toys and lack of Christmas spirit. <br /> <br /> In anticipation of a real Slasher movie I was very disappointed that not a handful of people were dying, and there was no nudity at all. What a crap. <br /> <br /> I wanted to have this movie, but it was just too slow and really did not have a good script. I did not expect great acting, but I really wanted some action. There was simply no.
