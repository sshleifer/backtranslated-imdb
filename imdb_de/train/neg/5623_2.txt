Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into an adventure movie "Jack London" is not a bad idea. He certainly led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. However, this film is flat and unsatisfactory. Above all, integrity is lacking. Michael O'Shea (as London) holds a few speeches in London; and it's nice to see his bearded Jack "The Call of the Wild" after spending some time alone in the snow-capped mountains with his dog "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very pretty. The film depicts unfortunate "Yellow Peril" peers between the life of London and World War II, both incriminating and insulting. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (24/11/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
