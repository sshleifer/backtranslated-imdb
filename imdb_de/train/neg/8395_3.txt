- A film crew shoots a horror movie in an old, supposedly cursed house where, over the years, seven people have mysteriously died. One of the crew finds an old book with spells and it looks like it's perfect for some of the ritual scenes in their movie. It is argued that the spells in the book are written better than the script they use. But as the book is read, the cemetery outside suddenly comes to life. Now the cast and crew are faced with real dangers. <br /> <br /> - IMDb lists a runtime of 90 minutes. Nothing happens in the first 60 of these minutes. In a movie too much time is spent on the film. Are we afraid of the horror movie they are shooting? We already know that her film is not "real". These horrors just do not work. <br /> <br /> - There are very few things that can be enjoyed at the House of the Seven Corpses. The spectacle is cruel. Most of these "actors" would have difficulty playing a primary school. The score is terrible. It is very reminiscent of a television series of the 70s and does not convey an atmosphere. Speaking of atmosphere, apart from a few moments at the end of the film, there is none of which one could speak of. The character logic is as good as nonexistent. Even in a movie, you expect the characters to behave in a certain way. I do not think I remember a scene where a character did not choose the most illogical road available to them. And finally, there are the first 60 minutes of the movie that I mentioned earlier. Can you say BORING? <br /> <br /> - I did not rate the House of the Seven Corpses lower because the movie (probably by chance) actually works. My two favorites are the beginning and the end. The opening sequence shows the deaths of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the film. And the final scenes on the massive staircase, while the zombies are threatening the film crew, are somewhat effective (what a sonic confirmation). Overall, these moments are not enough to make this movie a good movie.
