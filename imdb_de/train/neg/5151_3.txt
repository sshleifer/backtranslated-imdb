I thought that was a great idea, but, boy, it was done badly. We have a broad understanding of how complex and challenging the backstage process of a show is, but practically nothing works. The producers seem to have found no way to tell a story or give the viewer a "through line". (That does not mean they have not tried, but the stagehands have a summary of the Ring Cycle, as the program's narrative does not tell us anything about the physical operation of an opera.) We see many Things, but little is said about what people do and why. There is hardly any sense of who is who or how the different production departments fit together. For example, we often hear about a problem - we expect to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it is resolved. But instead, the filmmakers generally just cut across something else (generally pretty general footage from people shoving things or talking in headsets). <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie feels more like a pastiche of images you imagine you are running under the credits of a show, rather than something valuable worth looking out for.
