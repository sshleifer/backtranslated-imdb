"Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon in 1955. One year later he left the jungle ... naked and it took him 45 years to come back." Presumably "Keep the River On Your Right" is "a modern cannibal story". In reality, anyone looking for cannibalism will be disappointed. The first half of the film is more akin to a travelogue by New Ginuea, who mostly addresses native art. The second half relies on still photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but that's about it. Unless, of course, you are interested in home videos of a Jewish wedding or in Schneerbaum introducing his former male lover. I give up. Big disappointment and not really "a modern cannibal story". - MERK
