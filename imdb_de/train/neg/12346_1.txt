The basic requirement of this film is a political caricature. I think for those who know nothing about the realities of the military, this is probably a "feel-good film" on gender equality. A commentator recently commented, "Women are informed by being able to do anything they want." What a punch! Nobody, man or woman can do anything they want and unfortunately Demi Moore "buffing" for SEAL Hell Week in the early 27-week BUD / S program through a few sessions at the local gym and her desire to be alone SEAL just do not do it that way. In the roughest military training program, there is an exit rate of about 80%. These are those who voluntarily disembark, can not assert themselves on a physical level, suffer frequent physical injuries during exercise, or can not handle the psychological harassment. I never got beyond the superficiality of the fictional, supposed message of this film. In reality, Demi would not survive the first 24 hours of this hard and sustained physical training. Wish alone does not do it. Skip this movie as wishful thinking and better read "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001) to see what's really going on in this workout. Ringing, Demi! <br /> <br />
