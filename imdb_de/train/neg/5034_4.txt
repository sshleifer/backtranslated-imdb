I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film and the few reviews that are positive. I saw the movie and was pretty disappointed. I did not find it very pleasant at all. It was slow and lacking in entertainment value. Even the murder scenes are without success, with real close-ups of general knife cuts that do not look good at all. And the supposedly great ending is really not much, I saw it coming, and the end just seemed to be a clich√©. This movie may not be mentioned much, but it is overrated by the little he gets. I would not recommend this movie.
