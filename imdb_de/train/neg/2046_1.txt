I can not believe that this movie even made it to videos and that video stores are ready to put it on the shelves. I literarily asked for a refund. Take the fact that the film has no historical truth, and it's still the worse movie ever found in a video library. It's not even good enough to be called a B-rated movie. Do not waste your money or your time with this movie. Just listing on the voice and terrible music made me sick. Anyone involved in this film should be pulled out of the union, giving a black signal to the industry, but after seeing most of the film, I really do not think everyone involved is a union member.
