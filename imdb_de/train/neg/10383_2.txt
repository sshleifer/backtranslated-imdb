This can be one of the most beautiful movies ever, if you do not take it seriously. It's a bit dated and the effects are lame but it's so enjoyable. There are giant crabs attacking a girl. Oh, and the crabs sing Japanese. It is amazingly bad. And the end that was telegraphed throughout the movie is awfully awesome. Predictable, but if you see the last fight, you will roll in your place. Do not even give this movie a chance and you will love it. Susan George is fun to see and yes, she appears naked. Her daughter is not worth the purchase, but she is attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of big cats. This is a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give him a 7th Did I mention that there are huge crabs?
