Half of the reviews were good, so I took a chance for $ 10. Sure, Priscilla Barnes had some sex talk, but it was not much. The whole conspiracy that she might later become the actress's other mother and documentary filmmaker for the young woman extends him. It's not funny, it's not so slippery, it's not much of a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people who worked in the erotic industry, nothing that has ever happened in the industry. It could be shocking with what is popular these days in adult movies that make fun of today's gonzo videos, and the big orgy that only had 5 minutes to shoot, what a joke a bigger orgy in the had made it bigger and better in the early 70s decades ago.
