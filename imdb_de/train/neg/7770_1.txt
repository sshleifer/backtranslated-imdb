This complete mess of a movie was led by Bill Rebane, the man responsible for the truly infamous anti-classic Monster a-Go Go. As I neared the end of The Cold, I came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was actually worse than the shocker of the 60s. The history ?? how it is? is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to a secluded villa to play a series of macabre games. Whoever manages to keep up the pace and survive to the end will win $ 1,000,000. It's a very simple conspiracy, but Rebane still manages to obscure the process. Things happen. Characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it's over. Funny. I mean, what was it all about? I think you have to draw your own conclusions. Production values ​​and drama are without question a pornographic film standard. In fact, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not even that good. She is so incredibly awful that she is captivating. Unfortunately, one can not say the same thing about this crap festival, it's just a bargain cellar.
