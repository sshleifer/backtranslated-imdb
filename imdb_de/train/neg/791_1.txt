Imagine the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit at a table and one says, "Let a black woman approach an unsuspecting citizen (also black) on the street and ask if he's black, then go away." The other authors laugh hysterically until one suggests they would repeat it in each episode. Even more laughter. Well, if you think that the premise is funny and the show contains many such situations, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more entertaining, such as drying the paint. Those who have written glowing accounts of this show should either come out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny. Another example of humor on the show: A girl tries to pay at a supermarket cashier by trying to hypnotize the cashier. Funny for the first time, but why should it be repeated again and again in different shows with different cashiers? I could give other examples, but these could only be considered as spoilers to say why this comedy is not funny at all.
