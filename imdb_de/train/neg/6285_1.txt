Horror movie ?? really ???? I can not believe how bad this movie was, what was the purpose of this movie ??? the movie is almost 1 hour and 30 minutes and the first 70 minutes of it is just lena, who walks around with her stupid expression on her face after she had an accident ... not much talk, not even much action. I must say, the last 20 minuets had a little miniscule action ... and were still stupid ....... and the end, oh my god, I do not know where to start, it also ends with stupid look on lena face lol .. do not get me wrong i love Lena Headey, i think she is a great actress, but i dont know what made her make this movie ... do not waste your time and watch Because this movie has no story, no acting ... and no sense ... not to mention how slow this movie is and it feels like you're watching it forever.
