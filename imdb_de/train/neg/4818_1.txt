I was about 7 when this DIRE MONSTROSITY of a movie was released. In Britain in the summer of 1977, it was shown on television for weeks on end, as if it were an incredible blockbuster movie. It was actually the first movie I ever saw in a movie theater, and I was deposed for many years. The following week, I was invited to see the new movie "Star Wars," and I refused. To date, I have never seen it to protest that I have to see Sasquatch! Seriously, at the age of seven, I realized that I was watching garbage. It's just so bad, it's almost unbelievable. Rambling nonsense that should NEVER have made it to a movie theater. However, it has amused me to read all those years later that the director has never directed again, just as it affects me. AVOID ALL COSTS !!!
