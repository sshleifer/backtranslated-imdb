Sequels have an unpleasant habit of being disappointing, and the best criterion I can give is that this old tradition is maintained. These three stories are not as good as the original creep show. <br /> <br /> By far the best trio is a wooden idol that comes to life to avenge the thugs who killed their owners. The second story is about a sea monster that seems to be nothing more than floating slopes, and you wonder how anyone could be afraid of it. The third story features a cameo appearance by Stephen King as a truck driver, but otherwise it's a pretty unbelievable story about the victim of a traffic accident coming back from the dead because of the person who knocked him out. Take a look instead the original creep show, or if you've already done so, be happy with it.
