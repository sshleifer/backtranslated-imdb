Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that he was not exempt. I will try to soften that tone. Let us be real !!! Nobody wants to see a Chuck Norris movie in which he is not the main character. In the end, there was a good fight scene, but the rest of the movie stank. I have to wonder if old Chuck just can not hang with the best. Has he slowed down so much that he has to turn out to be such garbage and have to hope that his reputation will carry him through the entire movie? Chuck is a great martial artist, and as we've seen from Walker, Texas Ranger is a pretty good actor, but the trick is to combine those two qualities in his films, and it does not. Very disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, stay a main character in your movies because that does not work for you ... Gary
