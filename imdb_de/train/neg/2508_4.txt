Over time, they released this movie on DVD. I know some say WB is storming the release of this movie because of The Dreamgirls. But how can you speed up the release of a movie that has been in your catalog since 1976? <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, no special feature, no 5.1 DD sound. Come on WB, you can do a lot better than that. The audio and picture quality in this movie requires some serious help. <br /> <br /> It seems WB has not devoted so much time and attention to this movie because it's a black movie and my sales are okay. You could have kept the CD, which by the way does not contain all the songs of the original CD. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this DVD for purchase? Yes, because it's a classic movie. But WB has to add something more special. Take notes from other group films, The Five Heatbeats or The Temptation, where you can only see the performance, and the sound of both is much, much, much better than this DVD.
