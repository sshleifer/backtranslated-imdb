The body of a little girl is found without any identification. If it is determined that one leg is longer than the other, it is believed to be the body of the missing daughter of a couple. After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to sedatives and leads a miserable life. All this changes when one day, many years later, receives a call from her daughter! With the help of a former police officer and a reporter, she sets off to see if her daughter really lives. "Los Sin Nombre" is a complicated plan, moves at a slow pace and is completely unremarkable. The rescue is Emma Vilarasau, who, as a desperate mother, does an excellent job. The best thing about the movie is the end, but I'm not sure if it's worth the rest of the movie. Beware of the English subtitles of the last R1 version - they are not very accurate.
