UPA's films are rated surprisingly well on IMDb, though the animation quality is light years behind that of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM. Due to the rising costs of producing beautiful cartoons with high frame rates and beautiful backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted around 1950) began to dominate in the late '50s and' 60s. After all, the films were dirt cheap in production and they had received several Oscars to "prove" that the cartoons are now mainstream. As a result, lousy animations became the norm and this trend was not reversed until the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This UPA movie is one of the early ones. The characters are very simple drawn (all are simpler and have used stick figures) and the backgrounds were ugly - simple line drawings with very punchy colors (often with a sponge and rarely fill the articles). <br /> <br /> The story is a Jive story with a strong jazz-style attitude. Some will love it, others will find it very, very loud. It's the traditional "Frankie and Johnny" story, and it's probably not a great movie for the kids because of the shooting and everything. Heck, because of the animation and the jazz, it is not a very good movie for me! Some will read my review and doubtless think that I am a crank (which I am to a degree). I love animated films and a bit of this minimalist UPA style goes a very, very long way, and you can not really see them as great works of art - just very, very fast made cartoons. Ignore the Oscars and watch classic cartoons or something else.
