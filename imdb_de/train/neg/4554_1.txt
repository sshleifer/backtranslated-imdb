Bingo is the game, bullshit is the name. Rarely has the screen been smeared with such a bloated heap of half-gray conspiracy theories, Puritan prudery, and New Age gibberish. Much of the story takes place in Viciente, a Christian resort in the Peruvian jungle. Think to meet Tolkien's Rivendell and Planet Baku from Star Trek. Inhabited by scattered followers of a not-so-mysterious but surprisingly close-minded cult of love and peace. Thanks to the gruesome acting and sticky production design (the rainbow-colored visualization of the mysterious all-healing "energy" is especially disgusting), "The Celestine Prophecies" looks and feels like a discarded "Twilight Zone" episode of the 80s. There are plenty of factual errors in church history and nomenclature. I can not believe that Hector Elizondo has agreed to be a part of it. Maybe it was done in Bowfinger style without his permission. May the Lord be merciful to the director, scriptwriter, author of the novel, and poor souls watching the movie or reading the book.
