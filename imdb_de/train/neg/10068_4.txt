A cowboy who sympathizes with the plight of a nearby Indian tribe is falsely accused of raping and murdering the chief's daughter, causing too much hatred and violence. <br /> <br /> This spinner, however, makes fun absolutely impossible to defend at any artistic level. Due to the horrible costumes and the fact that all Indians are obviously white, it seems more like a live action cartoon than the serious production, the press articles pretend that there is. <br /> <br /> In short, the lush nudity (the real reason to see this) is good. Everything else is not possible. There are definitely better examples of both genres. <br /> <br /> More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and not just one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who was probably already in the can for murder at the time, when it hit the soda-stained screens of the Pussycat Theater!
