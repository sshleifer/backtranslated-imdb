I have never seen a movie in such a short time. The only salvation was the fast forward function of the DVD unit. It was like a badly produced CBC movie. There was obviously no money for lighting, filming, sets, filming, scriptwriters, editors, actors ... Oh, there was absolutely no story! I have to write ten lines of comment ... Bad, terrible, terrible, miserable, anxious, convulsive, vicious, evil, morbid, annoying, disgusting, icky, icky, pukey, stinky, stinky, foul smelling, everything -dumbs-down, and I do not know if I can still finish every ten lines how bad that piece of crap-o-matic production was!
