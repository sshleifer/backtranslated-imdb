I'm sure the people watching this move outside of Britian will be a fun watch, but for someone from the UK, it's painful in their mistakes. <br /> <br /> Right at the beginning of the film Elijah Wood gets at a subway station in Bank, which was painted in the trash. He says to his sister he meets "what happened here" and she answers "Oh Tottenham was in town yesterday" !!! Tottenham is already in town ... they are part of the city, they do not have to go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight against other fans, the last place on earth would be the Bank Station, which is likely to have more surveillance cameras than anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> There are a few other similar mistakes, but the biggest mistake for me is the actor playing the lead hooligan. He clearly decided it was not worth talking to an East End accent, and instead opted for a Dick Van Dyke model that blew my ears. It was emphasized by the fact that the rest of his band all spoke as they would have expected from West Ham fans. This mistake made him incredibly in the role and really spoiled the movie.
