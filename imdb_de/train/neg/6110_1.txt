Bo is Jane Parker, whose longtime anthropologist father (Richard Harris in the worst role of a very contradictory career) studies in Africa. She's following him (how?) And he tells her about the stories of the natives of a huge monster whose nocturnal howl can be heard in the jungle. It turns out that this is the ape man (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best dialogues in the film), who saves her from bad guys and falls in love with her horny monkey and cheers. Normally, I am very open to different opinions about each film, but this is the only exception. This is the worst movie ever made. If you do not agree, you have not seen it. (Note: Newsday called it "unendurable"). This is the best one-word summary I can think of. The Maltin Movie Guide comments that they almost had to think about a rating that is below the BOMB.
