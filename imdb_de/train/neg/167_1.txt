Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series or even has a clue about the plot should embarrass himself on this series. The Borg will not come out until Q brings the Enterprise to the gamma sector. The Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk meets them. The NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name. Berman and Pilliar made fun of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett has starred in this episode of Star Trek until this series. I'm not blaming her because she's not involved with this mess. Poor Bakula. He is a great actor, as is the entire cast. I like them all, but the plot is tragic and ignores all the precedents of the original series. Just check the reviews. I think more people saw Deep Space 9 (canceled early).
