This movie is horrible to God. No quality for this movie. You would think that the gore would be good, but it sucks badly. The effects are worse and acting, if you can call them acting, is the worst I've ever seen. This movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and probably runs on a budget of about $ 500. If you want to watch a good zombie movie, check out Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead. However, if you want to see a good cheap shot on video zombie movie like this one, it is much better than the redneck zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It is unsurpassable and meaningless. You were warned. I have nothing else to say about this stupid movie.
