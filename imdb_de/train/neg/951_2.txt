*** May contain spoiler. *** <br /> <br /> If LIVING ON TOKYO TIME was a brave experiment in which real Wanna-Be actors were given film games, on the condition that they need a combination of strong prescription anti-anxiety disease If anti-depression and antipsychotic drugs (this is the classic combination of psychology that makes patients become drooling zombies) during filming, then this film would arouse much more interest. If film production is another type of experiment in which all actors lost their sleep before and during the shoot, TOKYO TIME could be explained more easily. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of lifeless, low-energy actors. In the scene where the new man was sitting on the stairs talking to his sister, it seemed he had difficulty keeping his eyes open. In almost every scene he speaks with his lines and moves motionless with every part of his body. From beginning to end, his facial expression is best described as "sleep close." <br /> <br /> It's not annoying that the actors are talking about each other's lines as these actors can barely finish the lines of dialogue. Everyone speaks in a depressing, monotone voice. No laughter. No screaming. No power No one has enough energy to crack a smile. The result: complete and total boredom. <br /> <br /> And it does not help that the direction is simple and amateurish. <br /> <br /> Avoid this lifeless movie at all costs. Look at GREENCARD, which has a similar plot and charm and energy. Or for an unconventional Japanese romance story, look at the long vacation that has a plethora of everything that LIVING ON TOKYO TIME does not do.
