I also saw this movie about a year ago at a local show. First, I will say that it looks good. Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cameraman. I just wish the movie had been as good as it looks. I would not call that a horror movie. A few shots of a decaying mind do not turn him into a horror movie. There is no secret, there is no tension, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what's going on with both sides of the entire movie. Acting was okay, I think, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the slogan "Revenge can be deadly" .... really? ... you should check how many hundreds of horror / thriller movies have exactly the same slogan? <br /> <br /> It hurts me to say anything about this, but I know a lot of people who have worked on this movie, and I know that they do not want people to smoke up their ass, so give I have my honest opinion.
