Comprehensive virtual reality, the potential of computers, communication with the past, the ongoing struggle to identify your identity in a compelling society, and the mesmerizing Ada Byron Lovelace portrayed by the mesmerizing Tilda Swinton could have been magnificent. But it's bad, terrible, considering the potential! Acting - apart from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - differs from bearable to cruel. The plot construction is, to say the least, unpleasant - the modern programmer is a boring one-note character, but half of the movie is spent building up her character, and when Ada finally appears, they are to tell the events of her life. not to present a compelling story (but Swinton almost pulls it off). You never meet them as a real person, just an icon from a student's history paper. <br /> <br /> The digital effects like a digital dog and a bird are lousy and distracting, considering that this was the case in 1997, not 1985. And finally, the script is just plain bad. Bad, often overbearing dialogue - especially the struggles between the programmer and her friend that made me squirm - cold and distant characters, and zero attempts to create a sense of wonderment. The programmer successfully contacts a person in the past! Amazing! But no one seems to be surprised, and her friend says, "Be careful." (Although we have no idea then or later why it could be dangerous, and it never seems to be really dangerous.) Even though it is computer and Ada Lovelace and her love of mathematics, it is clear that no one, the was involved in the script, had knowledge of math or computers - all references to these topics seem like a complete hocus-pocus that defies any suspension of unbelief. A scene towards the end The film is pretty good, a monologue by Tilda Swinton expressing her grief over the fragility of life, but her joy in this life. Snappy, passionate and enlightening, it seems to come from another film. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with this movie because it is a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult movie. If you find the topic interesting, you may want to rent it but will be warned. See Orlando for another, much better gender role in history with a great performance by Tilda Swinton. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler / question: * * <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Ada asks that her memories not be preserved (in my opinion, the best scene in the movie) , But the modern programmer seems to be doing it anyway and transfers the memories to his little girl (hence the title of the movie). Am I right that the programmer hurt Ada's wishes without defending himself? Or is that another confusing plot point that I misinterpret?
