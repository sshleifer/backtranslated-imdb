As a writer, I find films that are so bad that they are a complete slap in the production. Talk about insult. I wrote better stories in the 8th grade than this one. Bad acting, bad writing, bad governance and taken together, the result is complete and complete failure. <br /> <br /> The only thing that succeeds in this film is to get the unsuspecting consumers to waste their time. Who would write something so bad about green light? It's not artistic, smart, smart, exciting, mysterious, scary, dramatic - NOTHING. The characters are flat and boring without development. The property is as recycled as an aluminum can. They somehow managed to fill some very familiar actors, all desperate for work or hoping that one of those low-budget independent films would become the next "Pulp Fiction". This script should be used to draw a birdcage, not a movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and last but not least, a 5'2 105 lb woman naturally has the power to beat men and women twice her size without fighting and with one hit. <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as if you were infected with a sexually transmitted disease.
