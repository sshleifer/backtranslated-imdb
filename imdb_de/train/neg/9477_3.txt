This was one of the most ungodly wrestlemanias of all time and is only saved by two matches. The hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, also Vince Mcmahon against Shaun Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete flush, and to be honest, I was almost asleep, it was so actionless that the casket match was not worth the Undertaker's complete joke. If you're really a big fan of WWE and missed the first days of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, you're probably going to love this. But I found that Wrestlemania left a lot to be desired.
