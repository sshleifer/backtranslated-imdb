As a big fan of the original movie, it's hard to see this show. The bright set decor and the brightly illuminated sets rob any style of this remake. The mood is never there. Instead, it has the look and feel of so many seventies television movies. Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff, but his snappy wardrobe and the apartment "Swank" do not match the mood of the original or make him an interesting character. He is doing his best to make it work, but Samantha Egger is really a very bad choice. The English accent and Californian looks can not blame Barbara Stanwick's velvet voice and sexiness. Lee J. Cobb tries hard to modify Barton Keyes, but even his performance is just crude, without style. <br /> <br /> It feels like being in the TV movie and reminds me again what a remarkable movie the original is still.
