The Dukes of Hazzard is quite a feat? A $ 53 million movie that's worse than any other episode of a 25-year television program. The plot is usable enough, but the pointless fun is rare to find and the casting is pretty detestable: Johnny Knoxville is more passenger than the protagonist M.C. Gainey's Sheriff Roscoe is a boring thug, Michael Weston's Enos weary, a seemingly ideally occupied Willie Nelson just seems to be waiting for the check to be released, and Burt Reynolds, who sits in a purgatory, where as an old player he still keeps his old movies Boss Hogg is a strange choice, to say the least, but has a good moment with an interjection and a $ 100 note. You know, a movie is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen presences? But worse than the script or casting is Jay Chandrasekhar's hopeless direction: apparently born with no weird timing notions, unable to do much more than simple two-shots and seemingly unaware of how to shoot a chase, let alone a few decent people stunts in the film, he seems determined to rid the film of all signs of life before they are realized. There are a few nice post-modern moments that revolve around the Confederate flag and the stereotypical role of Daisy in each episode, but not a movie that portrays you for the days when Hal Needham directed this kind of (and bad) direction Being a bait, a good movie can be his thing.
