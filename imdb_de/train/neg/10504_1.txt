I could not see more than 14 minutes of it. It's a great combination of really bad acting and really bad direction. The shots are disgusting, they've broken the 180 degree angle all the time. My head hurts, try the charge "You know what?" Dirt on the "Mystery Machine" window lets you see light from the lighting of the windows ... annoying. What else ... it's so poorly framed the whole time that you just want to yell at the lady directing there. I only staged short films, but I'm pretty sure I would be much better than a movie. The story is incredible. Only the long French kissing scene at the beginning tells you that it gets pretty awful. Pretty much, try to avoid these really bad movies at all costs, it will save you about $ 5 for the rental, and you will never get back the one hour hour of your life ...
