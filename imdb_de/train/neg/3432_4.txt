A murderer, a cannibal rapist, is killed by a mad policeman at the scene of his latest murder. At his grave, a cult has gathered with plans to revive him by peeing on the grave. This of course works and he wakes up and rips off the guy's penis and he's back in his old killing ways with a whole new zombie look. The two cops, one of whom is a bit crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem, are back in the case. Two of the original cult members also try to stop the killer by reviving a different kind of totem. I believe they have discarded, but they leave the grave with a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. Sounds a bit confusing, but no, it's just garbage. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible and one of the policemen is the same guy who Dr. Vincent van Gore plays in the faces of the Gore series, and he's just as horrible as the annoying cop in this movie. The other policeman is just struggling to get out his awful lines. Now I'm all for low budget cinema, but this movie is just awful. If the eyes of the ladies and their nudity did not please me, I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a bit of blood, but it is never more than some animal guts that are put on the stomach of the victims. The zombie make-up, on the other hand, looks good and his penile penis, with which he rapes his victims, is sometimes funny. There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the Chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy on a fishing line. <br /> <br /> The end is extremely bad. They would expect the killer to fight much more than he did. God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
