Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a little cartoon with lots of fun (but outdated and exaggerated) Bush jokes. Apparently I should have lowered my expectations even further. <br /> <br /> The letter was absolutely pathetic. Apart from the Cheney chicken eating joke and a few tiny, tiny wipes, it was really boring and inglorious. <br /> <br /> The animation was about as mature as the flash project of a thirteen-year-old boy. It's a shame that they used Macromedia's product because it can do so much more. <br /> <br /> I do not like Bush so much and I like a Bush joke just like the next man, but this was just half an hour slapping the President with some painfully unenthusiastic moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done so much more with That's My Bush. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, skip "Lil 'Bush" and buy a copy of the short-lived comedy "That's My Bush." You will thank me.
