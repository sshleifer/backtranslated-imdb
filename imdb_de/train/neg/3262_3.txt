I was fortunate enough to meet George Pal at a convention congress shortly after being released (and still have my DS: TMOB poster signed by him), and asked him why he chose the movie "Camp." decided. Before he could answer, two studio freaks intercepted me and taught me how the studio "knew best" and how "nobody would take such a movie seriously". I had read the Bantam reprints thanks to a friend for several years (ComiCon participants of the 70's will remember Blackhawk and his band, I was with him in a few years) and had bigger hopes than we had <br /> <br /> The Flacks insisted that never a serious adventure would be made serious, and so the "camp" was the only way. Some other fans jumped on my side and Pal listened as well as he could. At the end of the small event, Pal came to us and apologized. He wished he could have done more and better. STAR WARS brought the lie and a year after Pals death Spielberg and Lucas has proven that Doc Savage could easily have been the next big film series, if not the flack had been. <br /> <br /> Out of the memory or the story of Doc, and the movie would have done it worth a 6/10 rating as nothing but a thoughtless popcorn seller. <br /> <br /> But the destruction of this heritage was no less disgusting than killing a baby in the crib. <br /> <br / Doc Savage can still appear on the screen and survive the inevitable comparisons of the unfit with Indiana Jones, but it would have to be done with all sincerity and sincerity to reclaim the fame that we expect from the first American superhero should. <br /> <br /> SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it's much more serious. Yes, simultaneous recordings were made, but most were shots and very few with actors. And yes, there's a piece of Ron Elys jumping over a brick wall and shooting something over his shoulder with a specially crafted bronze pistol. Ely wears a duster over a white button-down shirt with a bronze tie and the words "DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL ... Coming Next Summer!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who is the studio that escorted George Pal to the convention in San Diego in 1975, beat the idiots on the side of the head and call them the idiots they are. At that time they made Dorknobs and Fu Manchu in stripes and wide canvas pants and wore Paramount portfolios.
