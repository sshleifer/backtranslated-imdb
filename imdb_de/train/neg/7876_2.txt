During a panel discussion that I attended after watching this film, the filmmakers stated that this should not be seen as a movie but as a food for thought. Well, the only thoughts I provoked were the time I wasted on the movie. The film's gimmicks (documentary style, futuristic setting) served as a distraction from what should be a thoughtful exploration of the abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use film as a platform for their political views - usually a very boring movie preaching to the choir.
