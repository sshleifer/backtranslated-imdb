OK, the company of Mr Agrama (involved in a dubious business with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi) has produced a terrible mish-mash of Mr Carl Macek. What's this terrible mish-mash I'm talking about? Well, Macek took three completely independent Japanese sci-fi animation series (namely Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada) and added TONS to the dialogue. The whole thing was heavy for violent content, he added some metaphysical hoaxes and called it some of the worst spokespersons of the Hell (Reba West's vocals have been and still are unbearable and total outrage, especially in comparison to Mrs. Mari.) Iijima) ... And the result was an episode of 85 episodes with hundreds of through-going problems and plummet holes. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Mecha were cool (especially those of the "Macross Saga"). ) and the intact parts of the plot were good. But what was good about Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or the "vocal talents" he had recruited. It was because of the efforts and efforts of the (uncredited - why? Would I be too brave to blame HG for plagiarism?). Those of us who finally wind up and compared the originals to Robotech now wish we had never come in contact with Robotech. The originals are of course much better and make a lot more sense. <br /> <br /> Robotech, however, has been worthwhile: It has led legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to launch a campaign to protect Japanese anime creators' intellectual property from such unauthorized and unrequested revisions, the talentless Produce people like Carl Macek.
