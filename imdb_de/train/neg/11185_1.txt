Yes, with MTV, there really is a way to market Daria. What started out as a smart teens - "Comment on anything that complains the viewer about the sucking teenage life and makes the audience feel better," the sitcom now mutated into a "How to deal with your problems" - Charade. I have always seen Daria and I really liked it. Now, after seeing the so-called "movie," I can only wonder what the meaning of everything is. Daria tells us how to lead life in school? Excuse me? Was not it the point that Daria made each episode so that what you like to do is fine as long as it's okay with itself, no matter what the rest of the sick, sad world thinks about it? The whole thing reminded me of the scene in "Reality Bites", in which the film channel shows the documentary for the first time.
