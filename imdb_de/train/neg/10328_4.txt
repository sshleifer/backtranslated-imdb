I think the show had a pretty good concept to work with. But the execution was bad. The script is bad and the acting is bad. There were many problems that could be better understood, such as protesting against marriages with gays or finding the graveyard. The show can not really be called a comedy show because it lacks miserable humor. I should say that this show was hardly successful in determining the life of the Muslim community to some extent. So far the second season is worse than the first. I had high hopes for this show, but I was kind of disappointed. Still, I appreciate CBC for putting such a concept in front of the audience. Nevertheless, I wish good luck for the future.
