Strangely, almost all reviewers are very positive about this movie. Is it because it dates back to 1975 and that Chamberlain and Curtis are included in it and therefore forgive the sometimes very bad acting and childish narrative? <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because some people get sentimental because they read the book? (I did not read the book, but I do not think this is a problem, filmmakers never assume that the audience read the book). <br /> <br /> Or because I'm unaware that English-speaking actors are trying to behave like their French counterparts?
