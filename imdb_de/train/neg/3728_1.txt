As some other comments show, this movie could scare you when you're a little kid. (And that's probably all it's good for.) <br /> <br /> But if you're older, this movie does only one thing: suck you mainly - and I do not mean acting, its soundtrack, cutting or s.th. like that. I'm just talking about the "conspiracy" (if you can call it that). <br /> <br /> SPOILERS continue ---------------------- <br /> <br /> I do not want to give more spoiler than necessary (if You still really want to see this movie after reading it), but if you have completed a school, this is just a big insult to your intelligence. Looking at it, I was stunned most of the time because what was happening was stupid. <br /> <br /> These include: <br /> <br /> -the formation of UNITE (a nasty bandage) <br /> <br /> -> we should just believe it's evil. is it evil at all? If so, why is it evil? <br /> <br /> -The trace of the evil in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> -> there is no need to impose this on humans, so why the hell (no pun intended) do they? <br /> <br /> Remembering Christ in your heart just as a lip service. <br /> <br /> -> Because there is no one who is considered a "real Christian" in this movie, besides, to say the stupid prayer , So ... just say this prayer before the Rapture and you're saved - no matter what ?! <br /> <br /> Therefore, rating 1/10
