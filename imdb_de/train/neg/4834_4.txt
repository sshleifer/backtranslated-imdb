I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's movie with great anticipation of the endless hype and 6 Oscars that were awarded to him. Unfortunately, it is really not a good movie. The depiction of the situation seemed secure and credible in all respects, but beyond that, the story seemed incomplete and the direction of the film seemed uncertain and accidental. The actors have gone to great lengths, but for me, I did not really understand what the movie was supposed to be. It's not as atmospheric and gripping as the Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as the Band of Brothers, not as action-packed as anything. I certainly can not understand why it was so much nominated, and why people "lift" it to that epic scale. However, given the caliber of films in recent years, I think there is not much to choose from.
