I recently stumbled recently and read the latest reviews because I thought I could handle an average movie. This movie was a bit below average, but still visible. The script was poorly written and the acting was average for a B-level movie, with a couple turning out to be pretty good. The plot is close to that of Saw, teaching people what they did wrong in a situation and trying to make them appreciate life more, but that's where the comparison ends. Nine dead try to have heart and mind behind simple ideas that are not new. The main flaw I found in Neuner Dead was the blow to the viewer, which occurred three minutes ago in the film before flashbacks and was completely unnecessary, and a totally inadequate ending that people badly do not see coming. Apart from spoilers, I have seen worse movies and even these have not ended badly. Decent movie, bad drama and end ...
