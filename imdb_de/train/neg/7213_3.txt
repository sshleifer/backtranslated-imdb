While I think The Exorcist is a horror classic, I have to admit that I do not rate it as high as many other horror fans. As a result, I have not seen many of the exorcist rip-offs, and if Exorcismo has anything to offer, I have to say that's a good thing, since this movie is so boring and definitely worth ninety minutes worth! For the sake of fairness to the other exorcist prints, this is often considered one of the worst, so maybe it was not the best place for me to start. It's not hard to guess what the conspiracy will be: basically it's the same as in the exorcist and sees a girl being seized by a demonic spirit (who happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then asked to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror movies, this one plays Paul Naschy, who is pretty much the best of the movie. Exorcismo was led by Juan Bosch, who previously led the inferred Spanish Giallo "The Killer Wore Gloves". I have not seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality was not one of his strengths. I can not say much good about the movie itself. Mostly it just tramps around and the exorcism scene is not worth the wait. I can not recommend it!
