This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The DVD was made available to me free of charge with an order that I had placed online for non-DVD related items. No wonder they were given away. As some reviewers say, they found it scary beggars, the person who puts them in the worst five films of all time, it just right could interfere with this garbage is unbelievable. Mostly toilet humor and bad done. <br /> <br /> Those who want to be entertained should avoid this at all costs.
