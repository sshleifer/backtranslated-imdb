This movie is poorly designed, poorly played and poorly written. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is terribly annoying and can not escape the same routine of Napolean Dynamite. Selfish and ignorant. <br /> <br /> In addition, Diane Keaton plays the same superhuman mother who cares too much and does not care enough about her children's life (see Because I said it). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although I generally like her, also plays a dirty idiot in this movie. Jeff Daniels is passable, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please skip this movie if you want to keep your soul.
