THE KING MAKER will undoubtedly be a success in Thailand, where the similar (but superior) "The Legend of Suriyothai" set cash records. The film, directed by Lek Kitaparaporn based on a 1547 script by Sean Casey, has some amazingly visual elements, but is disarmed by one of the most insane, pedestrian scripts and story development in the film. <br /> <br /> The event referred to in the picture is the arrival of the Portuguese lucky soldier Fernando de Gamma (Gary Stretch), whose revenge for the killer of this father drives him to shipwrecks, captured and slavery It is acquired by the beautiful Maria (Cindy Burbridge) with the consent of her father Phillipe (John Rhys-Davies), a man of name and past who is revealed throughout history. There is a plan to oust the King and Fernando and his new Siamese buddy Tong (Dom Hetrakul) after some CGI chilographers first rewarded their superior martial arts idiocy when his bodyguards were first rewarded, only once with the Queen Sudachan (Yoe Hassadeevichit) reveals her intention to kill the king and son so that her lover Lord Chakkraphat (Oliver Pupart) can take over the reign of Siam. Of course, Fernando and Tong escaped and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families (Tong's wife and children and Fernando's now-long-lasting love affair with Mary) with the expected consequences. <br /> <br /> The acting (with the exception of John Rhys-Davies) is so weak that occasionally the film looks like it's in storage. The predominantly Thai cast had difficulties with the poorly written dialogue, so we wished they had subtitled their Thai origin. The music of Ian Livingstone sounds like exhumed from old TV soap operas. But when it comes to visual splendor, there are plenty of them, and that alone makes the movie worth seeing. It's a movie that obviously has a lot of financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions. Only the basics are missing. Grady harp
