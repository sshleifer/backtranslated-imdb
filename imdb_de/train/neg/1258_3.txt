Warning: Spoilers Galore! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, who is reshaping this Sui Generis movie, is about as sensible as the remake of Psycho - oh, that's right, an idiot did that - I think my case is back , <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a chimpanzee nose that interferes with a simulation, proving he's not that smart right from the start. Marky Mark appears in the recording without showing his signature underpants. Then he is rejected by a simple woman who prefers to touch chimpanzees. <br /> <br /> The trajectory with which the space station Saturn orbits for no apparent reason in the interior of ship driving with genetic experiments on monkeys. Do we have to travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to carry out these experiments? The special effects team has a decree. Marky's chimpanzee loses in this issue of the sci-fi cinema of the 60s - the Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the incredible awkwardness of the space station by stealing a pod without anyone noticing. At the same time, he demonstrates his mischievous stupidity to install a space rescue mission into a wormhole for a consumption test chimpanzee with a million-dollar vehicle. Limited fuel and oxygen supplies. <br/> <br /> Before anyone can say "Pointless Remake" Marky surfed the wormhole, crashed on an alien planet, removed his helmet regardless of the deadliness of the atmosphere, and was chased through a soundstage that was almost Like a lush rainforest, it would not be the Kliegs lighting up the plastic trees. <br /> <br /> Surprise! It's APES that makes the hunt - or at least * would * have been a surprise if no one had seen Planet Of The Apes thirty years ago. Since Marky Mark could not show his chest, pull down his pants or break his lame whiteboy rap, he was without character. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth, which were used askew, helped immensely to determine * his * lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (also known as the Irritating Chimpanzee Activist), who lost without a Shakespearean script, beat both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutouts. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, secured the role of symbolic comic relief and interspecies. Although I have not gotten out of hand with puns related to this film, a headline has captured the essence of this "Planet of the Apes": "The Apes Of Roth." While everyone else was looking for miniboys from One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth chews vast amounts of scenery as Chimpanzee Thade and flings Kaka magnificently. As entertaining as his account of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a plot: Thade is crazy when we meet him for the first time ... and at the end of the movie he's pretty much on the same level as crazy. Nice twist. <br /> <br /> The original POTA (1968) contained a protagonist, Charlton Hestons Taylor, who was so disappointed with humanity that he left the Earth for space without regret - but as this movie progressed, Taylor was unknowing was caught in a battle to prove the value of humanity - as their only champion! The original film was ultimately a story of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he realizes that his species is NOT prevalent. Is there anything that is so cerebral or ironic for Marky Mark Leo? Or Roth's Thade? No, but there is a lot of running. <br /> <br /> The slogans call: Take Back The Planet. But it is the planet of APES. In this film, humans and monkeys ended up, and humans have become cavemen, so that the monkeys receive language and sensual armor. the monkeys deserve to inherit the planet! Marky Mark assumes in true anthropocentric arrogance that humans MUST have the apex predators just because they are there. "Returning" is as ridiculous as the monkeys that landed here in 2001 and complains: "A planet where people from APES have developed !! !!" and then caused problems with their overreacting and hairy anuses. <br /> <br /> Heston was cast in the POTA in 1968 because he had established himself as an outsider: he was Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! To call him a dumb, dogged beast in an alien society was to numb the expectations of an audience: how crazy must a world be in which Our Man Charlton can not respect them? Marky Mark has just stated that he has tight underpants. <br /> <br /> Although Heston was constantly vilified by the Monkey Council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and his amazing exaggeration. When Marky Mark tries to give zeal to the Mongolian people, it's like an unpopular guy in school who suddenly turns into a lesson monitor. He tells you to stop drawing penises on the board and you throw a shoe at him. Burton tries to make Marky the icon of humanity, but he comes out as a trembling dissenter. In the original film, the monkeys consider Taylor to be deviant, but he was an icon of humanity for spectators and apes alike. Again this irony. <br /> <br /> It was true that a guy who put the stage chewing on a acting technique - Heston - was supposed to play the father of Primo scene croon Thaddeus Roth of that movie. As Roth's monkey father, Charlton speaks his own immortal lines and this time turned against the humans: `Damn! Damn it all! '<br /> <br /> The film ends up being stupid and stupid. While Thaddeus gives Marky a damned lesson, a pod descends from above with Marky's chimpanzee. Monkeys prove their lifting study by bowing in awe to this undiscovered creature, while Marky proves his own lifting study with marbles, "Let's teach these monkeys about evolution." First, they are not monkeys, you monkey! Second, it was genetic manipulation and imbecilic plots that brought the monkeys to this point, not evolution. And what you want to teach them by blowing them away with the hidden lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution. If you give away twist ending, viewers will only get confused if they believe that Estella Warren's half-nekkid role was indeed an integral part of the storyline (still my pants). <br /> <br /> No matter that he was the last subordinate hope of humanity; In the end, Cop monkeys bring Marky to Plot Point Prison, where he had last heard, "It's a madhouse! A MADHOUSE !! ... '
