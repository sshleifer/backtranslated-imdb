This movie has all the traits of too many cooks spoiling the stew. Based on Shielah Graham's autobiography, it seems that the forces that would be could not stay alone well enough. They could not decide if this was Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and how much they should soften the story of whoever turned out to be the one. A film that could have been a story about two intriguing (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Graham) personalities becomes a bleak, disjointed soap opera about which we are also rarely told. In addition, there is absolutely no other feeling than in 1959. An awkward scene follows an awkward scene, and we do not know where we are in history or how much time passes. But - and that saved the movie for me - Kerr has never looked more beautiful and Peck is as always a very handsome man. They are really a beautiful, mature couple and I just wish they had better material to work with. There's a scene that works - Scott dribbles after Shielah, and seeing these two normally sophisticated stars bump into each other is very disturbing and gives a glimpse of what's going on in a relationship like hers. Apart from that, the film is a wasted opportunity and is far from the classic stature of other forest soaps of the 1950s (PEYTON PLACE, THE BEST OF ALL).
