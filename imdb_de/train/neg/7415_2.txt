What do you call a horror story without horror and history? <br /> <br /> That's the most annoying thing about the movie: I feel like the authors never really decided what's really going on in the movie! It's another thing to know, to give tips to the audience and not to give it away completely, but here you feel that the scriptwriters do not know it, the characters in the movie do not know it and the audience sees nobody knows ! (Remember "Cube"? Even this movie knew more about itself.) <br /> <br /> I've consumed a lot of horror / gore movies of the 80's and this movie certainly has its roots in these movies , But many important things are missing. We really do not know anything about the characters. They keep repeating empty lines. The story does not really develop - it never goes anywhere. B-acting is fine in this kind of horror movie, but there is not much to do in the script. We are not interested in the characters. There is nothing to remember about them. There is not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. And most importantly - no thrills, no showers. <br /> <br /> You get only a few common elements of the horror movie genre. They show the Lordi monsters one after another, but their characters do not really add to the story. <br /> <br /> I really believe that this amount of story, character development and atmosphere can be achieved with a minimum crew size and equipment. Oh yes, the filmmakers did that - and more - 20 years ago! I felt the common embarrassment of the audience when the movie came to an end. A real shame.
