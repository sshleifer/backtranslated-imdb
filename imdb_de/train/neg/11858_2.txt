I'm a fan of Matthew Modine, but this movie I came across via cable is absolutely funny. I see that scriptwriter and director were one and the same, so no one was around to investigate their worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines and no original signs. The goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character. What a waste of all the acting talent. Given how expensive it is to shoot in New York these days, I have to wonder how it was done. And if you're wondering why I even saw it, it came after a movie I like about the cable, and I left it on the computer while I was working. It is not a very demanding picture!
