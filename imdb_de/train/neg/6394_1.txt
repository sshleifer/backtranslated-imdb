This movie was bad. This movie was awful. The acting was bad. The attitude was unrealistic. The story was absurd: a comet that appears once in aeons appears one night. The majority of the world's population chose to observe this comet. The next morning, however, all but a select few have been dusted by the radiation of the comet. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants that are still alive, but people have been turned to dust. No bones, nothing. That's ridiculous. How can radiation burn people but leave their clothing and other biological substances intact? <br /> <br /> Even better, the comet has turned some people into zombies that eat monsters. Her make-up would not have looked like a newborn even scary. The crazy clown posse scares me more ... and they're supposed to look stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there were the survivors. People surrounded by steel as the comet passed by were spared zombie domes and death. How can steel block the radiation of a comet that supposedly burns people in its tracks? <br /> <br /> Equally offensive is the horror music of the 60s, which is played in the background by parts of the film, or the hair rock of the 80s, which serves no purpose the film and lets you turn your TV. <br /> <br /> However, the stupidest part of the film is the characters he focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were absolutely unrealistic. Who would plunder the day after an apocalypse, where carnivorous mutants roam everywhere? There were four five-minute horror scenes throughout the movie, and most of them were dreams. Between these scenes, there is an uncomplicated dialogue that makes South Park appear intelligent. The silence between the elemental dialogues was painful. I could have done a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of cheetos. Never watch this movie.
