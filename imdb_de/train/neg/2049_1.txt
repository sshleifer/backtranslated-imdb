At least I could make fun of the movie, which is surprising because I could barely prevail. To be honest, I appreciate that the cover of the DVD case costs more than the entire movie. And to say that it's the same director as The Boogeyman when a new version came out ... nice guys, it was misleading enough to hook me imitators was his haircut. Normally you only see this type of hair with a ten-year-old boy, and the character behaved like that. The film looks like it was made by a graduate of a film school who was looking forward to using every film technique he had ever learned during the lesson ... sometimes less is a buddy. Through and through, I would be lost by random plot twists that were nowhere to go or inexplicable. All of this makes a bad movie, but if the end is not close to bringing it together, it's an exceptionally bad movie. Undoubtedly, this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and that includes the French graduation video from my friends for the high school year. But maybe I'm a bit biased. I mean, I could play an extra. P.S. I do not even think that deserves a star ... not even half. NO FOR YOU !!
