Any movie that has nude scenes of Karen Allen and I'm still so bored that I'm going out, that's a stinker! <br /> <br /> Karen gets stuck in Paris and makes friends with a handsome Frenchman with whom she soon has sex. Of course he is married ("But, Cheri, why should that be a problem?"). What could be an interesting clash of cultures (believe it or not) is just boring. I went out <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie got a lot better after I left. but it would have to be a lot better to make up for a lazy beginning. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself running, do not go for the exit. Save time and energy. The safest way to save your money. It's a shame that the production company did not save their money.
