I'm a big fan of writer / screenwriter Michael Chabon. His novel "Wonder Boys" became a fantastic film by Curtis Hanson. His masterful novel The Amazing Adventures of Cavalier and Clay won the Pulitzer Prize a few years ago, and he co-wrote the screenplay for Spider Man 2, arguably the biggest comic film of all time. <br /> <br /> Director Rawson Marshall Thurber has also staged wonderful comedies, such as the good-natured "Dodgeball" and the ingenious short film series "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". And with cast members like Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, this seems like a breeze. <br /> <br /> That's it. Literally. <br /> <br /> Jon Foster plays the lead role as Art Bechstein, the son of a gangster (Nolte), who recently graduated in economics. Jon is in a developmental deadlock: he works at Book Barn as a minimum wage, has a bad relationship with his girlfriend / boss, Phlox (Suvari), which means little more than plenty of sex and plans to take a career for which he has no other Has passion. One night at a party, a former roommate introduces Jon Jane (Miller), a beautiful, smart violinist. Later that night, they go to cake, and she asks Jon a question that shakes him off his catatonic state. "I want you to tell me something you have never told a single soul, if you do, it will happen, make that night immortal." Jon tells her a recurring dream of him walking around in the city sees the faces of strangers passing by, but none of them looks him in the eye. "I imagine it must be the way death feels," he says. <br /> <br /> The next day, Jonah's wild friend Cleveland (Saarsgard) abducts Jon from work and leads him to a huge abandoned steel mill and soon Jon, Cleveland and Jane spend every waking moment performing punk rock concerts Drugs and drink a lot of alcohol. This does not go well with Phlox, who urges Jon on a more personal relationship, namely that he can meet his new friends and father. The film then tries to take us on Jon's journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father Phlox and his dead-end job, while finding freedom and expression through his relationships with Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br There is a problem that we follow Jon throughout the movie: He is completely uninteresting. He has no ambitions, passions or goals. He goes through life like the invisible spirit he described Jane the night they met. This is not a problem at the beginning. But he never gets more interesting. He is a completely passive character. He just follows the Bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but he never gives us any idea of ​​what interests him or what he wants to do with himself. <br /> <br /> As a result, the movie and its supporting characters have nothing to do and nothing to do except celebrate, have sex and quarrel. In other words, a lot of noise for nothing. What we have here is the flat skin of a good movie with no inner workings. Thrilling cinematography, cumbersome voice-over with characters looking into the distance, many sex scenes, straight and gay, big fights, more raging sex, a chase scene and a tragic death ... but it does not seem to matter. Ironically, Jane asks at some point, confused by Jon's aimless actions, "What's up, Jon? What's that all about?" Yes, Jon, say it. We in the audience really want to know. <br /> <br /> The title "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" must refer to the characters themselves, because that's what they are. They are all facades, one-dimensional representatives for people. The movie never lets us in. We never know why one of them is ticking. We see that they do many things, but we do not know why. And the absence of the "why" is one of the worst things a movie can have.
