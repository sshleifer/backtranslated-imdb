What a fucking movie! The worst of the worst! This movie is as entertaining as a dead ball. No talent-what-ever-actor, stupid act. Who wrote this script?! Was there ever a script for this stupid movie or did the director accidentally press the capture button on his camera and then decide to rework the movie? Is this supposed to be a children's movie or a comedy or something? My younger brother is in 6th grade and he and his classmates have just shot an amateur movie for their school project that has trumped this geeky movie. There is no excuse for this movie!
