Unlike most other commentators, I deeply hate this series. <br /> <br /> It looks interesting at first sight, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes up to the last episode. In the end, I still did not understand what the alien attacks were about (maybe I missed something, who knows?) And realized that I'd eaten through 26 episodes that were mainly the characters' own self-loathing. Selfishness and self-pity. In fact, it alternates between alien / robot fights and those dark, depressing blink-on-and-off scenes where one or more characters can say or scream "I hate me / you / them" 10-12 times in a row /> < I can not see either Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters) showing growth or change. (I also can not see other characters learning or growing.) I wanted to kick them and tell them that they should have a bloody life during the first few episodes, and the feeling has not changed over the last few episodes. Shinji really has the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry rather than charitable, and Asuka is such a vexatious knack that every time she came in sight I wanted to smash the TV screen. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything and often say it veeeeeeeery. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I'm a big fan of Anim√© and Manga, and I've never liked one so much. I read that the creator / author of the series wrote this when he was suffering from depression, and I can believe that. it made me feel depressed to see it. Is that the goal of this series? I honestly ask. Is it designed to confuse and upset the viewer? And if you're suffering from depression, why not just write a book or biography instead of mixing it with aliens and mechas? As far as I could tell, this alien warfare was nowhere. <br /> <br /> Finally, since I'm really fascinated by how many people claim to love this patchwork of dead-end plans, I can not help it, but I wonder how many of them really like it and how many say that they do it because they have been told that it is.
