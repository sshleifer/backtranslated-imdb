This bad remake of the classic from 1963 starts off pretty well and then replaces the tension with confused and pointless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the coolest moments is when Nell and Theo lie side by side in two single beds and listen terribly to the sounds outside their room. Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand for hurting her. Then Nell looks over at Theo, who is several yards away, and realizes that it was not Theo holding her hand. In the latest version, Nell lies alone in bed when she suddenly jumps out and slides across the floor. Only when she invites the invisible force to stop pulling her does it become clear to us what has happened. And can anyone explain what Nell's last words mean - "It's about family, it's always about family"? <br /> <br /> The only redeemer is Lili Taylor's performance, but even that can not save the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones shows once again that there is little depth beneath her pretty exterior. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. Zeta-Jones has to express it, for example, by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend or a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Definitely one that should be placed on the pointless Remakes graveyard.
