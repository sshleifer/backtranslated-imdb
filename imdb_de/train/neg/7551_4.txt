Well, finally I saw the remake last night in London, unintentionally funny, sexless and without real humor. I do not know where to start, while this strange homage entertained me, it did not really move me. The acting is screaming hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are much too "Disney", there is a ridiculous insert "six months later" after the burning of Nic Cage (which did not come fast enough for my liking) with Cage im Bear suit suppressed the audience's joy, as well as the comedy that was punched out of various "bad guys" on the island. It's such a strange remake that I can not believe I saw it. It reminded me of something The Comic Strip did in the 1980s, a bit like her Hollywood interpretation of Miner's Strike, very strange!
