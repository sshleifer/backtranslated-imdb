I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately chose this version. Everything from acting (the performers deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close-up shots ... no landscape shots and very little background image in the shots) were absolutely terrible. I saw this during my spring break and I can say for sure that I felt like I lost 114 minutes of my vacation. Recommended by no imagination.
