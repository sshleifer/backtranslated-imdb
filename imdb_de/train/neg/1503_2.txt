That's incredible! Fidani (who was also a spiritualist) was one of the cheapest directors in the world. This movie has the original title of Leone's "Duck you sucker!" But tell the boring story of a Pinkerton agent against the killer "Testa di Ferro" (the unlikely Gordon Mitchell, a stuntman). Everything is poor and crazy in this pelicula, which was filmed in the lovely landscapes of Lazio. The story is both bad and crazy. Fidani was not capable and at the same time ingenuos. Some crazy, illogical things went into the story (like the discussion in the sheriff's house and the demeanor of Butch Cassidy!?!?!?!?!? Yes, really Butch Cassidy, portrayed as an idiot). Terribles nuit americaine, absurd behaviors, illogical conspiracy, bad acting and a fleeting performance of one of the most acclaimed presenters of Italian television history, Renzo Arbore. Ah, of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes, it's great and terrible, but I'm sure he was only there for money and playing with iron horses. 2 out of 10, but ... DO NOT MISS IT !!!!!
