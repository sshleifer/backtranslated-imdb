As with many other Pop Culture franchise series, this line did not know when to stop. Instead of leaving things as they finished perfectly, they continued to do so; The first installment of this franchise is painfully undercut. <br /> <br /> This movie should never have happened. It was not intended that there was a fourth movie in this series, and that certainly shows it. The premise is idiotic and the depictions were the same. After the wonderful experience with The Omen, this was a big disappointment that stank of cheese and terrible spectacle after 70's. It was reminiscent of the Amityville horror in this regard, leaving a terrible, persistent stench long after it was over. <br /> <br /> It is rated a 1.4 / 10th of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
