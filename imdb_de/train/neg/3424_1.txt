You never saw a movie and still know that The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not, "How was it done?", Because if you drop someone money and tell them to make a movie, they will. <br /> <br /> No. The question is, "Why, oh why, did Steve Martin allow it?" I think he needed the money to fight an annoying lawsuit and was determined that it did not cost him anything. He knew that the sequel would be so awful that, out of pride, he would not even classify his royalties as income. <br /> <br /> The only way this sequel could not be embarrassed is to have Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the nation's most popular poor black family. <br /> <br /> Blankfield?): It's just obvious that you've worked on this movie in a sad way. The only way you can feel better about your engagement is to be an IMDb commentary as a lone cheerleader on the sequel. I prayed for you to plunge into satire, but unfortunately you really tried to turn you around. Why not 10 stars?
