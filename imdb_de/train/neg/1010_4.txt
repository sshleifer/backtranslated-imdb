I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman, and it seemed promising. And until Justin Timberlake staged. He is a really bad actor and is never allowed to make a movie again. I mean, he's one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen. He gives no emotion in his lines. Why the hell was he used for Josh Pollack's role? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice. Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so boring, it seems to be a bad mix of American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. That may sound cool, but do not believe me. <br /> <br /> Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good. It's about one of the few good things about this movie. He is just excited. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good, but nothing special. He has some really cool lines. <br /> <br /> About the story, even though it was a bit obvious and over the top, sometimes it was good. I had expected a big turn when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing really happened.
