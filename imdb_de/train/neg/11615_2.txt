Although I'm not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised to see his name in the opening of 'Joshua'. I did not know that he was in 'Joshua' until I started the film. It goes without saying that I watched the movie based on the movie, not the clues. A kind of "Rosemary's Baby", "The Omen" or any other demonic children's movie "Joshua" has been billed. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Slow, unbelievably slow and shallow. Still, I kept looking at how that would all resolve, in the hope that the final climax would shed some light on the subject. Okay, I admit, it did (a bit), but what a shabby end. And what a low-budget movie, or at least that's how they designed it. A person falls? You do not see the drop, you see someone lying in the blood. A person is hit by a taxi? you do not see it, you see someone who complains and holds up a bicycle. I am not sure if this is called "style" or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mother, a workaholic father trying to balance everything, a child? Joshua, who may not be the Antichrist and a newborn baby who often cries. She cries as much as we see, how many days she lives? and what was it about? Is there rats up there or is it Joshua? Is his mother crazy? Is Joshua crazy? Is he just jealous of the newcomer of the family? Will he grow up to be Michael Myers? Or is he driving his family to the edge? I do not think you were crazy, and no "so-called" drama could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, hardly any questions were answered, barely any open doors closed. I'm sure that might have been the idea, but for God's sake, give me something. Something. There are much better kids' wildlife movies to explore. Joshua is more like the mini-Me of the Antichrist.
