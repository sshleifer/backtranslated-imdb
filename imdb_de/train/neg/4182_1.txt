This movie is not as horrible as most sci-fi channel movies. I'm used to seeing the gray CGI blobs and the amateurish special effects, like close-ups of fake blood, which makes it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation. However, I had thought that I had seen all sorts of lows that could hit the sci-fi channel. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand in a rubberized sock glazed with syrup? These are the main alien vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers in the rubbery sock puppets. A talking hand comes from the victims' heads, and the vampire, who is in the vampire hunter's team, can talk to those rubber sock dolls in Transylvanian. How did foreign vampires learn Transylvanian? And is Transylvania not in Romania? Should not you speak Romanian? Why should a small town have its own language? If you can pick up your gag reflex and pull past the talking rubber socks, with your fingers moving clearly in the heads of the aliens; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires. There are the "Leatherfaces" who like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are the ugly ones, who all seem to have many facial scars. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their friends who are human traitors and sneak into the space colonies so they can sabotage their defenses so that they can attack space vampires. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you all think that the above is funny and worth a laugh. You have to deal with the third installment of Network TV rejections that form this team of stereotypical angry heroes who are constantly fighting each other. Why do you need to use lead characters in any sci-fi channel movie that are annoying, abrasive, rude, or simply totally disliked? I hoped that the talking rubber socks would win.
