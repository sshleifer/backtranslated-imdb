Where are the cannibals? Those who are fascinated by the title and the "real cannibal" of the film will be disappointed. Instead, we are shown a stranger and his re-visit to a native Papua New Guinea village, one of which was his lover several decades earlier. The man, Tobias Schneebaum, is New York Jew as they come, and somehow this is linked to the documentary, as he appears in several scenes in his Yamika some of the natives and by Tobias himself. Not all together a bad movie. Very interesting and great cinematography. Snow Tree is very sympathetic throughout and gives us a fascinating insight into a life that is about as far removed from Western civilization as you can possibly just the plot summary. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 children.
