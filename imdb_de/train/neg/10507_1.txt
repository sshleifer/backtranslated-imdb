OK, me and a friend rented it a few days ago, because we like to watch B-movies, since we do them ourselves. Anyway, the cover contained blood and strange-looking naked girls with fangs and stuff ... and Tom Savini! This movie just can not fail! Law? not correct!! It just seems like a waste! There was really no story, the dialogue was awful (is there anyone? X 1000 !!!), the characters were ... well, they really lacked any kind of personality ... the effects were terrible .. and what is with these long artistic shots of frightened people who do not do anything ... with extreme close-ups of eyes and things? We sat the whole movie, waiting for something ... something to happen ... but no ... "Oh, this is where the nymphs come in. Great! Oh ... they kiss again ... and now for the violence ! OK ... nothing really happens again ... oh, now they're walking around ... and the close-up of the eyes ... again ... oh, here's Tom Savini! Oh ... he died ... right ... OK, maybe something cool or even interesting will happen now ... no ... oh! Cool! A severed head! The end ... oh crap ... "And finally, because I'm so full of me .. I will tell you! Give me a van, six actors, a weird-looking house, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood, and I could make the coolest movie you've ever seen ... I made films without budget in two Days has better effects, better acting and a better script than this ... what does this Johannes do? Making cool movies is easy! It could have been so great ... I am really mad !!
