I just watched this movie to see what this hype is about, and I was as disappointed as I was surprised to see it end up with 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 grades at IMDb as of today. Kathryn Bigelow should be the luckiest director ever to win the best picture and directing Oscar for a really bad movie, and I wonder why? Did the totally unrealistic act of disposing of cowboy bombs bring anything to someone I did not see? Why did I always get the mental picture that this movie was a remake of an old bad western movie about a cowboy who did "brave deeds" in the wild wild west with "bad" Indians; but only that it had a different background this time? Was it given to the Oscars because the director was Ex by James Cameron, and it has turned into a beautiful impenetrable (gossip) story for daytime telecasts? Or was it a kind of Emperor's Clothes Syndrome - where most people realized it was junk, but could not just say it because others did not seem to say it aloud? <br /> <br /> And finally, what about? this sniper scene, in which they showed how the case fell into high-resolution Super-Slow-Mo, as if conveying a "deep message" or something? Something in the direction of "EOD guys are suddenly making good snipers and they're going to get those filthy terrorists all the time"? Was it just me, as if I had the feeling that here and there in the film so many parts and parts were penned for no apparent reason? And you can get the Oscars for editing and directing? <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do not waste your money with tickets. Wait until they let it run on TV in a few years. You will not miss much.
