<br /> <br /> The movie "Slugs" is unique because the deadly vermin are the good guys in this horrible natural history that went awry. You see, these poor fellows have been mutated by the pollution of evil people and do not want to do any harm. They are just snails - snails with sharp teeth that eat meat and excrete poison, but still. The real bad guys are the people who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs or overreact them when they hit them. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the scene in which the guy puts on the glove full of snails. They just hung around in a comfortable work glove when that huge hand came out of nowhere, and they instinctively responded, defending themselves and biting the guy. Instead of being treated for his snail bite, this guy runs like a jerk through his greenhouse, spilling volatile chemicals, lighting a fire, slamming a bookshelf around and cutting off his own hand, then mixing the fire and volatile chemicals House explodes. How can you push that on the slugs? <br /> <br /> This film draws a portrait of people who is less favorable. The characters in this film are the dumb sheriff who hates everyone, the drunken Hick who's mean for his dog, and the chunky buddy whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. There are also a number of drunken teenagers <br /> <br /> being attacked copying and we have to see the genitals of the skinny long haired freaks. Meanwhile, there's a guy who looks like a demon Leslie Neilson who yells, "You do not have the authority to declare a happy birthday!" for some reason. This parade of abomination is rounded off by the type of MST3K classic "Pod People," whose face explodes after eating a slug-laces salad. People are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic, and in a pointless scene as a rapist , In the film scene of the film, the villains try to burn the slugs helplessly cowering in the sewers. Now that they are idiots, people manage to blow up the entire city. They alone cause more damage than the snails ever! <br /> <br /> If you hate people and I know that I do, you will appreciate "slugs". If you're a fan of bad movies, you'll also appreciate this crapfest by the director of "Pieces" and "Pod People". There are enough bad spectacles, stupid dialogues, illogical changes of action, lame special effects, pointless scenes and bad synchronization to get your attention.
