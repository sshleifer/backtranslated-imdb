I thought that the protagonist, the astronaut with the bad case of runs (in his case, skin, hair, muscles, etc.), could get more and more film work after falling into a puddle. All he has to do is get a job as a blob. The premise of this strip is pretty lame. An astronaut is exposed to sunspot radiation (I think) and acts like an ice cream cone on hot days. Not only is this a mystery, it must apparently kill people and consume their flesh so that it can maintain some sort of cell integrity. Huh: Have you ever noticed that the person becomes a killing machine in every radiation accident or experiment? Why is that? <br /> <br /> The astronaut is disturbed by the "secret device" (which has no security) into the night and discards parts of itself. He seems to keep just enough memory to take him to the launch pad, perhaps because he wanted to return to space. <br /> <br /> So the part of the movie, which is quite full-bodied, starts with a doctor walking around with a fiddle-counter and trying to find the melting man by the humming he triggers. He kills a stupid fisherman who looks like Bill Gates, scares a little girl like the Frankenstein monster movie and ends a crazy older couple (who kills them for stealing lemons). Then there is a short scene where he beats his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young head and chases his girlfriend. They would think that the scene would shift if she cuts off her arm and runs away. But no ... we have about ten minutes until the woman huddles in a corner and screams and screams in horror even though the monster has disappeared. All I could think was ... a director's girlfriend, anyone? <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is even more lame than the rest of the movie. The melting man got ready for a bunch of Goo and then ... nothing. That's it. That's the end of the movie. Well, at least that meant there was no room for a sequel.
