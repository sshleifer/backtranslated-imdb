Having just seen this movie, I almost feel like I've wasted two hours of my life, but I think there's something good about everything: If I rated this as any other movie, it could only be 1 or 2 tops, but if I think of it as a low budget, ind. Movie can get it 3 or 4. This is a film meant to be 'completed' and without too long passages of boredom or wasting time. This movie is not. But I think many independent films are about showing movie skills, and considering that, this movie has some highlights. If I'm to comment on what the directors should take with me for their next project, the distorted sound effects probably have something of quality. They also manage to build some characters, but this brings me to what they should skip in their next project, as building the characters takes too long, as this is mostly irrelevant to filming. Also, the long periods for running around in the next project should not be continued - what's the point? I think this movie tries to be a bit of everything (build characters, suspense and action), and in the end it's nothing (not much). <br /> <br /> This film tries too much and too hard, and I think it should have been cut into a short film. I could easily walk around for an hour or cut out meaningless dialogue from the movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many irrelevant things going on in this movie. The story should have been rationalized. I know that there should be a mystery in this movie, but a little surprise for the killer is not a mystery. The story behind the "mystery" finds almost no attention in the film, leaving the final "point" as a quick and unsatisfactory sequel. <br /> <br /> So I would say that this movie was a nice try, but I can not. I hope the directors learn from their mistakes and produce a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you're not interested in learning about low-budget movies, you do not have to see it - not even understanding why everyone thinks it's bad. <br /> <br /> As others have already stated, I'm pretty sure the many tens for this film are from people who are somehow involved in the movie. This film could not receive a "10" if judged from a remote objective point of view.
