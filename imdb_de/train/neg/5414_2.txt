This movie is even a big step down, as is common in Bollywood. The performances were terrible. Even Boman Irani, who always manages to shine, becomes a bad guy completely on OTT. The soundtrack is not memorable either. And despite all the effort, the female leads do not manage to be "sexy". Vivek Oberoi is able to do far better projects, while Fardeen Khan has a similar price for now. But this monstrosity is even below his limited abilities as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are terrible in poorly written clich√© roles. It's high time for Indra Kumar to hang up his director hat. I hope he never directs another stain so. The future of Hindi films is now in better hands. To sum it up, stay away from the waste of celluloid.
