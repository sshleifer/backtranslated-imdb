Dolph Lundgren broods and frowns at this incoherent mystery / thriller, which is not nearly as cool as the box makes you believe. He's actually pretty good here, but the story is a jumble of B-movie clich√©s (investigators, revenge, tycoons, hookers, S & M) that look like they've been invented over time. The movie picks up a bit in the second half, but RED SCORPION rents for a decent Lundgren movie.
