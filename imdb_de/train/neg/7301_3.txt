There's a big difference between releasing an original, intense seat cushion, weird, gore-solid, and how the filmmaker Eli Roth and his team did with "Cabin Fever" just behaved like that. The film accompanies five college graduates into a cabin in the forest, which gradually turns out to be deadly when this mysterious, fast-acting, carnivorous disease succumbs. It does not take long for the friends to get involved and barely see each other, let alone be close to them. As big as it all sounds, there is a spark behind the basic premise of this movie that could have worked, in the hands of a less snooty filmmaker. Unfortunately, we end up with badly drawn characters whose sole purpose is to look beautiful at first, to contrast the inevitable decomposition, a choppy script that is so profane that the viewer fades out the dialogue subplots that are little more than (in a case) motivate a performance on the screen of director Roth. This is a sloppy movie production in many ways! Avoid this time-lapse.
