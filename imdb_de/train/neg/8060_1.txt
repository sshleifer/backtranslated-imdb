What a bad, bad movie! I tried to see without fast forward ... That failed. After about 30 minutes, I stopped the movie and went online to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Phew!) It was a confusing, boring movie. I do not think anyone can be hit by a fluorescent light less scored by one !! The funny thing is that I saw the version of the movie "The Killer Cut". The box says bravely "More blood!" "More sex!" "More terror than the theatrical release!" Yikes! If this movie was terrible with all these claims, I wonder how lame the "UN killer cut" was ??? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living and the world of the dead, take a look at the series of the Night of the Living Dead !!
