I'm a big fan of David Lynch and have everything he did on DVD, except the hotel room and the 2-hour Twin Peaks movie. When I heard about it, I grabbed myself immediately and ... and ... what is that? It's a bunch of roughly drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and rude and are not funny. Maybe I do not know what's good, but maybe that's just a bunch of crap that was forced on the public under the name of David Lynch to make a few bucks. Let me make it clear that I did not care about the bad language part, but had to adjust the tone further because my neighbors might have done so. All in all, this is a very disappointing release and may have been left as a curiosity in the deluxe box. I highly recommend that you do not spend your money on it. 2 out of 10.
