How can anyone understand each other perfectly without devices such as universal translators or translator microbes? If the creators of this show have realized that people taken from different parts of the world in different timeframes (Attilla the Hun was not a contemporary of the Hellenic cultures of the prelates, nor the Vikings of the pyramid builders) speak different languages ​​and can never develop a language that is so similar to today's English (except for the diffractions that they do not "use") that was influenced by Latin, Ancient Greek, Danish and French? <br /> <br /> 2 Cultural differences are not so easy to overcome, you have to gain confidence, but wherever the team arrives, they are greeted without suspicion and start organizing people as if they were their ordered leaders. Of course, true fans would say that they are perceived as gods. The people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like. 3 Historical background: none. Visually, it may vaguely remind you of the Greek or Viking culture, but anyone can wear a few tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to make the part look. A theater company in a small town probably has better props. <br /> <br /> 4 Boring! Another lame Canuck production that inexplicably ran for ten years. As a children's show there could be a touch, but anyone who knows a little about human behavior and language can not bear to see the first twelve episodes of season one, just like me. I absolutely wanted to believe that I had found a decent sci-fi show, otherwise I would cleanse and clean my computer of the sanctuary after the first five minutes!
