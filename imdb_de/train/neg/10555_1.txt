First and foremost: I love good splatter movies and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero-budget movie is none of that! The picture quality is so damn low, the soundtrack the most annoying I've ever heard (!!!!), and as far as the FX is concerned ... well, the super low quality does not make some of them look as bad as they would do it in a real movie (which is not this garbage here). No concept, gossamer action, primitive acting and rare dialogues - I think I've counted about 10 sentences throughout the movie, each of which has been repeated about 20 times ... the same goes for many movie sequences of what kind of audience this crap was made !!!) The story seems to be that a little boy had to watch his father raping and killing his mother, being mentally damaged and going on tour as an adult and showing self-mutilation. So far, so good ... But for these pseudo-art idiot directors, this plot is just one line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row that neither have a message nor make sense (freshly guts are thrown on a naked, tied up woman in a hole in the ground ... why and why is that the only time you see both wife and litter in the bloody "movie" ??? Disturbing? Yes!! Sick? Yes!! Necessary? No! Artistic? NO!!!!! Anyone who confuses this cheap Gore show with art should go to his psychiatrist as soon as possible or watch Pink Floyd's "The Wall" to see how a similar theme can be artfully crafted ... I hope so was the first time last (!!!!!!!!) movie, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all that you are doing out there, remember: not everything that looks cheap and obviously makes no sense is automatically "art" ...
