"A Guy Thing" tries to capture the feeling of "Mad about Mary" or "Meet the Parents," but seems more like being cut out of the rejection rooms of these two films. Fortunately, I rented it for 5 days because I could not sit and watch for more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The premise is decent and I liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up Paul's missteps (the checker at Save-Mart was great), but the script writing is absolutely terrible. The dialogue is usually shallow and just when you think that things are finally going to get on the track, an unnecessary sight gag is captured for no good reason. And how many toilet jokes does a movie really need? <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, slapstick humor is great if it's done wisely, as in the other movies I've mentioned, but this movie just misses the mark. Too bad how I love Julia Stiles (Ten things I hate about you was great), but even that could not help me sit through this horrible movie. Save your money and rent "Crazy for Mary" again.
