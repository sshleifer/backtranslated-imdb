I am amazed at why this movie is even popular, let alone by so many critics who are otherwise quite reasonable. This is a keyword that describes film to the core - irritating. <br /> <br /> The easiest way to explain this is to use the director - more specifically the abuse - of music. In the first half, a really boring reggae is played about three times (if once too often). In the second half, "Mommas And The Papas" "California Dreamin '" is played at least seven times, mostly at top volume. Thank God, whether you liked the song or not, you would be tired of it in the end. Imagine, some people claim to have seen this movie four or five times. This means that they have either listened to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times ..... <br /> <br /> All of these unnecessary hyper reps (they do not contribute to the story) could possibly be excused if the rest of the film had a lasting merit or if the story was involved in any way. <br /> <br /> But that's not it. <br /> <br /> The only aspect that I liked was Bridgette Lin's excitement and still plays Asia The Invincible in raincoat and sunglasses. That too has worn itself out pretty quickly. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the undeservedly high reputation of this film will convince many poor guys to see it. <br /> <br /> I can only warn you - if you have never seen a HK movie before. Do not start with this movie. <br /> <br /> If you feel compelled to look at him, be sure to avoid seeing him in a movie theater. The fast-forward and mute buttons are an essential tool for survival. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
