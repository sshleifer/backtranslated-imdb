As is usual with IMDb, displaying the majority vote instead of the "weighted average" is far more indicative of the entertainment value of the film. In this case, the majority indicates a "one". How right they are! To begin my review, I first admit that I am completely unaware why this movie is called "Alien Intruder". It does contain space and even an "alien" (I suppose), but in the long run, there is no reason and no reason for anything, at least no actual plot or resolution that I can make out somewhere. <br /> There is some scenes that are so disgusting (in terms of both lines, the timing and how they are spoken) that the weird feeling one gets when looking at similar, really bad movies far outstrips. I have no idea of ​​the part at the beginning where an electronic bugs Bunny seems to complain about something. <br /> <br /> The plot contains only one area known as a G spot, sorry this G sector ... and a virtual reality program infected with a kind of alien virus (?) , I think it is alien because the image of the otherwise normal Ariel appears as a photographic negative. <br /> <br /> For the most part of the movie, we see people shot with space weapons, falling out of lofts and seemingly endless, pointless close-ups of "Where's Ariel?", "Can not find Ariel" (pointless because most of the other shots involve interacting with Ariel anyway - anyway - on a computer monitor. Commander Skyler (Billy Dee) sits and watches every fantasy of the condemned VR programs hoping to find this alien virus and become one ... ??? Or maybe I missed something ... <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams did a few courses on how to act desperately before he did that. We know that because he spends a lot of time stroking his fingers over his face and looking sad. <br /> <br /> The docking scene with the nose of a ship going in the back of the other ship was reasonably funny at least and made for a laugh in addition to the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship, because it just turns in circles and looks very much like a Lego experiment that went awry. <br /> <br /> It seems everyone is dying in this movie, so why bother? Even the VR women are killed as if that's supposed to mean anything (especially because everyone else is dying anyway) ... unheard of. <br /> <br /> Because of the money I save on food, I will not complain that I wanted my money back, that I paid for the DVD. The dollar I saved for this bag of vanilla wafers paid for the time of this reviewer. <br /> <br /> I just want to add that the story itself could at least be added as a novel and with far more details could be very interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
