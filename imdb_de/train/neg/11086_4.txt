As for spaghetti western, I would not put this man can not die on the boring side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the onscreen charisma needed to play the role. With a notable exception, the rest of the cast is not very good. The direction is not inspired and offers very few moments that I have not seen yet. There just is not much exciting. <br /> <br /> The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She is the only bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. Unfortunately, their screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for This Man Can not Die is not right Rosalba Neri does not Jenny Benson Instead, it is the figure Melin I'm not sure how anyone could keep a guy named John Bartha Rosalba Neri listed... in the IMDb credits for the movie.)
