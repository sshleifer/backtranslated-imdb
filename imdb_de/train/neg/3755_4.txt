I loved this movie, I admit it. This must be the best (direct to?) Video I've seen. Well ... me and my friend just decided to shit and giggle that we would rent this movie. We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, plus more. When this red neck was hit by the Sasquatch against the tree, we observed this part about three to four times. That was amazing (of course hysterical). And why? Why does the main character have to roll that much? How honest do we know you are in danger. If you roll that much, it will not help much. But really, if this movie is in your local video store, RENT IT. It's worth the money and it's not even as bad as it was bad, but not unbelievably bad. If you rent this movie, the overall concept will be amazing.
