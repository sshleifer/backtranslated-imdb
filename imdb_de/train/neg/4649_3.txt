A 1957 (yes, that's the right date) J. Arthur Rank production with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, and Wilfred Hyde White; it has to be a loud comedy, right? Oh, it's just awful. It's a one-gag movie: seeing people shocked at the sight of a small alligator. The music is recorded in an inappropriate and forgetful way. Jeannie Carson is a lively dancer and competent singer. But what did she do in this movie? Diana Dors is also here and offers incredibly daring shots for the previews. Her acting level is not bad, but she's in the movie to make someone look. Well, you have to do something other than groan in this movie. The movie is now being sold by VHS users on VHS. Save yourself the cost and waste of time. A comedy without laughter. A musical without an unforgettable song or dance.
