It seems to me that some of the movies that were banned during the cinema history were actually very important and very good movies. I'd like to argue that instead of challenging challenging controversial films, censors should consider movies that are so bad that they endanger your IQ and your mind. If they did, one of the first films to be hid quickly would undoubtedly be "Stroker Ace." This movie is awful with a big 'A'. It's the worst movie Burt Reynolds ever played in. A pretty big achievement for a man with "Cannonball Run II", "Cop And A Half" and "Rent-A-Cop" in his CV! <br /> <br /> The gauzy story introduces us to the successful street racer Stroker Ace (Reynolds) who loves fast cars and fast women. He's stuck in a humiliating contract with crooked promoter Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The contract requires him to make humiliating promotions to a new chain of fast food restaurants, such as: B. as a giant chicken. Lugs (Jim Nabors), Ace's dumb-headed buddy, and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), a bimbo whose brain is slightly smaller than a pea courted by Ace, are cast into the mix. Hal Needham, the director of this substandard trash, used to be a stuntman, making numerous films based on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases. Some of these films were fine, like "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited", but with "Stroker Ace" he reached a career nadir. The characters are so stupid that they actually feel sorry for the actors they play. Above all, Anderson has such a stupid role that you have to grind your teeth in despair. The humor is consistently weak and infantile, and the stunts and racing sequences are unremarkable. Even the out-takes during the credits (which can be found in all Reynolds-Needham collaborations) are generally unsteady, giving the impression that the movie might not be fun. "Stroker Ace" is a stinker of considerable proportions.
