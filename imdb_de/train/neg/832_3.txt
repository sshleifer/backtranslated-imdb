I give this film its props that it is very well made and reasonably well played. But I could not get past the implausibility of the whole. <br /> <br /> First and foremost a game built around the term "Russian Roulette", which has to be filled after an hour. The big problem is that in a live show, you have the possibility that your first candidate is the one who is unlucky enough to pull the "real" ball. What do you do then? You have 50 minutes to fill and nothing to show. The implication is: Okay, you come to an end and the first five participants survive, which means that number six has the ball and can not possibly receive the payout. He will not shoot himself at this point, so it's kind of anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> Second problem, almost as big. Human nature. People will shrug, panic, pollute their underwear and do things that would not be good TV otherwise. Too much coincidence. For that reason, the "real" reality television is actually closely scanned and cut even more accurately. <br /> <br /> (The only coincidental thing is the "performance artist") about female victims who historically were rather rare. Even that was predictable for the case, since she did manage to shoot herself.) <br /> <br /> We're confident the ratings would rise when it started at 1am (unlikely) with the Asian token Girl announcing every raise in the ratings. <br /> <br /> One point about race and gender. Big surprise are the films that survive two minorities (one gay) and two female participants. So we stay with the two white men and of course the less likable of them is the one who buys it. The purpose of such a show would be its randomness, but the type you least like is the guy who dies. The highlight is that the character of Eva Mendes (after fighting for two hours on television for suicide). Mendes has produced and played along in this matter, so she has nothing to kill but herself) a conscience becomes when someone dies. What would she think would happen? She is shot dead by an onlooker who is mad at the whole thing (motives are never explained), and the show became a great success. "Really?" <br /> <br /> The problem with the media satire is that it either has to have something in reality or be so exaggerated as to be ridiculous (like Network). That's neither.
