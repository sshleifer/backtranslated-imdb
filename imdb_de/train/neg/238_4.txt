A Cinderella story for adults living in dreamland. The romance is very unrealistic, fluttering, loving and perfect. The Cinderella conspiracy to the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a dreamy romance with a twist, this is definitely your movie, but for the rest of us, real-world people, I strongly recommend that you save your three hours of time. Wake up to people! <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who saw the movie with me would not recommend the movie. We had a great time beating the majority of unrealistic scenes. Maybe I miss something. I just can not believe that a movie like this one can beat a classic like HDDCS !!
