I only speak as a movie, I did not really like it. not because there was no FX or because we had a single cabin as a scenario for the entire movie. That actually made me look at it. His "friends" are all happy and then they are crazy, but you have no idea why; then they take on different roles, one is the believer, the other is the antagonist, but they never make sense! In addition, the lighting was terrible and I mention only technical problems. <br /> <br /> With a few words, I think the movie just has a "ok, I'm out of here!" from some characters. Like the lady who does not want to hear his version of the Bible. <br /> <br /> About the story itself, anyone can freely write about what he wants, and the story is a testament to good writing and imagination. I owe it to the author of the book, so my 4/10. <br /> <br /> So in the end, you'll hear the story of the man, believe it or not. Do not spend all the time feeling like you're shocked and shocked by what he's saying, moving and joking at the same time as you would not believe him. <br /> <br /> Coherence. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading;)
