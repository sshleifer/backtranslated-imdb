I grew up in Texas and less than 15 miles from Gilley's. I can tell you that this movie is disgusting. The majority of Texans do not live as the movie suggests. The plot is faint and the fake accents are amusing and reinforce the stereotypical image that all Texans drink beer, honky-tonkin and rednecks. It's the awfully wrong Texas accents that kill it for me. Certainly, there is a certain Texas twang to the accents of most Texans, but these people exaggerate it. You can not get anyone from New Jersey and Ohio to put accents in Texas. It just does not work. John Travolta should have stuck to the disco dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger convinced as a Wonder Girl more than she did as a Texan.
