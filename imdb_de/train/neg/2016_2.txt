***** Warning: May contain SPOILERS ********** My HUGE problem with this movie is how totally selfish and self-employed the adulteress is !! After a one-night stand with a slimy psycho, she is followed by him. He constantly calls and threatens them and even sends a video of their night together. He is obviously crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that she just thinks he's dangerous to YOU ​​(and reveals her secret). Not for a second did she ever have to worry about her husband! Did she even think for a moment that he might be in danger from this psychotic? Once she realized how mentally he was, she would have had to warn her husband, no matter what the consequences. Maybe there would not have been a movie back then, but there was not one anyway, so what's the difference?
