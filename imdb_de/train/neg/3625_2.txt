This is a movie that belongs firmly in the 50s. It's very surprising that the American Film Institute selected this film for the top 100 American films of all time. I have seen virtually all the films on this list, and this is by far the most disappointing. Musical numbers (and many, many of them) are VERY long and boring and have absolutely no connection with the story. The end of the film has a terribly overlong ballet sequence, which of course has no real relation to the history of the film. You have to admit that it's very well done, the music is okay and the dancing is done to the highest professional standards - but there is no reason why the sequence is included in the movie. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is extremely childish and unlikely and behaves rude. His mental age is about 14. If you want to see a good musical from the "golden age" of musicals, visit "Singing in the Rain".
