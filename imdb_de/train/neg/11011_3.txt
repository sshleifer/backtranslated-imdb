A series of painfully uncomplicated skits that seem to last forever and last a day. Not as amazingly awful as saying "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but that is NOT a confirmation in any way, meaning or form. Features the worst rhyming clown ever. Most, if it is not offensive to anyone, except for the prudish or politically correct. It also has the worst song parody ever recorded in the movie, the WORST Arnold imitations of EVER (not just the worst version of the movie, literally the worst of times). I have no idea why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan or Slash would star here (the reasons I ever saw this). The only thing that was funny was Dickman. In summary, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but the people who made it their life's work to get that bottom 250 on this site are pathetic. Do something remarkable with you humans. If it is true that the Church of Scientalogy hates him, he can not be ALL bad. <br /> <br /> My grade: D
