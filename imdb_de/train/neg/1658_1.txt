This is possibly the most boring movie in history. I was looking forward to seeing this movie in the face of actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I'd rather see the Three Amigos than ever watch that movie again. It was promptly from the DVD player directly in the trash. I apologize to those of you who seem to like this movie, but you also liked New Coke. I can not understand why someone enjoyed this movie. He is slow, boring and has no real action. They wait 105 minutes for the movie to start. I understand that this was done in 1976, but this was an era of bad television. Thankfully, Disco and Three's Company are out with stop sign glasses and the Bay City Rollers. Well, only my thoughts.
