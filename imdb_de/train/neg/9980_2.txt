Do not waste 90 minutes of your time with "Fast Food, Fast Women". It's an annoyingly episodic screenplay with three pegged storylines that are ridiculously bad for predictable writing, terrible drama and even bad music. I found the anorexic main character angry if I saw her on the screen every time. She needs the fast food. <br /> <br /> Spend the 90 minutes that you would devote to this turkey, something more exciting ... like trimming the toenails. They would have more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The only redeemer of this movie is Louise Lasser, but she deserves much better than this tired screenplay. It's as powerless as the older man she woos in the movie. <br /> <br /> VIEWER BEWARE!
