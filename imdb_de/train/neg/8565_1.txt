We are sorry. Someone has to say it. This is really a boring movie. Worthy, perhaps, but boring. I almost cried with boredom when I saw it. The acting is pretty dark, the story is long and predictable, the score and the camera work are standard and unexciting. It's one of those movies you should not hate (because it's about disabled people), but I hate it. I guess almost everyone does that. It's interesting that critics were so kind to this movie. I suspect they too can not be objective. This was done to win prizes - which I remember was right. It was neither interesting nor entertaining. I did not see the piece and I can not compare it.
