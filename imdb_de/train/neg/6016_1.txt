This movie, which has been released directly on video, should be labeled with a warning sign that it is dangerous to human health and may cause the viewer to become a victim of boredom. It is another thinly veiled, evangelizing religious "Rapture" film in which the good (the believers) suddenly disappear and the bad ones (the unbelievers) are left behind. It's an interesting concept, especially as we see it on a flight led by an unbeliever who has a sinful affair with a stewardess on board (it is needless to say that the sinner does not disappear!). Unfortunately, the plane did not crash because all the pilots were infidels or the movie was mercifully over. Although this may have been interesting without the fierce religious browbeating, the plodding film is a total joke, the acting is terrible and the obviously computer-generated simulations seem very fake. Also, it's another Canadian-made movie pretending to be New York City. Spare me ... I'll just read the bible.
