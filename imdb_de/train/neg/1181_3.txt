This movie was so scandalously rife that it became a much sought after item ... the indignation, the mystery, etc. He had everything to be a great piece of film, but in the end he is failing in every way. It's a terribly bad comedy, a pathetic horror movie, a lame erotic movie. The 2-disc DVD contains a beautiful booklet with still images, interviews, bestiality essays, etc., as well as a detailed interview with the more than demanding director. For those who have heard of it, but have never seen it, the package will look fantastic until you actually see the movie. Disc 1 contains the edited film, poorly translated into English, but with good visual quality. Disc 2 contains the Director's Cut in a terrible broadcast in French. What can I say about the real beast? A hand puppet from Kermit, the frog, would have been more effective and shocking.
