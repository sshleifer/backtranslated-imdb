Okay, I absolutely love Ben Stiller, even though I'm lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston. I do not think that girl can act in the least. Every movie or sitcom I saw in them is very hard to get past their wrong acting. It sounds like she just stood there and read straight from the script. This movie had only one good thing and that was that Ben Stiller was there. This action is so used and abused, it is ridiculous. How many movies have this kind of action? Can we use "forces of nature ??" say? The plot is not only so old, but the result is so predictable and boring. I knew everything that would happen before it happened. It was boring, but watching Stiller is always a pleasure !!!
