Spoiler. <br /> <br /> First of all, nothing happened in this movie, except for a woman who was inexplicably bleeding. Second, it was not scary. Third, it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever. Let me do something closer. The sound was edited by either Beavis or Butthead. I'm not sure what, so let's just go with Beavis. The movie gradually gets quieter and people mumble and mumble, forcing you to increase the volume (I've seen this at home). Then Beavis gives some really loud sounds with supposedly spooky / shocking pictures and forces you to quickly lower the volume again. This happens many times until the movie ends mercifully. I can imagine Beavis laughing vulgarly behind the two-way mirror as he watches the test group picking frantically at the remote each time. If you have children and you prefer to watch creepy movies after falling asleep, this is a big mistake. But then it is still a big mistake. Here is a thought? If you're shooting a horror movie, add at least one unfounded beheading, a 19-year-old blond girl screaming out of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater, eating the shadow on someone's wall just out of reach of the camera a cat thrown in front of the camera to scare the audience, a joke with a crazy laugh, or a monster that looks like a stage hand wrapped in foil). These people did not even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
