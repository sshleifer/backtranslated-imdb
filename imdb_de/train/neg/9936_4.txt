Got this for 50 cents at the flea market, was pretty excited. <br /> <br /> I found it fascinating for about 15 minutes, then just boring and boring. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Mick and the gang in their best years, I wish there had not been so much talking about dubbing dialogues, and I could hear what was being said and played. <br /> <br /> The skits are politically obsolete and incredibly na√Øve and simple by poorly written Monty Python on acidity. I spent more time looking at the legacies of the late 1960s rather than what actually happened in the silly skits. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good reminder that times are really changing, and what's important is quickly becoming stupid. Good song, but it has now been played to death by this DVD.
