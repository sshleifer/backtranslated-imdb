I've seen an early preview of this movie and I hope you'll have time to edit the movie so that it can be improved before it's released on August 3rd. Andy Samberg of Saturday Night Live is shown as "Hot" Rod Kimble. He plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stuntman like his late father. When we meet him, he jumps a mail cart on his motorcycle, yes, a motorcycle, and almost makes it. This would be worth a 'Jackass' movie if he did not honestly try to do that. Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much older woman Denise next door. She seems to like Rod enough to join his "crew." Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half-brother Kevin, who documents the stunts with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mother Marie. She remarried to Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a really tough guy who enjoys beating Rod in some real clashes. It is clear that Rod Frank will not earn respect until he can beat him. We realize that Frank needs $ 50,000. Heart Transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he can "beat his ass" once he's healed and proves to be a man. A long fall on the mountainside convinces Rod to "grow up" in a stunt. Rod wants to earn seed by demanding stunts that pull you in when you see them in real life. Like the human torch on a kids birthday party. There were those on the show who managed to laugh at most stunts. Just when all hope and money is lost, a sponsor comes in to save the day with the 15 school buses Rod jumps. He receives exclusive broadcasting rights and sets up telephone connections for donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole city turns out and the world comes in. Is he doing the jump? Does he get the girl? Do they raise the $ 50k? Will Frank get his ass from Rod? Wait for this 90-minute movie to appear on video to find out.
