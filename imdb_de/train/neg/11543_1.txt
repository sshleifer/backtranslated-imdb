Although I use this page quite often to see how other people judge what I think are challenging or just entertaining movies, last night, watching this "movie" on film 4, I was forced to to write something down, even if it only helps me to cleanse myself once more. <br /> <br /> The film was possibly the slimmest experience I've ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23? you sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully as Leonard Nimoy) I'm not sure if the first half hour of the movie did not make the final cut, but in a revenge movie you'd like some empathy with the victims ... here I could not care less. In fact, the only character who interested me seemed to be the dog, and the stag came just before it. And both animals outwitted Dire (sic) and Scully, who were frankly awful. I think you are only as good as the script you received and I would like to thank the authors, the producers, the director and all the performers for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some good electricity.
