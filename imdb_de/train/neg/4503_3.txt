I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Memoirs of Geisha proves to be another failure of the combination of Western and Asian art. All in all, the scene is beautiful, but after restless emphasis on exotic-oriented scenes, some may find themselves full. The excessive cherry blossom was frankly exaggerated. It's probably the cultural difference of perception here: the ultimate beauty is not the eye-catching type, because a really beautiful geisha would not be the too-weathered pumpkin in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some other comments have rightly raised the biggest flaws. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt that the actress is great. An actor can play any role if he can look that way. Gong Li is great, but the power of emotion she has shown in this film has not been translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese woman. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actresses, did not even look like a Japanese. Some comments mentioned the peculiar delicate female features of Japanese women I can not agree with. These are so delicate that I suspect that not all modern Japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in Geisha, not to mention the two Chinese and one Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know the Japanese culture so well <br /> Geisha is a great opportunity to arouse the curiosity of the American public. However, it would be an insult to the film itself and to the arts if the film wins the Oscar for Best Costume, Best Director or Best Picture.
