If you see a lot in Bad Altıoklar, as promised by the Tagline, you will be very disappointed to see that the film is nothing but the populist style of Altıoklar in terms of the most famous topics like sex or marriage and cheating. Too much nudity, which seems to appear out of thin air and has no connection with the plot, proves that Altıoklar was unsuccessful in trying "something new," as he quoted. Too many sex-centered jokes seem to show that Altıoklar fell in love with the famous saying "Sex Sells." I had hoped to see a very good story with a very good narrative technique. In the end, however, I sat for 90 minutes sitting watching Altıoklar's experimental, but still too much on the work of popularism.
