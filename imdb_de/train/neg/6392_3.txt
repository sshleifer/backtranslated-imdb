Fans of Goreme master Herschell Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere when they spatter this movie for his usual bucket full of blood, because in this movie, there is hardly anything to bleed. Instead, Lewis decides to tell the bizarre story and relies on special effects that are on a budget that could probably have been doubled if the cast one day found their pockets for the change. Oddly enough, although cheap and very bad deals were made (especially by McCabe as Mitchell), the entire conspiracy conspiracy remains intact. Imagine how this film could have looked like on a decent budget! Overall, it tastes like champagne for a beer budget.
