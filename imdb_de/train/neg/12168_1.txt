This movie was bad from the beginning. The only purpose of the film was that Angela wanted to achieve a high body count. The acting was terrible. The murders were very bad. When Ally stuffed the toilet, it was probably in the abandoned cabin. But when the movie ends and Molly and the other man are in the booth, you see Ally, so Angela has to come in to get her. The part that really impressed me was when the black girl and Angela were in the booth and Angela took the guitar string and overpowered her. One was awful acting and two, why would not you just turn around and beat the bitch?!?!? If Molly is chased by Angela then, if you have the neighbor, why not just turn around and stab her ??? So stupid. This movie is shit ...
