A movie about Vixen (Erica Gavin) who has a husband from Mountie she loves ... but she also loves sex! During the film, she gets several men in bed - including her husband AND her brother! There is also a (tame) lesbian sequence. <br /> <br /> This film brought Russ Meyer on the map and was (in my opinion) the first critically acclaimed X-movie of all time. It was a great success when it came out. Unfortunately, it does not date well. <br /> <br /> It's well directed and Erica Gavin is just great (whatever happened to her) and it was VERY colorful ... but by today's standards it's extremely tame. I am surprised that there is now an NC-17 rating - there is no hardcore sex, and there are only female females without thighs and no male nudity. It is (unfortunately) quite boring and the addition of politics in the end was confusing (and quite stupid). It is worth seeing what was felt in 1968 as very shocking. I supposedly saw the cut version (which has a rating of R), but I only heard it here and there for a few seconds that they are missing. <br /> <br /> Meyer's next movie "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" is much better and dates very well. Start this instead.
