and not in a fun way. it's just awful It's shocking that people here wrote positive things about it. The story is shit, the drama is bad, it's not scary, the special effects are not special - oh no! The blackboard has hands that come out! oh gee - the mirror turned into water! The hair, clothes and make-up in the '50s are not accurate, and they've got a middle-aged man with a receding hairline to play the high school version of himself. This is like a late nightmare in Ulmenstrasse. I enjoy squatting and watching a cheesy horror movie, but there are better bad choices to choose from.
