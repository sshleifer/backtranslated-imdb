Anurag Basu, who co-produced the flop KUCCH TO HAI, debuted in this film. <br /> <br /> The film was in some ways ahead of its times, despite having a story that does not differ from HAWAS released one week ago and luckily that was better and made a better deal <br /> < br /> The film starts well, Malika's guilty feelings are shown well in the beginning, although the scene with Emraan Malika is too raw / vulgar /> The scenes between Emraan and Malika are well crafted and the twist in the story, in The Ashmith Emraan faces is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The tempo is moving fast and the audience is on the edge, but the second girlfriend track by Emraan is not completely convincing <br /> <br /> The cop track seems to be half done , <br /> <br /> The finale is too cinematic. <br /> <br /> Director: Anurag Basu is good Music is a winner, all the songs were fantastic The camera work was stunning <br /> <br /> Emraan played his naughty series very well, this was the role that played him Won glory and although he continued to play such roles and became annoying in this movie. He was excellent. Ashmith was once good at his role. He did a good job and one of his only good performances. He looked good too. Malika was brilliant in her role, especially in the second half, but her dial was at times out of truth. Unfortunately, in other films where Raj Jhutsi has so much potential, she was okay
