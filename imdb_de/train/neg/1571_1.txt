When I saw this movie, I had to constantly think. Why do they make such a problem with broken brakes? There are a million options to slow down the car! In the movie Speed, the authors had a good reason why the car could not stop ... <br /> <br /> There are not many good things to say about this film; All the usual clich√©s come into view, the actors are very bad, the story is like a sieve, etc. This makes this movie a waste of time and money
