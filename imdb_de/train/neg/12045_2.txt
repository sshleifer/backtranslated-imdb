Hello, <br /> <br /> This is my first post in IMDb, although I have been using it as a reference for some time. I would therefore like to welcome you all. The fact that I am Greek will inevitably affect my judgment. I do not hope for your anger. <br /> <br /> I spent 2 years of my life (everything we Greeks actually did) and analyzed Omirus epic (and not Homer's as you can see everywhere) rhyme for rhyme. If I remember well, it was Iliada (Iliad) in 8th grade and Odysseia (Odyssey) in 9th grade. Warner's Troy was a big disappointment for me and my Greek fellow students on campus (I'm studying in the UK). Iliad's epic is one of the best literary works ever written. It was composed 400 years after the war by a Greek poet Omirus. Historians set the Trojan War around 1200 BC The real cause of the war was not Helene's beauty, but the strategic position of Troy. That is, one can now understand that Omirus epic does not represent the actual events (since this is historically not accurate), but this has never been the purpose of this work. <br /> <br /> When you read this huge poem, you can ask for the definitions of honor, love, anger, hate, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The best part and the most instructive were these long talks between the warriors before the battle. None of this was revealed in "Troy". <br /> <br /> Warner's Troy was really cheap for me, and for other intellectual people it was also English Finnish and German colleagues of mine. It's a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. Incidentally, perfect thunderstorms were a bad and stupid blockbuster (computer graphics did all the work), and yet it's Wolfgang Petersen's best work. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to say that you would rather see something different. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It's a really expensive B-movie. <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> Alex
