If you've ever watched a Brian Avenet-Bradley movie and compare it to IMDb's feedback, you know most of the comments and votes are fake. TRUST ME: You'll be bored! The people in the production team write their feedback themselves (sometimes they even admit it). But that's not enough: you also constantly click on "No" if the movie contains a negative comment. Therefore, negative critics are always placed behind the hyped critics. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad light, bad script, bad ending. Believe me now! If not, you will believe me later! Brian Avenet-Bradley could be a pretty good businessman. Otherwise, it can not be explained that he finds people who still finance his films. (Okay, they're cheap, but still.) But as a creative person, he's completely failed.
