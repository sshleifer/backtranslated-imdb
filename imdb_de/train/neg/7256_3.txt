I bought this movie on Blu-ray because it promised great visuals and music. I was also a big fan of a similar movie ... Baraka. The movie is very Baraka-style, wide-angle, very similar with cameras set to capture a long time each time they take a picture. Even some scenes were identical (the road with the traffic). While Baraka narrated a great story that brought nature, man-made environments, spirituality and horror of the world together in a compelling manner and great music, this film simply jumped from recording to recording without a full story, a mediocre music score and then. ... POOF, ready! I thought there must be a mistake! History of the World Half of the movie is Egypt and landscape (looks like Arizona, but I did not care). Seriously folks, that's terrible, rent it if you have to, but do not buy it. The filmmakers should be ashamed when they bring it out.
