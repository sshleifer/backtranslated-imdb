I do not usually take the time to make comments that few people will read about movies that few will see. In that case, however, I feel that I must warn all those who are considering wasting time with it. I just saw it five minutes ago. This is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The spectacle is terrible, there is no conspiracy and production levels are at best at the poverty line. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. There is only one thing that could have saved this movie for the purposes of a horror fan - more gore on the screen and an eye-catcher! The total of three times this occurs outside the screen. Although it is effective and somewhat annoying when it happens - especially the final scene - it just is not enough. The movie is just too long for minimal content, too dialogue-heavy and therefore almost impossible to watch. What happens? To put it in a nutshell, three teenage girls drive responsibly and knowingly through a remote area where more than 20 girls have been abducted and murdered. Of course, their car breaks down and they are taken to a boring old house where three crazy people live - one of them is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered off screen, after an eternity of boring, slow nonsense. As I said, the only things that are worth seeing are the murders. Please do not buy it or rent it for just that, and do not be fooled like I was by the misleading boxing art and the movie description. Save your money and your time.
