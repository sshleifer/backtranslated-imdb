What was the purpose of this movie? What was the story? I dont know. Shaq can not act, people do not know how to conduct, and I am Kazaam! A ghost rattling? Come on. Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will be in such a movie. I remember seeing that just to kill time. It did not really interest me. I just remember thinking, "Who put Shaq in this movie ???" The whole story also seemed stupid. It made no sense at all. I think an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find everything in the ghetto and anything can happen. I can not comment much more because this movie is so awful that it's worth nothing to comment on it. I "wished" that this movie would go away.
