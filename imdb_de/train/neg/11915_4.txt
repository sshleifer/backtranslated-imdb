This obvious pilot project for an unproduced TV series shows the young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as Amnesia with some incredible powers that must be deployed when a man who turns into a flying demon, the world disappointed. The CGI is equivalent for a TV job, and Appleby is fine as an amnesic, but hard to swallow as a super heroine. The familiar television face of Richard Burgi is included as Applebys mentor, but he can not help it to lift that filth over the mediocre level. From the beginning we see too much of the cartoon-like flying demon, a bad sign. Even the scenes in which Burgi trained Appleby for the fight, are actually ridiculous. They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other films, especially REMO WILLIAMS.
