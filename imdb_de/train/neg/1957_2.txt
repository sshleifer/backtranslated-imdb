I enjoyed this movie most of the time, but I always felt that I saw a children's movie. I honestly believe that someone wrote a Pg script and then decided to add blood, nudity and language during the shoot. It was a big disappointment. There is a belief that children's magic exists in movies like "Babe" (the pig) or "Angel in the outfield" that defeats the evil tooth fairy. In the end, her daughter's parents believe that she can see the spirit and use that ability to supernaturally defeat the Tooth Fairy. When I bought this movie, I thought it was a b-cinematic response to the dreadful darkness. Somehow, 1/4 of the money makes a better movie, but they do not. They have made a worse movie and are likely to lose the same amount of lost money when darkness falls.
