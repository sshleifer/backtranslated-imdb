This movie was so bad that I had to fast-wind most things to get the good parts. Hah what good bits? The only thing that was worth it was the end (who has seen the movie, knows what I mean). I expected a lot from this movie, as if an underworld were facing Freddy Vs. Meet Jason. But what I got was this crap. The story was forgotten, the cast was badly used and what did the director think when he did that. That could have been great, but it turned out to be the most boring movie I've ever seen. OK, what if there was a nice bit of T and A, I was behind the neck and I was sorely disappointed. Do not expect a movie that is good, but if you want a bad cheesy horror, then look at it and see how a horror movie SHOULD NOT BE MET.
