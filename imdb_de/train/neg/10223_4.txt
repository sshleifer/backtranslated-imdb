I remembered the title so well. For me it was a Flora Robson movie with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles. And it was Vincent Massey's voice behind the whiskers. Well, Flora Robson was great. Your next signature would be "55 Days at Beijing" for me. The same role, but with different lush clothes. And the same voice. The armada was a subtext. I like black and white films. Was everything done in Elizbethan at night? It was sometimes talkative and hard to fathom. I could not say what the love interest was. Was it the Spaniard or was it Vivien Leigh? And I do not think that Elizabeth I would have been the brilliant strategist who recommended the deployment of firefighting vessels against the Armada. Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. Historically this was perhaps more accurate, but Bette Davis had appealing scripts. And I missed daylight!
