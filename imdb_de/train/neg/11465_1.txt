Undoubtedly, this is one of the worst pictures I've ever paid to see money - the kind of movie you choose in despair at the mall movie theater during the Christmas break, if you missed the start times for something good, but still dead are on a movie! And that's how I came to see that stink bomb ... <br /> <br /> At intervals of more than three decades, I can still smell the rotting fish that makes up this story. Incredible conspiracy - that a killer whale bears a grudge against a person who is not on the sea - is ridiculous. And that's almost all, except for a completely missing "love theme" that plays over the end of a movie that does not contain a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is lovely (in a two-dimensional role), but Richard Harris just chews the scenery. He was not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and this is not a "Jaws". Luckily, I got most of it out of my head, and when I come across it on television in TV shows, I immediately go on. "Danger, Will Robinson!" See the current t.v. Advertisement showing a husband and wife whale watching ("Orca - I love Orca ...") - at least it's over in sixty seconds. This streak represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never get back.
