I wanted to say that this was the worst gay theme movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say that this is the worst movie I've seen in a genre I've ever seen. Getting into trouble when a movie begins with a "personal note" from the director, and asking about the "understanding" of the audience for the "many challenges" facing a first-time director. The audio track is so bad in many scenes that it's almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and this from a DVD version. Bad light, bad scenery, bad photography, bad script, bad acting usually contribute to the fact that this "film" is unsurpassed. After a few tries, I made it to the bad end and immediately gave away the DVD, which I bought stupid. I'm sure there are many challenges facing a first-time director. However, do not try to avert this lame attempt as a finished product. I see in IMDb details that this was not just the first directing effort by Richard Natale, but also the only one. That's the only positive thing I can say about this supposed "movie".
