I've seen how this movie thought it would be one of those old B movies that are fun to watch. I was so wrong! This film was boring and was obviously aimed at men who like to look at corpulent women. The story was so ridiculous and implausible that it lost all my interest. It seemed to be in the same genre as the Ed Wood films - bottom of the barrel.
