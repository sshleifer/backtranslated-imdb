I can see little girls enjoying this show, but it's ridiculous to call this a family show. I am amazed how well it is remembered after all these years. It's a hilarious and stupid show about the widowed father of three children who lives with the brother of his deceased wife and his stupid friend from school, and others when the seasons go by. All plotlines generally have a really stupid lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is mad at someone else, and every episode they make ends in a light, witless joke. As for the actors, I did not like them either. Bob Saget was as painless as the father with the responsibility of the mother. Dave Coulier is a 30-year joke that makes comic and behave like a kid, and he's terrible. John Stamos was the most bearable character, but he was so clich√©d that it was hard to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, in the show was a really bad actress and showed no emotion at all. The middle girl Stephanie was too stereotypical as an annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what bad actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they will be turned off. The storylines of too many storylines were so unrealistically stupid that they are worthy. This is a "family show" that seeks to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and although they are needed for a family show, they overdo it. This will be remembered as my least popular 80s and 90s sitcom. <br /> <br /> My rating: terrible show. TVG 30 min.
