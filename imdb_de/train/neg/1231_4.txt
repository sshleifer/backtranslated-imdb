Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a high-class housewife who lives in a suburban private estate with her twin children and abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della devotes all attention to the twins, neglecting their home and appearance and disturbing Kenneth. On Christmas Eve she travels to the local mall at night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts, and she finds no free parking space. When she sees an old car parked in two places, she leaves the owner with a message that calls him "selfish idiot." When the mall closes, Dellas car is held by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks. Chuckie, the African-American Huey, the Chinese-American Vingh and the Latin Tomás. When the mall guard guards her, Chuckie shoots him on the head. Della accelerates her car and tries to escape the criminals. However, she crashes with her truck near a forest while being pursued by the gang. She takes the toolbox, hides in the woods and fights against the gang to survive. <br /> <br /> A few days ago I saw the trailer of "While She Was Out" and I really wanted to watch the DVD. Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the movie, and I'm totally disappointed with this boring and implausible collection of clichés. Della Myers is portrayed as an insecure and careless housewife and does not exist as a wife. Motherhood is her only interest in her family concept. She is chased by four common criminals, but she defeats her with a toolbox that seems to be Batman's utility belt. Therefore, the plot is so absurd that it irritates. The gang of criminals consists of the favorite cliché of American films, with an African-American, a Chinese-American, and a Latin-American state politically correct along with an American lord. Kim Basinger has a decent acting, but her children are too young for a fifty-five-year-old woman. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora" ("While she was outside")
