My husband rented this in a video store and thought it was tense. (He never reads the synopsis). <br /> <br /> Well, it would be fun if the thing was to be seen. It just is not like that. The same thing over and over again, no intrigues, and WHERE did you find the leading man? The senior man, Michael Des Barres, does not even look good, especially for the role he's getting. Also, sexual harassment in the workplace is something you want to see hire Michael Crichton's "Disclosure." At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early '90s. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, who is normally seen, plays an embarrassing scene here. There are also lighting effects that are cheaper than at home. Do not even waste the time to rent this. 0/10.
