When I saw this movie for the first time in the cinema 11 years ago, I loved it. I still think that directing and cinematography are excellent, as well as the music. But it's really the script that has disturbed me more and more over time. I find the writing by Emma Thompson selfish and unfaithful to the original book; She has reduced Marianne to a minor character, a second violin to her much too old, much too strict Elinor - she has many kinds of "focus moments" in the film and often they just seem to be there to show off Thompson herself /> <br /> I understand how she cuts off several characters from the book, but omitted the only scene Willoughby redeems in the book? For someone who kept the book red and appreciated long before the movie, these are things that are always hard to digest. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. She does not have the best script in the world she can work with, but she still pulls it up gracefully without too much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, maybe a bit old, but he plays the role wonderfully. And Elizabeth Spriggs is absolutely fantastic as always.
