Do not understand how these animated films come out, and no matter how well (or badly) people love it. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). They like pretty much everything animated (like most people who rated this movie). The theater was almost full and I was looking forward to seeing the movie with its great cast. To tell the truth, I was bored. It was incredibly predictable and just funny. There were a few giggles in the movie and that was it. Of course, they kept trying to get the cheap laugh, but it just did not work. My son almost always tells me he wants the DVD after watching an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep halfway. The kids also thought that the character animation looked funny. I have not heard of them since I saw the Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares. Trust me, I'm not the guy who's looking for the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and like so many animated films they throw out there, they have very little.
