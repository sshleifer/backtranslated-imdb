From the rundown ranks of the already over-saturated 'Hillybilly Horror' subgenre comes this sad story of one of Inbred Redneck's terrorized holiday family. Sounds familiar? Well, it should definitely be for anyone who has even a passing knowledge of the horror genre. It is absolutely new here. The movie seems to be content to recycle all the old, worn-out clich√©s (deformed Hicks, a peaceful family that turned out to be Sagittarius, the rebellious daughter, the "freak," who's good at heart, etc.) but that too is half-hearted enough to make this a waste of time. This is a memorable muck, but humorous enough that J.D. Hart starred in a movie titled "Films That Suck" in his career, a rather ironic omen. <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
