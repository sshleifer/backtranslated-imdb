How sad it was to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise had to make this terrible apology for a movie. Tina still looked fit and attractive, but for some reason she seems really scared. I can understand her fear. fear that this third stinker will somehow be made public. I am also a fan of the sympathetic Adam West. Like Tina, Adam looks good and fit for a man of his age. His acting here is passable, but the script is so bad that it is difficult to even hear the dialogue. The far-right cycling group has gotten out of control in a small hick town. The bikers here look like a colorful group and I do not want them to go out with my sister. The acting is stiff and wooden, and the plot is as old as sand. Hellriders is hell to watch!
