This movie is totally garbage. A feeble-minded intellectual consoles himself by doing his best to demand the superiority of the aristocrat to the working class. No more than a piece of complacency catharsis. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> If this kind of movie is going on in the US, it will certainly make a big joke. And just because it comes from "the other side", it turns into a masterpiece, a wonderful conversation for certain brainwashed and / or brain washing westerns (some George W. maybe). A typical episode of the Cold War, kind of a joke anyway. <br /> <br /> I would say that, as expressed in this film, this is what Soviet intellectuals all thought at the time. Perhaps they deserve all the misery they claim to have gone through. BUT NO! Because like many others, I have read and seen real masterpieces by outstanding Soviet intellectuals. For example, something that is also relevant to the dog, "White Bim Black Ear" - both the book by Gavriil Troyepolsky and the film by Stanislav Rostotsky - is a true masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, true sadness, true pride and dignity, one of the best in the Soviet era.
