Manmohan Desai made some entertaining but illogical films like AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he did some craps like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him Mardardard nahin hota, but the movie is so bad that you are terrified. <br /> <br /> The Brits are made of caricatures and the movie looks so weird. The scene at the British hotel is damn stupid The movie has a lot of stupidities like Amrita attacking Amitabh and then the whole scene and towards the climax the movie gets even worse. There are more gems like the horse statue that gets life, The masks of Amitabh haha ​​and much more Manmohan Desai is bad Music is okay <br /> <br /> Amitabh does his part in style, nothing but COOL, LAAWARIS Type roles Amrita Singh is okay Satyen Kapuu is okay Prem Chopra is as usual, Nirupa Roy is back to normal Even Dara Singh is as usual
