I had to see that at school. And in summary ... <br /> <br /> Talentless actor, talentless screenplay and a talentless director. <br /> <br /> This movie is such a waste of your time. Do not even look at the movie. Do not bother. You will be so disappointed. My teacher said it should be good. How was she wrong? She even slept through a bit. The actors of the movie were just bad. The best actor was the old man and that does not say much. It has a terrible plot with terrible characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say that it did not make sense. The script was numb and confusing. There were points in the movie when I frowned and said, "What?". There were just too many loose ties and action holes. It was absolutely terrible.
