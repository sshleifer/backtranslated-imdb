After seeing many reality TVs "Next Action Star", TiVo took on this awesome trick. For some bizarre reason - and I only blamed myself - I looked at it all and hoped that there was something unique in the entire movie. After so much hype about Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" with action-flicks, he should make sure he's focused on his alchemy. <br /> <br /> First, Billy Zane was the only redeeming value of the entire movie. and even he could not lift the slipper out of the chisel. Apart from that, Zane's performance fluctuates about 2/3 of the way, as he does not even seem to know what else he has to do but look smug. <br /> <br /> Can not blame him here. The writing was honestly shit. Take the ideas of "Rat Race," "Enemy of the State," "Terminator," "Midnight Run," and any bad gambling movie you can imagine, and just pick it up. And who was the genius idea to have two bridge chase sequences in a row? Sean Carrigan, The Man of the Hour by The Next Action Star, highlights all the strengths and weaknesses of casting directors mention throughout the run of the series. A one-note Johnny, Sean plays the stupid, good-looking jock very well, but he's having trouble bearing the weight of the movie. Honestly, it never seems to matter to us if he lives halfway or dies, as Carrigan gives the audience no reason to like him at all. His stupid but happy routine is getting old, as there is not really anything in the character he should choose. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan is a dream compared to the rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot made of wood. Did Howard Fine really say she should pretend to be the terminator for the first half of the movie? I do not think so. I always expected her to quote Arnie. Her character "performance" can only be compared to the dramatic depths of "Freddy Got Fingered," though they are far from well developed. The camera loves her in dark, shady sedans, but in the harsh daylight her behavior sucks all the energy off the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed more naturalness in her five-minute part than Corinne at some point in her screen time. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Sean had the sturdy, good looks to make a good head start in an ensemble cast should not have been left to make this a solo. It was just too big a task for him. "Next Action Star" colleague Jared Elliot may have been luckier with a little more dynamic character, but it's hard to say when you introduce Jeff Welch's lame script. Someone should take Welch's iMac from him before he or others hurt. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot was just too far away from her reach, even for such a complete crap. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be ashamed.
