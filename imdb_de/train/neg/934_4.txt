Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as good as usual. Ritter was not bad either. Her name was as pretty as ever. It could have been a good movie. Too bad the conspiracy was abominable. It was completely predictable, banal and boring. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film was laid out like a child's color by numbers. The characters consisted of punched cardboard parts. There was nothing new or interesting to say, and that completely outweighed the acting, which was a pity. <br /> <br /> Finally, the writer was too bad he was not the victim. Especially with the "precocious" lines of the child, which were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Again, it's just acting that prevents a much lower score.
