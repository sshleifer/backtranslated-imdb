This was the worst movie I ever saw Billy Zane in. I understand that this movie was mainly intended for the new arrivals who were pretty good for newbies, but overall the movie was not credible. > With all the shots you would think the police had intervened. Even the coin, which was a mistake with Sean, was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes that the coin is the mistake was not realistic. <br /> <br /> Looks like this movie was quickly beaten up. Bad job. Get a better author. <br /> <br /> The countdown to the end was not consistent with anything. The fight took longer. And what a coincidence that Billy has no bullets every time he bombs Billy. Once I can believe, but not twice. <br /> <br /> In fact, Billy's character was stupid. It was so stupid when Sean finally knocked him out. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
