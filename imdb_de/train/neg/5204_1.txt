"Trigger Man" is definitely the most boring and stupid movie I've ever seen in my life. More fascinating are the holiday videos of my aunt. The actors seem to be recruited at uglypeople.com. They have no talent for acting convincingly. <br /> <br /> You go and go and go through the forest. There is more walking around than in all three parts of The Lord of the Rings together. After the first hour I started to read a Porsche brochure while I saw "Trigger Man" on the way. Dreadful. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time and money. I would give the movie 0 out of 10 stars, since this is not possible, I have to award 1 star.
