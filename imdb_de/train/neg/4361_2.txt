With footage plundered by Planet of Dinosaurs, this video (other than the stolen footage) is a group of people who were shot into space and land on a dinosaur planet that ... will not wait 'It is really earth. It's a five-minute sketch that spans 90 minutes. Slightly better than Chickboxer (another in the Bad Movie Police series) - with a nostalgic home-movie feel and good stolen effects, this movie is still an impossible challenge. I still have to think about the question of whether we become so uncreative that we now plunder old films not only for action, but also for mismatched material. Obviously, low-budget producers are so desperate that they really give us everything to take our money
