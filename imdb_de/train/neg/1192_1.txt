I completely agree with jamrom4. This was the most horrible movie I have ever seen. Holy crap, it was terrible. I warned not to see it. And I looked at it stupidly anyway. In about 10 minutes after the painful The experience that I completely gave up to see the atrocities, but I sat through to the end. Just to see if I could. Well, I did and now I wish I did not have it. It was disgusting ... nothing happened and the end was all preachy..no movie that is bad has the right to survive..I beg all of you to spare yourself the horror of greasy drives of the bus..if I only please note the same warning .. please save yourself from this movie .. I feel that those who rated it high were involved in making the film. And all should be wiped off the face of the planet.
