"ASTONISHING" yells the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. You must have referred to the fact that such a sad bitch was ever published. The film revolves around a group of girls suffering from a disease that forces them to become cannibals and murder innocent people just to stay alive. Your skin peels off during the film, we also see severed legs, heads, etc. that are about as convincing as a Halloween fuzzy felt set. There are a lot of conversations, a bit of human cooking, and a funny zombie hunter locking those involved in the skin disease in his closet strapped to a chair before stabbing them in the head and chopping them in bits ... <br / > <br /> You get the picture. Considering that there is no acting talent at all, the Gore is ridiculously unrealistic. What is the meaning of this whole farrago? Another look at the video box is the "Responsible for the underground cult". Would it be like these strange religious cults that brainwash you to think in one direction when clearly the opposite is the case? Because that is the only possible reason why someone can remember to observe this tax write-off. Then he compares in the same section with Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA oh stop it. Now you are just stupid. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Are you offended by the above opinion? If so, you must be a member of the said cult. Do you spend your wages? Do you let other family members see you? You force her to watch Andrew Parkinson movies until you think he's the best director since A. Hitchcock? Tell me ... that sounds like a panorama special for me. And greet the critic of LA times when you return to your colony, right? 0/10
