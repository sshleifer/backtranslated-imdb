Despite positive reviews and film screenings at international festivals, this film is not for everyone. The story is very similar to other films in which a teenager from the immigrant family has to overcome many common people's problems of their age, and also to fight against the pressures of ethnic traditions in their family. She does that by choosing a sport, and with the help of a local boy who falls in love with her for some reason, she confronts her problems and wins. Like Beckham, it's football, and now it's Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But Fighter is a much inferior product than these two, it was just embarrassing to see it. Semra Turan, the actress who plays the role of a teenage girl, may do a lot, but she can not act. Her presence on screen is anemic and awkward, the dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotion are terrible, her body and her facial language are of amateur actress, who are poorly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a bit better, but they just can not save this clich√© movie with stereotyped characters and flat plot. Apart from a few relatively good moments, this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer. <br /> <br /> Even kung fu fighting is no reason to look, it's just boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lack of inspiration, and most kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all sorts of kung fu positions, not really fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small, skinny girl battles tall and muscular boys and pushes them off their feet. <br /> <br /> The only reason this film even attracted attention is that it's European. It's very easy to make this movie known - a first martial arts film from Denmark, but do not be fooled. It's just a drama about stupid teen girls and their problems that by the way do not really convince. <br /> <br /> Bad movie with embarrassing lines, drama and story.
