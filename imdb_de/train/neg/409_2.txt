<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombarded this one. He became a joke for himself. Once again, we have a movie that includes sex and violence, immorality, libel of women and a lot of conversation between characters and missed pans. <br /> <br /> It's all for free. Because there is no action at all in this film. It deceives all its set pieces. All actors give the kind of performances from a Verhoeven movie. In other words, it is traded almost everywhere. Starship Troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world that inhabited the characters. In this regard, the scientists behave the same way. I'm sorry, Paul, but soldiers and scientists are not really made of the same mindset. <br /> <br /> A big mistake in the conspiracy was that Kevin Bacon's character returned to science after escaping for this one night to do evil things, in which we have already spent more than enough time have to watch these animated males (with the exception of Elizabeth Shue) as they walk and talk. Why do not you show how the character could make a difference in the outside world? How could you possibly track him down if he could be anywhere? Think of all the different things that could be done with this concept, both in terms of history and characterization. Then look at what this movie does and you really how bad the whole project really was. <br /> <br /> More insulting is the Doco on the DVD, in which everyone claims that Verhoeven is a kind of MAd genius. Well, one in two is not that bad. <br /> <br /> This film contains nothing special. Just like the title says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
