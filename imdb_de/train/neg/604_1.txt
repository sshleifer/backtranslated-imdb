I was so disgusted with this film that I felt obliged to warn others. This movie has no story, storyline or hint. The film begins with the standard "let be scary" intro, which has since become accustomed to every movie observer. So we can completely ignore the beginning. We'll soon be introduced to the lead actress, and from that point on, it's clear to everyone that you've just wasted your hard work and it would be better to look at static effects. (If you have not seen white noise - EEK) Acting is a DISGRACE and everyone should return to the pantomime from which they came. However, even the best actors in the world would have difficulty making this movie TV-ready. Their poor performance contributes only to the disaster. Meaningless violence, and what I can only guess, is the written word of another "eccentric" writer who has probably considered himself an artist and led a film that puts your patience to the test. It was only when my observer turned to me and said, "We've been watching this for 45 minutes," that I realized that this movie is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a teabag. Obviously something was missing and unfortunately it was not the audience. Rather than pointing out what the movie is missing, let me tell you what he has: stupid blond (surprise, surprise), victim, evil monster-guy thing, about 2 minutes of storyline spanning hours, days, weeks, months extend ... and credits. <br /> <br /> Want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl looks a bit naughty in some scenes, but expects her face to be torn off for the rest of the movie!
