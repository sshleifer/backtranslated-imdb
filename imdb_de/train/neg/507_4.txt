Unlike my reviewers, I always try to find something redeeming with blood in every movie I see. Something must be lost in the translation of the word "bloodsucker" from the Italian in the title; Almost as if the producers were originally filming a gothic vampire story and then changing their minds, they could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence so they would still be included in the movie. <br /> <br /> This film was made in 1975, recently released on DVD and comes with its own movie trailer, which in some ways is more daring than seen in the movie. Well, anyone who buys this film has probably already read his synopsis and knows what to expect - Italian soft porn I bought it because I feel attracted to Christa Nelli (mostly called "Krista Nell"). I find the absence of a cast of characters the most frustrating in many of these Eurosleaze films of the '60s and' 70s. I was hoping Imdb would show the cast of the characters if their names were heard in the film, but without a cast list, it's very difficult for them to associate with the actor in question. I think Krista Nell played "Cora" but under that massive hairstyle. Costume and make-up are difficult To distinguish them for sure. <br /> <br /> There is mostly a two-dimensional representation of the actors of their role, and nobody really stands out. Something may be lost in the synchronization process. What were the positive points? The music was atmospheric and of course, if you are interested in beautiful lesbian soft porn, it is there. The locations outside were good and I would like to know where they filmed the castle on their island. North or the Republic?) In 1902, everyone wears costumes from the time. Some scenes I found unintentionally funny, especially these sex scenes !! Anyway, a pleasing game. I rated it with 4/10.
