A wonderful television mini-series completely ruined by a 45-year-old woman desperately trying to impersonate a 16-year-old connoisseur! No exaggeration - this is the actual age of the figure played by Ali MacGraw when the film opens just before the surprise attack in Pearl Harbor. This TV miniseries is really the classic example of the title of this post. I always refer when the topic comes up. That alone makes this totally unsurpassable, though it's one of the best filmed "global" dramas of World War II that TV has ever produced. If you have the stomach - or a good fast-forward ability - you may enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I am stunned by some comments related to the love story (pun intended). Did you watch the movie with your eyes closed? Or are they aging boomers who repeatedly astonish me with their "selective memories" and "selective visions." I'm a boomer myself, so do not think I'm a hopeless young punk. 45 WILL ALWAYS LOOK 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age gracefully damned. <br /> <br /> The winds of war could have been ... so good. How much more would we be talking about this miniseries today, about 25 years later, if an ACTUAL idea had taken on such an important and crucial role? At the moment, with the constant old Biddy distraction, this alone accounts for most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds of War.
