As an Altman fan, I had been searching for this movie for years, thinking that he would have to be at least a little brilliant with such a great cast. <br /> <br /> Big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of Altman's major mixes, arbitrary and improvisational (or feels so), in the hope that everything would come together in the editorial space. That's not the case. <br /> <br /> As Maltin points out, this turkey is only notable for the debut of Alfre Woodard, which dwarfs the vets around them. But otherwise you avoid at all costs. (Which is pretty easy to do - it has never been released on video - to my knowledge - and the cable gigs are the frequency of Halley's Comet.)
