The wealthy widower Anthony Steffen (as Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover and British lord. He brings sexy red-haired women to his castle where he whips them and murders them. Erika Blanc (as Susie), the black bootie, gets away temporarily. Mr. Steffen is being persecuted by Mrs. "Evelyn", who died at birth. As a therapy, he decides to marry again, after he met the pretty blonde Marina Malfatti (as Gladys). At the end of the film they had to dig a few more graves. "The night Evelyn came out of the grave" is at least a great title. <br /> <br /> ** La Notte che Evelyn on the Tomba (1971) Emilio Miraglia - Anthony Steffen - Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
