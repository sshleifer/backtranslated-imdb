Not to be confused with the above-average supernatural thriller "The Sentinel". The Sentinel was for me a big bore of a movie that did not deliver the consistent action, a few critics promised. For me, it seemed like everyone was halfling and just there to make some quick money, because it felt like a TV movie. The Sentinel is a repash of several better movies, like "In The Line Of Fire," this has no originality, and watching Michael Douglas walk around felt stupid in my opinion. The main problem besides its unoriginality was the bad pace. I was often distracted as I tried to watch this movie while looking at how much time was left. Not just the abuse with Eva Longoria, who was not worth a look. <br /> <br /> Performances. Michael Douglas is usually a reliable actor, obviously the movements are going through here. As a man on the run or as a secret agent, he does not convince. His chemistry with Bassinger was also out. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here he is just OK, that's all. He tries to look a bit brusque, but managed to be more bland than anything else, and to be honest he did not seem to be so interested. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. She does not convince in her role and was a feast for the eyes. Kim Basinger is quite terrible as a 1st Lady. She looks bored, and her role is a litter, more than anything else. Martin Donovan has a big role in the end, but not enough for me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion. The Sentinel is yet another political thriller that has bored me to tears. It is too old, too tired and, above all, the lack of effort is sucked. Not recommendable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
