This is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photography and good intentions, but confused and incoherent. Garcia plays as John Berlin, a directed detective from LA Berlin, who has moved to a small California town at the behest of a friend on the local troupe. He is soon involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder that leads him to theorize about the existence of a serial killer nobody else believes. The known victim is considered blind, which leads to a romance with a blind girl witnessing - in a nearby school for the blind. Despite a fascinating story, there were too many quantum leaps and storylines in this movie that made me wonder how the hell were we up here? or 'how did we find that out?' Despite the good acting I found it confusing and incoherent etc. John Malkovich has a small role as F.B.I at the end. Investigators out to get to Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
