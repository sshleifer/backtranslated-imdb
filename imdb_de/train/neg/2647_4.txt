I say one thing for Jeanette and Nelson - even if they're stranded in a happy, funny, painlessly unfamiliar musical like this, there's still that sparkle in their eyes. Yes, the chemistry between the famous duo is also there when the material is as thin as paper. Even if the score is practically mind-blowing, there are few earwigs. And even if the circumstances are so incredible - yes, even for a fantasy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, she has more chemistry with Nelson than with her own real husband Gene Raymond in SMILIN THROUGH. The movie was still a much better movie. Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as well as the next fan, but this is the end of the pile. Jeanette is more than embarrassed in her only "hep" number with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only come up with a blank look when confronted with the most ridiculous situations on Broadway in 1938. Surely he must have had more wit and style than is the case with this weak MGM production. Edward Everett Horton plays in an inglorious role, and none of the supporting players can breathe life into this chaos. It's like an amateur night in the studio, even if the few professionals are sprinkled among the minor characters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: painfully awkward rendering of a Rodgers and Hart musical. Can not recommend it, also for fans of MacDonald and Eddy. And although Jeanette's close-ups still shine with their wafer-thin beauty, this film is stunningly bad.
