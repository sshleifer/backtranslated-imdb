As an impressive 10-year-old I liked the philosophy of the 70s sitcom "Bridget Loves Bernie". I understood the controversy surrounding the romantic complications between a Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and an Irish Catholic schoolteacher (Meredith Baxter) and both parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents) and Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents), who have problems with the inter-religious marriage of the young couple. <br /> <br /> If I look at the show now with years of personal life experiences, I am amazed that the show was even a success. although season highly rated. Veteran TV writer Bernard Slade, who a few years after canceling the show wrote the successful piece "Same Time, Next Year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" was a very light, superficial comedy that collapsed under her own breezy weight The Real Chemistry between Birney and Baxter could not be denied. In later years, both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (Birney in his short-lived role in "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here they tried to breathe life into a show that needed a much wasteful comic book edge, which might have deepened the complications of a highly controversial topic. The show ran Saturday night between two CBS power plants: "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both shows were smart, funny and had enough of Rand (more on the former than the latter), which sparked my interest in the situation and the characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very smart and only occasionally had a giggle. <br /> <br /> This was another example of a show that was not really as good as I remembered.
