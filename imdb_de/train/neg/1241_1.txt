This is the worst movie I have seen in years! It starts to make a fool of himself and continues in the same way. I think when will something happen in this movie, and the drama is worse. The end lifts it up and saves the movie from a total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. I'm sorry, Tim Burton Batman was good, but this is shit.
