The authors and producers of this little excursion have broken new depths of corruption. Has the writing pad adjusted so badly, or had the ideas dried out so much that they were forced to insert a hideous scene in which a young woman in the backseat of a delivery van is defecates, and then dump the feces immediately back onto the car throws (brainstorms) At least you summarize what this movie is worth). We had already been treated with one of the other women who had urinated on one of her friends at gunpoint, as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; would have been enough ... we got the message! This means bringing toilet humor to another level! If the script and acting had been better, I could easily have forgotten that I saw a movie that was completely shot on low-budget videos. This was a rather original plot, with a skilful (single) direction in which we could only ever get the vantage point out of the van; This makes it feel much more real. We have never looked into other places, such as the shop or the field where several women have disappeared, and this could have added the necessary tension. <br /> <br /> The script was bleak. Lines like, "I do not feel so well ... I want to go home" after one of the girls was persecuted by a psychopath; Raped and shot at by a screwdriver, they look a little undercooked. <br /> <br /> The acting was devilish (apart from the maniac). Have learned all five leading actresses in this spectacle by doing a correspondence course during a long post strike! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the entire movie with the subtitles. The director seemed to have a light job. It seems that the only direction he must have been was "Scream Girls." <br /> AND HOW SHOUTING ...... If you see this, please have some paracetamol ready!
