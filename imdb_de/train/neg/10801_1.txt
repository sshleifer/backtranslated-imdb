Well, I watch movies that have received bad reviews, and say, "Hmm ... that's not so bad!" I loved The Cable Guy and thought My Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Remember, I really did not look at it with high hopes, but I figured that ... maybe just ... it would be so bad in a way that I could laugh about it. I was wrong. At no time during my suffering from this "movie" (and I use that term sparingly), I was even almost mild talk. At the beginning, Shaq Quentin Tarantino looks like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I could tell, an Amish priest would probably be a better rapper than he. The main character is just annoying and not a character you can easily like. To be honest, I would rather eat a greasy droppings from the bloody wounds of a harlequin fetus than to see it again.
