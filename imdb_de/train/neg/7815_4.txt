As a longtime fan of Superman from the comics, the 50's series, the first two films of Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark, and finally Smallville, I * really * hoped for something clever with "Superman Returns." <Instead, we brought Lex Luthor another attempt at converting real estate, another kryptonite sequence with cocky forces during wear, and internal inconsistencies: he could not prevent him from falling into the forest ocean when stuck with 6 "kryptonite, but if Lois 3 "breaks off from it, * embedded the rest in himself *, can he * lift * a * continent into space? The only hero in the story really was Lois's partner - I can not remember his name. He did all kinds of lifesaving, heroic things with nothing but courage and skill - no superpowers, no invulnerability ... just a normal person. <br /> <br /> They make Superman so small. Why can not Superman fight Brainiac or fight to save the universe from General Zod rather than Lex's petty schemes? Oh, I forgot they did it in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yes ... I think I'll stay at Smallville. <br /> <br /> also ...
