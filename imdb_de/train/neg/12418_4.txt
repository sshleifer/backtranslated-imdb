I just did not see this movie when it was released and praised as the best picture of the year here in Israel. and to summarize it all, let me just say: This is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is Dror Shaul's second feature film, and I have to admit that he did his first and the TV drama before. This picture is much better. In addition, this is his first attempt to lead a drama. The early works were comedies and were funny and effective. <br /> <br /> The first thing you need to know if you will ever see this movie: Israel of the 21st Century hates the kibbutz and the values ​​that it has since represented the formation of the State of Israel. The real situation of the kibbutzim is very dark, and some of them disappear gradually. The kibbutz, Hebrew word for collective, was a kind of village for members only, where the values ​​of equality and socialism were the dogma of everyday life. With the change in social values ​​over time, the kibbutz now seems to be a place where the human mind has been suppressed, within dogma rules, without a ticket. The entry of capitalist values ​​and lifestyles in the 1990s made it hard for the kibbutzim to survive. The crazy mother in the movie is the central metaphor for that. <br /> <br /> But I consider this movie nothing as nostalgic for the good old days of kibbutz. Once it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quiet environment. but the movie shows the opposite. that the kibbutz, with its socialist dogma, was a place like a cult of madmen, with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each individual within the collective. This is the central philosophy of postmodern capitalism: your individuality is the most important thing. You have to stand in the middle, and nobody but you is the thing. This is the philosophy the movie stands for, and that's just the first sin. <br /> <br /> If you disagree with me politically, you will surely agree that acting is the tone of the film. It's a script and its direction are the four sins that follow. The film has no real visual text and none of its recordings is something to remember. It is also very "tender", a delicacy that is nothing more than an artistic fart attempt to trigger emotions that do not appear in the film and not in the viewer. It just bores. <br /> <br /> Can someone please explain: why did this movie win so many awards? Maybe because it shows that Israel is in tune with the rest of the world and hates socialist and human values? or does it perhaps show that Israel is a "delicate" place that does not yield to dogmas and fanaticism? that we are basically very human and good people capable of feeling, especially if they are fake, as capitalism expects us to do. Or perhaps because it tells one of the biggest lies of Israeli cinema in recent years, a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the Jewish state? No matter what the answer is, it's not good. Not for the world, not for human values ​​and not for the Jews.
