Expectations were pretty high for me when I visited this movie, and I thought Steve Carell could not go wrong by being replaced by great films like Anchorman, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I start with what's right with this movie: Steve Carell may be Steve Carell in certain places. There are a handful of moments in the movie that made me laugh, and it's almost entirely due to having the latitude to do his thing. He is undoubtedly a gifted person and it is a shame that he committed himself to a total train accident in my opinion. <br /> <br /> If that's not the case, I'll talk about what went wrong. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Dan Burns, a widowed girl with three girls, who is being considered for a National Consultative Council rate. He prepares his girls for a family reunion where his relatives, who have been with him for a long time, spend some time together. <br /> <br /> The family is high on the list of things that make up this horrible movie. No family behaves like that. It's almost as if they were transported from Pleasantville or Beaver. They are a caricature of what we mean by a family when we are 7. It reaches the point where it becomes uncomfortable and simply frustrating. Touch football, crossword competitions, family bowling and talent shows. ARE NOT AS THE ACTUAL PEOPLE IS. It is almost sick. <br /> <br /> Another big mistake is the woman Carell is about to fall for. Watching her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated. What I imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman, looks a bit mildly retarded. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is playing on another planet. I left the theater and wondered what I was seeing. After further reflection, I do not think it was much.
