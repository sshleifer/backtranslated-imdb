This is the first of those "8 Films To Die For" collections I've seen, and it certainly does not make me want to see the rest ... though I've heard that at least some of them are decent. I do not know, that was not so bad, but it did not do much for me. Their basic dysfunctional cannibal family in the suburbs, so mom and dad died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?), Where they still brought strays home if possible. The best part was the spooky Goth sister, who naturally invites a friend from the school who never leaves. Anyway, of course we have a butcher in the basement and so on and so on. This family is something like the white bread version of the Sawyer clan, they are evil and they do bad things, but they are not souls. I see a lot of reviews from people who like this, and I do not know what I've missed, but I found it very mediocre and would not recommend it to anyone, really. 4 out of 10.
