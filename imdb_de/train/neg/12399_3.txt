The supernatural, vengeful cop is back for a third installment, this time as a guardian angel for a wrongfully accused policewoman. Standard stick and slash image, yet well played and directed, which makes it incredibly interesting and observable, though the violence does not apply to the squeamish (especially the director-cut, who was originally rated "NC-17"). <Br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
