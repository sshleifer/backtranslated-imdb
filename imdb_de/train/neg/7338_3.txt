I watched this movie and hoped to find a nice and interesting story, but the story was not good at all. The spectacle of the actors was not better. Of course, Shahrukh Khan was there, but it was not enough to make this movie "believable" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I read that this film is based on Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovary", but for me, I have not seen him agree with the Indian mentality. <br /> <br /> Generally, we buy a movie to dream and have a good time so as not to waste our time and make our mood worse. I just can not understand how you could get such a "high" vote with an average of 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> So it's the kind of movie you should run away and ignore, because it does not appreciate anything! You will only waste your time if you like "dark movie" with "strange and not meaningful story".
