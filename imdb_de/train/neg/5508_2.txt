Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to break into serious television reports. If a job he begged for fails, he is fired. His beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) also says Sayonara. When he gets home, Tim is surprised to discover that his home has an unwelcome visitor (Christopher Lloyd) from the planet Mars! Tim calls him Uncle Martin and soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on Earth. However, Martin is in trouble everywhere, from the bathroom to the laundry room and much more. Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees an opportunity to spend time with Tim, but the true love story does not go smoothly in this case either. Soon everyone on television is watching Tim, hoping for a story about a true alien. What does a man do? For those who loved the same eponymous TV show with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this movie is not worthy of putting on the proverbial boots. It is truly indisputably terrible, without conspiracy, and on alleged special effects that also fall flat. Daniels is okay as Earthman, but Lloyd is just as terrible as the alien and has overreacted a storm. The rest of the cast is just as appropriate as the costumes, the set and the production details. Even if your kids see the cover and beg for this movie, convince them to look for another movie in the video library. Rest assured that children and adults will find this movie a colossal bore.
