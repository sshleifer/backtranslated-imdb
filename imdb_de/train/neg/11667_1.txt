This film was a great disappointment in the direction, the intellectual level, the conspiracy and dealing with the subject of painting. It's a slow-moving movie, like a sequel to Wonder Years, but with a frightening lack of depth. Nor is it able to convey its message convincingly. <br /> <br /> Dealing with the topic of painting is very elitist and limited to vague and subjective terms like "beauty". According to the creators of this film, "beauty" can only be experienced in kitschy landscapes in the Bob Ross style. Good art after this movie can be achieved by applying basic color theory (like elementary school) and a lot of feeling. In parts, the film is insulting, z. At one point it is said (rather celebrated by dancing on tables) that people with intellectual disabilities have no emotions or can not express them through painting, since their works are worthless by definition /> I do not understand how the film has such a high rating again, not many people have rated it yet, and they have only chosen very high or very low grades.
