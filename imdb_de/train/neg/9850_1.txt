I felt brain dead, I'll tell you. This is the worst movie I have ever bought. (In my ignorance, I thought this was the eponymous Peter Jackson movie). The performances are so horrible that they are ridiculous. The special effects have not proven and look bleak. The script promotes this kind of TV movie, staring into the middle distance. The actors look as if they have taken lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they each have a look and stick to it. Besides, I never got confused by a movie until I sat down to watch it. Is it a dream or a conspiracy so horrible that the frustration sets in within minutes. Avoid like a plague.
