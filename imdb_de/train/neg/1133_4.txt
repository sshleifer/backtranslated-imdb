I have seen romantic comedies, and this is one of the simplest / worst attempts. Many scenes are plug-and-play features that are strictly adapted to the romantic comedy. Usually this is okay because it's a genre, but the challenge is generally to make it new, original, and original. This is not the case in this film. <br /> <br /> Apart from Sylvie Moreau (who is the real star of this movie, not Isabelle Blais), there is no point in who the characters really are. They fit into this one-dimensional stereotype and become nothing more than simple puppets that serve a very light narrative. <br /> <br /> The tempo of the movie can be annoying, the rhythm is lacking, and the cut is filled with unnecessary close-ups. I should also mention the overly stylized decors that some scenes naturally lack, or rather make the attempt seem natural. Of course you also have the right music, which unfortunately does not fit. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that a movie that makes Woody Allen allusions obvious is ultimately so fraudulent. If you expect a good carefree romantic comedy, this is not the case. Or rather a bad attempt. You'll just leave the theater wondering why this movie has received so much praise when the cinema is over 100 years old and there are far superior Quebecois directors making better films. Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But it is bad when you consider cinema as an art and directors as an author.
