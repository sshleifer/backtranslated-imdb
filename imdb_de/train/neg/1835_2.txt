Start with the script. I have seen cartoons with more depth than "Envy". Whenever the characters repeat what they have already seen, the first time it was not funny, a movie is in big trouble, which is certainly "Envy". A movie based on a joke should go somewhere better. Here is a movie that is absolutely nowhere to go. Christopher Walken likes to forget about this bomb because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller had immediately come to mind in some pretty good black comedies, "Flirting With Disaster" and "Duplex." Be sure that "Envy" is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, just total nonsense. "Envy" deserves its low rating because it stinks like the subject. - MERK
