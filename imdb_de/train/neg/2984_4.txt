I admit that most of this film was not inspired, but I was still entertained. It has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy, above-average music, and the women in the film defend themselves fiercely, there are no jokes here. I can imagine dozens of other films that were much worse, at least this one had a fascinating storyline along with some social commentary. They allude to the military's handling of viral epidemics, destroying everything in sight, even if it means people should save. Also how dangerous martial law can be, because at this time no democracy exists anymore. Fulci seemed to be trying to combine his earlier work (Zombie, Beyond, Gates of Hell) to somehow improve it. He failed, but by no means miserable, as some people make you think. I have a penchant for zombie movies, so I admit I'm a bit biased when it comes to reviewing them. All I'm saying is that this movie is good once, if there is not so much descent in this movie (fulci quit and bruno (i can chop with the best of them) mattei took over) it could have been a lot better and more focused can. It will remain in my collection as fulci's Zombie Swan song a scene in Zombie 3 where the cemetery man was actually demolished, I could not believe it myself, look at it, you'll be surprised.
