I'm a friendly person, so I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. It was without doubt the worst movie I've seen in a long time. There was very little conspiracy and the deeper interesting areas that were addressed, d. H. What Jesus really wanted was glossed over, and instead we received heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted on our heroine (Arquette). A total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humane for both her character and the audience. The acting was hardly there and the director was not inspired. And when I saw another drop of water or pigeon fly to the camera, I might have screamed louder than Patricia.
