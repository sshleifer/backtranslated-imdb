# 1 Vampires Vs. Humans <br /> <br /> # 2 Military Rejection of the Roughneck Squad as first aid for dangerous, unknown vampire attacks. <br /> <br /> # 3 Sexy female vampire at the side of the "good guys". <br /> <br /> # 4 Lots of Gage and Action. <br /> <br /> There are four (4) large plotters to help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four, the next plotter will not put you off ... <br /> <br /> # 5 In space. <br /> <br /> The last one almost got me, too, but I'm glad I watched. In a bunch of terrible direct-to-video horror, this is the sci-fi channel Halloween Marathon ... This movie is a breath of fresh air. It will be able to compete against any of the other sci-fi channel offerings, even the other vampire movie that Natassia played in (who always gives Uwe Boll money?).
