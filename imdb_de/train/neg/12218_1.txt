Very bad. Very very bad. As a man struggling to make, be in, or at least sniff the catering table of a movie set, I find it hard to criticize independents who have actually made a film of every kind. This movie ... oh oh. <br /> <br /> The achievement of Frightworld seeks nothing but gross exploitation (an honorable thing in itself), and trying to reconcile it with mainstream standards is a mistake. And to be fair, it's more entertaining than - say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not much. So I will not try to criticize, let me just take a few observations. <br /> <br /> 1) If Gore is the point of the movie, should not you be able to see it? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you have set three sound engineers, make sure that at least one can operate the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror movie, your main maniac needs to be more fearful than a smurf doll. I know hard ... <br /> <br /> 4) There are many talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most of which are really cheap to rent. Get someone who knows how to frame a scene. <br /> <br /> 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs does not mean that he should do this every two seconds. <Br /> <br /> 6) A kudos for the girls to take off their tops, but next time the girls should get the tops we want to take off. <br /> <br /> 7) Editing should help tell the story or set a mood. At least in this kind of film cut, the Gore gags should sell. A chainsaw that suddenly appears in the belly of a character is not scary but sloppy. <br /> <br /> Some good things. Not the acting was bad. Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid as soon as she started defending herself. There were a few nice pictures that were thrown unfortunately without reason and rhymes on the screen. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. I also like the moxie from Frightworld. The next time you have a movie, I hope you all want something better than Colman Francis. Update at least Ed Wood.
