Here's another Diane Lane movie cheating on her husband. Is that the only role she knows how to play? This time it's 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man. I'm not surprised because that's so predictable. Then her husband gets angry and throws the milk. I would not be surprised if she slept with the milkman too. I would not be surprised if she slept with the ice man too, because this is a very boring movie. Then, after some milk throwing, she apologizes and sees the blouse man again. Moron. While she does it with him, her son is stung by wasps. My mother always told me not to throw stones at a wasp nest. This child mom had no time to tell him that she was too busy with the blouse man.
