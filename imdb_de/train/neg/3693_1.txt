Film Visitors - avoid watching this movie. If you are weak, you may want to commit suicide. If you are a little temperamental, you want to kill the lead actor of the movie. <br /> <br /> Although he has no talent in acting, he is the mass hero for all rickshaw pullers, the auto rickshaw drivers, hooligans, thugs and immature and ignorant literati. <br /> <br /> He proves you do not need talent or knowledge to succeed. <br /> <br /> He is the highest paid actor in India. This shows the taste of a movie that goes public in India. 90% of cinema admissions in Tamil Nadu are definitely attracted to its kind of nonsense films.
