The title should have been "The Wanderer". That was just he left. <br /> <br /> There was nothing about the movie that was good. The description of the movie does not really match the plot. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can get out of the movie is that he was a good son but a terrible person with a low life. <BR /> <br /> I'm sorry I spent my money and time on this movie. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie. I was hoping it would get better ... what a mistake. I got worse. <br /> <br /> If there's a suggestion I can make to the producer, it's to take his life into another field, because filming is definitely not for him
