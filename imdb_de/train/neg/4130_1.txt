A top contender for the worst movie ever made. Joanna Pakula's character seems to be an I.Q. of 3, that's just one less than the author and director. The script would not have passed in a high school writing class; the "jokes" are youthful; the concept stupid. These performers were obviously desperate for work. I stayed until the end, just to see if things would get any worse. It was Life is too short to spend any of this with this movie.
