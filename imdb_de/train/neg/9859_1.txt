This movie is just lame. A total waste of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are such a clich√©, and the way she talks about RPG players is not funny either. The problem is that the authors do not seem to know how an RPG game works, and especially how to joke about this game. Of course, there are a number of losers who play role-playing games like crazy retarders and total losers. But for me that's not the funniest way to joke about this game. History makes no sense at all. Who cares how long a game is played? The biggest problem in this movie is that the authors and actors did not even try to know what RPG jokes about. I was ashamed when I saw this lame movie.
