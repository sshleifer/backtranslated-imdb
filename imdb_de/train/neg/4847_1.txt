As usual, I'm mad to see the films I have not seen in anticipation of the Oscars. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed in my alley. I can not understand for the life of me why this movie got the rapture. There is no story !! A group of guys meanders around Iraq. One day they will scatter a bomb here. Tomorrow they will be out in the country and start sniping. No waiting here, they are back in Baghdad. There is no coherent story at all. The three main characters are so overcharacterized that they are just caricatures. By that I mean, we have the cute kid who's scared to die. We have the die-hard military who is practical and just wants to come back safely. And then we have the daredevil cowboy, who does not stick to the rules, but has a penchant for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldier DVDs. What do you think will happen ??? Do you believe that the cowboy soldier who does not obey the rules will hurt the sweet child with his renegade ways? Why yes! Do you think the Iraqi kid, who has a weakness for a cowboy soldier, will be killed and drive him crazy? Why yes! There is no story here. The script is youthful and predictable! The camera gets shaken up so much that it looks "artistic". And for those who consider such a great war picture, rent "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Do not waste time or money on this boring movie!
