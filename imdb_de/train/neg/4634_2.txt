Obviously talent has a certain talent, Maria Bello is always great. However, this is just a bleak waste of time representing every character as someone who is loathed and exploited for someone to make a movie out of an "interesting" story. Well, I hope they got it out of their systems. Unfortunately, there is no insight, no sensitivity, no context and really no humanity for the audience. That would be all right, unless there is no humor, no horror, no context and nothing constructive about the story it tries to tell. bad things happen, you sit and see it, you do not care, so what? In 99% of the cases, the words "based on a true story" are an inadvertent warning to the audience. The director and scriptwriter are lazy and intrigued by some of the events they've heard of somewhere, so just throw them on the Screen and expect the audience to feel something through the "true" nature of the story, without the filmmakers having to do anything about the work. I hope they had a great time making this movie. It stinks on ice.
