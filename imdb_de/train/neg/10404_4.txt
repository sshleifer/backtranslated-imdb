This Tremors Series Direct Video Death Rattle features sixty inspired seconds (saw blade: you'll recognize it when you see it) and more boredom and filler than you can shake off with a stick. Tremors 4 was apparently shot with a very small budget. That is, they only had enough special effects for three or four minutes of valuable worm-on-human violence. The lackluster, stereotypical cast and trite lyrics make the tremendous hour and a half of Tremor 4 feel at least fifteen thousand years old. Only hardcore Tremors fans can prevail, let alone enjoy this movie. If you are not among them, do not bother.
