I am quite generous here. I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN, even though it's not really the BOOGEYMAN we advertised on the DVD cover, and we all know it! It snuck up on me. But this movie is something else. Being led by a guy who has been in the movies for a long time and made a lot of films, it looks like he's been shot on a 10 year old VHS camcorder! The story and the show are cruel! David Hess, you also abandoned me. After playing one of the most threatening villains in film history, did you resort to it? However, the story and acting could be forgiven if someone took the time to make the video look a bit more professional. There are a lot of recordings on video films that do not look or at least are not so obvious that this distracts your attention from the movie. I can not say that it's the worst movie ever, because I could not go through the whole movie, but it's certainly close.
