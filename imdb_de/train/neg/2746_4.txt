I was afraid to take my nephews into this movie because I did not think it would be done well. The kids, ages 6 and 10, wanted to see it, so I gave in. I must admit that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought, but was still a long way from the book. The film seemed to work well with the understanding and sense of humor of the 10-year-olds. I found out that the 6-year-old understood what was going on, and he presented solutions to the upcoming problems. I sometimes had to explain that sometimes the movies do not show the best solutions to the problems, because it's more fun to see what happens when they make the "stupid" or "stupid" decision.
