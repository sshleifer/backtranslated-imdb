If one compares this misery with an old porn movie on a low budget, that would be an insult to the old porn movie on a low budget. The animal scenes have neither meaning nor represent this man and his crimes in the broadest sense of the abstractions. The summary on the back of the DVD cover says in part: "gripping retelling of the terror rule of the BTK killer". This is NOT a retelling. A retelling would mean that you learn the truth about what happened and why or why. None of this is true. I'm an avid student of serial killers and have seen some pretty fucking movies about it and frankly, that's NOT one of them. This is not even about the BTK killer. Save yourself time and money, and hire dojmer instead. THIS serial killer movie is accurate and true. However, if you MUST see this movie for yourself, watch it for free at your local library. Even then you will feel cheated.
