The first part of the film was quite pleasing, but in the end it became banal. Although Turturro is an actor I generally like, his Luzhin often resembled a bad Rain Man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying. All in all, it seems like this movie is working hard and looks pompous despite the mostly good performances.
