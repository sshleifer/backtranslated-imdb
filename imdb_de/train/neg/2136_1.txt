Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen. When did Hollywood ever shoot a successful movie that attacked the Republicans? Why do not you learn? The Dixie chicks do not. These left-handers live in their own elite bubble and interact with each other. The fact that most Americans are far more right than they are is unaware. The best Hollywood productions are not biased and rarely political Cheney was bad. <br /> <br /> I thought Cussack could have made better movies. <br /> <br /> It was not funny.
