A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. There is no escape. I love the show and think that Freddy is probably the best character ever made in horror movies. But even if I'm a fan, I can not help but see that this movie is mediocre. <br /> <br /> There is not even the effort to develop an interesting story and strong characters. By now they had just given up. They do not even try. They are of course the production and hope for a few lighter dollars. <br /> <br /> The story does not attract your attention. It's so easy it's almost missing. <br /> <br /> Alice, a survivor from Part 4, is now pregnant. Freddy comes back through the dreams of the baby. In the beginning we learn that Alice has to find his mother to stop him. And that's it. <br /> <br /> The story is moving slowly as there is so little action that it gets pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogue and terrible acting. In fact, this is the only scary thing, the actors, since the deaths are not even a bit cool. <br /> <br /> The characters are so uninteresting that we could not take care of them. <br /> <br /> The girls are as unattractive as possible. The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I have seen better actors in school games. It is really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some lessons. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. But the material simply did not make her shine. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkin's work is nowhere near Renny Harlin in Dream Master. He tries a few imaginative shots in the end, but the tension Harlin and Craven have created so well in the previous films is not a place to find them. <br /> <br /> The dream child is just another unimaginative sequel. It's a kind of movie that gives the horror series a bad name. <br /> <br /> The end for the once sinister Freddy. It's too sad to see him now. A clown who is not funny. A bad joke. Goodbye, Freddy.
