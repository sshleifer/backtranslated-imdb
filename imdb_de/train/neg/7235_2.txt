Not even Bob Hope, accompanied by a string of fine character actors, can save this ill-written attempt at a war comedy, since its patented timing has little to offer. The plot includes a Hollywood movie star named Don Bolton (Hope) and his attempt to escape military service at the start of World War II, followed by his mistaken convocation in a confused attempt to court a Colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, played by Eddie Bracken, log in with him, and the three are involved in various antics related to training exercises filmed in the hills of Malibu, California. Paramount was well-budgeted for this effort, employing some of its top specialists, but the direction of the normally reliable David Butler was limp, and this is due to a lack of comedic element in the scenario. A shift towards the end of the film to give Bolton the chance of heroism is still born, with poor stunt work and camera action. Strangely enough, Lynne Overman is given the best lines and this seasoned master of ridicule is doing very well by them. Dorothy Lamour looks and looks nice and it is always a pleasure to see and hear Clarence Kolb as her father, whose voice is unique on the screen or on the radio, but there is little they can do about it Save movie, damn how it is with a script assignment error.
