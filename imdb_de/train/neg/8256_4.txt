The only word I can think of to describe this film is Ordinary. <br /> <br /> The plot about Gary Sinake's character attempting to commit suicide is a ridiculous premise in a cabin where golf balls are driven into the sea for not living in the lucrative Pro / Am golf community could handle? Cry Me A River. I wish that were my problems. I like Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this film was clearly a bad choice or a paycheck for Sinise. The scene in which little Timmy Price is verbally abused by the other club member during the tournament in front of his father is so exaggerated that I am embarrassed to see it
