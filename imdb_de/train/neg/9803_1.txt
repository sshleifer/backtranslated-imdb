The Power Rangers are definitely the worst TV show and a completely ridiculous plastic toy line in United States history. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this terrible television show. <br /> <This is simply the worst show ever made, with terrible actors clad in multi-colored spandex outfits that look totally ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, since there is no redeeming value for this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Today's kids should try to watch better shows like the Toy Story movies instead of this garbage.
