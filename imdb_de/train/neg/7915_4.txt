All X-Men movies were great. And I mean everyone, including the long-hated X-Men 3. They had solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best in my opinion) and a good story arc. <br /> <br /> I was all excited when I heard that this movie was in production and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is The Fountain, though you will not hear anything about this movie when he talks about the actor), and his acting is not what messes up the movie. <br /> <br /> The entire movie is plagued with a lot of meaningless characters who do not add anything to the storyline (like blob or gambit) thrown in there to make the fans believe the filmmakers read the original comics. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of XMen, I have read many, many of their stories and none of them have been considered in this film. None. Not even the continuity. The Weapon X project does not respect the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth or Emma Frost. The motives for Wolverine are just stupid and seen in millions of films: Revenge for the death of a loved one. <br /> <br /> Oh. What I had expected was the whole damn movie a Berber moment for Wolverine, who resembles X2's at school when Stryker men come in and he alone decimates the enemy forces, but hey, this is Fox, a family movie and you will see no explicit violence from the most violent and cruel Marvel hero. <br /> <br /> Also, I had a feeling of constant Dejá Vù in this movie because Wolverines Origins are already explained in X2, we already know how he does it I have his Adamantium skeleton so it does not matter anyway Sense to make a movie of something we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally think that Wolverine is one of the few characters who does not need a solid background story because mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how the Joker got its scars?
