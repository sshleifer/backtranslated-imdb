This movie hobbles from self-indulgent moments to self-indulgent moments and promises to become something worth hanging out for. But it does not. It's flat, confident, uninspired and boring. <br /> <br /> A series of sets and backdrops do not make a movie but a calendar. This kind of pathetic socialist pseudo-drama documentary ("It's true that it really happened") not only fails to entertain, it does not convince, and does not work as a social history. Clich√©s mixed with bad acting make this movie very difficult to finish, the amusement factor diminishes pretty quickly. The characters are one-dimensional and never evolve as far as one feels for them. The director's ego is the biggest character in this film.
