I saw that at the premiere in Melbourne. <br /> <br /> It's flat, two-dimensional, invulnerable and boring in the face of the theme. The performers are passable, but they did not have much work to do with the very awkward and inconspicuous script. For those who may have been worried that Ned Kelly is too intellectualized, you can comfort yourself with the fact that this narrative of history is completely literary without depth. It does not work as a popcorn movie either. His pace is too devious and his craft too weak to be content even at the level of a worldly actionist. I very much doubt that Gregor Jordan can sit back and say, "That's the best I could have done with the material." <br/> <br /> Ned Kelly is a fascinating character, as is the national answer to him. Perhaps folk genius, possibly class fighters, possibly psychopaths and probably all these things, he has mastered the true mythology of Australia for over 120 years. Once again, his story on the big screen has failed miserably. <br /> <br /> That's life.
