Scary, but mostly in the sense that it will be over before the 70th birthday. I saw this as a late-night rerun in 1976 and thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but only). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is a bit scary because he looks like he was stuffed by a taxidermist. Yvette Mimeux looks like she smoked nice Downtown Burbank Brown. <br /> <br /> It's a sort of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's baby. This is a turkey that should never have been made. If you're suffering from insomnia and it's 1.30pm on Saturday morning and there are nothing but repetitions of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship, then that might work better. But God help you, if this is your only choice for entertainment.
