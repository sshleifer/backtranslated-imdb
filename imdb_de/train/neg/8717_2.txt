This is one of the most amusing bad movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this on Fridays with a bunch of friends on DVD and we just could not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough: Terrorists kidnap a convoy they believe has weapons-grade uranium, but in fact it carries a lot of man-eating dinosaurs. Easy mistake to make. Challenge a surprisingly incompetent team of army special forces to fight prehistoric beasts. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine. A man who seems to perfect "Smell the Fart," as advocated by Joey in Friends. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of gore and a lot of shooting, but unfortunately Rance's team seems to have a goal in the general direction of a horde of huge, lumbering monsters. Also, the lights always seem to flicker and go off whenever a Velociraptor attacks (so we can not see how bad the creature effects are). <br /> <br /> Having said all this, we all had a lot to offer. As a Jusassic Park / Aliens action adventure, this movie stinks worse than a dinosaur's move, but being a ridiculous, ironic conversation is a complete success.
