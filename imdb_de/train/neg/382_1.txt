Hail Bollywood and men directors! <br /> <br /> Really, that's the ultimate limit for victims made by Indian Woman. <br /> <br /> Consider the current state of affairs in India, where wives become more and more malicious day by day and are very possessive about their husbands - the directors ... can also be called Uncle Scars (see movie The King of Lion). They have developed a completely new concept of how both prisoners and women can happily live together after sharing everything ... including the spermikins !! <br /> <br /> Story: Married couple - very happy - but accidentally happens a mishap and wife has a miscarriage - the fetus, together with the capacity of ever lost mother! <br /> <br /> Now in India, the in-laws are selling the daughter-in-law if she does not give them an heir! So the woman makes an important plan - surrogate mother ... but the scientists intervened - "Certainly artificial insemination" - NO said the artist (actually director) - "Neighborhood will find out that the daughter-in-law is infertile Looking for a surrogate mother! /> Neighbors Neighborhood! Society !! I have the same ones who watch fashion TV day and night - girls between 14 and 40 years ... in bras and panties - well, these neighbors suddenly take over the upper hand in family planning and decision-making! <br /> <br /> So the woman sends her husband into a beer-bar where girls dance on stage - mostly uneducated and illiterate - but men love such women because they can satisfy their ego. < br /> <br /> He hires the main dancer in the pub - asks her to give birth to his baby - for money - she agrees - she comes home - gets pregnant - wife and is kept - both live in the same house - in the meantime, the prostitute also gets a taste of household l ife - so much caring people - she misses them all and cries silently !! In the meantime, no one in the family knows that the real daughter-in-law is walking around under her petticoat with a pillow !! - The mother or other elderly people never took her to the examination - or even tried to feel the movements of the baby in the womb !!
