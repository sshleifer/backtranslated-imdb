### spoiler! ### <br /> <br /> What does this movie offer? Out-of-control cuts and cinematographs that match a terrible plot. It is sad to see how Denzel Washington's talents are wasted in such wastes. We are certainly implied that the Mexicans can not save themselves, outside the forces that may be military, American. And we know that the father is a shady character, after all, he is a Mexican, in contrast to the woman who appreciates Creasey more because he is American. He killed everyone because he thought she had died. Of course she will not, she is a young kid and you should not hurt the feelings of the Hollywood fan. The trade-off scene was the only thing that kept me from rating them "implausibly successful" (as some critics have pointed out) "Taken". The nausea of ​​such films will take some time. When rating such films, we have to doubt IMDb's credibility.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Imagine that! Mine will be in the range of 3.5 to 4.0
