Same old same old about Che. It completely ignored the really interesting facts of Ches true character. Sodeberg repeated the same boring tale of Che. The stupid seductive story of an Argentine rich boy so shaken by poverty became a Robin Hood who fought alongside the poor until he was finally assassinated by the CIA. Yes, yes, I've heard it all, boring and unbearable! The reality of Che Guevara is very different and much more explosive! The facts show that he was a totalitarian man with a messiah stroke who wanted to force open the Maoist tyranny of the world. He was so fanatical that in the hottest moment of the Cold War he even asked the Soviet Union to destroy New York, Washington or Los Angeles and bring about the end of the world. She called on Khrushchev to launch a nuclear attack against US cities. For the rest of his life, he explained that he would have pressed his finger if he had pushed the button. When Khrushchev backed away and literally saved the world, Che was furious with the "betrayal." If Che's recommendations had been followed, you would not read this report now. How a murderous maniac turned into a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film. Incredible that no filmmaker dared to show the real side of Che and his posthumous media transformation. That would make an Oscar winning movie! I thought doing independent film meant to take REAL RISKS and to be GROUNDBRAKING! They only stick to "safe counterculture issues", ie "Che cool", "Wall Street bad", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA is worse than KGB", "Christians are fanatics and stupid", etc ... ad nauseum. Oh, how daring, how mind-blowing. Tres anti-mainstream and nervous. I wish they had real kojones and would tackle the independent film oligarchy! That would be really daring!
