This is a science fiction movie of Formula B, and the director did not mind. It's about a dragon, brought to life by a scientific team. All you have done is what you have often seen. It's a weak script with no real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotyped characters and situations. The director attacks this by turning him into a formula film without trying to deceive us, and that makes the movie easy, but it's something you probably will not remember. It's best to see them cook, clean and train. Somehow a pointless fun. It has its place in the conversation, but it's certainly not something you put together with friends to watch, unless you're all drunk and do not care. The mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair. I do not think it's as crappy as most people, but I'm surprised that some people in the postings thought that was spectacular. I really miss that, as I see no attempt to make this film a memorable movie.
