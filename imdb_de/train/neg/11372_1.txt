I've been using IMDb for years and never wanted to get involved in film commentary. This documentation has so many problems that I hardly know what to say. I'm not a Muslim or an Islamic Studies expert, but I know enough to shed light on the obvious, one-sided view this documentary represents. <br /> <br /> The problems with this film begin with the fact that it is a documentary. Most of the documentaries I have seen are anchored around some valid points and then surround these points with questionable interpretations and misinformation. This is certainly the case with Islam: what the West needs to know. Yes, there are fundamentalists around the world, and some of them are Muslims, but building a documentary on all of Islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading. This is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more. <br /> <br /> For those who want to objectively investigate some of the issues raised in this documentation, here are some things that may be helpful. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about Islam in the documentary. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside of this region. In China, more Muslims live, believe it or not, than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation of the Koran used in the documentation is questionable. I looked at the documentary when I saw another translation, and the differences were striking. I was warned about the translation used in the documentation, and now I know why. Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that the surrah says that unbelievers will go to hell. The translation I read instead reads: "Those who reject the truth among the people of the book and among the polytheists will be in hellfire." The difference is that those who reject the truth are the ones who know God and the truth of God and decide to reject it anyway. <br /> <br /> The film mentioned that there is no morality in Islam, but that's not true. While it is true that much comes from the Qur'an and hadith, Islam also recognizes a concept called "primal" or "normative behavior." Of course, what is normative can be interpreted in many ways, but "urf" should be "good" behavior, which an average person would think is right or wrong, as a unified knowledge that all Muslims follow, that's just not true There are many Islamic law schools, and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law. <br /> <br /> The hadith tradition is similar, there are thousands of hadith, and every law school accepted Some reject and reject others: Using the hadith without a serious scholarship to determine which are accurate, real, and applicable, one indiscriminately select quotes from the story that fit what you want to say? This is what the documentary did. <br /> <br /> What I hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem, not Islam or any other religion Christianity has fundamentalists, the abortion clinics, doctors, us w. I know, that's not the same as suicide bombing. Just understand that the justice of fundamentalism is the problem. If you feel that you have the answer, everyone else must be wrong. However, if you feel that you have an answer, you can work with other people's views on politics, religion, God, or whatever.
