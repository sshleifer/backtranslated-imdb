Cabin Fever is the first feature film by Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Pearlstein co-authored the script from a story by Roth. This is a zombie movie featuring George Romero and his earlier "Living Dead Movies" and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot to mention Sam Ramie's "Evil Dead". There is nothing original here, and the story is not compelling. Acting is comparable to this genre, it's just that history is failing and better done. Having achieved the commercial, if not the artistic, success of this film, Roth decided that he was a director and with the vile, cruel, vicious, pointless (albeit much more ambitious) manhole hostel Cabin Fever is not a good movie, but im Compared to hostel it is a work of art. I hope someone (preferably a psychiatrist) convinces this guy that filmmaking is the wrong career choice is Cabin Fever, a weak 3/10 for not as bad as the hostel.
