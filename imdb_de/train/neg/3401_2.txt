I borrowed this movie after hearing it was not awarded an Oscar, but after watching it, it's easy to see why it did not. Despite the beautiful photography, the film is unbelievably slow, even though it has hardly any plot. The plot is about a boy trying to deal with the death of his parents, which may or may not be the case was an accident (the movie is never clear) and how his grandfather told him fairy tales. The fairy tales contain the only interest in the plot, but they are very short and seem to have no meaning. <br /> <br /> The first fairy tale specifically concerns a boy trying to give his dying girlfriend a magical flower to save her life, but the boy delays by first trying the flower to make sure that she is not poisonous If he is a few seconds late to rescue his girlfriend, the grandfather explains that the boy is too impatient. However, this does not make sense, since it came to overcooling and slowness, which led to his failure. A perfect metaphor for this movie. <br /> <br /> Skye's photography is beautiful, but Stardust, which was released this year, is another film about Skye's filmed and beautifully photographed tales - and it's infinitely better than this.
