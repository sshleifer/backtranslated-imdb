Thomas Clay has mixed with the wrong types. That's the problem with the young people these days, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main part of the film is slow and quite boring and slumbers to the end of the drug use, as if there is no better target like the director. We are introduced to the main character, who is an outsider. We do not see him fit at school and at home and feel awkward in himself like so many adolescents. Robert falls in love with bad guys and starts missing school and taking drugs, and before you know it, he's a psycho-rapist. <br /> <br /> The film is really about the fact that Clay does not really understand the connections between violent images and violent actions. Clay seems to believe that a generation of crazy teenagers is made evil by war pictures on our televisions. Nevertheless, he filmed the most disgusting piece of SIMULATED violence. Is this guy real? <br /> <br /> If Clay has not seen YouTube, is he perhaps naive and unaware of the brutal climax scene of his film? Anyone who wants to see is the most disgusting scene at the end of the film, and I'm sure that's what's left with the people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is meaningless when it commits such acts of violence to film Clay, damn not only young people actively involved in preventing wars, but also more extreme perpetrators , tasteless violence for no better reason than his personal celebrity status. <br /> <br /> Pity for everyone involved.
