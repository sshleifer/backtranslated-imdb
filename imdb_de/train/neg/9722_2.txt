I really did not like this movie ... mainly because of the main characters! They are both immature, selfish and selfish. They hurt ALL people around them and played their stupid game. The visual effects were good, but what good are they if there are no characters to connect to, or if a story is interesting? Shall I be happy when these two psycho-people love each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I thought, "This is probably the # 1 hit from France?" ........> <br /> Finally: Happy New Year! They both earn! <br /> <br />
