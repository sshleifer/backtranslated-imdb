Okay, I remember seeing the first one, and the boy sucked it. After I saw it, I just laughed it out and said, "Oh boy, just another low-budget B movie, I'll never see part 2 of this movie." Then, about 1 1/2 years later, came the second part. It sucked more. But I just laughed it out and said, "I'll never see part 3 of this part." About half a year later, Part 3 came out. I was stupid enough to rent it and boy, I just caught it after I saw it. God, I never really realized how much movies these days suck. Save only $ 7.50 and do not rent the whole series. Trust me, it's worth every penny.
