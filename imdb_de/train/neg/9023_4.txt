I've seen anime, but I'm not a diehard fan, and I do not read manga. I say that because many of the reviewers who make fun of this movie seem to have this background. I have seen "St. John's Wort", and although it is not a masterpiece, it has made me choose "Shinobi," especially since everyone seems to love it. <br /> <br /> Well, I saw it this afternoon and struggled hard to keep looking. Yes, it is very beautiful - the slow-motion water scenes, the autumn leaves on the trees, even the CGI eye flickers - majestically. I liked the hawks, the costumes, and even some of the fight scenes, but overall, it was boring. <br /> <br /> It seemed like someone took "Romeo and Juliet" - the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers - and threw some "X-Men" for a good measure. Two of the characters split Wolverine's powers - the man in a bear costume had his claws and the gray-haired man had the ability to heal himself. Then you have the girl who has a poison kiss - that's Poison Ivy (by Batman). Why do you give these women such stupid powers? Poison girl shows her leg and then kisses you to death. Man, that's a great force for you. And the other girl can turn this yellow dust into a beetle that rubs her hands. The other woman, one of the beloved stars, has the power of a hypnotic gaze. Wow. <br /> <br /> I made it to the end of the movie by fast-forwarding it and saw a bit more tragedy than I expected. Some people compare this to "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero". Do not make that mistake. They may have similar endings, but that's where the similarities end. "Shinobi" is made by an amateur - the other films are made by an experienced filmmaker. <br /> <br /> I would say avoid this movie unless you are 12 to 18 years old.
