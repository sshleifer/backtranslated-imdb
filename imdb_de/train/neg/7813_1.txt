In my eyes, this is almost the perfect example of a Hollywood ego beaten only by the new King Kong movie. Superman is the original superhero and deserves respect, though he wears tights. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen. From the beginning of the movie you just want to put a piece of kryptonite in your throat. He just looks stupid when wearing the costume. But enough of him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for Lois Lane, she should be a tough reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a student. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, he's actually Superman's son, he never thought ...) and the acting was awful. This movie has a good thing and is called Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant, but even he could not save this movie. What this film needed was the cast of "Lois and Clark" (except Kevin Spacey, of course) and another story. I saw this movie after seeing "The Hills With Eyes" and I found out that there were worse movies.
