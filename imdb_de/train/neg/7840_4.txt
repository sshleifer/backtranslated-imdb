This film is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a Catholic school, watching the RAWANDAN genocide roll up around him. The film then begins with a brief explanation of the past and the rivalry of Rawanda. Then it jumps to the story that is told from the eyes of a young, idealistic "NEW COMER", a young teacher who does not like life or the situation takes seriously. As he and the driver approach a roadblock, he plays with his drivers I.D. They do not know that this is a serious moment and if the driver does not identify himself as the right tribe of soldiers, they will be killed. And so he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfoldment around him. Suddenly it becomes clear that every Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that European soldiers and tourists can not and will not help. The media cameras can not stop machetes, and there are too many machetes that shoot militants. The title comes from the army captain and said he was going to shoot the dogs who eat the bodies around his compound, not the militiamen killing people around the grounds. Mainly because they have not shot at the soldiers yet. Eventually, he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuee team that he wants to give up his place for one of the intended victims, runs his tail between his legs rather than being exposed to an immanent death with the schoolchildren. He has promised not to leave behind. <br /> <br /> It's more about character studies and a moment when Jesus is looking for a character than a story about the genocide in "RAWANDA". This movie did not have to be played in RAWANDA, it could have been running anywhere in the world of the Genocidal Hell Hole at any one time.
