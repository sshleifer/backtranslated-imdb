Well, gosh, I'm disappointed. When I first heard of a remake of Robert Wake's 1963 film "The Haunting," I was worried that it would be ruined by a plethora of visual effects the size of a summer movie. But deep inside, I had faith. Surely, with such a talented cast intact ... De Bont and his company will not ruin a film whose original was a fantastic and frightening film that understood the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now !! ?? My fears have manifested ... a promising film went wrong. Yes, the production design of Eugenio Zannetti is stunning. the film is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never do anything wrong. But the script puts its good performers to the test. You are invited to provide the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer who escapes with some dignity ... and that's just so good. But the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our ideas, feel this terrible fear of the unknown. No, we show visual effects to show what we should be afraid of ... and you know what? As wonderful as they are ... the visual effects are somehow stupid. And the climax is a phantasmogical mess ... but things had gone terribly wrong long before. <br /> <br /> Everything in The Haunting is over the top and over the top. I'm afraid there's no real thrill in this old ghost monstrosity ... just moan. Instead, look at the original. <br /> <br />
