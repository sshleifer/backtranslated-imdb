A kind of family parody that mixes "An Officer and a Gentleman", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and no doubt other movies that I can not remember now) into a pretty boring movie with some bright dots. The gags are always where you would expect them, and Damon Wayans' lines are predictable. As I said, this film never surprises you ...
