People like me are going to rip this movie. It's just not realistic. The plot is sooooooo predictable. You can predict everything that happens in practice. Of course, they find the treasure and become dirty rich and deceive the bad guys. We have seen it a million times already. The authors of this film must think that most of the public movie is stupid. You have to be right, because the majority of people really liked this movie. I solve my puzzles in seconds. The secret treasure room under the subway of Manhattan? You would think, with all the work being done in the New York subway, that this space would have been discovered beforehand. and all that was built during the Civil War? PLEASE And the love story between Ben and Abigail? how sweet, and I found the romance in Clive Cussler novels weak. They just fall in love so in 2 seconds WHILE I wanted to do more to save my own ass than to get one. the hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper. 1/10 garbage
