An actor asks, "What is my motivation?" To understand his character. After watching this "Docudrama", this vague and arbitrary farce, a spectator wonders what everyone's motivation was. <br /> <br /> This unfit offspring of the daytime television (The Oprah Show) missed a mile a great opportunity to explore themed subjects. <br /> <br /> His characters were all shallow and shallow, their plot far less socially releasing than a "Simpsons" episode. He presented the investigation police free of charge as unprofessional and incompetent. It could not be offered why the court could treat the main character, a female child molester, so differently than it would a male offender. Why did this unrepentant woman start "cleaning" her second-grade student, starting an affair with him when he returned to her sixth grade? Why did the boy's mother testify for her? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, rationalization of generations and greed. The movie gave no indication. <br /> <br /> Why was not the viewer informed that the victim's mother sold interview rights to print and television newspapers and introduced her teenage son to The Today Show? The fact that Mary Kay's lawyer earned money prompted her own "Son of Sam" statute, so she could benefit from her crime by selling her story to the highest bidder. Why was not it declared that the father of LeTourneau? was a former right-wing Republican congressman, presidential candidate for the 1972 United States Independent Presidency, president of the John Birch Society? In 1983, John Schmitz's political career ended when he was found out by his own college student in the neighborhood that he had children. Only when this lover sexually mutilated her infant son? But the father of Letourneau had taken his many children from "too liberal" Catholic schools and fought to ensure that all schoolchildren do not receive sex education. <br /> <br /> One month after her conditional discharge, again with her now 14-year-old pregnant, Mary Kay's second daughter, Mary Kay, received 7 1/2 years in prison for numerous probation injuries. A prophetic editorial on the sad affair then appeared in the Seattle Times: "At the end of two wretched hours, LeTourneau was sent to jail, and this desperate blend of TV visibility was over until the casting began." <Certainly, 18 months later, the filming of this travesty was under way.
