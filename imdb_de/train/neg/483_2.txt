I did not think the French could make a bad movie, but obviously I was very wrong. As mentioned above, this movie essentially uses its title as a starting point; Her portrayal of her life and person has little or nothing to do with the true Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /> <br /> The script is awful - presumptuous, stilted and vapid - and the paraphrasing of the facts is unusually offensive, even in a genre that too often lives on distorting and not telling the story. In addition to a rather decent set design, the physical attractions of Valentina Cervi are the most important asset of this film, and it is obvious that the filmmakers knew this from the start. You do not waste time creating different "erotic" sequences that are more about trembling than plot or character development. Unfortunately, the thrill of seeing a pretty young girl in a fake sexual arousal can not and does not support this movie. The drama is unremarkable, and the score is too general despite one or two interesting chords. The cinematography is fine, and there are some pretty colors, but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences with distorted lenses that are more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than for a costume drama. In any case, the script leaves the camera too often on Artemisia's body and too rarely on her paintings. <br /> <br /> All in all an almost complete failure. It's neither intelligent nor tasteful enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and presumptuous to work as softcore pornography. So the French can fail!
