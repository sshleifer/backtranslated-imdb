First of all, I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it in my ninth grade and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing for me. The film cuts out some characters and misses many of the main points of the book. It jumps around a lot and does not explain anything in detail. If someone saw this movie without reading the book before, it would be confused. The most disappointing thing in this movie was the end for me. The end of the book was the most powerful, and in the movie they changed it! It was supposed to be the pigs and men who were in an alliance and a kind of "merger," but instead, the film made the impression that the animals were rebelling against the pigs. To summarize, I do not think this movie captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.
