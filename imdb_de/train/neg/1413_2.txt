I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I'm sure that would have been a good movie if something had happened. Nothing does It is short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, I scanned the remaining 20 minutes. Agonizing. <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an actor - who has not worked for some time - and researches a role he could play as a cashier in a supermarket. He visits the supermarket where she works. Nothing happens. She decides to drive him home and they go to an Arby's, a Target, a car wash. Nothing happens. They talk about their lives. Nothing happens. Always. <br /> <br /> I do not understand it. But I also do not get the Bill Murray movies "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers". If you like these movies, you might like it. Many people find films like these bizarre, charming or - for reasons I miss - intriguing about dialogue. A common mean in movies of this kind is to have a long silence / silence break after an actor gives a line that makes sense. We know it's meaningful, because there's nothing on the screen for two minutes. Sorry, I have to be a Philistine. I do not understand it For me these films are not funny, charming or thought-provoking. They are just boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. No drama. No voltage. Do not laugh No tension No action. Nothing to see. In short, not one of the things I go to the movies for. I can get bored for nothing. I see strange characters in real life. I go to Target, to fast food restaurants and car washes. These elements do not make a movie, even though stars do this stuff. I pay to be entertained. <br /> <br /> If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman and do not want to hear him walking around, then you have fun. If you want to drool over Paz Vega, you can watch and hear them. But nothing happens, I promise. A total Snoozefest.
