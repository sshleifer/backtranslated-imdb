I remember watching the movie with my parents in the summer of '78 and being pretty good at that time. Of course I was seven years at this time. Just before the Jackson movies came out, my wife and I rented this movie because she had never seen it before and I felt nostalgic. <br /> <Ralph Bakshi had no money left in the middle of the animation process for this film and had to drastically reduce production. Since this film was mainly shot with Rotoscoping, the animation technique for budget travelers, this says a bit. A big part of this movie is just animation in the broadest sense of the word. There are some scenes that are obviously just people standing in front of a screen, possibly with some animation effects. <br /> <br /> Due to budget constraints, the movie - already a compression of "The Community of the Rings" and a part of "The Two Towers" - has been reduced even further. What you get is a kind of filmstrip version of the books' Cliff Notes. <br /> <br /> It's not all bad, but the animation brings a warmth that I've missed in the Jackson movies. It's nice to imagine what it would look like with decent funding. <br /> <br /> This movie is also noteworthy because it has the sequel that never came. Several years later, a half-hearted, half-hour TV special was aired that was supposed to finish things up. I'll just say that it was a musical.
