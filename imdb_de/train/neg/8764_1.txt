This film was an absolute ordeal. First of all, it's a whopping 4+ hours! The Kargil War had several points that were captured and fought, but it was not necessary to show each of these battles. So maybe it's a documentary, not a commercial. Sure, it did not seem that way because there was not enough background information and there were some shortcomings. The battle sequences were performed so badly. I am very disappointed with the man who made well-done sequences in Border. Every battle was the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (This could be a spoiler.) The entire army marches uphill, five or so soldiers cuss each five thousand times (they use the same word each time), one of the main characters is shot, someone shouts for a stretcher, the actor says: "No, war no stretcher, that brings 6 men out of the battalion, "and then an actor dies. Exactly the same happens over and over again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and long. The cast of the film is too big for itself. Despite this long film, none of the characters was well developed. The actresses had the smallest roles. They are all dressed and shown as equal. Two of them cried synchronously. It was so funny. They moved their hands and heads at the same time and then bit together their dupatta. <br /> <br /> The list goes on and on. I know that I still forget something. I think I hit the movie so far that you get the picture.
