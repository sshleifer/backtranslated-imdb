When exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat, causing some worrying side effects ... Occasionally eerie atmosphere and some decent (though underused) make-up effects do not save this one horror movie because he is a subordinate story of the human creature. The Bat People aka It Lives By Night suffers from his pointless story, which is clumsily plotted and tired at tempo. The plot never seems to go much and the film never provides an explanation for what happens or even a satisfying conclusion for everything. The cast is pretty mediocre in their performances. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I give the film some points for its haunting theme song and beautiful locations. The make-up work of the late Stan Winston is also pretty good, but there is not a big showcase here. A missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the smaller creatures freaks out there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from ****
