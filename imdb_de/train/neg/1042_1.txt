First write the script on a napkin. Who needs more than that? After all, we are not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Then get yourself a lay actor. It will be good for the festival hype. Who needs people who have refined their craft for years? Then hire a cameraman who does not know how to turn on the light. You see, when it's well lit, it does not look "real" and the festival people will not like it. Who has to take professional pictures? Then hire a ten-year-old man who has never had a camera as an operator. It gives your film a totally amateurish feel that festival screeners call "reality," and guarantees that even though you'll empty the seats of real people, critics and a small portion of the audience that is being over-intellectualized will shout "genius." You will not believe that this was just an amateur lesson. <br /> <br /> Once you've done that, buy your ticket to the Festival of Bad Movies (also known as Sundance). <br /> <br /> What a sad waste
