*** SPOILERS *** Like some evil Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance double play combinations, in "Omen IV" we brought back the evil seed of the late AntiChrist Damien Thorn. Terrorizing his parents, his classmates, his neighbors, and eventually the whole world, she called them Delia York, Asia Vieila. After being handed over to York's Karen & Gene, Fay Grant & Michael Woods, a "deserving" couple in the St. Francis orphanage of the Catholic Church. Little Delia wasted no time in feeling her peasants scratching her mother at a house party. Later, Delia was almost killed by a runaway truck, only to be saved by this "Devil Dog" named Ryder. Going to school Delia takes care of the local tyrant by getting the big one to get wet in front of all his classmates. Later, when his father threatens the Yorks with a lawsuit, her head is knocked off in a self-induced traffic accident! Delia is someone you'll never make friends with, if you know what's good for you. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dalias father Gene becomes by himself a big man in the city, he thinks by being elected as a congressman A master of clean air and green trees is pushing instead of the smog and the concrete boy to aim his eye at the White House. Did his brave and strange daughter Delia have anything to do with Gene York's sudden happiness? <br /> <br /> Only later, when Jo, Ann Hearen, is hired as Delia's Nanny, does the truth come out about her strange and evil forces. Jo, a New Age guy, realizes that Delia is a bit weird after she has colored all her white crystals black, and calls her New Age guru Noah, Jim Byrnes, to visit her. Noah is so upset about what he sees in Delia Kirili's color vibes, all black and blue with a little pinch of red, that it throws him so abruptly that he almost crashed into Delia's mom's car. <br /> <br /> Taken On a journey to a psychic festival by Jo Delia, the entire event transforms into an inferno that sets the place on fire through mental telepathy and gets everyone enthralled, including poor Noah, who is on fire was the festival and had broken his leg. The and the shaken and battered guru was so shaken by the experience that he later sent out of the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan wilderness. <br /> <br /> Later, with the help of sweet and cuddly pet Ryder, Jo is thrown out of a second-floor window to her death because she knew and spoke too much. When Karen is pregnant again, she decides to finally find out the truth about the true parents of Delia. That's when she and we in the audience are confronted with the truth. She is not only the dreaded AntiChrist of Revelations, she is his twin sister! Her brother, the Anti-Christ himself, is about to enter the scene as her little brother, born, unborn Alexander York. <br /> <br /> Three times were more than enough for the AntiChrist to return to Earth to reach Armageddon. The movie that went public became a bit tired of him and his evil adventures. With a fourth really not necessary, since Daimen Thorn, the original AntiChrist, was dead and buried for years. The usual bell went through without anyone believing that little Delia "Thee" is AntiChrist until it was almost too late to stop them in their deadly rounds of destruction of all humanity. The movie is as bad as it is, too long, 97 minutes, for a horror movie that could have told the story, it's only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> With a Private Eye Earl Knight, Mchael The Learner and later a former Catholic nun sister Yvonne, Megan Lehch and now the faith healer Felichy, who was only killed in the film, also did not help the conspiracy. It only prolonged the suffering of those watching the movie. They could almost see the surprise ending as soon as the movie "Omen IV" began releasing bases for Delia's eventual takeover of the civilized and uncivilized world. One surprise was that Delia did it with the help of friends.
