This filth is hard to follow. The sound is crap, the picture quality goes bad again from bad to bad too good! Things happen for no apparent reason that signs appear and disappear. Did the director suffer a serious brain injury during his production? <br /> <br /> Poor movie production aside, history is mean, just bad, shit If you like rape, murder and self-harm, this is just the place. And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough, you can see clips of people being executed. I looked at almost everything, but had to turn off after seeing someone blow out. I've never seen a movie that made me feel so ashamed and dirty.
