Even in a bad movie, there is usually something redemptive, something you can say, yes, it was awful, but there was this performance, that part of the script, or that special effect, it was just awful. The acting was ridiculous, the script terrible, complete with many inexplicable breakfasts on Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were at best low. This was a very bad movie, and even Drew Barrymore's wishes were deleted from the story. Look at it, if you want: a) suffer from severe pain. b) See how bad a movie can be. This is a movie in which I can use the stereotype: "There are ninety minutes of my life, I will never come back," with some reason!
