As a horror movie fan, I try to see all the major novelties of this genre, especially those that come from my home cinema. And I can say that "Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as the Russian title of it) is one of the weakest films among them. First, it can not even scare a little kid, it's so slow and so predictable that there's no room for true horror. To be honest, it's bad in every way: from the stupid conspiracy (I do not know why the Russian producer / director decided to turn the classic story of Ukrainian witchcraft into a lame and ridiculous modern America thriller.) Me Absolutely agree with the previous reviewer (it's not a bit thrilled) and the awful and cheesy actors. All actors well known in Russia, including the leading Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova, look like wooden puppets or something similar, and it seems to me that they have not played at all, they just speak their English lines without any expression. And in the end, I do not really understand why they filmed this movie with Russian actors in English? I think it was her wrong turn. At the very least, they could cast American or English actors in the lead roles to make them more convincing. I can say the same about so-called "American small towns" that were filmed in Estonia and look like that. The only positive moment I have found in the "power of fear" is the visual effects. They are not outstanding, but rather good for the Russian movie. And the music is OK, at least it does not irritate me. That's why I give him two stars. All in all, if you want to watch a good horror movie? Do not waste time or money on this boring movie. And if you are looking for something that is said to be a Russian horror, I would advise you to find a copy of "Viy or The Spirit of Evil". It's really the terrific movie based on the same novel as Power of Fear, but much, much better.
