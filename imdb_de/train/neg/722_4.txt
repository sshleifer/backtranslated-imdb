One scene shows the mentality of "Terminator Woman" quite well: Karen Sheperd and another woman try to flee the rogue's camp. Karen encounters an armed guard who points his weapon at her, but throws it away after a few seconds and challenges her to fight. Karen kicks him in the balls, takes the gun and runs away! If a movie is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another family member, you know you should not expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble make fun of each other early on, and the movie might have gotten better if it had focused more on their love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes, they separate, and the movie slows to creep, and even with occasional battle scenes that enliven things, there is a lack of excitement. In the final, Trimble fights Qissi in a cave and Sheperd goes by speedboat Frauo-a-Womano against beautiful Ashley Hayden. The battles, however, are so coordinated that they interrupt their flow and reduce their value. On a positive note, the praise to the costume department allows Karen to show a spectacular cut throughout the movie! (* 1/2)
