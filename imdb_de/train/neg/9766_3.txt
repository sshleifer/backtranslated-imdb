Roger Corman is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was solely responsible for some of my favorite horror films (such as the Edgar Allen Poe adaptations "Masque of the Red Death" and "Pit and the Pendulum") and for some unaffordable cheap and sticky garbage Quickies (such as "Creature") from the Spukmeer "and" She gods of shark reef "). Corman has made a few films that are simply not classifiable and ?? ?? simply said almost impossible to judge correctly." the trip "as well as the imaginative can called "gas-sss" be described as psychedelic exploitation. in other words, they are incredibly curious, influenced by the hippie culture films. half the time when you have no idea what's going on, who these characters are that pass through the screen and where the hell is running this whole thing the plot is simple, yet highly effective. A strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally released and destroyed immediately that the ge world population over 25 years old. This could decided the basic requirement for an atmospheric, robust and gnawing tension be post-apocalyptic sci-fi landmark, but the writer George Armitage and Roger Corman, to make it a "trippy" road movie comedy. None of the characters even tries to prevent their inevitable deaths. They just party on the street and find little syndromes that deal with adolescent crimes. "Gas-s-s-s" is disappointingly boring and tries too hard to be bizarre. The entire script seems to be improvised on the ground and is not funny at all. Definitely not my thing, but the film has a loyal fan base and many admirers, so who can I say it's not worth your time or money?
