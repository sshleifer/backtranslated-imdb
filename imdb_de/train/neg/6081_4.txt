A typical Italian film from the 70s, original and good music, but with some peculiarities, interesting but not fantastic photographs, bad and sometimes confused acts (eg the role of Wolfhound and where does the boy come from?) With bad dialogue , nice atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The reason why it is still (relatively) well known and sought after is probably the nude scenes (including the typical 70s pseudo-coitus) involving an 11- and 13-year-old girl With an older teenager (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel), from a sociopolitical point of view, it is interesting to see how these portrayals of very young teens 30 years ago across Europe (and the US) were considered acceptable and normal, while now more than one Is taboo. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the bullying of a girl (Laura) by the other two characters and their discovery of sex, a fairly accurate representation of a teenage life aspect. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not develop until the end of the film and appears already well versed in the erotic arts - for them there is no "growing up": she is a very futile young girl who is already aware of her sexual But in the end, charms are only used and end the movie like the little girl she really is. The boy is a totally despicable tyrant, while Laura acts as a very naive and weak victim.
