When the number of video nasties I have not seen disappear, this little pile of garbage appeared on my "hire" list when I saw it was available. <br /> <br /> The premise involves a model or something has been kidnapped and taken to the jungle to be ransomed by a colorful crew of idiots. Another git is hired to bring her back, and he gets a sack of money that can be used as a bargain chip. But when he comes back with the girl and all the money, he gets a big break. He brought a helicopter and a pilot, and wow, this pilot is one of the worst actors ever! Granted, they're all terrible and the synchronization will make you cry. After stealing into the jungle, we learn that there is a cannibal cult nearby whose meat-making, earth-bound God roams the woods like a human King Kong searching for tribal women whom he can devastate and devour. Well, this guy is just a naked guy with the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for the eyes. His growling and groaning is a ubiquitous part of the soundtrack, and I realized that I muted most of those scenes. Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason why this movie was banned, even though there is a certain scene, for about a second, when God attacks a girl and gives herself courage, but that is not a trigger factor for fans. Even Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows long close-ups of female genitals and unfortunately also male. So if you want to be "fair" in terms of exploitation, you have understood it. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this garbage to everyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just cruelly cushioned garbage that only a fan of Video Nasty can probably see. As you move through the list, leave it at the last moment. If you look at it first, you may get the idea that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not the case.
