Now here's a movie that if made in Australia, would easily be a comedy. It is sad and annoying here, limp and cheesy and baked from Lala land. How did the erector do it wrong? Well, especially because you are serious about a job that is so funny that nobody can take your mind seriously. Unless, of course, it is a nerdiges, lonely gay cliché (but somehow sweet) ... or is this cliché stacked on a cliché. No value in history that seems almost like a prequel to Gus Van Sant GERRY ... and with a title like THE FLUFFER, how's it all that big? Well, this author must have been so crazy that he did not come to Burt and BOOGIE first, that he had to do something his own. Confused and undeveloped, except for the theme "Unrequited Love a a Langes", which is left over from a faded Streisand lyric, all we have left is an atmospheric Beefcake and TV series story. The unnecessary fourth act of this overlong drama is really terrible, as the film as the Gerries migrates into the desert and stuck there. In Oz in the late '90s, about 20 people shot a similar but funny movie called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY, he also suffered from a more terrible Auteur than Orson, so they filmed half again, got an unscrupulous TV editor who cuts them up and down to 72 minutes. A lesson there when bad movies get better through lightening. I think THE FLUFFER was stiff on the release and if it stops working I can understand why.
