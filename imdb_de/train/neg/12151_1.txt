This is probably the worst I've ever seen in a movie ... ever. and what's up with the casting? The lead actress in this film has a kind of nose constellation and is almost impossible to watch for a while without fixing on her nose. You could go to a grocery store near you on a Sunday afternoon and easily find fifty more qualified, better-looking leading ladies. I made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a "cool" DVD case. This movie looks like it's just a class project for a group of multimedia students at a local college. I would rather have spent the hour watching this movie on public television ... at least the special effects are better and the people there are more attractive than anyone you'll see in this movie
