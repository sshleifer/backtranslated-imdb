My friends usually enjoy many hopeless movies, but this one was too poor to even watch until the end. It was just so boring and unoriginal. Not even the "hot" girls who starred in this movie could watch me. Everything was just predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The spectacle was sometimes good ..... but several times bad. The most annoying character in the entire movie you're about to die for must be the main character's best friend. The more I saw him, the more I wanted to smash my screen. (You know what fat ugly kid I'm talking about) <br /> <br /> The conspiracy was done so many times before I think they should be sued by other movie companies. OK, it's a good idea, but that was all that this movie had. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie can only be viewed by you to save abuse from your friends. Or if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
