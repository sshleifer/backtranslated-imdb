When I ordered this on the blockbuster website, I had no idea that it would be as horrible as it was. Who knows? Maybe I forgot to take my ADD medication that day. I know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon and dressed in their wide collars, bell pants and feathered hair from the late 70s, I knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era earned fame for the band Dumpster was. <br /> <br /> The first prediction of how bad things should be was the narrative at the beginning, which tried to explain what cosmic forces force the universe devastating and polyester and porn music music to would-be viewers , From the opening scene with the ill-made effects to the "monsters" from another world and then the house that leaps from universe to universe was as painful as watching a primary school production of "The Vagina Monologues". <br /> <Throughout the film, the sure sign was that something would happen when a small ship appeared. The "ship" suspiciously consisted of old video recorders and camcorder parts and would attack anyone who was on his way. Of course, if she moved slower than Bob Barker's guts, but it had threatening pencil-thin taps and the ability to throw an ominous green glow that could stop bullets, and equipped it with a laser capable of just balsa wood in one or two hours to cut (with some help). <br /> <br /> Let's go ... As craziness and the bubble-bell continue ... We found out they are trapped in a "Space Time Warp". How do we get this little thread of scientific information? The oldest male lead role tells his son that in a more or less straightforward way, he remembers refreshing Coca-Cola over a cup of Joe or an ice-cold bottle of how to win the big game. Was Pops a scientist? No, but he knew about horses and seems to have interfered with string theory and Einstein's theories as an amateur. <br /> <br /> The recordings I saw on DVD were of near-qualified quality. The sound was muddy and the transfer looked as if it had been shot on a cell phone from a theater screen with the VCR, otherwise it was really, very, very bad. (There is not enough "really") to really describe it. <br /> <br /> I know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics. I never saw this movie in its original release, but I think I would have come to the same conclusion even then: bury the movie quickly.
