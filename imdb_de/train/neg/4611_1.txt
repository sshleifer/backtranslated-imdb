I think it's Jack's great empathic ability that makes him a powerful performer that he is, but empathy has a price like all other things - when surrounded by mediocrity, he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with him. He's a joke as a mafia hit man (also because the role does not suit him a bit, he's so extroverted), and grazing makes it easy not to fool himself. Kathleen Turner has had a much too long career because she is tall and blond because her acting skills are limited to what she does with her eyes. If she opens her wide, she thinks she is so damn sexy, and Anjelica Huston is the same in all areas, just like Robert Loggia. <br /> <br /> The film is a lame draft (and this is the only mention of the lobe they call a script) of a gangster movie with a cast who was probably only interested in the after-party faster (they did certainly the party elite gathered in this area). What, did they shoot in one day? Because that would be the only explanation.
