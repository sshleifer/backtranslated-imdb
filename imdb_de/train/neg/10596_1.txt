Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. THAT'S WHY WE GO. We now know that this movie is really going to be terrible. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this movie on TBS and knew it would be bad. But not even I thought it was that bad. The plot is terrible, Van Damme is (at last) getting old, but unlike Arnold, his films are too. Forget this movie. Do not you see Je. I would not even get paid to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - in his heart lies a wonderful, action-packed ride. <br/> But the marketers sure want us to think that way, right? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
