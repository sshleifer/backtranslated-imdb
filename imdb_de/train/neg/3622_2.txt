I caught this a couple of months ago on the Family Channel, and since I had some memories of the television program from my youth, I decided to see it with my 4-year-old daughter. I should have had some psychedelic mushrooms, because that's just bizarre! It's not just a musical with annoyingly forgotten tunes, the necessary cheesy effects and camsos of stars that have long since passed their collective primes, it seems to have been produced as a good excursion by someone. Flutes talk, British kids far too old for this kind of crap ... in the words of Krusty the Klown, "uuuuuggghhhh! What was me?" If you're a big fan of Sid and Marty Krofft's entire oeuvre, you should try it. Otherwise, if you are not ready to loop before watching, stay far, far and far away.
