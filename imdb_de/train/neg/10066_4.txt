I have recently reviewed this and there is another version that is shorter in 1999. I feel like they are the same movie, but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One is Japanese and no Pikachu short is all I can come up with. Why else vote twice for the same movie? <br /> <br /> Prof Ivy was pretty boring. She sounded almost asleep, no expression on the few lines she had. <br /> <br /> That was enjoyable enough, but there was not much. <br /> <br /> A collector (who, according to Lugia, has no plan to destroy the world) and the usual characters who want to stop him, because trying to conquer Lugia causes a lot of destruction. <br /> <br The following Pokemon movies are a little better, Deoxys (Poke 7) are great, with no. 8 almost here.
