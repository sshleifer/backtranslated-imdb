Some amusing humor, others that fall flat, some decent acting, others that are pretty cruel. This movie is just a hit and guaranteed to miss 12 year old boys more than any other niche. <br /> <br /> The children actors of the movie are just not funny. When you do a family comedy, it's usually a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises above the material to make a funny and dare I say human achievement in the midst of this mediocrity.
