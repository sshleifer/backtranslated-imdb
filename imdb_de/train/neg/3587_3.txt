How can they go from Joe Don Baker (as Bufford Pusser in the first sequel) to Bo Svenson (as Bufford Pusser in the second sequel). Why did you do that? Just because Bo Svenon looks more like Bufford Pusser, they should still That did not change, because the first sequel was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and I wanted to see that thing in the second installment. <br /> <br /> I would have given this movie a 7 out of 10 and I would have given it a 1 in 10 if the story had nothing to do with Bufford Pusser's life, but it did and that's why I had this movie rated 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest that anyone who intends to watch this cheese should not, and instead look at the first sequel.
