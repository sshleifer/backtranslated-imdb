This show may be the biggest, ugliest, most common steampunk I've seen in children's programming and has actually been successful. The main character Johnny, although I understand that he should represent a normal child, is neither sympathetic nor bearable. The jokes are lame, exaggerated (ie the "Whoa! Did not see the coming gag." Come on, that was not even funny the first time, it's not even cute) and lacks any form of primitive joke or inspiration , And last but not least ... it's just ugly to look at. Although children are not particularly critical of artistic talent, they prefer eye candy. I can not bear the show because the art style is in a way ... disgusting. Disgusting indeed. Just bad. <br /> <br /> I just can not stand that this gets so much air time. Although I understand that nostalgia can be a bit irrational and I should not hope to come back to that ... I really miss the old cartoons. Bring Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, anything but that crap. I think it's just wishful thinking. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I advise you not to waste your time on this show. I think that really good cartoons can be enjoyed by the big kids too. And that does not cut it off.
