The story is a bit slow and a bit stupid. Greta Garbo does not look very good and I could not understand half of the words because of her accent exaggerated for this role. In the meantime, Melvyn Douglas plays his normal, unlikely role, and Constance Bennett is just one exception, except for a few of her screams that are funny. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Roland Young had the best role in the movie. I wish he had more lines than he disappeared in the second half of the story. It was also interesting to see how Ruth Gordon looked so young. I had only seen her in the crazy roles she had played from the late '60s to the' 80s, and an old woman. As for the story, the last few minutes may have been best when we see a stuntman doing amazing things on skis and pretending that Douglas is falling down the slopes. That was an amazing and humorous material. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can see where this movie - the last of Garbo - was not a box office success. It just draws too much, about deceptions. It's an annoying story. Garbo knew it too and shouted that it stops.
