I read the book and the book was fascinating. <br /> <br /> This movie, director, script and acting was absolutely unbearable. I cringed when there was a script that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the actions, simplicity, and courage to illustrate a monstrosity in a potentially fact-based story. I can see Why was not this movie released to the public in most cities? Would never recommend this movie to someone I know. <br /> <br /> Simply one of the worst adjustments I've ever seen has turned into a conspiracy of heaven on earth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was indeed the only highlight. But how could that fail when shooting in a beautiful country like Peru? <br /> <br /> Do not waste time and energy on potential viewers with this flop.
