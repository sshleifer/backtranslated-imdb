Years ago, a friendly movie and I went to a horror movie that we thought was good because he played John Cassavetes. For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, scriptwriter, and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands), three times nominated for Oscars, who wrote and directed a series of good low-budget films. Until we saw The Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavete's income came from any movie he was offered. Had we known what the film was about before we saw it, we might have avoided it altogether. But we did not go out. At the time, my friend and I jokingly said it was the worst movie ever made. Well, honestly, that's not true. I saw a lot of bad movies on Cinemax on Friday night (did I just say that aloud?), Which are far worse than The Incubus. Almost every movie with Brian Bosworth is by definition a worse movie than The Incubus. Surely Santa Claus conquers the Martians is a worse movie than the Incubus. However, I've consistently used The Incubus as a threshold I do not want to fall under. When I talk to this friend about a movie I may have seen, I will always find that he was better (or worse) than The Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
