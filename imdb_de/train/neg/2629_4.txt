Hollow Point is a good movie that's worth half the price, or if nothing else was wasted on a good time without you having to think about it. There are the necessary explosions and hammering spectacles and pretty ladies. A pretty good cast with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow and pretty Tia Carrere. This cast plus a light touch does not make the movie any good, but it's fun ... on a scale of one to ten ... 4
