If anyone really wants to understand Hitler, read the history of the First World War and not the history of the Second World War. Find out what happened in this war and how soldiers constantly had to live dead bodies. How many soldiers went mad what they saw during the First World War when they called it "shocked" is called post-traumatic stress disorder. When you get to know the real horrors of the First World War, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a person can be desensitized to death, not because of his evil, but simply because it was the only way to deal with the terror around him. <br /> <br /> So many others are missing this movie. Read a few books on the subject, and you should watch the movie "Paths of Glory," the only good WWI movie ever made. You will see the frustration of the soldiers in this film, the sense of helplessness, and a complete devaluation of human life as nothing but bullet trap. That's what this film lacks, it really is the key to understanding Germany. A lost war in which millions and millions of Germans were killed for no real reason. Then comes after the war a complete economic collapse. These are the factors that lead to extremism. <br /> <br /> The loss of family members and massive poverty always lead to extremism. Unfortunately, this film has ignored these factors and is now another piece of trash that can be dumped. Since there really is no real value, there are fictional films based on fictitious characters that could give you a better idea of ​​Hitler. They just threw Hitler's name on it, so it would sell more.
