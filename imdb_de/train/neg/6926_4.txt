I received this in the DVD 10-pack CURSE OF THE DEAD. You have to love these bargains. Even if they contain no real remastering, no restoration and no hoo-ha and the films are usually in full-frame pan and scan format, there is no denying that there are always a few gems. And by "gems" I mean, there's always good crap, especially if the movies are from the 70s, like The Mansion of Madness. <br /> <br /> My copy is called Mansion of Madness, but when the title screens roll, it's Poes Dr. Tarr's torture dungeon. Does not matter, because crap is crap, no? Yes! However, it is not true that this movie is completely worthless. There are a few funky elements here and there, and obviously the film had a decent budget. <br /> <br /> The title sequence of the opening is cool, with its color negative run through a cheap TV look. The dialogue is always funny. Shortly before the film begins, the horse and carriage driver gets off to move a dead stump in the middle of the road. "WHAT STRENGTH!" says our hero. Funny, that this guy would not be able to fend off the crazy forest people later on when they're weird fun. You will forget that this guy was even in the movie until he reappears at the end. So memorable are these characters. <br /> <br /> But the best thing about Mansion of Madness is the crazy music and the crazy hijinks that the good guys endure. It's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable. And why the strange slapstick? I'd say my favorite moment had to be when the horse and the buggy are attacked by the forest freaks when they pull up a stupid homemade ghost on a stick in the middle of the road and stop the buggy. What the hell? Oh yes, there are a lot of boobies for those of you digging things like that. Fools, bad dialogues and crazy music. The best buzz from Mansion of Madness for me. It is worth at least a visit and can be much better if you had a few to drink or something. I can not say I ever got bored of seeing it, but I can not deny that it's also a barrel full of shit. A bit like Magical Mystery Tour, but with an action, but not. Hmm. <br /> <br /> And Mr. Chicken PWNZ.
