Next time you're at a party and someone asks, "The other day I heard the expression 'will of the author.' Does anyone know what it means?" Tell them to sit by "Head Above Water". The only way Diaz could have survived this film was this literary device, which is often used by bad writers. There are some comic scenes and you will have some laughs. However, the film does not stand up to the slightest logical analysis. Why is Keitel Diaz holding his hand in front of him and not behind? Why can she, of course, do the chainsaw gag? The best thing about this movie for me was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four dollars in the video store.
