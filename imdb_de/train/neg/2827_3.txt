The story at the beginning is interesting: slavery in the (late) 20th century from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem is that two of Richard Fleisher's favorite enemies are deliberately attacked: Arabs and Germans. That we believe that very Arab-looking men roam free and easily catch blacks in West Africa is just as believable as whites chasing slaves in "roots." Obviously both trades are / are run by natives and include (d) much more sophisticated networks. While the Arab countries are involved in today's trafficking in children and sex slaves, Israel is one of the worst offenses, according to Amnesty International. So why only point to Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer? It is obvious that these people are biased and hated by a Jewish director. <br /> <br /> The acting is above average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is good as always.
