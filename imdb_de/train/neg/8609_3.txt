If you've seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous films and performances, you'll spot some of the jokes that were made in this weird bastard. This film is written like a sitcom and misses any sympathetic chord, from the self-help doctor who plays like the chopped liver Molly Shannon, to the "I'm fat and therefore funny" John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are sympathetic enough, and if this had been done as a pilot of an action-adventure series, it could have worked. Instead, it looks like a male fantasy trying to be politically incorrect.
