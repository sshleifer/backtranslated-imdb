The movie is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I do not think most people know what a "walker" really is or will be. I felt like I was watching a movie from the 70s. The theme was simply unbelievable for the year 2007 and was even discontinued in DC. I think that was true for everyone else who also saw it when the applause was low and fast in the end. Most did not stay for the Q & A. <br /> <br /> I do not think Schrader really thought the movie ahead of time. Many of the scenes seemed too short, as if they were never finished or he did not know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to the next, and you had to find out or guess what was going on. I did not really get Woody's (Carter's) private life or friend either. What was it about the "artistic" male bondage and torture pictures (from Iraq prisons)? What did he think? I think it was his very weak attempt to create that dark private subculture life for Woody's character (Car). It did not work. It did not even seem to make sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson. He has played his character (car) flawlessly. They really got a good feel for what a "wanderer" might have been like (say, twenty years ago). He was great and will most likely never be recognized for it. <br /> <br /> As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... boring. <br /> <br /> Do not see it! It is painful! Unless you are a true Harrelson fan.
