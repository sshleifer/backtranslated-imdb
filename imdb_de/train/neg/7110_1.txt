Well, you have to give the director credit for how brave he was. Gutsy would be the right term. Not only did he use a total of five people (no extras at ALL), he also opted for subordinate special effects with a confusing and boring plot early in the movie that you could die THE HAPPY !!! However, they promise a FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIINNNN. Having a spooky limping gardener is always a good step. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you're watching Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have seen it. They like to show awful movies just to let you know. <br /> <br /> A good present for someone you hate.
