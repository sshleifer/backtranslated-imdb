When I saw this movie, I thought, OK, it'll be fine any minute ... I was wrong. The really best part of this movie was when it was over. A complete drop of 92 minutes. Apart from the fact that the wendigo finally appeared in the end and you could not see it so well, was the best. And the tail was pretty stupid. There were too many sections in the movie where you thought something would happen, but it was a flop. The worse part is that more was talked about by Wendigo than by Wendigo. For the creature to be so bad, you definitely can not recognize it in this movie.
