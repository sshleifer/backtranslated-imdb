Ok, first of all, I'm a big zombie movie fan. I loved all of Romero's films and thoroughly enjoyed the remake of Dawn of the Dead. So when I heard that every single critic had fallen in love with this movie, I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and while it might not be a very good movie, I enjoyed it, if not just the fact that it was just a funny zombie shooter with a half decent storyline. This is pure crap. Terrible dialogues, half-hearted acts and video game scenes that have been inserted into the film. Who in the mind thought that was a good idea. The only thing about this film (I use the term easy) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a terrible movie and that he could make the most of it. Everyone else pretends to do Shakespeare. And very bad, I can add. Basically, the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a) have a huge zombie buff and need to see every zombie hit, or b.) How to play MST3K, the home game. Take a look at it with friends and be prepared for lots of unwanted laughs. <br /> <br />
