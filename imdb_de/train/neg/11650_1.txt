After the first litter, you think the Wayans brothers could make new jokes. I do not think so. If the first one was not bad enough, this one is so bad that it hurts to watch. With all the actors in this movie, you think they could come up with something more clever. Although they could not, they had to take the same slippery, not funny jokes out of the first and somehow get into this movie because they thought people would laugh about it again. Although the thing is, I did not laugh about it the first time. They tried to make these films into parodies, even though they failed at every level. Mostly they are just random jokes that are so disgusting and clumsy that it's hard to see and enjoy them. If they then try to make scenes that are film parodies, the 20-minute replica of the scene ends with maybe a joke in the entire scene. Also for people who say that it is not for older and real young viewers. Well, I fit in the age range for which it should be funny. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you find it funny, you are probably not one of the more mature or intelligent people. It does not take so much skill to write such a script. If you want a smarter and funnier movie, visit the movie Spaceballs. It's a movie parody that's really good and well done, and it did not have to use nasty and slippery jokes to make fun of it.
