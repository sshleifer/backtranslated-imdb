MY EYES! NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY, MEAN THIS FILM UNSEE! Which drugs do you use? This could be the worst movie ever! I felt like I was on a bad, sour journey all the time. I have to call a therapist to help me cope with the trauma of this epic catastrophe. From beginning to end Glow Ropes is an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema. When I thought about seeing this movie with my Jewish best friend and family, we thought, "Oh, that may be funny, it will probably be bad, but still a bit funny." Movie could be. All my friends lined up for lobotomies at the end of the movie, and as the movie progressed, one of my friends tried to hang up with his belt while another tried to cut his wrists with a wooden spoon. I wish I had seen the video of The Ring instead, so that the pain and suffering would be over in just seven short days. For all who want to see this movie, YOU ARE NOT PREPARED! You may think that you are some kind of "tough guy" when you hire that, but this movie will break you, knock you to the ground and urinate on you.
