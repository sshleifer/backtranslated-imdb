Oh, the joy! Oh the joy! Another movie that is so bad is good! Or I thought so. In fact, he misses the "so bad good" phase and goes, unfortunately, directly to the "could be so bad that it is good, but they screwed up and made it just bad". <br /> <br /> For a start, it's way too long. Cut for half an hour and it would be more bearable. Then put such ridiculous plans as "the man who sabotages the mission to save the earth, because he has all the food in store and he will be rich if the mission fails!". Moron !. Or the most recently seen in dark star plotter "talking bomb". You know what ... just like in Dark Star, the bomb has a malfunction ... hmmmm. Add a saying "We can not move out of a kindergarten game" and you have a solar crisis in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> Slight relief is in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants (as we called him in this movie) whose sole purpose is to drive a child through the desert and call the child's father, to pick him up ... Finally, between driving and phoning, Jack makes lots of pointless chatter and greed, but adds little to the story as it is - in short, he's the best part of the movie. <br / > <br /> My award for "The Iron Line Straighted Face" goes to Charlton Heston, who met his eldest son for the first time in a long time, commenting that his son seems a bit "out of shape" while he is there himself and his stomach bends over the waistband and urgently needs a Captain Kirk Corset. <br /> <br /> Even the bad guy is amusing top stooge who has a gleaming white hairstyle that keeps me from Andy for some reason Warhol thought. <br /> <br /> Apart Of these joys, this movie is only recommended. The end is a sequence copied from the final sequence of 2001 (but mercifully shorter than the end sequence of 2001). <br /> <br /> Tips to enjoy this movie better if you are stupid enough to look at it the way I did: <br /> <br /> 1. Whenever the bomb speaks, stand up before, her name is Tarquin (trust me, it works!). <br /> <br /> 2. Whenever Chuck Heston is on the screen and is about to speak, pronounce him a line from "Planet of the Monkey", eg. B. "Get your dirty paws from me!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. Whenever the main female character looks stressed (this is mostly the case), you keep hoping that she has an aneurism and will die soon. <br /> <br /> 4. During the endless "The ship breaks again" scenes, one always hopes that the technicians and engineers will have a Scotty ism like "You can not change the laws of physics!" or something crap. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, you do what you need to get you through this problem. Halfway, I dozed off and woke up to realize that I had missed nothing, nor had the plot (as ridiculous as it may have been) progressed. So do not worry if you want to turn off some, you will not miss anything.
