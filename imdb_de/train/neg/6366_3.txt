There was not a single redemption factor in this movie. The girlfriend and I love action movies. Especially fighting scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were great), but this movie was not entertaining. Five minutes of action followed after twenty minutes of conversation and "angry" facial expressions. The main hero is a restless figure who has seen a fight and is therefore forced to appear seriously disturbed at any time. The army has disturbed his bowel movements to perfect his fighting technique. The music is not good either. They fight for the rap and hip-hop style of the streets, because these guys are thugs. The rest of the soundtrack consists of the usual background noise of low-budget dramas. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is classic B-style. The actors deliver their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, and the lines themselves should be set on fire and burn in a rotten Hollywood alley. The movie is called "Honor", but there was no honor to make this movie. It was just a waste of money, and spending smart money is something I consider honorable. <br /> <br /> Go to Felon instead. The fight scenes and situations are more real.
