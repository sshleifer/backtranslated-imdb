This is a 1974 German movie that deals with a few women who go to a castle and, moreover, I can not really explain their purpose or even the purpose of the movie. I can tell you that there are several women who are also servants in this castle in the moonlight, dressing up, putting on body color and gliding to bongos, as they did in the Goth Kit-Kat Club during the run of this movie. Yes, there seems to be devil worship and vampires, and there are girls for girls, and so on, but the focus seems to be on the painted women lounging in the basement. I liked the eye-rolling of one of the main housekeepers, which gave the process authenticity and made it even more evil-looking. Was that the evil lesbian Wanda (as charged in the credits)? No matter. If you are not too choosy, if your lesbian devil wants to worship movies, you might like it, otherwise it's pretty boring and I could not finish it, I was so bored. 3 out of 10.
