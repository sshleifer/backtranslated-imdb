The old principle that bored people are boring is well demonstrated in Women in Love. The script from D.H. Lawrence's novel contains an endless flow of concepts that are at best sophomoric. <br /> <br /> What a pity that so much effort has gone into such an empty exercise; what an empty array of characters that received such attention. Despite the high production values, this film looks as boring as its staff. A renewed visit in 2001 merely confirms an impression of Juvenille's spirit in adult bodies from 1969, who nowhere tosses around and every step of the company fumbling away.
