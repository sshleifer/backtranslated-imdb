This ghost movie by Kiyoshi Kurosawa is pretty wild and he had at least one fear of jumping that caught me off guard. But all in all, the film is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer just to find out he may have committed one of the crimes. Then he is followed by a beautiful Asian spirit of the woman and has no idea why (and the viewer is not). While other murders are committed, he becomes even more confused, as the killers can be easily found, and that spirit is still pursuing him for some reason. Not only is the conspiracy stupid, but the woman's spirit is more than anything funny, especially when she suddenly flies through the city like Wonder Woman. And the end makes little sense, actually the whole movie makes little sense, and I can not recommend it at all. If it was not so serious, I would think it should be a black comedy. Outside "Bright Future," this is the worst movie I've ever seen by Kiyoshi Kurosawa.
