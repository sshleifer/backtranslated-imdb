"Sir" John Gielgud must have become senile to play in a mess of a movie like this one. This is one of those movies, I suppose this is considered "art", but do not be fooled ..... it's garbage. Stick to the "art" you can admire in a frame, for the films labeled as such are usually unintelligible counterfeits like these. In this masterpiece, Giegud recites Shakespeare's "The Tempest" while the camera pans away to naked people. one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool. Wow, that's intoxicating stuff and real "art", right? That's only an example. Most of the story makes no sense, it is impossible to follow them, which is why liberal critics are afraid to say that they have not "understood", so they give high marks to save their false ego. Do you want Shakespeare? Read his books.
