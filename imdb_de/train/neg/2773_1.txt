Until that point, Gentle Rain was the movie I found worst in history. It was displaced by this "blockbuster" from Asia. It has a "star" and it's John Rhys Davies. He's far from the form to be the daring, magical flying guy he throws here. The rest of these people could not figure out a high school. No clich√©s were overlooked in the dialogue and the special effects were called as often as possible. <br /> <br /> It's pretty easy to see that someone in Asia had a lot of money and had to get a car for some actors. They wanted to drop money. Or maybe it was a director or a writer who needed a loan. My guess is that every career with this film is in his testimony. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a big favor and do not watch this movie. One hundred Thanksgivings could not eat this turkey. <br /> <br /> The one funny scene was unintentional. The brother of the king appears at the scene. The king? A handsome, older, short Asian actor. (Bad actor) The brother? A six foot European. (Also a bad actor.) No excuses were made for that. They only expected that we would not notice that poor man's brother Jet Li was a wannabe Pierce Brosnan in a cheap "Injun" wig from an old 1940s western movie.
