A country singer nicknamed "Big T" - seriously, that's what they call her - risks her burgeoning musical career and her life by becoming part of the company of a sloppy drinker (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother committed suicide, his father is also an alcoholic and he has a violent temperament. You can imagine where that leads to. In the meantime, there is a lot of music, as Parton with their fluent vocal talents song by song (at least half a dozen of them about Texas) is excluded. Avoid this mess and check it out instead in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS.
