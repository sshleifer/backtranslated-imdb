You know how everyone jokes about acting in porn movies? If you have always found the plot of a pornography that arouses your interest, this movie is for you. It really was like porn without sex. Or if you do not like that analogy, imagine that you and your drunken roommate found a movie camera on a park bench. This is the movie you would do. - Terrible acting - Bad camera work - Music on a Casio keyboard - This movie offers everything and more. For those who are masochists in the crowd, this is a premiere piece for your collection. <br /> <br /> I can only say that the only people who submitted reviews for this dripping pile of film were people who played the main role in it. <br /> <br /> Your film career is over before the start.
