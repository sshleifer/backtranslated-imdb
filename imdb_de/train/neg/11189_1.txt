Always enjoy great movies that deal with the supernatural and deep thoughts of the spiritual world. However, this film rejected me in terms of production and direction. There is nothing to discuss what this story has to tell. All I can say is that it was a great waste of time and effort to get it on the big screen. The actors, Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, have done an outstanding job in his home country of England and we have seen him in "Still Standing" on a television series. Heath Ledger, played the crazy guy and we recently watched him at "Brokeback Mountain". '05, gave a great supporting role. Shannyn Sossaman ((Mara Sinclair)) has seduced a priest from a church that is not recognized by any faith. Do not waste your time, you'll be sorry!
