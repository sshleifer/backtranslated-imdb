I have just seen "El Otro". I've always taken my hat off for Julio Chavez's performances because he's a great actor, but this movie is really depressing and slow. I think it would have been worse if there had not been Julio. Anyway, this is definitely a movie you will never understand unless you are from Argentina, and even if you are, I would advise you not to rent this movie to have a good time with your girlfriend, yours To spend a friend, your family or friends ... it is really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make much sense. Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is boring and impresses the audience with scenes that shock you a bit. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. Overall, I definitely did not like this movie.
