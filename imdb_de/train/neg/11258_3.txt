I have said this in other reviews, without a story, you can give the audience all the smoke and mirror mirrors that you want, yet no one will hurt. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have a big eye for 30's Art Deco (which I love), and I think the idea of ​​using all digital backgrounds could indeed be the wave of the future in filmmaking his. However, it is obvious that the director was so interested in the digital rendering of his film that he forgot to film many scenes that would have helped enormously with this surprisingly thinner movie. (SPOILER) Because they're screaming loud, they've forgotten to have a villain in this thing! OK, they have one, but at the time of the movie, he's been dead for 20 years. Conran misses the point of having a villain. As for the action, let's see, Sky Captain (Law) shoots a robot, two or three of the flapping wings (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting !!!), and some robots, but Most of the time he spends his time moving and convincing others to fight his battles for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever else is wasted in this movie (the reviewer who commented on her and Law's lack of chemistry is right), and I was a little fed up with it, taking repeated shots of her camera She shows ONLY TWO SHOTS LEFT, both of which are wasted in the movie, one weird, one pretty funny, though I've seen it from 70 years. Nobody except Law and Paltrow has a lot of time on the screen, and that's the real flaw of the movie. An audience does not identify with robots, it does need a hero to root for, and a visible, despicable rogue to hate. Without this and an interesting story, all CG will not help the world.
