This movie, presumably a thriller, had about five dealings that culminated in the climax, but ended up as a yawn. <br /> <br /> The writing was banal, the pace was slow and incoherent and the characters were boring. George Clooney looks like he needs to go to a gym, Matt Damon pushed it up, and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie was that it was carefully crafted. Be politically correct and it has not said anything like big business, oil and the Middle East. I've seen documentaries make for more excitement. Just look at it when there is absolutely nothing else to do.
