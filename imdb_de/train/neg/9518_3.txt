Bad performances by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Heavily underdeveloped minor characters. Annoying talkie without real conspiracy. The ending makes you flatter than a pancake, with more loose ends than you could tie in four sequels (that is, if you were ever interested in these wooden characters). MacLaine is the only true capital. This penultimate sequence, in which the "Chicago Hood" looks for the Sinatra character, is ridiculous. The music in this order is also bad. And in the final scene, when Martin's figure took off his hat for the woman he called a "pig," I almost had to go outside and find a stone to throw through my TV screen.
