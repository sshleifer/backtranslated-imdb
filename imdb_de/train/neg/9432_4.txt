"Unhinged" is a strange little movie, a forgotten Slasher from the golden age of the genre. It's hard to write a satisfying review of this movie just because the movie is so unique. The conspiracy is quite overdone - three young women on their way to a rock concert fall into a car accident and end up in the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinach daughter. Very soon the ladies notice that something is wrong when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic. In addition, mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship as they argue intensely over their housemates at dinner. The old mother goes so far as to call her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking in guys in the evening to sleep with them. Halfway through the movie, when a girl finally decides she'd rather leave to seek help, the murder begins. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, the film is at the bottom of the barrel. Neither of the three stranded girls can be the "lead" girl above all. It is almost unbelievable to hear how they are kept in the same wood tone throughout the movie. The mother and the daughter are better, but not much. The movie is pretty boring in parts and really, really slow. The murders are cruel, but nothing we have not seen yet. As already mentioned, however, the film really does gain points with a brilliantly disturbing and bloody ending. It comes completely from the left field and has the same shock value as the end of the classic "Sleepaway Camp". Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is boring and suffers from terrible drama and boring, boring tempo. The isolated, creepy-looking villa and the sombre, gloomy lighting give the film a grainy realism, which is quickly destroyed when one of the characters tries to act. It may be worth it if you can hold it to the end, but I say you are better if you only rewind for the last 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
