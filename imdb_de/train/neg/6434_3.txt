I'm always surprised how different people are and how you get both extremes for almost every movie. People who think that this is the best movie and people who think it's the worst. <br /> <br /> Stigmata would not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's up there. Especially the sound. The producers spent more time on the soundtrack than on the editing. It was so loud when the soundtrack was played and no one spoke, and when Patrica spoke in her monotonous voice, she was barely audible. <br /> <br /> I like Patrica and Gaberial normally, but they were both flat in this movie. Patrica basically had 3 emotions. Quiet, in great pain or really angry, she has stigmata. The first was the predominant one, the second was associated with screaming pain, the third was to raise her voice. It was the volume that made up the three emotions, not the emotions. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I have missed many deep meanings and subplots that everyone has talked about, or maybe I was distracted by the horrible filming and the MTV-style style. Watching a 3-minute video requires fast cuts and slow motion to give a short story. In a 2-hour feature film, it's bad. I do not understand what it means that women see across the steppe and drop a child. And no Pittsburg does not rain so often !! <br /> <br /> I think maybe it was a real story with something intended to say, but the entire budget was spent on buying music and equipment for slow rain drop shots and renting this magnificent apartment in the Mrs. Arquett lived and ended up firing the man with the story.
