Stupid and just a funny movie about a child being traumatized when he realizes that Santa is not real (???). He grows up and grows up (Brandon Maggart). He makes lists of people who are naughty or nice. One Christmas he grabs and sets out to kill the naughty people - dressed as Santa, of course. <br /> <br /> Boring and just a bad killer Christmas movie. If you are looking for Gore, it is not here. Only a few of the murders are shown and they are not very crazy with very bad effects. Most of the film contains Brandon Maggart, who talks to himself and slowly goes crazy. The script is banal, the acting is terrible and leads to an end where I staring at the TV with open chin. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and look again to make sure I was not hallucinating! Really REALLY bad ending. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent a scary Christmas movie, "Black Christmas" (the original version of the 70s --- NOT the horrible remake). Avoid this at all costs.
