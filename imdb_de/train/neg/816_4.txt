In the 1970s, WPIX conducted "The Adventures of Superman" on each weekday afternoon for several years. From time to time we would enjoy having neighboring shows on the show "Superman and the Mole Men". I have always been looking forward to these days. When I saw it recently, I was surprised how bad it really was. <br /> <br /> It was not bad because of the special effects or their lack. The Superman costume by George Reeves was pretty bad, but the edges of the foam padding that made it look more imposing were clearly visible. And true, the costumes of the mole men were even worse. What should have been a furry coating would not have misled a ten-year-old, for the zippers, cuffs and bad pilling fabric, which were poorly cut into baggy costumes, were all painfully obvious. However, these were forgivable shortcomings. <br /> <br /> No, what made it bad was the fake plotter. Again and again Superman has done nothing to prevent a deterioration of the situation. A lynch mob is looking for the creatures? Instead of rounding out the hysterical crowd or even searching for the creatures, he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to Lois and the PR man. The creatures are cornered? Again he stands around and looks and talks, but does not save them until they are shot. Luke Benson, the city's hustler, shoots him? Attempted murder of a reasonable person, but Superman keeps releasing the man to cause further problems. Superman had some options to nip the problem in the bud, but never used it once. That said, both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well and seemed to feel comfortable in the roles right away. If only they had gotten a better script to work with.
