Evil Breed is a very strange Slasher strip, which unfortunately is not good. The beginning of the film seems promising, but overall it's a disaster. The dialogue is pretty bad, but not nearly as bad as acting. The acting is brutal and unbearable The characters deliver terrible lines and even if that works intentionally, the method does not work because the characters get annoying. Some of the killings are innovative, but it took far too long for them to come to them. After about half an hour through the movie We get the first death (unlike at the beginning) and then almost every other character is smoked within the next five minutes. The film turned into a kind of parody of ridiculous-looking characters, unrealistic karate-like battles, and a scene where a man gets his guts pulled out of his ash racket. Neither of them is funny, it's just ridiculous. The movie then becomes ultra-bloody and ultra-meaningless. Most characters are even clich√©d for slasher standards and as solid as you have been on the counter for five days. Evil Breed is not even ridiculously bad and fails in her main task. See Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just before dawn or See No Evil for a real slasher.
