Manufactured Landscapes begins with its long opening of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory, trying to show the devastating effects of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. The booming story assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is completely new, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America, and Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum. That there may be a connection between today's Asian pursuit of industrialization and prosperity and past hunger and terror experiences is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, one tries to present Edward Burtynsky's photographs of industrial waste as somehow "beautiful". A big part of the movie is a slideshow of these pictures. They are well produced, have the size of a museum and have evidently been shown in several exhibitions. But for me they only show that almost every photograph can be beautifully rendered if it is well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship between the photographs and the spoken message of the film, if any, remains unclear. I do not want to point out that there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialization. Finished landscapes, however, only offer strange and bitter hopelessness. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. Maybe it has value as a demonstration of what's wrong with the American (and Canadian) left.
