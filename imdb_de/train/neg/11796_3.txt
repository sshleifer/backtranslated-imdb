Is nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Then take a look at Phat Beach. Do not rent it and DO NOT buy it. That would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I watched this on TV and had to laugh in certain places. I did not laugh long and I did not laugh hard. However, there were subtle jokes and comments that made me laugh. If you are looking for an extremely funny movie, have a look at Friday. If you are looking for a strong emotional film (something this film tries ... kind of), look at something like Tire Dreams or Jason's Lyric. If you're looking for a good black booty, check out a porn movie by Dominique Simone, because the nudity in this movie is pretty much nonexistent. However, if you have nothing better to do and this is done via cable, look at this. You will be a little amused. <br /> <br /> *** 3 out of 10 ***
