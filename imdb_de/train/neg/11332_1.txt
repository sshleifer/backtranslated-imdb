As big as a Texas prairie and just as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can not drive this crowded boat. Taylor looks bad to LOOKS - wrong wardrobe, fake hair and wrong make-up - a unique achievement in her remarkable career. Hopper offers the only credible performance and Dean in the climate scene shows remarkable talents as something we do not usually remember - a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and raises the question of what Redford could have done with the male lead role. There is no apparent conspiracy that creates tension until the last twenty minutes, but only a milestone of milestones that have little to do with one another. With the exception of Hopper, there is no character development, just a collection of carton clippings that appear for no apparent reason like random targets in a shooting hall. The film addresses racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo, and has SIZE, making it an excellent choice for getting rid of unwelcome houseguests. Those with the DVD version can spare themselves a bit of boredom by starting with the second record. You will not miss anything interesting.
