Warning! Spoiler! <br /> <br /> This is your typical Disney movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Correct politically what has to do with the nursing home, which has an even distribution of races. <br /> <br /> 2.Awaits the intellect of the audience with its simple lines. <br /> <br /> 3.The boy's sleepy father is taken almost straight from the Never ending story 2. 4.In a world of crime, disease, corruption, hunger, and other things to be cared for, only an inferior team of divine intervention is worthy. UHHHH !!! <br /> <br /> I do not like to swear ?! Where the hell did that come from? <br /> <br /> 6.In the help of the team, the angel causes pain and humiliation on the opposing team. Very angelic indeed! 7.The team The angels help, are called ... can you imagine ... THE ANGELS! Disney in its worst form! <br /> <br /> 8. "I just got his training wings." Brillent line! <br /> <br /> My affliction: I did not like it at all.
