I saw this movie with my 17-year-olds. Daughter. I insisted that we attend the matinee show, not because I'm a close boy, just the feeling that I did. In the sense of NASCAR, this is the dream of a sponsor. So much blatant advertising, it would be almost an info-Mercial, if it were not the so-called drama. Traditionally, the Herbie franchise continues with its cheesy storylines. The car is just a "vehicle" (no pun) for this cornball of a movie. Earlier Herbie rates (though also cheesy) were produced in more serious times, making them more digestible. Ms. Lohan, Disney's acting drama queen, has few acting skills. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would be involved in such a project. Only the snack bar was a major rip off!
