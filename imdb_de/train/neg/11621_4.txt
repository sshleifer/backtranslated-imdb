I wanted to see this movie because I knew it was Christian. The director had a good idea / intention in creating this movie, but it could have been better. I can understand why someone still has feelings for which he is the greatest love of his life. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, mean and rude. The main character apologized again and again to his friends, if they were the middle ones for him. They were not understandable at all and used God as a reason to explain their behavior. The main character or someone else did not know if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, was still married, and so on, but they were against him and solved old feelings that needed to be dealt with. His friends were probably Christians and should be seen as supporting, whether they agreed to his decision or not. So often do we do things in life that we do not apologize to those we've hurt in the past, and when he tried, they were all against him. The ironic part was his new girlfriend, who was accused of having stalking behavior because he was simply looking for an old friend when she did something strange to find his name, address and phone number ... she seemed to be the stalker! She did not look like a friend at all, just looking at herself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with the person they should be with, and I believe that the movie has done a terrible injustice by making it appear as if God does not care about true love ... only that you stay with someone with whom you have made a bad choice. We all make mistakes ... it's all about what steps you take to make amends. As I said, the film had potential, but I was tired of constantly repeating the one-sided view and sticking the audience in the neck of its so-called ... well-meaning friends. This film did not conform to the Christian belief in love, but I give it a C for its efforts.
