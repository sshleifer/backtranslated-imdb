... I had seen it in my teenage years. This movie was mildly entertaining. What I liked about Soul Survivors was the Gothic atmosphere during the party scenes and the constant change between "dream" and "reality". Would not there have been films like "The 6th Sense" and "Don"? Look Now: The end would have surprised me.
