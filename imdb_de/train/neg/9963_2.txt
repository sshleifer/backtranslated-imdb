I love Alec Guinness. And that says a lot about this movie. Actually, he is not feeling bad. He just seems to stand by, be urban and his usual adorable self, but invest nada. It's obvious that the girl he works with is a featherweight, even as an inexperienced young French girl. Sir Alec would not have chosen her as a young girl and is obviously not very happy about it. <br /> <br /> The interesting character is the brooding brother of the strange "Suzanne", another jerk. "Donald" strives to be a French Heathcliffe, and I waited in vain for the source of his secret. What deep dark secret did he hide behind this forehead? Was he in love with his father's lover? Why was he pulling Suzanne's hair when she planned to bring the different parts of this turkey together on the estate? Or maybe he just had enough of her vile acting. <br /> <br /> The film would have been charming with Guiness and the "older woman", who remembers Paris and sees Paris together. THAT would be a great story! Two amiable experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why did not someone come up with that? I suggest watching Alec Guiness in "The Card," a little-known but rewarding movie.
