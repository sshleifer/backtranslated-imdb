Calling the most pathetic piece of crap in film history is not an easy task as the candidates are so abundant, but Nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite since I saw it. It was so funny that we had to rent it again the next day, and I had to laugh so hard that I literally rolled on the floor. (This usually only happens when I see Monty Python's "Scott of the Antarctic.") <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, an overwhelming "What the hell feel" captures the viewer. I am totally amazed that this clumsy home video ever made it to production. It should be a sequel, but has no obvious connection with the first movie. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is female, although we went halfway into the movie to guess what to do with all the muscle and the barbarian nomadic outfit. <br /> <br /> It's not really an action, it's just a long chase scene, but it's so slow and pointless that, if you call it a chase scene, it sounds a lot more interesting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue, which is just as good in terms of quality, and then, after a blatant action scene with many gasoline explosions, the film suddenly ends abruptly without really explaining what it was all about. Luckily, it never gets boring, because there is always something stupid and wrong going on! <br /> <br /> Terrible movies are usually just boring, but Nemesis 2 is a perfect mix of excessive seriousness and unintentional craziness that is really entertaining. Rent this movie or even buy it, you will not be disappointed!
