I have to say this movie is a Mork and Mindy when I saw it when I caught a cold, I even moistened myself a bit. When this Korean guy with the spiders in the neck started kicking people, it was like my lord, the Asian people smell and suck because they eat dogs all the time. Every time he got back on track, Chuck had a terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a normal, non-robotic person. Some people compared it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the Holy Spirit and the spirit of the Christmas season. This movie is so bad that I put my newborn child in a box and left it in Mr. Norris mailbox. He can raise my child. I'm not letting him into a world where he thinks Norris is a karate expert.
