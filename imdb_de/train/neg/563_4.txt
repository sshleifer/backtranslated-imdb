Does every good story have to be "improved" with graying Broadway music? Obviously, those who can not come up with their own actions believe that classical literature is only for looting. I admit that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, since it's certainly true that Dickens has often written things that will discredit you a great deal, and this was a great example ... Take this serious story of course Add and add disgusting music and collect it with every character, from prancing orphans to chopping up bobbies, and suddenly it's uplifting? Argh. Bring me a pelvis. <br /> <br /> The four stars in my review are from the casting I could compare to My Fair Lady's. Each of these films had a cast that a game version might be proud of, but then they have to go and let them sing (see appeal above). Unlike My Fair Lady they could sing here, and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of Oliver Reed (sorry, if I'm wrong, it's been a while). <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint I have I have said. Why embarrass anyone except the truly shameless by making silly songs into an absolutely good story? Rarely has this been done successfully. In general, it ruins the story. It has done with this. The jury still has no idea if this story is worth saving, but with all the kick-off it's impossible to say.
