It was disgusting and painful. What a waste of occupation! I swear the audience (1/2 full) laughed TWICE in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Do not even rent. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was just too mean to be credible. <br /> <br /> Just ok. I was sorry for him (the actor) if people remember this mess. Charming and sweet, but without purpose. The "romance" with John was absolutely incredible.
