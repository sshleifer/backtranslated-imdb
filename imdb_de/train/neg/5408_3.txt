This review is most of all spoilers. IF YOU CAN ENJOY THIS FILM, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. <br /> <br /> That's the problem with children's television nowadays. It's all so condescending and condescending. "Wow, that was fun, right?" No, that was not it. And unfortunately, it seems to have penetrated into children's films. And that's what "Flight of the Reindeer" is all about. Granted, I did not see "Flight of the Reindeer" in a few years, so I might be unclear on some points, but I remember being completely unimpressed at the time. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story follows a lecturer who is given a book for Christmas. Now the lecturer is a valued scientist about the flight habits of an animal. I think they were bullfrogs. In any case, Mr. Lecturer / Father of the family learns through this book that reindeer can fly as much as bullfrogs. Apparently this book was written by a scientist who disappeared hundreds of years ago at the North Pole. If it were me, I would have thrown the book out of the next window. Flying bullfrogs are a naturally occurring phenomenon, but flying reindeer are a fantastic and totally unrealistic concept. But, Mr. Lecturer, it is not me. I think that explains why he flies to the North Pole and leaves his wife and child at home without knowing where he's gone. Of course, things go awry and before he knows, a flying reindeer has crashed into his private plane and stranded at the North Pole. <br /> <br /> Are you still following this? Well. <br /> <br /> His family is devastated, of course. I would be too, I mean, what a crappy Christmas. Elsewhere, the lecturer is in a hidden city on the North Pole, inhabited by dwarfs and a tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white. Instead of trying to flee immediately, as I would have done, he welcomes everyone there with open arms. This hidden civilization of dwarf monsters, and he welcomes them with open arms. Oooo-Kayyyy. They feed him this story that they are the elves of Santa Claus and they make toys for children all year round, of which they have no idea. And Mr. Lecturer accepts it all. He even accepts that Santa is indeed the scientist who disappeared two hundred years or so ago. There is only one problem - they do not want him to leave. The world can not know about its secret existence. After all, before they knew it, there would be a McDonald's and a Starbucks on every street corner. <br /> <br /> Still with me? <br /> <br /> Well, Mr. Nice Guy's family read the book and assume that he went to the North Pole. Boy, would not you be embarrassed if they found out that he had just taken a brisk walk? Before the audience knows it, they set out to spend Christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland in the world. Meanwhile, the lecturer is fed up with all the snooty dwarfs and decides to leave. I can not remember exactly, but I remember him holding Santa Claus at gunpoint. A firefight takes place as the dwarves attack and manage to escape via Santas sledge. With hot Santa on his heels and bloody eyes in his eyes, Mr. Whatever flies by a wonderful encounter next to his family's plane looking for him. So he jumps to her plane, the planes fly back and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> The fact is that over the years some shocking films have been made on behalf of Christmas, but because they're up to this festive charm they get away with it. And it is this charm that is completely free from 'Flight of the Reindeer'. Not much is wrong with that. nothing that insults the intelligence (well, obviously there is IS, but it's a children's film and can get away with such things) or something particularly insulting, but the problem is that there's not much right about it either. It just does not feel like Christmas. And for a movie that's about Christmas, it's a pretty big mistake. But hey, I do not think 'Flight of the Reindeer' interests the target audience? Why should they? They are all so stunned by tranquilizers that they probably could not spell "Christmas." <br /> <br /> I give three out of ten points. If it were a TV movie, I would add two more stars. We all know how bad they can become.
