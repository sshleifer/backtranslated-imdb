Yet another example of the complete waste of money from the British lottery. How commercially has this film proven itself. The Film Council, which financed this miserable garbage, was supposed to be stranded on one of the disused subway stations on the London Underground, because this clich√©d, gloomy copy was committed to filming, a half-mutated thing that's made up of all the horror movies the Director has seen and felt fit to imitate, especially Deathline. Among his many sins is the apparent failure to sympathize remotely with the main character until the last minute. It is a bit late then! Surely all of these development managers at the UK Film Council have noticed this in the script. Add to this the terrible spectacle and the ridiculous appearance of the creature, and you will get an excellent example of how you are not afraid.
