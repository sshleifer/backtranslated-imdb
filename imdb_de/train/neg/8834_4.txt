This movie contained some truths. I remember a story 15 to 20 years ago that 4 fishermen had found a body in the water and they decided not to report it until their journey was over. I also remember that they were accused of having disturbed a corpse (or similar charge). I am not sure if it was in Australia. Spectators outside Australia must believe we live in a land of rapists and serial killers. Wolf Creek and this movie would promote that perception. The movie itself reminded me of A Simple Plan. But as far as anyone was one of the best Australian films, I can not be so generous. To put it this way, I would not care anymore.
