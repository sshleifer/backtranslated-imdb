It is often said that movies can never match the original book. Well, in this case, not only is the movie not "as good" as the book, but it is an insult to the book. I'd rather see Milan Kundera's novel set on fire than cope with that "something" the director is likely to call "adaptation" on the shoulders or the unbearable lightness of being? "is set aside, and instead it's all about the movie of Daniel Day Lewis (I can not say Tomas) that he's making sexual adventure with his dumb wife, his lover and his other lover." Fran√ßois Truffaut has already said: bad directors make bad movies, do not waste your time and money, read the book instead, it's really worth it.
