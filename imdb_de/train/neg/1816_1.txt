This movie is really brilliant. It sneaks through the banality to shit with such speed that you do not even see the common sense and common sense of humanity rush by. But it does not stop! This film hits the bottom of the barrel so hard that it bounces back to the ridiculous comedy: see how Kor scatters the overgrown Conan wannabe with the overabundance on neck hair stuff that swings his sword like there's no tomorrow (and not the kind how he swung it, I'm really surprised that * a * morning was for him, or at least for his beer gut). Do not miss this movie, it's a fantastic play through idiocy and sheer bloody thoughts! And when you finish looking, you dry out the tears of joy (or the tears of frustration with such an inappropriate storytelling) from your eyes, because some dumb people gave these people another $ 5 to make a sequel!
