What can I say? I think I have to write "Spoiler Alert" and then "reveal" that they have MUCH used the F-word in this movie - as in every two sentences. I did not like this movie at all - too much evidence of sexual perversions, minor steps and fraud. And that cursing was totally out of the window. I gave this movie "3" and two of those are for Mira Sorvinos sexy moves on the dance floor.
