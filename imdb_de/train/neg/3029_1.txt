This "thing" is from the beginning only a terrible consequence of extremely short cuts of blurred camera work. While the plot offers everything for a thriller, the story is told so badly that I can not buy it. In the middle of the movie, the actions of characters do not make sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> For example, Ed's idea is to make Edna coffee for her after she has shot down her son's arm, far below his supposed experience. It's just an extremely stupid idea. Domino does not question the fragmentary orders that Claremont Williams receives over a break-up telephone connection, just miss me; Should not she be suspicious of Williams turning her on? These FBI agents seem to be out of their heads with a single helicopter, and they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shootout. What they do about it by withholding and disseminating information to Cigliutti is quite a bit of incitement to murder; It seems to me a farewell to justice when the FBI conducts investigations in this way. In fact, they would have messed up a case irreparably if they had behaved like that. We see a car crash that would normally have been seriously injured if most of the passengers had not been killed, but miraculously left all along with some bruising. On the contrary, the accident immediately follows that Domino loves Choco, who, in Domino's view, is in no way motivated by past events, but merely by being stunned into the eyeballs. The whole sequence of scenes from the call of Claremont Williams makes me want to be dramatic. Along with the awful, restless camera work, this only makes a piece that I hesitate to call a movie. I'm sorry for the wasted effort of the main characters whose talent is out of the question.
