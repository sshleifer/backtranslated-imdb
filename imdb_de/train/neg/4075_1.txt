I'm a horror film freak, and this movie was so bad that I felt embarrassed not only for the "actors" but also for the director and poor juice of a producer who actually spent his money on this hit. > <br /> From the title you expect a big slaughter, a certain action and at least a direction or a dialogue. Instead, you get something that looks like a slightly more violent and sexual Three Stooges episode. At least I laugh about the Three Stooges. As I watched this crap, I turned on another TV and looked at Howard Stern until something interesting happened. Needless to say, I have watched Stern. <br /> <br /> Watch this "movie" I realize I could make a movie with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $ 50 change, and a broken PC. This movie is my inspiration to get me interested in filming without budget. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned ... There is not much here except a lot of conversation and little action. This makes "KaZaam" look like a Meryl Streep movie. <br /> <br /> I am sure that Germany has not banned it for sex or violence. Other countries must pay attention.
