I hear rumors about an upcoming "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc". With advances over the last 25 years, from steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can be revived. I just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left by the whole Magnavision fiasco. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the Betamax VCR" was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history. Who would have expected such a quiet cinema after the tentative "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the compact cassette" and the downright sticky "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the 8-track band"? I'm just crying about it right now.
