What was it all about? I saw the matrix and was amazed. It was the most spectacular movie ever made. What the Wachowski brothers ever had to shoot this movie is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> There is no conspiracy, you can not argue with that. Basically, the whole movie was a lot of talk, and do not get me wrong, I have no problems with Talky movies, but all the talking in The Matrix Reloaded was a pointless trick. Then there would be a combat sequence that took far too long, then pointless sucker, then another fight scene that took too long, and it all became the biggest anti-climax of all time. A little bearded guy who speaks a load of incomprehensible bull for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves also shows his worst performance so far. I knew he was not a good actor, but that was more than a joke. If you look at his films in the order in which he was in them, it seems he's starting to get worse. God knows what His Achievement is in Something's Give A Give! Keanu Reeves: The only wooden plank ever to be an actor. <br /> <br /> After the splendor of the first movie, this was a massive disappointment. If you have not seen the first movie yet, I suggest you look at it, but do not waste your time with that bastard. <br /> <br />
