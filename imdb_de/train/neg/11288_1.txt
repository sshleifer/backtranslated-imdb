Lately, I've been exposed to both this movie and King Arthur, on DVDs chosen by others for the "entertainment" of an evening, and together, they are nothing more than a growing idea that the modern movie viewer The audience is totally convinced There is no discrimination and she is satisfied as long as they receive "action". Both films were total garbage. <br /> <br /> What happened to the character development? What happened to a meaningful dialogue? What happened to the action? And if one observed something vaguely claiming to be "historical", whatever attempt to capture a degree of accuracy, a realistic notion of the "political map" of the time, even a light flair of the epoch, before everything in their social settings. Why do they all have to show the value of 21st century America? I read in the message boards of disclaimers that "little known" was the dark age. Not so. There are considerable quantities known, with many scholarly scholarships about the era, but these jokers simply could not bother to do homework. <br /> <br /> I just wish I could vote 0/10
