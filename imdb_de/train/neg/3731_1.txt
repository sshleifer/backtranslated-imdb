I have been raised in a "very Christian" household since birth. I was saved before watching this movie and the rest of the series. I had to look at him in a youth group in my church. This movie was very disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares for years. I used to lie awake in bed and listen to my mother's steps upstairs. If I did not hear her footsteps, I snuck upstairs to make sure she was not thrilled. Every night I prayed for salvation because I was afraid that Jesus forgot me. This is definitely not something I will show my children until they are much older, if any. It took me years to shake the fear that this film gave me.
