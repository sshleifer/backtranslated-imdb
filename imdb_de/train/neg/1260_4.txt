Yes, CHUNKY, that's the nickname Donna Reed's romantic track of Tom Drake plays on her! So let's make that straight away. From her first role in THE GET AWAY (1941) to her last, DALLAS (1984-1985), Ms. Reed could NEVER be called CHUNKY. Not this attractive and slender actress. Whose roles at M.G.M. Rarely has she lived up to her talents. <br /> <br /> Ms. Reed is assisted by a cast of competent character actors, who unfortunately have to flock through this alleged "bullet" comedy. It is clear that M.G.M. was out of their depth to make this kind of movie. A type better produced by COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither the touch of Ernst Lubitsch nor the joke of Preston Sturges could save this film. A rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the signs of a pre-WWII war. <br /> <br /> If Irving Thalberg had been alive, the script would have either undergone a significant transcription or never seen the light of the day. It fit into the "safe zone" of Louis B. Mayer, who did not call for family entertainment , A form that could not stand up to the post-war challenges of the DeHavilland decision, the loss of its theatrical chains and television, and would contribute to the descent of M.G.M.M. Fortunately for Donna Reed, her best days are before her peak in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953) and her Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress.
