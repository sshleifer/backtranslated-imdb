I will not contribute to the plot ratings, it's not very good. <br /> <br /> Very unlikely orphanage on Bala. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee at their height. <br /> <br Some beautiful landscapes. <br /> <br /> Good for facial recognition, and I quote: "Look at your mouth, this is Cassie of dumbbells and horses". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry. <br /> <br /> Fulton MacKay was much better at Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better at everything else and Diana Dors did what she did best. <br /> <br /> redemption function? It was free to watch the horror channel before subscribing. I will not sign up for this effort.
