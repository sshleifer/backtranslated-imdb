For the first 30 minutes from Tinseltown, my finger on the remote wiggled to look around and see something else. The premise of two writers who renounce their luck and live in a "campground" was mildly amusing, but painfully bland. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - The great filmmaker who lives in the park and sleeps in a toilet offered hope and I decided to give a few more minutes. And then a few more, until Kristy Swanson's introduction as an aspiring film director and borderline nymphomaniac added some spice. Their solid acting performance increased their presence beyond the borders, which was a welcome welcome. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the obvious low-budget effects on the movie have bad-shot scenes, slow tempo, and some slapstick handling of moments. Some of my favorite movies of all time were low-budget, Whithnail and I were one who also deals with 2 boys with a dream, but on their luck. <br /> <br /> However for my money the actors Save Tinseltown from the archives "Terrible Movie" and almost push it into the archive "Could be a cult movie". In some scenes with Joe Pantoliano's character, I laughed aloud. Especially the penultimate scenes in the awfully clich√©d but still funny character house, where history meets its last moments. <br /> <br /> I can see how Tinseltown was great stage play and while the filmmakers did their best to translate this into celluloid, it just did not work and while I laughed a lot in some scenes and a liner, I think That the first 30 minutes would cloud my senses and expectations In a sense, I would have laughed about something. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in a novelty coffee coaster, then you should not put up with it if you see it in a bargain basket.
