Actually, that's a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first animated 3D movie. I bought it about 3 years ago on DVD. Did not Bug's Life do that too? I think it was at Disneyworld in this tree, so I say before they go and use that as a logo there. In addition, Shrek 3d was a motion simulator in Universal Studios. You should still consider it as a movie because it appeared in a "theater" and you could buy it for DVD. The movie was cute, at least the little flies. I like IQ. I agree with Animaster, they did a good job because they turned a movie into a movie that is just an adventure. I recommend it to families and children.
