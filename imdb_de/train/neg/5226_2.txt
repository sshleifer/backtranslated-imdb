This was one of the lameest movies we've seen in recent months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad drama (mostly from the minor characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Hugh Laurie obviously went out of her way to learn samba dancing, but the scope of his character was just that he dips at the kiddie end of the pool. The film is based on the look of a pretty girl and great music, but not enough to entertain. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen Rio or the interior of a British bank, this film is the case for you 2 out of 10.
