The black guy turns into a wealthy white man, and the whites seem to embrace the hip-hop culture, and most of the "fun" moments of this movie play off. The problem I have is that it does not work and almost never works. <br /> <br /> OK, so no one would expect Lance to grab such a body and suddenly start behaving like Charles Wellington. That would be too much to ask. I admit that. At the same time, however, it goes too far in the other direction. Imagine a rich, white man singing rap and turning everything upside down as if he's a bastion of hip-hop culture, and people * just * accept him? And what about Sontee, who falls in love with him * as a rich white man, even though he does not care about his money or his power? This is so incredible that it is not even funny. <br /> <br /> I just could not stop the disbelief and stop the movie. I added an extra star because it made me laugh a couple of times, even hard. But I just could not get past the whole "white guy at hip hop", which has never been done well in any movie I've ever experienced. This was no exception.
