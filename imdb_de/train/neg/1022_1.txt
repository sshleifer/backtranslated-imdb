Starting with the poster (just Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the entire movie was scam. One movie after another was about nothing in this movie - or at least nothing new. After 10-15 minutes you realize that you have just paid for Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J to recite themselves through another policeman. <br /> <br /> Basically, some are the corrupt city system, all secretly backed by the backbone business and in the city, under the watchful eye of some politicians. The almighty and above-the-law organization is called FRAT and you know what? They have a crazy, crazy policeman who shoots and punches at will - suspects, girlfriends, you name it. FRAT police are corrupt and greedy so they make mistakes discovered by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. An hour later, after a series of incredibly bad shooting scenes and more stereotype lines, everything ends happily and we get the last line: you can not beat the system. Bah! Do not see this waste of movie roles. Freeman and Spacey have barely 10 minutes together!
