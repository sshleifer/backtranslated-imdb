***** Probably smaller spoilers ****** <br /> <br /> I can not say that I liked it, but I can not say that I'm not ... it's very strange. It has bad things in it, like a shark coming out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can imagine. If I were the director, I would certainly cut that part off. .. For some people it gets boring because of the lack of action, sometimes it makes them feel like home ... Take, for example, a scene where one of the friends died and what they do next, huh? nop, do not cry ... their narrative horror stories with each other .. * sigh * (just after they've cried because he's lost) hundreds of "candles" on the table in front of them ... the boat is surrounded by a sort of curtain ( old rags that cover the windows) and sofas / couches ... I thought it was stupid, with candles, without thinking about the surroundings, apart from being alone on the high seas ... <br /> <br /> The good, some scary scenes that they did well, I liked. Sometimes horror works better when it's hidden, when it's hidden behind something, instead of showing it, so this movie does it well, maybe because it's a low budget I do not know, but it works well for me! You will feel tension if you forget some of the above holes. <br /> <br /> Do not expect much! But if you like anykind, watch this movie. Be patient and try to enjoy it. lol <br /> <br /> (sorry for my raw english) =) <br /> <br /> Cheers
