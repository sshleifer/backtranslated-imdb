I do not have much to say about this film. It could have been a wonderful tour de force for Peter Sellers, but it is one of the most tragic dropouts in film history. The last film by Sellers makes it all the more painful. <br /> <br /> The awesome script, directing and shocking wood performances make for a terrific encounter, making this movie one of the most unsurpassed films ever made. > <br /> I wish so much that I could even find a giggle or laugh buried somewhere in this bunch of lazy blubbers, but it's a lifeless, humorless disaster. The truth hurts. <br /> <br /> Peter, why could not you stop being there?
