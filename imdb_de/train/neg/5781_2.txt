Roman Polanski has made many, many films that are not exceptional. His fame confuses me. Nothing is a highlight except Chinatown (I did not see "Knife in the Water" or "Tess"). Every contribution he made to the film was completed over twenty years ago. His work is simply embarrassing, safe and / or boring (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates). R's baby must have signaled the end of the establishment at the time of its creation. It's a lux product and a pretty tall concept for a horror movie from 1968 (never show the baby). But that's just a false horror juice. Everything is to the point where the line of action becomes hopelessly clear very early (um, thanks for the finale that destroyed the title), and on a clear day you can see the end ending for a few days. It did not support my interest. I think whatever that movie may have been, it's completely derailed by the 1960s version of femininity. Farrow is such a chronically distracted, helpless waif / housewife. Her frailty is oversold ... she is extremely irritating. There are no real ideas in it ... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil. <br /> <br /> The Dakota is barely exploited for its uncanny potential.
