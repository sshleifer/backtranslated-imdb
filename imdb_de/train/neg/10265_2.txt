Kirstie Alley looks a bit leaner, but only a little bit. He's with a man who looks like MacGuyver, bleached blond hair and everything else. The premise of the film refers to an older woman (50 !!!) who can not produce her script due to age discrimination, so she sends her younger nephew as a writer. Not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy plays, inhuman dialogue and a ridiculous plot. There is another conspiracy that concerns a writer who distinguishes or admires Kirstie's character. Why this is involved is a mystery. The actor portraying Kirstie's brother is so wooden and Miscast it was torture to see her scenes. What is there to say about this movie? Avoid it.
