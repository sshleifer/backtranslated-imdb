This is the worst sequel in the world of movies. Again, it does not do it anymore. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he kills people making a movie about what happened in the first movie. Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this. If you appreciate the precious hour during this movie, then do not look at it. You want to ask the director and the person next to you what made him do it. Because it simply does not combine the original brands of horror, action and crime. Teenager, young child or young adult, this movie affects people.
