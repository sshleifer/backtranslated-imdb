I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but that was too much. Acting was not great, but that was not the real problem. The problem was the sinking feeling that I got into the stomach trench after 20 minutes. These characters were hollow. They had almost no depth, and the little that they had was devoted to the cruelty they showed each other in the guise of friendship. Exploring the dark sides of a series of characters can be intriguing, but you must give these characters actual personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts. These characters were made of cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly.
