Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested in seeing what he would do with total creative control over a movie. Unfortunately, it's not customizable, but not because the jokes are not funny - some (I will not say most), and indeed, Mr. Mike has done a good job translating his mentally unbalanced screeds into visual gags. The problem is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, you name it) is so horrible that the movie is unbearable. Some outfits with the name "PKO Productions" receive the production credit, but do not look at all; It looks like Mike stole one of the SNL set cameras and did it one afternoon. I understand that Mike's goal was to torment the audience, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear, or understand what is supposed to be shocking. Nevertheless, the DVD is not a total waste: it contains a laudatory speech on O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three "Mr. Mike's favorite bedtime stories" by SNL. Also, the movie's "cat's swim" section is a great scene you can watch if you want to freak someone out. 3.10
