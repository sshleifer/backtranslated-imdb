Impressive. I thought that might be dull, but it was even worse than I had imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good "car crash" movie: those that are so bad that you can not look the other way, because you want to see how bad they can get. That's really the only reason why I could leave the TV on - morbid fascination. It was not so much the acting, which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast, but the premise and the plot that should never have seen the light of day. Also the script is groaning. Did somebody else notice in the cinematography that he was using a "curtain-drawing" system, like in an old television program of the 50s ... but without irony? At first I thought they must be joking, but the movie takes itself too seriously to use it in a fun way. Do not even ask me about the score ... the only highlight is the last song by Morcheeba. I think they wanted to leave people with something for their $ 8 ... glad that I saw it on TV !!!!! Just stupid! I wonder if Timothy Hutton has had a hard time finding much work lately? I think if you do not expect much and want to see a mindless thriller, it would be better to spend an evening cutting your toenails, which is why it deserves a 2.
