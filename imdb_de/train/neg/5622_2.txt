OK, apart from the psychedelic wallpapers, the information presented here was good. The music I could have foregone (not that it was bad music, only that it did not suit this movie at all). <br /> <br /> As far as the content of the film is concerned, the director often speaks of a pagan perspective on the existence of Christ and a surprising comparison of the deeds and events of Christ's life with the lives of mythological figures / deities such as Mithra and Dionysius. Then he brings up the chronology of the origins of Christianity and introduces an 'ok' case, but not one that would blow me away. If the director had stuck to the facts and proceeded with them, this film would do well. At this point in the film, however, it breaks into a group of personally satisfying attacks on Mel Gibson's "Passion of the Christ" and a Christian private school, the director visited in his youth. In an interview with his old headmaster, who became aware during the year that the director had set himself up under false pretenses, I felt that the director was somehow childish. He asked good questions, but like the movie itself, the interview broke into an attack on the rules of this private school, not on Christianity. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are only interested in information. Look at the first 30 minutes and turn it off.
