A schizophrenic fled a New York mental hospital, and soon teachers at St. Trinity University are released. The new teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) has to deal with the confusion of red herrings. Despite a 78-minute run, this cheap-o-slasher keeps going until the lame end, when the person you suspect is the killer from the beginning, reveals himself as such. Director Richard Haines breaks into a sweaty stalk-n-slash staging, but brings the cruel impression that the audience of the early 80s probably coveted. For all of our amateur anthropologists, this was filmed in New Yawk in the early 1980s, so you can get to know all the cultures, beliefs and practices of living people from this faraway place. The movie gets recognition for releasing the "Final Girl". You rarely see that. Besides, it's always nice to see a horror movie in which a priest is the killer. Do not you trust the clergy, my beloved film industry? Luckily this is just a wrong priest and he gets caught. He is still working in the morally high basic angle.
