Usually I'm not the sort of horror movie fanatic, but this movie is the exception. how this movie got into my head !!! It's a very simple movie, but extremely effective at the same time, it has a great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments. Another was the family photo that I did not expect and I jumped out of my seat !!! I would recommend anyone to watch this movie. When the lights go out, he stays with you for a long time !!!!!
