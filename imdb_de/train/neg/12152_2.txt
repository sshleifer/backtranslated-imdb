Some reporters and their military escorts are trying to tell the truth about a zombie epidemic despite the "government controlling the media." The style of the film does not understand that the George Romero zombie films only worked because he subtly kept his politics in the background of most of his films ("Land of the Dead"). This satire is about as subtle as a brick in the face or a bullet in the head, which is more appropriate for this scenario. What is subversive or subtle when you see a military man masturbating to death and destruction? Is there anything differentiated by the different commercials blended with the movie? Nope. In addition, the spectacle is equally terrible, the characters quite unlikely and the plot crazy. Add it all and you have the worst, most incompetent zombie movie since "C.H.U.D. 2" has raised its hideous head. My degree: D
