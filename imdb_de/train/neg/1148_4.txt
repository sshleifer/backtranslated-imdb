Pedantic, over-long fabrication trying to record the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Starts quite promising with a still relevant probe in an aircraft explosion, but the melodrama between James Stewart and wife Vera Miles only disturbs (Miles had a habit of playing lukewarm women under duress, and her fringy nerves hit a schedule here). The esteemed director Mervyn LeRoy has taken on this adaptation of the book by Don Whitehead, but despite the talent involved, the picture makes no impression. The best performance is provided by Murray Hamilton as a partner of Stewart. However, most of the dialogue is ridiculous and the stubborn move makes the movie twice as long as it is. * 1/2 of ****
