When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical. Like "The Harvey Girls". It is not. It is a pudding that overcooked, hit the kitchen ceiling and was pushed off and cobbled together. No music and no historical piece, but unlikely. <br /> <br /> It begins with Patriarch James Woods, the eldest of his three daughters, a small child who becomes Barbara Stanwyck, says she must keep the surname and at home. <br /> <br /> We believe it will be a historic intergenerational story. And for a short time. Then it becomes the story of the cold-hearted Stanwyck fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead against him? Why else? As we learned in a strange flashback sequence told by Stanwyck, she once thought she might inherit some money (for her sisters and, of course, for herself) by marrying. She met someone she thought was a fool, who was actually lawyer Brent. <br /> <br /> So no one believes the child that they had, a young man of about eight at the time of the main plot Well, you know ... They had a premature marriage and in the very short time when they were together, he was conceived. One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young, played by Gig Young. The other sister tries to get him away. Etc .. <br /> <br /> It's a shrill, uncomplicated mess - good enough, but with no hint of logic or plausibility.
