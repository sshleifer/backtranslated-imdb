The plot, character development and gags in this movie are all extremely weak. Pretty much a waste of time. The conclusion of Saving Grace is meant to make you warm and fuzzy, as if the characters have grown through their struggles. There was no such development to allow such a warm, blurred feeling. The drug dumplings are cliched, and much of the film does not sound like life. The plot builds up tensions that are supposed to be suspenseful, but the characters are not sufficiently developed to handle it. Then it goes through a resolution of all outstanding issues in about a minute of screen time, and the viewer feels as if he has just lost his time.
