The title song for this movie ........... is the biggest free-spirited ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in 1978-79 when I subscribed to Kabel for the first time. In 1979, the cable just became an ordinary place in houses. (or at least at the time when it became common here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> This could be the first movie I saw on the pay channel called "The Movie Channel" - the "The Star Channel" At that time, they changed the name to "The Movie Channel" in the early eighties. I received a free month of "The Star Channel" with my new cable subscription. "The Van" was one of the films that turned on this time in this network strong. <br /> <br /> I remember watching that movie back then and thinking it was a typical teenage film (in the same direction) as other middle-budget teen movies ... those who did the plot revolves around nudity and parties. <br /> <br /> I totally forgot that this movie existed until I saw it recently, after not seeing it for decades (I found a DVD on DVD for sale in cheap garbage cans) and I realized She bought for only $ 4.99. <br /> <br /> Seems I thought this movie was a lot better than it is. However, it was a different experience to observe than now (30 years later). <br /> <br /> It was fun to see the kids listing Rock'n'Roll music, smoking grass and having a nice van in the back (often all at the same time). This is what a good teenage party movie should be. <br /> <br /> There's no big plot except for the fact that the main character fantasizes having sex with his arch rival, a good-looking girlfriend. All his college money will save you from a crappy Dodge Van (with split carpet walls to buy her mirrored blankets and a waterbed in it to get her attention, and he finally gets sex with her. But his archrival finds out and looks for him (so they can balance their differences by pulling their vans) ... he and his archrival in the end ruin both their vans and instead steal his girlfriend, an arch rival, conquers the heart of one neat (less attractive) girl, that he dates through most of the film and he decides that he is feeling better / he is doing better and the film is ending. <br /> <br /> The movie has funny moments. But if you look at this movie 30 years later, it is more like a journey into the past. Because I still remember pizza parlors and pinball arcades, it also brought back memories of cruising in a small town while we smoked pot like screaming at good-looking girls and hoping I lay down I'm watching me a girl to share a joint with me, and we then screwed us in the back seat. I also remember a lot of songs this turn (if they were new) ...... This movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era (brought back many memories) <br /> <br /> The one thing Honestly, I can not remember popular as this movie presents them as that. I remember this era very well, and I do not think about young men who want a van, but remember young men in their 70s (including themselves) who wanted a Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or a Hot Rod Ford Mustang, but never a van. This movie makes it seem like vans are the most popular items and every young man wanted one (which was just not the case at the time)
