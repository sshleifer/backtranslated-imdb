This movie looks like it was made for television. I've been waiting for years for a movie to be shot about Rubin Carter, because I loved seeing him in the old MSG box, and watching this movie was very disappointing. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Washington, but he was terrible and boring. There is really nothing good to say about this film unless I liked the song.
