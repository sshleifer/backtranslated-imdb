My roommate got the No-No-No-Nanette soundtrack as a dubbing tape and she listened to her without interruption. After it finally brainwashed me, I found the songs irresistible, especially the famous ones. I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... But from the soundtrack I had no idea what the movie was about. Recently I saw a copy of it in the video library and rented a supposedly long lost version of the film. I thought it would be awesome because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs I loved were nowhere to be found in the video I saw. Now I have never seen the version of the musical from 1930, but this version was unfortunately disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dancing. Other than that, the sound was consistently poor and you could not understand what people are saying. The only highlights of this film were really the outrageous fashion of the 1940s. Nanette wears this crazy beanie with two feathery ears that stick out like rabbit ears, and Kansas Kitty has that bizarre feather muff she holds on her forearm and then wraps herself into that netting. The one-dance sequence is also a bit weird when Nanette makes this weird ballet with pin-up girl pictures lying over her. Another bright spot in the film was the artist Guillespe, who dreams of being a good artist but is currently doomed to drawing pin-up girls for money. I like the way Guillespe keeps it in the old school and dissects Nanette when his masterpiece, the play that was to make his career, is sold by Nanette for only $ 5250. Does not she realize that this piece was his immortality? Silly rabbit / girl with her feather bunny ears on her hat. When will you learn? Why does not he just put in a cigarette before the advertisers take the work with them?
