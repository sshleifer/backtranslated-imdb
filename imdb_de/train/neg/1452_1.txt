This Germany from 1919 to 1933 hardly looks like a Czech capital after the Second World War. Oh, sorry, it's the Czech capital and it's funny in 2003. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most terrible history films in the near past. Rohm is a head taller than Adolf and looks so damn good, Goering looks like he's just 23 years old, and the "Leader" always looks like 56. Especially in 1919, many houses in Germany were almost new (the WWI does not reach German cities!). No crumbling plaster! Then the Reichstag building. There have never been gorges in the city around this building, never. And that sounds like a miracle to you: The Great Berlin Fire Department has many vehicles with engines in 1933, some even with turntable ladders, but no hand pump. <br /> <br /> Last thing: What kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this in the final sequence? For me it was a kind of "Adolf's adventure in Wonderland"
