I saw this movie, along with any other editing I could get my hands on - including games - to prepare for academic research. Cinematography is as moving as music. Unfortunately, the whole life was taken out of history. I have never seen such a horrible account of Mr. Rochester. All his most basic features have disappeared. Where is his joke? Where is his passion? Scott's Rochester resembles more of the Rochester slide St.John than the character of the novel. In fact, the actor who played St.John in this adaptation played a passionate St.John while Scott agreed to smash things or just stare at the ceiling (which he does constantly). I have no idea what they think. I would like to give this movie a slightly higher voice based on the wonderful music and cinematography, but I can not bear to see this movie too long because of the performance of George C. Scott.
