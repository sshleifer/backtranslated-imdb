If you liked the Grinch movie, check it out again, because this was not such a good Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character that has "graced" the screen lately. His voice / accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with a terrible wail, which is the only laugh I heard in the theater. Not even the kids liked this one, and kids are laughing at something now. Save your money and watch Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a funny family movie.
