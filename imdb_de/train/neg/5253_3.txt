The name (woman) of the main character is the German word for "woman". I do not know if that was intended or not, but if you got giggles from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year, when it was shown, these were the only giggles the movie got. Not that it was a giggle, it's a horrible movie for God's sake! A horrible movie in more than one meaning. It's a shame that such a premise was wasted on the viewer with terrible, even unbearable moments (definitely not for the fainting heart !!)! It was not even necessary to show all the things shown. I do not even go into a moral obligation (because films do not really have this task or function), which is shown here, but this is a new low of the "torture movement" that has grown in the US in the last few years!
