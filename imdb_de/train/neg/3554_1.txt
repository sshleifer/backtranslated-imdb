I rented it in the 80s and honestly can not remember anything, just what the movie is that I've ever seen. This is not one of those "it was so bad, it was funny". This is not one of these "it was so bloody, it leaves a bad feeling" movies. It was not even one of those "What the hell was that?" Movies. I can not remember the actor's performance, but it was filmed badly, the story was incoherent and had no definable style. When it was over, I was annoyed that I was wasting time. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies that I could not understand because of unknown cultures, styles and / or stories, but it was clear that these films had some of these qualities. The incubus has none. <br /> <br /> I did not really think about commenting on this "piece" because I'm afraid someone might watch it out of curiosity, but I'm forced to warn anyone who appreciates film to skip this movie ,
