At some point I do not understand what the directors think when they make a movie ... After seeing Welcome (2007), I had a trauma and thought that they would not do it again. But after many great promos, Tashan finally ended up with a heart attack. <br /> <br /> So amazing 3 songs in the promo - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what do you get in the movie? Zero story, predictable storyline, lots of Akshay Kumar stunts and nothing but watching Kareena after her big weight loss ... Musically another big disaster ... in the music album, they've spent time making pathetic little dialogues with these 4 jokers and they did not think to give the background song of the scenes when Akshay does Kumar stunts ...! the song is so beautiful, quite similar to Tashan Mein and that is not recorded in the music album !!! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, I would say, look at this background song, which is something like ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> <br /> Overall, very disappointed with the The way Bhaiyyaji tried to speak bad English! <br /> <br /> Go away, man, I gotta puke!
