This was a movie about infidelity and revenge. A twin with the "twin connection" realizes that something is wrong with her sister. This movie took forever to set the plot. An action that has been done many times. The acting was for the most part bad. As soon as the plot comes together, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins living with an abusive father. The father seems to favor Ashley, so Laura gets the blame for everything. It is promised that the girls would never be separated, but when they grow up, their lives run in different directions. Ashley gets a job at a diner where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course, nothing good can come of that. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a bad excuse to find him. I've always been waiting for this movie to get better and be a resolution somewhere, but it never happened.
