Much like the early horror movie The Boogens, the insidious killer is a real flop when it is finally seen. Although Stephen Furst of Animal House obviously enjoyed the role as a product of incest, his performance is more comedy than horror. The extremely tired plot has three sexy women (Bach, Lamb and Lois Young) can not find a hotel for the evening, so they like to accept a seemingly friendly museum curator, who is exceptionally played by the late Sydney Lassick. If you've ever seen a horror movie, you know that lovely IL 'Sydney is a crazy psycho, so you know what's going to happen to the pretty ladies. <br /> <br /> The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young (a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one who walks naked while Sydney watches her take a bath.
