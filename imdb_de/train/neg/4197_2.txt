Unbelievably bad spectacle, a not good, unclear story and flashy pictures and slow motion in which they are least needed: adrenaline is everything a movie should not be. Georgina Verbaan (so and so Dutch soap actress, who has not attended her English lessons) plays the rich girl Freya, who has the habit of looking for "thrills". What makes dangerous stunts, breaking things and annoying people. And not in a funny way. Then there is Dracko (Rivas). He leads the series, but also has other illegal activities. Then there is Freya's father (Lockyer), who also plays a dubious role. And in the end we have Jason (debutant Fyall), the friend of Freya. <br/> <br/> One day, Freya disappears and everyone seems to be involved, but to us, the viewer, it is not important to anyone. The cast is either sympathetic or believable and the story makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Why was this even done? 10.2.
