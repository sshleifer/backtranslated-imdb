SNL is pretty funny, but the people who say this is a short sketch on SNL are a bit stupid. It's NOTHING like SNL, it's just a stupid bitch. Andy Samberg tries to behave like Jon Heder, but fails. Although Jon Heder is just funny in Napoleon Dynamite, Andy tries his best and people think he is funny. <br /> <br /> Just funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was reasonably funny with Andy was the pool section. <br /> <br /> You could have done the "quiet place" much better if you had not driven the falling scene in 3 minutes. > <br /> The part in which he pronounces his H's more has lagged behind. They try too long and half the time Andy laughs while he's playing ... he's a terrible actor and does not deserve to be in a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a movie joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year comedy level. Which is about half of the United States.
