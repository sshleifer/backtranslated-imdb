Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to play in this movie and had to play a Part-Mexican, otherwise he would have been banned. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Presumably, following the success of "Dodge City," Warners attempted a follow-up with Errol Flynn and his usual buddy list, such as Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh, and the ubiquitous John Litel. They made the big mistake when they tried to call Miriam Hopkins a love interest for Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer to make things really bad, because she has proved one thing and she can not sing. The story was not so bad, but with Bogie it was clearly an abuse, and it turned out to be a poor western country that was overly long and had a low budget. But fairness would not have helped color.
