Like "First Blood", this one tries to find a point regarding the treatment of Vietnam veterinarians, but between the monotonous gunfire, burns, punctures, torture and explosions there is really not much time for it, as Rambo takes half a ton from Asia Vietnamese soldiers, most of the Russian army, various vehicles and everything else to which he can direct a rocket launcher. The only woman in the midst of all these boy toys will soon be shed, causing testosterone to reach dangerous levels and degenerate the script into a series of loud noises. Jerry Goldsmith, who provides some crazy musical clues, carefully examines all clich√© themes from the Russian Rat-a-Tat to the Chinese Ching-chang-chong just in case we do not exactly understand who we are looking at. Stallone has a brain in his head; This empty nonsense is under him.
