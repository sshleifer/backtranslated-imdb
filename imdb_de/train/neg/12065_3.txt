When I was a kid and lived with my sister, she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them. VCR'S had just become a household item, and we had no more than 150 films, and we watched hell out of everyone. <br /> <br /> I was recently at a yard sale and saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy every horror movie I do not have and I knew this movie seemed familiar to me. I thought for a moment and realized that my sister had bought her. She had sold it in a flea market years ago, and I suspect who knows. <br /> <br /> I did not remember anything and I saw it the night I bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes. I'm not sure how I felt as a kid, but I'm sure it was fun because it was new to me and I would watch and enjoy everything. <br /> <br /> I'm a horror freak. but there are certain requirements to call it "good" and this was very short. It was one of those conversations and bored me to deaths. What death scenes you see is done with the shadow on the wall and subsequent blood spatter. If you are lucky, you get so much. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I've seen some with similar depictions I think this should be buried and forgotten. Do not look at these people unless you are tough.
