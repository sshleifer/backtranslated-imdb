At first glance, this movie has everything a psycho wants: a vampire story with a restriction of "not under 18" filled with violent violence, drugs, blood, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatical zealots and even a gay necrophile policeman ! But then, this movie is a consequence of bad history (so thin), bad acting - with a ridiculous English accent that makes you think you're seeing a bad Monty Python - bad music (80's hard rock), the movies are awful, the end is a shame ... Besides, the sex scenes are ridiculous, the gore not very impressive. And these vampires are reflected in a mirror and do not even fear the light of day! You will be very disappointed unless you see it as "Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope Bloodlust will one day reach the 100 mark, because that's the place. <br /> <br /> I would say that having friends and enough beer is still fun to watch. <br /> <br /> 3/10
