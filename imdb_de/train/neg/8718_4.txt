The third part of the "Carnosaur" trilogy contains a series of Keystone-Kops quality military commands that attempt to kill two Velociraptors and one T-Rex. I give him a 4 of pure compassion and my predilection for dinosaurs. The movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy and can not really be taken seriously. More importantly, though, I can see some interesting parallels between the "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" trilogies when watching this movie. The first part of both franchises is a dark, disturbing film that has become a cult classic, the second is an "alien" rip-off and the third is an ironic, almost slapstick (whether intended or not) that did this roll on the floor and laugh. Like the "Xtro" franchise, all "Carnosaur" films are completely independent of each other. They only carry the franchise name to awaken interest in the "sequels", I think. Of course, "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different production groups at work, but if you've seen all three films of both franchise films, you'll switch back and forth between the two.
