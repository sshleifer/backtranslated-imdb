I'm serious. This will not help the Australian film industry make this kind of film without any values. Okay, if you're a stoner and have nothing better to do, then maybe. I think filmmakers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have and this is not the vehicle for it. Come on, this movie is just cheesy.
