The story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. Begins with an opening scene that is a great example of absurd comedy. A formal orchestra audience is transformed into a mad, violent mob by the crazy songs of its singers. Unfortunately, the WHOLE time is absurd without a general narrative ultimately leading to it being too devious. Also those from this time should be switched off. The cryptic dialogue would make Shakespeare appear easy to a third student. On a technical level, it is better than you might think, with some good films of the future great Vilmos Zsigmond. The future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest are briefly to see.
