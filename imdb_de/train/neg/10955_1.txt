This is the story of two guys who found a copy of 'Funky Monkey'. This seemed strange at the time he found out that there are still billboards for the film in the local Cineplex Odeon. After seeing classics like "Every Which Way But Loose" and "Project X", the two boys found out that movies with monkeys are fantastic. <br /> <br /> These guys had a long drive when they saw this movie. There was a monkey replaced by a stunt MAN when action sequences were required. It was obvious that the monkey was not trained in the school of Shakespeare drama. Maybe the monkey would have been replaced by Ben Affleck, which might have thought the boys. <br /> <br /> Maybe a big buddy like Jackie Chan or even Hulk Hogan would help. Fortunately, this movie had an amazing martial artist and a Jet Li-like Matthew Modine. While some believe that Matthew Modine does not come close to Jet Li, Kameratricks proves he is just as good. When it becomes apparent that an inexperienced chimpanzee can not handle the film, the film leans on Matthew Modine to be the real star. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there is a dorky kid who connects to Modine and the monkey? Is there any way that the child learns self-confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie? Even Matthew Modine should get jealous (because the pick-up line "I'm the second fiddle for a monkey" in the ladies does not work.) Shortly after watching the movie The two boys got a call from Matthew Modine and told them "Seven days. "
