First, be warned that I saw this movie on TV and with English dubbing - which may have completely ruined the atmosphere. However, I rate what I have seen and hope that people will distract from this version. I found this movie painfully boring. The entire movie atmosphere is lost in the synchronization and leaves behind the slow frustration of a Stalker movie. I'm sorry, but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow, except when the movie is about philosophy. I have not seen any deep philosophical meaning in this film. Maybe I missed something, but I have to say it the way I see it. I rated it as "1". What can I say, maybe US-oriented taste.
