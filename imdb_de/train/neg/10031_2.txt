I just saw the movie in the theater. The film has very few good points to talk about. Kareena's beauty and a few songs may be. That's it. The film is a disappointment in all areas. Anyone involved with the film will be disappointed, including the Mumbai Indians (Chennai have made it to the semifinals). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I feel about the movie is the action scenes. Today Bollywood tries to copy action scenes from Hollywood. They forget, however, that Hollywood directors do a lot to make it look real. Unfortunately, Bollywood directors do not have that much time. They spend their time with songs and advertising for the film. Now, such too stupid action scenes in South Korea can work, as the audience pays for its favorite actor to kill a lot of people. But in Bollywood this will not work. All the action scenes I wish I could have relayed. In the end, even some Chinese people emerge from nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar. That's the height of stupidity. The audience does not pay to see such stupidity. I think Bollywood should forget the action movies now. They can not do it. The last good action I saw was from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me. Do these people see their film after completion? Can not you find out that the slow motion action (done with ropes) is too unrealistic and too childish? Better no action scenes, if you can not handle it. I just want to go back to Amitabh's era, where movies like Zanjeer and Deewar had exciting action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective at the time, but visually it is much better than the current epochs. <br /> <br /> This film should now open the eyes of the Bollywood directors. Please do not make any more action films until you have mastered the art of making it happen.
