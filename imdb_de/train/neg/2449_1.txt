Bashki was to be congratulated for having tried to turn one of the great works of English fiction into a film, and then stupidly beaten for that attempt. The animation was bad, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was overwhelming and the movie was a bitter blast through the first book and half of Tolkien's masterpiece. I can still remember my sheer disappointment and farewell to the movie when I saw it for the first time. Now, I find that any attempt to turn a book into a movie fails in many ways, simply because of the medium, but regardless of the source of the story, this movie is just pathetic. Bashki can do much more.
