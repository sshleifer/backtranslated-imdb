Now to the truth, the very weak plot - for a Walt Disney movie the total garbage. When the Robinson appeared, the movies were everywhere, I was shocked at how bad it was. It went like "Alice in Wonderland" gone wrong! It feels as if they lacked ideas that put together some crazy waste to try to get away with - and they do not. After that, I sat there and wished for the end. My younger brother lost interest halfway and was puzzled by the story. The characters are weak and after the Robinsons show up, you do not care about the end, you just want the movie to end. It's a forgettable movie and quickly forgotten. If you have some spare time, do not waste it on it.
