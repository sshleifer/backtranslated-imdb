The movie starts with some scrolling text that lasts almost five minutes. There is a basic summary of the processes. This could have been made easy with the actors, instead you get a scroll effect. Shortly after being bombarded with characters about whom you learn something, remember that this is all you will learn about it. The action begins to separate from the ground and then crashes through the entire movie. Not only does the storyline change, you may even wonder if you are watching the same movie. I have never played the video game, but I know people who did it. In my understanding of whether you played the game or not, this movie does not get any better. Save your money if you do not want to sleep in the theater.
