This version is probably available on DVD in your local Dollar Store. The pressure is not great, not even the sound, but if you have 1.00 â‚¬ and 90 minutes left, you will get your money's worth (which does not mean much). Anna Neagle is extremely blurry as Nanette. Whatever their charm may have been, they are not seen in this movie. There are many good character actors in this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material remains remarkably behind their talents. Still, it's interesting to see how such accomplished artists make the best use of weak writing. The musical numbers (there are really only two) are pretty awful. Obviously, the studio did not feel compelled to benefit from the rich musicality of the original "No, No, Nanette". For what it's worth, the DVD can be obtained for $ 1.00. It's worth saying that you saw it.
