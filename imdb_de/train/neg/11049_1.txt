If Mr. Cranky had rated that, I would be tempted to just copy his review and paste it here. But as he does not, I have to try it myself. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's acting is outstanding. But not even he can save this movie from catastrophe. The director was really distracted at his work because it was just a collection of scenes thrown together with little continuity - reminiscent of bad 70s movies. Worse, both the actors and the director seemed to be there, which was probably the bad script. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth discussing the story, even though it's a futuristic affair The company called the Proxate Corporation, which assembled a crew of superfluous people, around dangerous cargo on an old one Container / slave ship to Nigeria to transport. The ship's computer is a baby stored in a glass jar and connected to a crew via USB 12 or so. The company should be named Prostate Corporation because the entertainment value of this film is equivalent to a research with the same name. <br /> <br /> I honestly can not find a scene that I could describe as good and really made sense in the context of the movie. I only saw it to the end when I had the bird flu and this movie reminded me there were people out there who actually felt worse than me - especially Malcolm McDowall. I'm not going to take that against him, because he's a great actor, and every great actor is entitled to a bad movie in his career, and this movie is a trifle. <br /> <br /> So, if this is not the only film available to you If you're renting a business or you're a man and your doctor is not doing prostate checks this week and you feel like this is one bad thing, then give that one a big berth, unless, if you're really focused on community, buy a copy to support Malcolm, and then use as a coaster.
