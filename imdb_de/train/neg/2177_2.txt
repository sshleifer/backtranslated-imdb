The first noticeable problem with this unfavorably named movie is the casting. Ann Nelson plays grandma here. Three years later she played in "Airplane!" as the woman who hangs herself while listening to Robert Hays Pine for Julie Hagerty. I could not get this picture out of my head. <br /> <br /> Matt Boston is a fifteen year old man with problems. He has a headache. His mother had a nervous breakdown. His grandfather had a serious heart attack. A chain-smoking psychiate decides to find out what the hell is going on with this family. First, she mesmerizes Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells a story in a flashback that fills the entire first half of the movie. <br /> <br /> She and Grandpa bought an RV (cheap) and drove to all the tourist traps in the California desert. The motorhome will soon have its own mind, go from the road and so on. Then big boulders fall on it. The elderly couple is accordingly afraid, but remains in the vehicle to postpone the plan. <br /> <br /> After all, Grandpa has a heart attack after being stranded on the motorhome's roof if he makes another unplanned ride. <br /> <br /> Boston's mother talks to some of the Native American mummy she has lying around the house. She wants to introduce herself as a writer and makes ample notes about the musty corpses. The psychiatrist reads the detailed notes and fills in the gaps with the help of her imagination. We see the mother half-turn, but her mental breakdown is off-screen, much like Gramps's heart attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, the patient patient, the little Matt. Matt goes under the hypnotic weapon and tells his own story. He thinks Mom is shaking (this was done in 1977). Apparently, Mama lets the astral bodies of Native American mummies fly through the air. You meet Matt like a bee on a windshield and Matt starts to look crazy. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist brings grandma and Matt to the desert. Matt is inexplicably in a wheelchair, and the trio faces the invisible (and unexplained) forces. <br /> <br /> Flocker has no sense of scene building. One is a campervan stranded in a desert of salt in the desert. In the distance, the couple noticed some boulders rolling on the camper. This is a pretty scary little scene that eventually gets dubbed. As the boulders begin to spin toward the vehicle, the special effects become apparent. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which the motorhome leaves the motorway continue again and last forever. The scenes in which grandfather is trapped on the roof of an RV while driving on a dirt road will last forever. Mama's conversations with Mom last forever. Matt's out-of-body experiences last forever. This movie takes forever. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to press the fast-forward at least a dozen times. As the scenes dragged on, it was obvious that Flocker was paddling. Cut off the grease here, and this would have taken an hour. The last "explanation" that the ghosts of mummies tried to kill those near Matt never holds water. Did you live in the camper? The filmmaker never draws attention to the fact that the spirits are not good in their murderous way, they do not kill anyone! <br /> <br /> When I was in "Airplane!" Constantly thinking of Nelson, I thought of other films as well. Anything that keeps me from falling asleep while this one is here. Boston is awful like the kid. He plays a fifteen-year-old cute 10-year-old man who has a clever Alecky line for all those adults who attack and love themselves. <br /> In the end, Flocker wrote and caused a mess. The title is just the beginning of this exercise to make the audience uncomfortable. This is not scary, and like the ghosts you can still run away from this band in the video store. <br /> <br /> This is not rated and includes physical violence and easy profanity.
