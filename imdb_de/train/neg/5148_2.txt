There is a lot wrong with this image, starting with a script that is both obvious and redundant. Courtney Cox plays a cartoonist who flees to a small desert town after being raped twice in the city. She is immediately followed by a local who appears rather unappetizing (Craig Sheffer) and who tries to attempt an imitation of Mickey Rourke in third grade. D.B. Sweeny is a local policeman who is said to be there to protect and serve. Meanwhile, the script manipulates the audience, who really is the good guy? Logic jumps out of the window after the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than it should be. If you think "Blue Desert" could be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. His role as well as the entire film is insignificant. - MERK
