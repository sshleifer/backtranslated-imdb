As a graduate of film school, it seems to me that the New Zealand film has reached new heights in new times, the general public seems to think every New Zealand movie is great. Siones Wedding proves that this is absolutely wrong. <br /> <br /> It's totally overrated and not funny, and far from the "weird" movie other IMDb users commented on. The only really funny thing I found in this movie was Derek, the wannabe black guy, but otherwise the jokes were recycled crap we had all heard before. <br /> <br /> I am semi-Samoan decent, I wanted to see how the film would deal with the Polynesian representation. It was a total slip-up - I know it's an alleged comedy, but I did not feel the characters had anything new to say about Polynesian identity, even if it was a humorous way. I was most disappointed with the end of the movie and the breakdown of the character's relationship. Mikaele was the player who only played around with white women. He turns away easily when the 'Dusky Maiden' comes to town, an epiphany Maybe he should look for a stable relationship he refuses at the last minute and accepts his position as a Polynesian playboy for Palagi women. I did not understand why they did that. All in all it was very disappointing. My entire family saw that it was a good laugh, but in the end, it was very fierce to pay for it to be seen in the cinema. The jokes are lame at best, the acting, especially from Sefa's girlfriend, APPALLING, and frankly I would have been happy if I had gotten hold of one of those pirated copies of the film to save me the price of $ 15 / > <br /> I think the only good thing about the movie is that it's the second step (behind No. 2, of course, a far superior movie to this film) in the birth of Polynesian cinema. I hope that in the future, Pacific filmmakers can learn from Siones wedding how they can NOT reflect Polynesia and say something more meaningful and meaningful. Even if it is made comedic.
