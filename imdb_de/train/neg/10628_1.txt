This so-called "documentary" tries to say that the US has faked the moon landing. Years Right. <br /> <br /> All who have actually studied the case know otherwise. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is definitely evidence. When the astronauts were on the moon, they brought MANY pounds of rock from the moon - for geological investigations. These were distributed around the world to hundreds of labs that tested them. They all came to the conclusion that they came from the same planet, not from Earth: because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those on Earth, but are similar to those on the Moon. I.U. The conspiracy theorists never study anything: they only absorb what fits in with their theory and ignore the rest. <br /> <br /> Another false statement from them is that it was wind in the hangar where they landed the moon have shot. IE the flag moves There is a logical explanation: The astronaut moved it with his hand, so it moved. And what does this prove? Well, if the conspiracy theorists studied the footage at all, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut has allowed it. the conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they can not study a topic properly or just study it until they get what they came for, so that they can lie about it and make a profit (ie this so-called "documentary"). <br /> <br /> There is an assertion that it is not possible to be shot on the moon because all the shadows come from different places because there are different light sources, the artificial lighting from the studio. Once again the conspiracy theorists are (as usual) wrong, the same would happen at night in a desert without light sources. But I doubt that any conspiracy theorists would ever be outside their grandmother's basement for longer than the days a Star Trek gathering is held. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy theorists deny BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. They make all these lies look important - that's a fact.
