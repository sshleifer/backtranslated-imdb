That was not a really good movie. There were many implausible and predictable things that happened in the course of the movie ... but I think most reviewers miss the point of why this movie should appeal to a wider audience. THIS FILM WAS MADE BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Is not that enough to inspire all of us to watch this movie? You know, a movie by a former NBA star does not come with me every day. Pretty stupid kids in a big house being cut up by an ax with psycho. Every clich√© trotted for us to groan. Teen sex. And everything was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can not say enough about this movie! Teen drug use! College Hijinx! And everything was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
