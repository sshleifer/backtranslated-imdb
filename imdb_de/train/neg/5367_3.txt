I have seen every episode of this spin-off. I thought the first season was a decent effort, given the expectations of such a success, the Gray's Anatomy. So I kept watching. I'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, the chemistry and above all the drama of its predecessor Gray's Anatomy. The relationships seem skillful and the acting is so-so. The letter lacks the intelligent and comedic clues seen in GA. It turns out that a formula does not feel formulaic and invented, unfortunately PP is not. I loved the presence of Kate Walsh in GA. I'm afraid the life of Kate Walsh in LA is simply not interesting.
