A look at the sets, the staging and the editing make it clear that this project did not have an adequate budget available. Maybe Bela Lugosi should distract you from such things. Young brides fall dead on the altar after saying "I do". Their corpses are being discovered by a renowned gardener. Lorenz (Lugosi) and a few of his crazy minions stole when his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) needs injections of young virgin's glandular fluids to stay young forever ... forever beautiful. An eager local reporter (Luana Walters) realizes that every missing bride wore the same rare orchid on the altar; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz knew best. A typical horror film storm brews a visit and makes the Lorenz estate a bit scary. especially with a dwarf and a drooling hunchback on the grounds. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
