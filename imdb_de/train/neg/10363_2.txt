I grew up with the intertwined stories of Wrinkle in Time Chronicles. My dream was that one day a scriptwriter would meet his kid sitting on a big sofa and read A Winkle in Time and thought what an amazing movie this would do. Unfortunately, this screenwriter failed, changed characters, thrown lame humor and destroyed the whole action. I know that turning a popular novel into a movie is a difficult task. But why can not you be true to the book? Why do you have to change the way the characters think and act? For those of you who have not read the book, pick it up, find a soft couch and let your imagination run wild.
