Defy every clich√© and misrepresentation you've heard about half-devout Mormons, and you'll see that they've all starred in a ridiculous apology for a movie. Eventually, Kurt Hale's fortune has changed (luckily), and hopefully it'll be a while before we can see any of his features in the cinemas (the basketball scenes). The plot was limp and very unsteady. You really did not understand why someone did something. It was like having sand in my eyes and a 300 pound woman was sitting on my face, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not rate this movie negatively was because The Libra does not let me.
