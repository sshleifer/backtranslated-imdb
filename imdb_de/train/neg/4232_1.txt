Karl Jr and his father now lead an army on a remote island. They catch a trio of guys stumbling across the island. Whom to beat back after a while. (Well, the survivors) It has blood, blood, and bloodshed all the time, which would have been fine if any of it looked remotely real or if the production did not look like it had been made with a week's salvaged lunch money (I could It was probably only worth a few days). The dreadful synchronization did not bother me so much, and I suspect that if I was really drunk, some of it might have been a bit humorous ... maybe. But as it is, the movie felt too long after only 78 minutes ... Oh, I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> My Rating: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Bonus Feature: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence"; and trailer for other Shock-o-Rama movies
