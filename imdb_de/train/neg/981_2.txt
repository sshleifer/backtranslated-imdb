As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I finally had to see this very boring picture. It is Miss Dietrich's first color film, and the most beautiful blonde in the world is a redhead! Bad Start The story is a monstrous boredom that includes a topic that bores me boringly: religious guilt. (Who needs it ???) It may be enough to say that of all Dietrich's films (and I have seen most, including "Pittsburgh") this is the only one in which even their performance is barely noticeable. The color photography is fine (this is a very early Technicolor version), but for no purpose. Ridiculous casting: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough said?). The only thing that's interesting at all is John Carradine's foreign caricature of a performance as "The Sand Diviner" that predicts everything. The supposed "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever thought. Yet another example of David O. Selznick's bloated reputation (has he ever made a really good movie - except That One?). And as a last nuisance, the soundtrack of the MGM DVD is a mess with seemingly loud volume random. Very un-recommendable.
