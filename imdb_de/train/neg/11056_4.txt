I was so disappointed in this movie. I do not know much about the true story, so I really wanted to see her play in the movie and educate me about a little piece of history. With such a powerful, true story and great actors, it seemed like a combination of deadly fire. Well, somewhere the script failed. It was so distracted - is this movie about his childhood? his love life? his own disability? his speaking ability? his passion for the disabled? I'm sure there's a way to integrate all these things into a good story, but this movie was not. I stayed cold, watching characters unlikely because of their disability but because of their personality. Other small handles: 1. The powerful soundtrack. It's the seventies - WE'VE ALREADY GET THERE! 2. If he's such a phenomenal public speaker, why were we no longer treated here and there as a clipping - and even then mostly in montages?
