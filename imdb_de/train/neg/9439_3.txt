Twist ends can be really cool in a movie. It's especially interesting when the phrase is right in front of our eyes, but we just do not care. These types of twist ends are the ones that make people think. Then we have twists like this movie. Do it, no matter if you pay attention or not, you have no idea what's going to happen. When they reveal this kind of random turn of events, this is somewhat baffled instead of a shock. This film starts off as if it's going to be an interesting setting for horror, but after about 20 minutes, it's nothing more than a boring dialogue and a stupid twist. Three young women go to a concert, so they get lost in the woods and hit a tree trunk. They land at an old scary woman who hates men, and are greeted by their homely daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange things happen because these girls stay in this house for several days instead of trying to go home or go home, and the tension becomes a stupid slasher. <br /> <br /> and it is always between just a few characters. We have the three main girls, the scary spinner and the old lady, and conversations of importance do not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. It's pretty crazy to sit through their conversations. We want to know what's going on and instead talk and talk and talk (about nothing). <br /> <br /> Plot holes are abundant here. The house where these girls are staying in their car accident is apparently three miles from somewhere ... wow, three miles! A walk of two hours or less will kill her. Why did not they come with the worker for this household who went to town? Did he have a single-seater? How is it that these girls never question and just volunteer and rarely check each other? Why did it have to have so many dumb twists? Maybe the answers are in the boring script. <br /> <br /> Having a Slasher movie with five characters is really a bad idea. It's not exciting, it's not scary and the end is definitely out there, but undoubtedly stupid. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 79 min. R for nudity and violence.
