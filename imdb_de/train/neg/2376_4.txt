George Brent is a reporter who is supposed to interview an heiress. She is allegedly the heiress of a good luck cream. He interviews her on her yacht. They fall in bath costumes on each other. <br /> <br /> It turns out (rather early) that she is not an heir. It is part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the ups and downs of its romance. <br /> <br /> The supportive occupation does not contribute much. Davis and Brent carry the picture. Although it's pretty predictable, it's also pretty entertaining. It is far from its best. But considering her darkness in her work, it's not one of her worst.
