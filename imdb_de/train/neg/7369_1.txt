I had the feeling that it would not be better after "Submerged" ... I was right. He has to look for champagne money and not worry about the final product ... His voice is repeatedly called by a stranger who does not sound like him; The editing is - well - just a step above amateurish. It's nothing more than a B- or C-class movie with just enough money to hire a few talented cameramen and an "OK" designer. <br /> <br /> As the previous poster said, the problems seem to appear in the post-production (... voice-dubbing etc.) Too bad, because the plot is actually OK for a SG-strip. <br /> <br /> I will never rent another SG strip unless he sends me an email asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I miss Kelly LeBrock ... <br /> <br /> - Jimbo
