(Spoilers galore) This is an absolutely horrible movie. First and foremost, he has this type of medium. I suppose he made a career playing super dads. It was alright when he tried for the first time to frighten his son by pretending to be a monster ... but then, 10 minutes later, they did it again! And so it goes, this movie is moving in agonizing real time. At some point I began to take pictures that it was days later, until I was reminded that the story was only the next day ... in the early afternoon! I'm not really sure who this couple should be in real life. At first, they are presented as a kind of Manhattan-Yuppie couple, who grew up and had a child. But they drive an old blue Volvo. These guys stopped Volvos decades ago. Today they drive Priuses. But I'm sure they did not drive Volvos in 2002. <br /> <br /> OK, then Wendigo. A "mysterious Indian" gives the boy a small magic wendigo statue and tells him about his powerful magic. Come on ... let's do old Indian mysteries. To drive home, they wave over every Indian statue in their tourist trap in New York City. Indians are portrayed in a way that has not been seen in this film for decades! Oh, and about Wendigo. He is not really the cause of the horror. He does not kill the child's dad, which is the worst thing in the movie ... he was just killed by an ordinary hack of resentment and a high-powered rifle. The Wendigo comes out late in the movie to avenge the guy who killed the father ... oh, but it used to seem that Wendigo was kind of mad at the dad, maybe because he killed a deer ... So then Wendigo I must have been happy that the father was killed ... but ... <br /> <br /> And so it goes ... offensive, boring and nonsensical. There is no reason to even watch this movie.
