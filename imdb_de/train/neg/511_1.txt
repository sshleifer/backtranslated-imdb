I was one of many extras in this big bomb. I was just in the right place for the racing scenes of A.I.R. to protect. as was known then. Thanks, my scene was in the first minutes of the movie and I do not have to go through the whole thing. It was more of a big party than a movie set, but hey, the pay was good. The attention to detail was not a strong point for this, but who would know it really slow speed and then accelerated in the movie on what was close to the normal speed. Many scenes were changed when they were filmed. I guess, cost and time to save.
