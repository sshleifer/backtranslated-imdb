On the poster reads: "At birth he had 6 years to live ... At age 34, he undertakes the journey of his life." Ami is an American-born Israeli who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at the age of one. At the age of 34, after the love of his 22-year-old carer did not fare well, he decided to come to the US to see the doctor who said he would only live 6 years. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive and weighs 39 pounds. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, even I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's brave to live if he can only move his left index finger, but why does he have so much trouble with the doctor Who diagnosed his illness 34 years ago? His doctor just told his mother that people with his illness will not live long because of the medical history. Why does he come to the door of the old doctor? Why is it a journey of his life to track down this old doctor in the US? There are so many things that could interest us in Ami's life: how can he do those animations with the movement of a finger? How can he go through daily life while completely dependent on others? How did he live his doctor's prognosis? How does he emotionally handle when other people look at him as if they are looking at a strange creature? The movie did not tell us about it. Instead, the filmmaker picked up a van and set off to show Ami at his old doctor's door to show him he was still alive. I thought that was a joke.
