If you like to be entertained, do not watch this movie. If you want to see exploits of war, do not watch this movie. If you want to see good acting and a great script, do not watch this movie. If you like typical Hollywood war movies that end just in time to give the public a politically charged appeal to the size and fame of the war, then head to this movie. Otherwise you will not waste time. I am always interested in war films because I think that if they are done well, they can teach us about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war. This film shows a group of boys traveling in the countryside, saying what clich√© advice they say, doing the most predictable things and defending the oppressed with the same power and brutality given to the oppressed. This movie is a shame for filmmaking and for the United States of America! Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa or any other country and watching this when you are told that Americans are really like that? No wonder everyone hates us! Please, please, please, please do not waste your time with this piece of garbage. if you have to, wait and rent it. 4.10
