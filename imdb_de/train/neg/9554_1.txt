This is the worst, and I mean, the worst computer-based movie I've ever seen. The whole plot is absolutely unconvincing and full of stupidity. <br /> <br /> I mean ... <br /> <br /> The guy in this movie can actually talk to the computer as a real person. Now you probably think that this must be a super cool hi-tech computer, but it does that with other very bad and weak computers that do not even have a graphical user interface. <br /> <br /> and The main idea of ​​how to overload the "super" computer by connecting it to the internet via computer games is really stupid. My phone will turn off the lights to save energy, but apparently this ingenious computer can not decide whether to use its resources to handle security threats of national security or to load computer games, but I just do not have time for this. <br /> <br /> I just can not believe that someone could record a movie stupidly
