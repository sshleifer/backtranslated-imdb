Well, what can I say. <br /> <br /> "What the Bleep do we know" has made the almost impossible possible by leaving masterpieces of the genre like "The Postman", "The Dungeon Master", "Merlin" and so forth it's the worst movie I've ever seen in its entirety, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is indeed impressive, because I have seen many bad movies. <br /> <br / > This masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts that switch between a stupid and fictional plot about an extremely annoying action. A photographer abandoned by her husband who was forced to take antidepressants to survive, and a few talking heads Talk about how quantum physics is supposed to justify their pseudo-philosophy of the new Aggie Basically, this movie is for you when you start your day meditating to people like Enya and Kenny G. If You have a sense of humor, a lot of people who know how to have fun, and a decent helping of good weeds, then this movie is for you too. Otherwise stay away. Take my word for it. <br /> <br /> The first thing that impressed me about "What the Bleep do you know" is that it looked like it had been edited and assembled by the same people to shoot at the cheap weddings camera complete with pink heart effects, computer-generated twinkling on the screen, and other gritty stupidities. Anyone who lets these people close to a theatrical release is a mystery to me. I think that's what Kenny G does to you too much. The film was steeped in cheesy GCI that you or I can produce on our own computer using over-the-counter video editing software, but it would never be so, because it's just too ridiculous. The script was obviously written by someone who has no writing experience. All the characters and conversations were not only unmanageable and unbelievably unbelievable, but the "writers" felt they had to push any relevant information, or rather disinformation, about which this movie is about your throat. Well, considering the target audience, maybe that was not a bad idea. For example, the main character spends half of the movie pills. Apparently, however, it was considered inconclusive enough that there are a few dialogues in all areas that specifically pertain to their anti-anxiety pills just in case the onlookers are unable to overreact their overreacted ones Pain and her grief to associate little white pills she takes when she feels bad. Acting ... Well, I've seen better plays in Ed Wood films, and no, that's no exaggeration. Heck, the little bit I was in when I was 12 was a lot more inspiring than this. It really did. <br /> <br /> The story is interrupted here and there, with a bunch or random talking heads, a curious mix of crazy scientists, crazy doctors and self-proclaimed mystics, how and with what quantum. Explanation "of how any man or woman has created their own reality, only by participating in the life experience. You see, reality is a probability field from a number of different possibilities, and it is not written in stone until you have taken note of the observer. What happens if more than one observer observes that they did not say it, but who cares? Listen to Enya, meditate, observe, and be God, and nobody makes such stupid and archaic things as critical thinking, logic, etc., to "paradigm shift" and "go down the rabbit hole". In addition, the Heidelberger Unsch√§rferprinzip is supposedly a proof of alternative realities, parallel universes and the like. <br /> <br /> Speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the movie. All these people are constantly talking about rabbit holes. I'm not sure what that had to do with anything they said or show, but I'm sure it's kind of anal sex. In fact, the movie is extreme anti-sex. Sex is everywhere portrayed as dirty, ugly and anti-enlightening. <br /> <br /> In any case, the talking heads speak, the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts with a magical marker all over her body, and then walks around with an even more stupid look in her glassy eyes, when she started. <br /> <br /> I would like to return 2 hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Here are some random quotes that I remembered: <br /> <br /> "What I believe to be unreal has become much more real to me, and what I used to do for Real is often less real than unreal. " - Some talk about the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br /> "What does it take for a man to get an erection, it just needs a single thought, nothing changes, all the changes are inside, and yet he has an erection." - A self proclaimed mystic, leader her own school of enlightenment. <br /> <br /> [looking in the mirror] "I hate you, I hate you, you're fat, you're ugly, I have you!" - main character, the fat and ugly photographer.
