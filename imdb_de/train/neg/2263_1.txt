Ok, let me say that I did not expect a movie with Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold. All I wanted was that it's cinematic ... and it was not even that. It looked like someone's bad home movies. Badly played, scripted and brimming with nudity of the most unattractive people I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film's "plot" focuses on a lower-class family that chooses to go on the "Jerry Farrelly Show" to cover several affairs between mother, daughter, stepfather, and her daughter's fianc√© to discuss. From there, the film flickers and develops into a unique experience: white-trash pornography. There is redneck sex, interacial sex and even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This movie encouraged me to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Disgusting and humiliating. African American and working-class Americans should be offended. (Howard Stern should be happy that he did not waste his attempt on a movie star, he was smart, funny and entertaining.) <br /> <br /> MY GRADE: F + (the daughter was hot)
