It was really hard for me to get over this step. It was extremely slow and sometimes I wondered when the plot of the movie would actually come to life. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed too slow and I kept wondering when it would end. I'm usually a person who sometimes likes a good indie file, but that did not satisfy what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> It seemed like they wanted to make too much of this movie. At one point, it seemed to become political, of which I'm not a big fan of movies. If you're looking for a slow movie with little or no action, this is the movie for you. I felt like I wasted two hours when I could do something different.
