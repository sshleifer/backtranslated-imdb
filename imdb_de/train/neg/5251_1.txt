This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" has undoubtedly made the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotions, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor ... repeats the same situation over and over again. It shows no character development. It does not even show violent and / or sexual content and adds nothing new to the psycho-killer sub-genre. So lame it should be shown at the film schools, as an example of "what not to do" in a first movie. there are scenes that were shot almost identically; There are scenes with two or more master shots, and it's pretty dreadful for the action to jump from one master shot to another for no reason. The camera almost never moves, as if the "very talented artist" is afraid to show his lack of visual ability. The actors who play the lead act as amateurs, and the side cast is hard to believe. There are more holes than the plot in the script (if ever there was one) ... <br /> <br /> A really discouraging movie and a totally talented director.
