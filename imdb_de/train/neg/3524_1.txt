This is one of the worst cases of movie noise I've seen in a long time. It's so horrible that I'm not sure where to start or if it's worth it. The plot is the real problem, and 'Sly' I'm sorry because he does a decent job for his role. But this conspiracy ... Oh my god. I love it especially when he jumps up from the mountain of a mountain just before the end while the helicopter is on the move. A climb of one or two days takes five minutes! I could go on, but it's not worth it. Apart from the grim opening (of which even a five-year-old could predict the outcome), the rest is irrelevant. Sorry folks, but that's about as bad as filming.
