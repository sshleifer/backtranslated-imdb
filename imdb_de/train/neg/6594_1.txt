I have seen most if not all of the classic Laurel & Hardy movies. I have always enjoyed it, even if I have looked at it again and again. This new film attempts to reclaim the classic with two new actors resembling both Laurel and Hardy, but fails for a variety of reasons. One of them is how inappropriate their clothes are (still at the beginning of the 20th century), but both are portrayed in the 90s. Part of the previous dialogue has been brought back, but also fails the classic series. This movie might be the worst movie I've ever seen, and should be taken off the shelf forever. The real Laurel & Hardy turn grumpily in their graves with such a bad imitation.
