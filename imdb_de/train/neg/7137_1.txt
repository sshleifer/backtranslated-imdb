The cars in this movie are fantastic. The acting in this movie is terrible. The plot and the driving scenes do not make much sense and are just as bad. If you are really disturbed by movies where someone shifts and suddenly runs faster, you save the effort and money. Good movie for racing fans? Well, there is one part where they make the mistake of calling a NASCAR driver a rally driver. If you can not tell the difference, look at it, you have a great time. It really depends, there are really really nice cars in this movie, they are terribly driven and are absolutely unrealistic. The drama is terrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot. If you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. I'm disappointed that such beautiful cars are portrayed in such a bad movie. If the class of cars should match that of the movie, they should drive with rusted bicycles.
