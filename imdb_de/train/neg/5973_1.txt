This film is another great example of what Jerry Bruckheimer seems to be best at since about 1997 - raising a movie one year before its release and not getting a high-quality film. I'm not a film critic, but this movie was as predictable as it comes. Any attempt at a joke, any attempt at a touching moment, and the pathetic attempt at a love story were exactly what I foretold in my head. Do yourself a favor and save your money.
