Impressive. Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. did not influence anyone? This steaming pile of donkey droppings is a perfect example of this. "The Violent Years" looks like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" makes Keith Richards' worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal issue. You know, I've had nightmares that wake up and sweat bullets that will never come close to the horror Santa has found out of the seemingly clean bottom of my being. But I can imagine some parties where this movie could actually go well. If you are looking for the perfect example of a Santa-Satan dichotomy on VHS tape, look no further. Do not watch this movie because I was told that the MST3K version is now available. Move over Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
