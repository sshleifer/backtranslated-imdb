Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) prepares to donate his problematic shrink / extension machine to the Smithsonian Institution as he and his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) prepare for a long weekend of their son Adam (Bug Hall) , Wayne's brother Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and his children Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteer to look after Adam while his parents are absent titles would you expect), The adults are accidentally fidgeted by Wayne's shrinking beam. As the kids run amok, their miniaturized people have to be exposed to huge, huge insects, wrinkles in the carpet that look like ravines, and other threats. That was bad, as most direct videos, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, were kind of ridiculous. I had to laugh about this movie "roach" Stuart Pankin and the partybullys were even more ridiculous, looking at their own risk!
