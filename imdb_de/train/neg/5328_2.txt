Susan Seidelman seems to have made a decent career, with some first-rate credits. I am certainly glad that she has withdrawn from this film, which seems to have its admirers. I am not one of them. <br /> <br /> I saw better acting in the high school plays than in Smithereens. The act like the young Susan Berman, who is ambitious to make it into the world of music, is ready to do anything to get there. She even rejects the sincere progress of a young artist living in his van on the East River and played by Brad Rijn. Young Mr. Rijn is the worst performer in the movie, in fact the worst looking jobs I've seen in a long time. No wonder he has gone nowhere. <br /> <br /> I'll say that Seidelman's eye for the camera is a good eye catcher when he catches the well-known East Village locations where the movie was mainly filmed. But her work with her live actors did not fit. I am not sure if she had so much raw material at her disposal. <br /> <br /> Take a quick look and you'll see a very young Christopher Noth in front of Law and Order and Sex in the City as street performer. <br /> <br /> If you like punk rock, you can do it for the soundtrack. I stay with Bing Crosby.
