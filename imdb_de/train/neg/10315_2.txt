I can not believe that people found this stinking pile of rubbish funny. In order to shift the attempt of humor between cruelty, disgust and stupidity, "There is something about Mary" remains no reason to stay until the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but that's never enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller is keen to work within the storyline and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser. The recordings were badly timed and poorly framed. The Farreley brothers should be stopped at all costs from film production. I check IMDB to see what they are working on so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; The bonus is of the one time I smiled. It's not that I am against humor or in my opinion alone. My wife hated it too. The next day we saw "rush hour" and laughed silly. This movie just stunk.
