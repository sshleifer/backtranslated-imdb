This movie was absolutely pathetic. A pitiful script and lack of history made me drool three losers over bikini babies. Sometimes I felt like I saw an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I could not even get through the movie. Emran Hashmi is disappointed and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only valuable part of the film is the parody of Anu Malik and his obsession with Shayaris. It was pretty funny. The songs "Sini Ne" and the remix version were really good. You can always count on Emran to be connected to lip-locking and lip-syncing a chart buster. All in all, it seems that Emran does not have a good script from the Bhatts to support him this time.
