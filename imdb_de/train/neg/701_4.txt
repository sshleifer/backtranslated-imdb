During the Christmas holidays, a group of college friends stay behind to prepare the dormitories for demolition and replacement with residential buildings. To make the work a little harder, a murderous, chuckled psycho wanders through the dorm halls, exploiting the group in various violent ways. The Dorm That Dripped Blood, which was performed in Britain in the 1980s, was in place the first visit a good reputation. The term "video nasty" is reminiscent of some pictures of explicit violence, violence, sex, etc .: all things that a horror fan dreams of. After hearing all this information, I decided on Pranks (old title) and expected a sloppy Slasher experience. , , and that's what it's been trying to do, but it's pretty much failed. Visually, the movie is not great. The cinematography, the gore (except for a few scenes) and the overall direction are all failing. It's just not nice to look at. The unoriginal script is missing and often throws random things for no real reason (like the opening kill). There are some cool death scenes, including a pretty face that melts (which you can see on the poster), but that's all positive. The acting is pretty bad, the story seems to be unimportant, the killer is neither cool nor scary and suffers the one big mistake that every Slasher beat should always avoid: it's a bit boring. For a movie that some UCLA film students have made for $ 90,000 (which would more than double today), the dorm that drips blood is not a total mess. It has some good things and is pretty good to watch. , , But as a Slasher film that seems to be on the level of films like The House in Sorority Row and Pieces. , , it just can not compare. Do not expect much and you can at least be entertained. I hate to say it, but this is one of the few movies I've seen that would actually be better with a remake. , , and yet they go for great works like Black Christmas. Well. , Obligatory horror elements: <br /> <br /> - Subgenre: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are brutally cool kills, and the gore is fine mainly. , , but nothing special. They have also screened some of the best murders. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is a little unattractive (to me) nudity, but not very much. <br /> <br /> - Cool murderer: no. The killer's final monologue (s) made him / her quite uncool. <br /> <br /> - Anxiety / Suspense: One or two jumps, but nothing too effective. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I guess, yes, but I just did not care enough, and it's as obvious as the nose on the murderer's face. <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3.75 / 10. Bah! Humbug! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
