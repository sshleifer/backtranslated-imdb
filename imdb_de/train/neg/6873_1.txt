The TV productions at the beginning of the year 2000 were between weak and bad. In front of brands like Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives or Monk, the TV did not have the right hit, which could capture the attention and interests of the 2000s viewer. Titles like (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena), or even (Baywatch Hawaii) did not encourage you to watch and follow, or at least they were not as fascinating and interesting as the time, what preceded them. (Special unit 2) was no exception. In fact, Men in Black meets the parody of The X Files! (As if this was the special unit 1). But also after this brilliant formula; it did not work well It was promising; At the time, after a decade of X-Files, there was some saturation from the "supernatural" cases, so that the natural mind mocked it naughty (imagine Mulder as a womanizer!). (Special Unit 2), however, was not the strongest or strongest when it comes to making a comic sci-fi show. It was highly ridiculous, for example, where every sexy situation has to turn into an ugly disgusting situation. It enjoyed this bad taste disgusting. (Michael Landes) was not charismatic and as a comedian mostly unbearable. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee) as well as any alleged sexual attention was anything but boring. Sure, the show had a funny look, but overall, it was a straightforward job. It's clear that nothing was more interesting than his main idea. Under (Evan Katz) 's other work as co-writer and co-producer like (Seven Days) before or (24) later, this must be a low point! Despite the pronounced personality, it was a silly joke most of the time. So, if that was the goal, they made one of the dumbest! And really, it would be one of the rarest times, if you would be grateful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes!
