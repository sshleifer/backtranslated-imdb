I own 2 home entertainment businesses and have seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but this one was so bad that I had to register here and comment on it. How bad was it? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola earned an Oscar for her performance in Godfather III compared to Giada Colagrande in this film. <br /> <br /> It was robotic and not inspired. Her lover died just one month before her arrival at the Rubber House that he had given her. Once there, she discovers that he has cheated on her throughout their relationship, but none of that seems to register with her. Within a day she starts a relationship with Leslie, the housekeeper of the house (Dafoe). Although she is married to Dafoe off screen, her scenes with him were cold and emotionless. <br /> <br /> If there was a conspiracy, I missed her. Not even Willem Dafoe could save this movie from the amateur movie wreck it is.
