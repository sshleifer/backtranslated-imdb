I'm tired of all those little little things, like this movie "rocks". It's pure CG over-acted CRAP! Do not send an assassin, it makes much more sense to smuggle hundreds of colorful, aggressive, venomous snakes into a plane! The only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to. It's not "that bad, it's good". It is so bad that I prefer to stab in the eye with a sharp stick and then be subjected to it again. I thought honestly, a COMEDY would be like PLANE! A parody! I was wrong. It's the whole thing "It's shit, understand it!" Or Samuel A. Jackson yells, "Snakes on the Plane! Ding, I'm sorry, I do not get it, it looks like a few bucks from the movie industry would give more money to make more films like Triple X and Die Hard Spending money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought William Hung's CD, they still live in their mothers' basement and stink of plastic chair sweats on the computer for days by playing online games and watching porn Take them to the theater and ask for one (since I doubt you have a girlfriend) a ticket for snakes on a silly butt plane No irony in watching good movies The true demise of Western civilization Being a cult movie is an insult to real cult classics like Repo Man or even Orgazmo, I've said enough here.
