Shintaro Katsu gained a lot of fame with the wonderful character Zatoichi. The Zatoichi movies had a weird and incredible concept - a blind guy is the biggest swordsman in Japan and spends every movie correcting wrongdoing and demanding retaliatory actions against evil offenders. He's really a nice guy and the movies are exciting and addicting (I've actually seen every movie). That's why I saw this last episode of the Hanzo the Razor series because I assumed it would be very similar. It turns out that the Hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and promote the rape of "women who deserve it". Hanzo is a police officer from the Meiji era. He regularly detains angry women and interrogates them by forcibly raping them with his steel penis. How he made his member so strong must have been seen to be believed, but it's definitely NOT for the squeamish. On the other reviews, however, I find that they are still very popular ... and that's pretty scary. Despite decent acting and amazing fight scenes, the movies are like brainwashing - and I can not imagine how the films could have contributed to violence against women.
