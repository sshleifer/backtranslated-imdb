This mini-series is actually more entertaining than others, with much larger budgets and bigger aspirations. SOTD is somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "HR Pufnstuff" in the entertainment spectrum. If it was not that long (almost 3 hours), I think kids would quite like it. It has adventure, action, "cliffhanger scenes" and not too much romance or other "icky" stuff. When you are young, you are not too critical in bending rubber swords, playing campaigns, and repeating scenes that are repeated. (At least two scenes are repeated identically in the film, just as in old series to bring the audience up to date.) After all, children usually accept the dialogue between English and American, who comes from the mouth of Asia as an actor. (Not to mention that some of the lead roles are played by non-Asian actors.) <br /> <br /> I would give this movie three stars, but I felt like director, producer and cast deserve at least an extra credit at least to carry out the project. This movie is not art, but like painting your house, it actually took some time, effort and discipline to finish it. All in all, no recommended use for your time The kids chatted in a mini-van while traveling. Oh, yes ... hey, IMDb! "Dialogue" is the preferred and traditional spelling. Your spell checker seems to think that "dialogue" is the correct spelling. While "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and the OED see it as an alternative form.
