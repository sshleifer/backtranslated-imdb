It's a good movie for kids who love dogs. It runs a bit slow in the morning, but ends when De Vil is pushed open. The basic plot is the same as the first movie. The bright side of the adult movie is the talking bird that thinks it's a dog. The bird speaks like a human (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and barks like a dog. It's the comedy that the movie needed more of. See it in the matinee, so you do not have to pay the full price or wait until it appears at Disney.
