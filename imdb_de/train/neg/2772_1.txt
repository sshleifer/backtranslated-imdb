Warning spoiler. , , I have to agree, it was almost there. This was such a bad movie about such an interesting and true story. It had such a promise, but the drama was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are just outside a theme park. I laughed as I watched what was probably serious scenes. I really wanted to have this movie, but I could not. The best was the fight between friends, which ended with the death of the "king". I liked the punishment of the queens. And the last shot made a beautiful picture. There are so many better films to watch. I can not recommend that.
