What else can you say about this movie, except that it's just awful. Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons why you should see this, but that's it, but their talents are wasted in this garbage Some scenes of Adam, such as when he runs because you can not see his face. If Adam was embarrassed to be in Zombie Nightmare, just remember what he was thinking ??? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but Zombie Nightmare is by comparison a classic (the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version is first and last) by the actors. A rip off of The Wild One with Marlon Brando of course. Tina looks stunning. I hope she and Adam get a good pay !! Consist!
