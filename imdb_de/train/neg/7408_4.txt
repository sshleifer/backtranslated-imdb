I'm not quite sure why I clicked on "Contains Spoiler", because frankly, there are never enough explanations in the movie to know enough what is going on to spoil it. <br /> <br /> Optically, it delivers mostly. Apart from some 80s rubber mask monsters. I say now that I've never seen the band Lordi before I looked at it, nor did I know that they won Eurovision. Apparently the monsters in this band are members, pretty much in their stage characters. What ever. Anyway, I did not know that while watching. I just thought the monsters / demons would be passable most of the time. Nearly. <br /> <br /> I'm almost sure there is a half-coherent explanation for what we see on screen, but it may be better not to know it. It would probably have been incredibly lame to think about it. The action makes it run pretty well to entertain the viewer most of the time, even though half of the entertainment factor over Wtf jokes that wtf is about to happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him four, mainly because I have a good laugh, especially because it does not really explain anything. It must have been the mood I was in, but I found the hella funny for some reason. Then I watch the movie on the internet and find out that NOBODY knows what it's all about. This amused me further and increased my score by half a point to 4/10. <br /> <br /> It's not scary or very coherent, but visually and sonically it's pretty nice. All in all not necessarily necessary, but observable. Do not expect too much and expect no sense and it could entertain you if you are in the right mood.
