The funniest scene in this movie is probably when our saviors get their medals and plaques and so on. So the basic idea is that the police trumps these gangsters by a million to one, but they are powerless because the bad guys' bad guys are just a little bigger. I suspect the police ammo is a bit more. You decided to shoot this documentary-style film with fake interviews and all, and what's up with these guys? They talk as if they were armed with rolled-up newspapers. Okay, I admit, it's probably still dangerous to be in the line of fire, even if the situation is so much to your advantage. And why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything? I would say that's a very long time when you've surrounded them and you're allowed to shoot. They are ten yards away, they hit absolutely nothing. Then they buy bigger weapons to reinforce their heroism. And then yes, there you have it, one of the police actually beats someone. Bullet was probably distracted by a lamppost or something. I had a good laugh, I think.
