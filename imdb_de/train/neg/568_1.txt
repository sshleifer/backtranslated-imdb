This "debut" on the sci-fi channel today and all I can say, "I'm speechless," I recorded today so I could see it after work today. I had high hopes. Now I rip the cabinets and look for a rope so I can hang myself up. Maybe the worst movie I have ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like "It was fun to make fun of this movie," but this movie does not give me anything to work with. I know you should not post spoilers here without warning, but I'll still "This movie is shit" I said it! You should show this movie to film students to show them what they should NOT do! My nine year old niece could make a better movie. The only decent thing about this film is the sound and / or soundtrack. OH! I just found a rusty C-clamp in my old toolbox. I will put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain clears the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could just tape this VHS, but I think I'll burn it in the hearth instead. I could wash myself with soap, but I'm afraid I'll never be clean again. Christmas is around the corner. Buy this movie and give it to people who hate you. -Mike
