A very bad attempt at a young spine. At least the music in the spinal cord was good. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism at worst. A number of Hollywood executives, bad musicians and producers create a "Poopie" show so their kids can be in the limelight. Oh please!!! The potty humor was even bad. I hate this stuff when there are really incredibly talented kids (musicians, actors, and artists) out there who pull their ass off to be successful, and that crap is coming. <br /> Why was Gene Simmons absent? Ameriac's taste in entertainment goes down the toilet.
