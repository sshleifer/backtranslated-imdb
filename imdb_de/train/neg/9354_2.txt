There is one important aspect of the film Jobson apparently forgot - he has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you. You do not have to tell the audience what to think because they will see it. The plot here is punctuated with some of the heaviest narrations unleashed by the unsuspecting audience - the violent prose of the sensitive fifth. And it should be unnecessary, because there is a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals. Maybe Jobbo felt that the basic story needed some help. And he may have been right, he lacks a basic credibility: the 1970s in Edinburgh were not full of pretty, failed girls with a taste for the Velvet Underground and a penchant for a passing sociopath. From the manicured and new-looking clothes the character wears to the cod-intellectualism that tries to connect everything, it's all too thought-out for my taste.
