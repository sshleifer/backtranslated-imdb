What a horrible movie! For some reason, scientific laboratories and outposts always have a staff of grubby, dirty, communal misanthropes inside. These people, who are likely to collaborate on complicated science projects, can not agree on how to survive the death of a CGI kite. Spoiler: An extraordinary scientist whose main acting skills are "laughter" and "the eerie gaze" has cloned a dragon. While the lab was working on this, the other scientists are shocked because they all seem to have been left behind in their experiments and caught with their pants down. The rest of the story is like THE THING or Ten Little Indians, where the staff are hunted down and killed as they try to find a way to flee and / or defeat the "dragon". The CGI Dragon Creature is dark gray, which seems to be the most popular color for most of the cheap CGI special effects. It does not look much better than a cartoon, and the dark grays make it difficult to see interesting details in the dragon's body. Everything it looks like is a gray spot. The spectacle is less than terrible. These scientists behave like a bunch of kids who can not agree on anything. This makes it easier for the dragon to kill her at various escape attempts, hide and seek, etc. this movie. He seems to sink to the level of his minority. This movie is really very cruel. Acting is bad. The story is stupid. The CGI is very cheap and amateur. It's nothing special about this movie, it's not even a good time killer you can look at while doing housework or other work.
