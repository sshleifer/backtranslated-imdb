Some of the films you buy for a pound turn out to be pretty good - 23rd-century films released dozens of obscure Italian and American films that were great, but although Hardgore released some Fulci films among others, that's the bulk of their production Crap like The Zombie Chronicles. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it is not nearly as annoying as the Stink of Flesh. Apart from that, it's a very clumsy anthology film with the technical expertise of a Lego house built from a corrugated horn. <br /> <br /> It has been mentioned elsewhere, but you really have to worry about a movie where previews are inserted into the action sequence in the credit sequence, so until the zombie attacks, you have it all seen. <br /> <br /> Bad Movie fans will have a ball watching the 18,000 continuity mistakes and the devilish spectacle of the cast (especially the hitchhiker that was so bad he made me laugh a bit) and a big one Praise to Hardgore for having gotten into the spirit of things by publishing a print appearance that felt like I was watching a battered home video from a camping trip. <br /> <br /> Terrible, terrible stuff. We all did such things when we got a camera in the hand, but common sense is prevalent and these films hang somewhere in our cabinets. Avoid.
