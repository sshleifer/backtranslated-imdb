The three henchmen in a full-length western comedy musical? Maybe "Rockin 'in the Rockies" should combine the Stooges comedy with the Western musical in a matinee; If so, this was a pleasant way to break a Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a handsome young hero; and Mary Beth Hughes (as blonde June) and Gladys Blake (as brunette Betty) are pretty women. The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group. her songs are quite melodic; However, these are the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the movie does not "rock". There are a few laughs; The humor of the Stooges, however, is muted than usual. The talking horse is not busy. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'in the Rocky Mountains (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
