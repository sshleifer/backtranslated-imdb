I was intrigued by this movie, curious to see how they adapted Hubert Shelby's brutal novel. I thought that a literary piece of such depth, with a rich selection of characters, terrible situations and social criticism, could not be translated into a bad movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is a horrible movie experience, not because of its content but because of its form. Director Ulrich Edel, in my honest opinion, does a terrible directing job that does not do justice to the original book. No wonder that is a fine television director. This movie looks and feels like a bad strip "Made for TV". Some of my views on this bomb (** spoiler in front **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of creativity in directing. The scenes are slow, feel slow, look bad, and barely move from an anchored position. The only freedom they claim is the cinematography area with a nice dark tone. Apart from that, the film has the same technical creativity as a television soap opera. <br /> <br /> - All the actors do a great job of portraying these miserable characters. The problem is that adaptation does not address a fundamental element in the story's development: MOTIVATION. All these characters move like robots without a clear motivation for their actions. They seem to do things out of the blue, like robots, for no reason. Nobel misses every opportunity to enrich character development by not exploring the motivations of the characters and not fully developing the personality of the characters. <br /> <br /> This lack of character development is blatant in Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job with this trashy prostitute, but her alcohol-related decision to let sailors offend her is not explained. It looks extremely stupid when we see this character out of the blue. This is a clear example of the development of bad characters. <br /> <br /> The film also contains many secondary token characters that do nothing, feel nothing and add nothing to the plot. I would like to know more about Harry's wife and the interaction between the two. This is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Noble only approaches the character development with Harry and his fixation with his gay lover to mess it up in the end, without explaining his motivations. The thugs are also a joke in their lack of development. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever experienced. Terrible Job by Mark Knopfler. I was seriously expecting more from the former leader of Dire Straits, but his job in this film is seriously lacking. Sometimes, as in the battle between union workers and the police, the music seems completely disconnected from the film. It also feels completely poor and anachronistic; I could swear that the entire soundtrack was made with a Casio toy keyboard. It detracts from the actual action. <br /> <br /> - The book adaptation of Desmond Nakano is so verbatim that the point of the story is eliminated. It feels like they've been trying so hard to maintain the action-by-action storyline in the book that they've forgotten to actually develop the characters and explain their actions and motivations once again. I'm serious I can not recommend this movie, not even to a Shelby fan because it can ruin the original book. It is a very uninspired effort in adapting the novel and showing very little creative input.
