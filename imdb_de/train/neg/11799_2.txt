That could have been a good episode, but I just had to turn it off. The British representation was terrible. Did the creators have a foothold in the UK before the shoot? At least in England set foot ?? I do not think an Englishwoman had such an accent, other than a royal family comedy sketch! Well, I do not think an English boy has acted, spoken, or dressed like an English child in the history of the British nation since the praising public appearances of Prince William and Harry. To American filmmakers .. There is more than one country in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. That means more than 1 culture! I can deal with stereotypes, but that was so bad that I could not see it. Fire looked cool!
