Townies is the laziest movie I've ever seen and I've seen the Blair Witch movies (parts one and two). It seems to be confused what it wants to be. It's not funny enough for a comedy, it's not tragic enough for a drama, it's not bloody enough for a horror and it's not good enough to watch. It has scenes of a man doing "slapstick / bloody" karate, so I think, oh, this movie will be in the role of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then it jumps without warning into a drama about a missing girl, a retarded (mentally handicapped) woman and a trusting mother. Then it turns into the ONLY good part of the movie, which seems like a sitcom without the laugh marks. The part I'm talking about is a lonely TOWNIE so lonely that he finds solace in a rotting corpse. That was the ONLY part of the movie that made me feel right. The rest was a waist of my life. Then, just to show how CRUEL Wayne is, there's a sort of DOCUMENTATION at the end of the film by Wayne (the director) that makes fun of Toby (the star) in public. It made me sick. Although Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other Wayne films) are not the best, they are at least thought-out enough to entertain until the final credits. I even like Killer Nerd a bit, there were some great lines that I use to this day. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like Overground movies and if you like to see your feet, just rest where they are, you will not like TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (from ****) <br /> <br />
