I'm a big Charlton Heston fan. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time, but what did he think when he made this film? Normally, if he made a bad movie, I could blame the scriptwriter or the director, but in that case, it's all he does. The stupidity of this movie is all his fault. It proves that even Heston can not make a Shakespearean story interesting. I wasted two and a half hours of my life for this snooze party and I will never get that time back. This is by far the worst Heston movie I have ever seen. If you're a Shakespearean fan, you may find this movie entertaining, but if you waste no time, you will regret it in the long run.
