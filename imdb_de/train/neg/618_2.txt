Maybe one of the worst teen slasher movies I've ever seen. I start with the bad points of the movie that cover the whole movie pretty well. First of all, nobody can escape: TERRIBLE ACTING. I swear, they picked up some random kids from the street, depending on what they look like. Second, BAD / NON-BINDING CHARACTERISTICS / DEVELOPMENT. They hardly know half the children who are killed here. They only realize that they have earned it in one way or another. The scarecrow's character was exaggerated and a cheap rip-off of other big fantasy killers like Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOGUE: The scarecrow was full of terrible one-liners that would make you laugh just because it was so awful. Lines like "Let's find some small animals to torture!" leaves you only with a raised eyebrow. Last but not least: Next: BAD CASTING. How old was the man who played Lester? How 30? His back was bald for God's sake. I could say a lot more about this movie as cheap special effects, it's "High School Film Class", but the point is understood. It's just bad filmmaking. What I found to be "good" in the movie: - entertaining for those with low, low, low levels. Would help to bring insomnia to sleep. A very cheap laugh or even a giggle.
