Me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good. But we were wrong. Acting first ... wow ... Acting was the worst, the impact was really bad, it seemed like a movie a college kid did. The plot was pretty good, but it was done. The thing that most ruined the movies was the actors. The lead actor was the worst actor ever ... it's a shame I even call him an actor ... The only good thing about this movie was that it was so bad it was funny. See it ... but otherwise ... stay far away from this. I usually love B-list movies and such, but these ... I do not know how it was passed on to be even taped on video ... This is the worst I've seen ones.
