The monster from the Enemy Mine somehow got into a small mountain community where he settled down. He is being chased by a medical vigil who wants to exterminate him. This assassin, who looks like a refugee from a Motley Crue video, rides a motorcycle trying to rescue a group of children who have decided to go for a big chill weekend in the middle of the monster's lawn. Decapitations and a lot of blood are first and foremost to avert attention from the story, which is like a bad version of the island of Dr. Moreau ceases (and yes, it's worse than Val Kilmer).
