Hoo boy, that was a real test to get through. Tom Hanks' mug is plastered in the DVD case, and that's the only reason anyone would buy it. He looks about forty on the box, but the movie was filmed in 1982, so he still has the job of his bosom buddies and of course is about forty pounds lighter. The story concerns a Dungeons and Dragons-like game that Hanks and his three friends play, and Hanks thinks it's real. Chris Makepeace is a genius boy named Jay Jay and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a number of funny hats. Oh, look, he has a yellow helmet with a tuxedo on! Now he is dressed like a World War I pilot! This was a really horrible movie, but in a bad way. A few veterinarians usually appear as parents of the children. There's Anne (I'm Honey West, dammit!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who are actually looking pretty hot. Murray Hamilton, the mayor of Jaws, has a thankless role as a police officer. Wendy Crewson is the love interest for Hanks and a blond guy I have not seen before or since. There is some syrupy music here and there and absolutely no tension, no sense of danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see because he is crazy. The monster is played by the late, great Kevin Peter Hall, who became famous by Predator. A friend of mine picked it up from the old discount box at MallWart and told me to throw it in the trash without looking at it. So of course I had to see if it was that bad. It was. The night before, I saw Apollo 13, and then this movie was a shock. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the dustbin. Oh yes, after Hanks almost jumped out of one of the World Trade Center towers because of his delusions, he goes home to recover and is visited by his friends. Hank's mother, a drunken Vera Miles, says he's coming along well now, but when they go to sea to visit him in his tennis outfit, he's crazier than ever. The end
