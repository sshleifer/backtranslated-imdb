Yes, I will only tell you about it, so do not read if you want surprises. I got this with the title Christmas Evil. On the DVD there was also another Christmas horror called Silent Night, Bloody Night. While Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night and Deadly Night) had much potential and was almost good, this was not quite as good. It started interesting enough watching the villain (if you can call him that) observing the kids next door and writing books about who's naughty and nice, but after a while, you look for some action and this movie does not deliver. You need character development, but that gets overboard and you're still not sure why the guy snaps. After about an hour, he kills three out of four people, while a whole lot watches in horror, and the men he kills are not even his goals, which only make fun of him. This is one of the killer's many unsuccessful attempts to knock on the naughty. Then he tries to kill the other and he tries to invade his house by pressing himself into the fireplace. He gets stuck promptly and barely manages to get out. Then he enters the basement and tries to kill the man by strangling him in his bedroom. He can not kill the guy this way, he picks up a star from the tree and cuts the guys neck. What the hell was a tree doing in the bedroom? Oh yes, the killer before this kill stopped at a party and also had a bit of fun. Well, it's about, except for the city people who follow him with torches, and the unresolved part with his brother and the tune he wants to play. What was it all about? He kept talking about something that was never really explained. How come you ask, now that I have spoilers, I'll tell you. He runs off the road in his van and goes on. Well, let's say it was lame !!!!!!!!!!!!
