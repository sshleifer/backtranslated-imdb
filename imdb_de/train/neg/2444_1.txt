Two houses, a street, a telephone booth, a car, a girl next door, a boy next door and a zombie. This list of ingredients should be enough for a great horror movie. All you need is some blue light, ambient music and ... done. Not in the hands of Dutch director van Rouveroy! <br /> <br /> I like organizing "bad movie nights" from time to time. The concept is very simple: get schnapps, win movie-loving friends and immerse yourself in the worst cinema. For such an evening, this dirt is one of the best. Laughs guaranteed! <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that van Rouveroy still defends her film as a great success. To testify to this, you need to listen to the commentary on the DVD. Again: disbelieving and laughing guaranteed!
