Hmm, IMDb rating of 7.5, good comments, blah, blah ... okay, two of my friends and I, we ordered pizza, sat down and wanted something as cool as Ichi or at least something brainless, but funny like Versus. But naked blood sucked. It is a complete waste. Okay, the scene with the woman who likes to eat is quite outstanding. But that's it. Not more, not less. I will not summarize the conspiracy, other people have already done it, I just wanted to stop the hype. But pay attention and rate it yourself. Maybe we can push the rating where it should be. One more thing that comes to my mind: The soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter ever was - okay, Johns Cool ... :) 2/10
