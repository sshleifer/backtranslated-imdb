It's The Hard Meets Cliffhanger, when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists, and it's up to a police officer, Jack (Crackerjack) to end this. <br /> <br /> A B-action movie that pays off other films and is pretty good with pretty good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in these movies) and three fine stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as a policeman and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as a terrorist. If you do not like stupid B-Action movies, this is not for you.
