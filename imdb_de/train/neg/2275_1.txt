A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, but this time with a live breathing mask as the lead. For the dubious benefit of an English soundtrack, we endure Tom Cruise's soulless performance as usual at zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his person, but usually we get a character underneath to keep our interest. His empty posture negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz. <br /> <br /> There is an acting exercise in which the actor is freed with masks to enrich his portrayal of the character through word and body language. Cruises masking painfully underlines his inadequacy as an actor. See the 1997 Original Amenabar Open Your Eyes!
