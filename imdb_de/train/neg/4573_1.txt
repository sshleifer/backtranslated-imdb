I did not know much about this movie before I saw it, but I've heard that it has something to do with quantum physics, so I was interested. What I did not know is that this IS NOT A HISTORY, but a bunch of New Age Blowhards who love the sound of their own voice and talk about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics. I say it's more in the category of documentary than comedy or drama. <br /> <br /> Marlee Matlin is in the movie to give some kind of action to this New Age Symposium *. Her parts of the film feel terribly pinned and are meant to show the speaker's thoughts so we do not die of boredom. Matlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike the New Age hippie who crashes on her couch. We listen to how nameless people roam about what quantum physics means to them. The one bright spot in this movie was the spokesman from India (I assume), but I think he turned up for the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> It looks as if Barbara Eden is really going to let herself go and she goes on to explain how quantum science has something to do with her crazy New Age beliefs. It looks as if Quark of DS9 was short of money and he also makes a brief appearance in the film. There are a lot of Whizbang CGIs we should be impressed with. Cells in the body are portrayed as dancing Jello forms because the filmmakers seem to have seen Flubber too often. The people in the film say the Arawak on San Salvador considered the Pinta ship invisible to Columbus because the natives had never seen clipper ships before, as if people today had a chance to know. Of course, they omit all this information and just say "Columbus' ships were invisible to the American Indians." The movie makes many such arrogant jumps. Thomas Young performed a double-slit experiment around 1805 and found that light can sometimes look like a particle and sometimes like a wave. Of course you would never know that stupid movie, because the only clue to it is that "atoms can be particles and waves." And that must mean that people can walk through walls, walk on water and never grow old if they only wish one star !! Then I'm sure Marlee Matlin could stop being deaf if she believed only strong enough. I'm sarcastic, but this movie is full of false hope and beliefs that do not really keep the people who support them. <br /> <br /> These are New Age kooks who have stuck to Quantum Theory. It reinforces everything they believe in meditation, zero point energy, crystal healing, and so on. If these snake oil sellers really believed the crap they sell, could not they just put their paycheck into existence instead of appearing in that joke a movie? We listen to another nameless man without speaking about evidence we know, and talking on his couch in front of a fireplace (or TV screen) about how he creates his own life. Every time he was on the screen, I wanted someone to storm in and throw a pie in his face. These people take themselves too seriously. Another bald-headed guy in a suit says that nobody * really * touches anything because there's a magnetic force preventing it at the quantum level. If only someone had stepped on the screen and punched him in the stomach, he shouted, "I'm not touching you, I'm not touching you!" A moral relativist in the film claims that there really is "nothing like good or bad". Apparently it is okay that Hitler gasses millions of Jews to death? Another person says that there is "no love". It's just a chemical and we really do not love people, we're just addicted to the chemical onslaught we have when we're near them. I suspect that guy is doing this movie as a civilian service because he's been addicted to heroin for so many years. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a truly pathetic sequence in which two young adults walk around a wedding party and see everything RoboCop. They judge whether women are cows, dogs or foxes, and a sexual position pops on the rubble. Marlee Matlin gets drunk at the wedding she is supposed to photograph and the next day she decides to love and take a bath because she is a beautiful and unique snowflake. <br /> <br /> I liked it when the movie said that people often find evidence of their ready-made ideas. Maybe I just see what I want to see in this meeting, but I really wanted those people to get pies on their faces, and it never happened. <br /> <br /> If you've never heard of it The ideas presented in the film may be interesting, but there are better sources for all the ideas here. If you want to watch a good movie that talks about the Heisenberg principle of blurring, look under The Man Who Was Not There. If you want to read a good book on Quantum Field Theory, read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. If you want to see a movie that talks about imaginative visuals through different philosophies, see Waking Life (though sometimes it feels boring, self-confident, and overbearing). All in all, you should read Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson instead of wasting your time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Normally I find it very difficult to give films a score of 1 to 10, but this was very easy for me: 1/10 stars. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is right. The people in this movie do not know # $ *! Undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen.
