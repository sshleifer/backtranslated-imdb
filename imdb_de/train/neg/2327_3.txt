This movie comes straight from the dark dungeons of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company gained prestige and wealth in the first half of the 1990s, producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies. The best known disasters in their ouvre are "subspecies", "seedpeople" and "trancers". None of these is recommended and not really Doctor Mordrid. Hyperactive director Charles Band came into the right company for his film. Doctor Mordrid is amazingly stupid and cheesy and almost completely humorless. I only saw it because it plays Jeffrey Combs. I've learned that it can have several disadvantages if you are a fan of his. For any good movie, it seems like he made 5 inferior ones. Anyway, the story is about the fight between two old wizards. One who has been here for 150 years to protect people (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and one who is evil and is called Kabal. He wants to destroy any form of human life for some reason that I have already forgotten. Combs receives his instructions from the mentor. This "guy" is just two eyes in space. Very, very cheesy! Every now and then a dazzling flash of light appears on the screen, but that is the only form of special effects this movie has. The whole thing is just a whinging and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other, it's over before you know it ... I expected the evil wizard to at least defend himself a bit, but no ... In In some scenes, you can really see some originality and creativity (such as Jeffrey's lecture on the influence of the moon on criminals). If you are really careful, you may even discover some very small but nice aspects (like the raven) that is Edgar Allen), but overall it's a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he's a superhero in my eyes ... but he sure does not have to put on a stupid Maulot.
