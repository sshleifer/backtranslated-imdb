Largely dense road movie with some comic reliefs provided by the outstanding John Cleese (though he really gives up his performance at Fawlty Towers). It seems like the slapstick is being changed from the head to the mushy sentimentality, and the worst part of the movie is that Martin and Hawn have to "find out" who they are, etc. See it at your peril.
