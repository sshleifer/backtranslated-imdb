As a big fan of only the first two seasons of BSG and the stand-alone feature of BSG Razor, I had hoped that this release would bring the franchise back to its original glory. Normally I have no problem with science fiction, which is mostly dialog-driven and no visual sweets of special effects. If the script contains only a few original ideas of good actors, a profound movie can be made with little CGI money. This prequel has none of the above requirements. The virtual reality created by the terrorist youth was both ridiculous and unbelievable. This scene was simply pasted there to increase the release value to Restricted. Not that teenagers do not love mosh boxes full of virtual reality filled with sex, violence and heavy dance music. It is the part about the same teenagers who have the intellectual depth and reason or the political and religious passion to develop such futuristic software or become suicide bombers who amaze me. These kids are definitely not from this planet. The movie is like a soap opera, with only the last 10 minutes being interesting. The scene where Eric Stolz gave his cyborg a devine assurance by updating the student firmware was amusing, if not entertaining. However, this old concept was portrayed much better and credible to the brilliant, classic original "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica rips apart his only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror movie. No surprise there! Overall, the film was boring, unoriginal and cheap, using recycled CGI from Caprica of BSG. I doubt I will watch this space soap when it premieres on the sci-fi channel. Unless, of course, I suffered from a bad sleeplessness, at the time this show would definitely be the cure. zzzzzzzz
