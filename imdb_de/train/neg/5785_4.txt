VAMPYRES <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> A motorist (Murray Brown) is lured to an isolated villa that is inhabited by two pretty young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and gets entangled in their free-spirited sexual lifestyle, but his hosts turn out to be vampires with an insane craving for human blood ... <br /> <br /> An Example From The Lesbian Vampire Cycle, initiated by director Jean Rollin in France and confirmed by the success of Hammer's "Carmilla" series in the UK, pushed Jose Ramon Larraz's brave shocker VAMPYRES to tolerate the concept of Adult Horror well beyond the British censors in 1974, and his film was cut short by almost three minutes after his original British release. It's not hard to see why! Larraz (who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym "D. Daubeney") uses the Gothic theme as an excuse for as much nudity, sex and bloodshed as the film's short running time allows, using those commercial elements as a mere background for a lethargic Meditation Concerning life, death and the sexual and other impulses that confirm the human condition. <br /> <br /> Harry Waxman's haunting cinematography, filmed on-site in a picturesque country house in the fall of 1973, evokes an atmosphere of bleak premonition in which the desolate landscape - sombre and equally beautiful - creates a whirlwind of impetus (Larraz did a similar trick that same year with SYMPTOMS, an inconspicuous thriller that spilled into a violent barrage during the finale). Despite his claim, VAMPYRES 'razor-thin plot and gross manufacturing values ​​will split the audience from the start, and while the two protagonists are as charismatic and engaging as one might wish, the male lead (Brown at his head) passes by at the time of filming ) is wistful in a role that should have gone to a nice twenties something. VAMPYRES is an absolute must for cult movie fans, an amusing curiosity for everyone else. Look out for superstar Bessie Love from the Silent era in a short cameo at the end of the film.
