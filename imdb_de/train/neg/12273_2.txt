PLAN B has the appearance of a fast-paced, unedited, sloppy scriptwriting script that attempts to tour the actors involved - an outing that should have been from the start. It's just another mafia-based "comedy" that has nothing new and lowers the standard for attendees. Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the criminal who cares more about clothes and looks than about his business of control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is stupider than dirt and his ignorance should be funny. Maloni has beaten one of his debtors (who happens to be married to Fran - Diane Keaton) and Maloni accepts Fran as his assistant to reduce her dead man 's debt by being Maloni' s "Hit Man". Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to fulfill Maloni's duties. Instead, they decide to bring their "whackies" to Florida to hide in their brother James's house until they can figure out what to do next. This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B. Plan A means killing them! The end is absolutely predictable, as is every line assigned to the characters in the script. Diane Keaton has done a lot of good movies and is one of our most talented actresses and comedies, but here she screams and screams and jerks off a ridiculous part that quickly gets annoying. Paul Sorvino is the type of Paul Sorvino from other gangster films. The supporting cast may also play in the widest slapstick on the balcony, pratfall mode. What should be a comedy is just silly and exaggerated. Director Greg Yaitanes once again has to resort to TV sitcoms: Had this meager story been compressed into a half-hour performance, it would have had a chance. Grady harp
