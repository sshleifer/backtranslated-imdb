I had absolutely nothing to do last weekend and got together with my friends to watch a movie ... every movie. And since the only movie we did not see was Inspector Gadget, we decided to do that. This is a movie that could only be interesting for kids. Oh, and it's not like I do not like movies that are aimed at the younger audience. But this movie had absolutely nothing to catch my attention. If you have nothing to do at home, sleep. Better to waste money than hard earned money. Watch the movie if you are a child or if you are a parent with a child :)
