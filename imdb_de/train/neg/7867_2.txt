Okay, I tried it and I tried, but I still do not get anything from Guy Maddin. Stories from the Gimli hospital left me cold, the movie about the Austrian villagers and about the ice nymph were pretty to look at, but lacked in the storytelling section ... and this noodle movie about abortion and hockey is just boring. I'm glad that Maddin appreciates the silent movie, but I do not like his films for the same reason I do not like Quentin Tarantino's films: they're empty homages to better, more ingenious films - films that move the art form forward or Bankruptcies are new territory - and are all style and no substance. Countless jumps and unusual camera angles can not disguise the fact that Maddin is an unoriginal David Lynch wannabe, although he has an advantage over Tarantino: He usually writes no embarrassing dialogues, since his films are usually dependent on subtitles. The conclusion: Maddins Schick is a clever film for aspiring film majors.
