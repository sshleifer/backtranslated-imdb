This film was so poorly written and staged that I fell asleep for 30 minutes through the movie. The jokes in the movie are hackneyed and even if the plot is interesting in some angles, it is too far-fetched and in some places ridiculous. If you are 11 years or older, you will miss the writing in the movie and be disappointed. However, if you are 10 years or younger, this will be a movie that will grab your attention and be thrilled with all the stunts. and wish you were a warrior. The casting in this movie was not very good and the music was very disappointing because they looked like they wanted to build up the tension, but it did not fit at all. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 is excellent, 1 is terrible), acting in this film is a 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was ridiculous. As she did some of her "fight" poses, I started to laugh out loud. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the director. For example, the part in which her enemy turns out to be the person possessed by the evil villain, how her voice becomes dark and evil. I think that was incredibly stupid and like Wendy's (Brenda Song) teachers were all their teachers in the school who were owned by monks, that was pretty ridiculous. All in all, a disappointing movie, but okay if you're 10 or less.
