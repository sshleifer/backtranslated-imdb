Georgia Rule must be one of the - if not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feeling that makes me gasp, "what?" Aloud at least 7-10 times during the grueling two-hour course. <br /> <br /> Filed in his trailer as a film about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as a matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter, and Lindsay Lohan, a rebellious, overexpanded, sparsely-dressed granddaughter, the viewer believes this is a clich√©, a light kick-flick about how to grow up and get together as a family. <br /> <br /> Talk about wrong advertising worst. <br /> <br /> After many shots of animals doing "fun" things in the background of "Pivotal" scenes, not to mention a full five minutes focusing on an old woman working in a doctor's office Weekly comes to change her diaper, or the fact that this movie is actually about Lindsay Lohan's character who is sexually abused by her stepfather, Georgia Rule creates her own movie genre: The Unbound, the Terribly Hateful, Inappropriate Comedy that deals with extremely serious topics in awkward, surreal, weird ways. If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama / comedy, he should have seen The Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. Junebug And so on. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way I can get a reader to understand the terrible genre that Georgia Rule falls into is to create a hypothetical situation. Suppose that the movie The 40 Year Old Virgin was about the fact that the main character was celibacy because he was sexually molested as a child. But instead of taking the movie more dramatically, tummy chills and comedy would follow, and all the characters' reactions were fake, lifeless people pretending to be worried. <br /> <br /> Take a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney as the flattest, most non-dimensional character that could have been cut out of this poorly written script, along with a male character throwing away all his religious faith and morality, to be with a trashy, too tanned girl who does not have the same interests as he does, as well as an unnecessary chase, unrealistic moments of characters trying to relate to each other, and you have Georgia rule. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was an insult to anyone dealing with filmmakers, screenwriters, actors, editors, and so on. They have much more talent and are not noticed enthusiastically. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> And if you have to, get drunk enough before hand.
