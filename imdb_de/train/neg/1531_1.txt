This movie is so bad that I had to vomit. Badly produced, a non-laugh zone. Why would you fake a movie in the name of God that is, to some degree, a parody (and a damn funny movie)? The sets are ridiculous, the effects so bad that they are not even ridiculous, and the acting farce. It's a complete mystery why you should even consider this garbage chunk. National Lampoon used to do Animal House, which people still find totally and totally weird. Now they were condemned to make TV movies like this lump ****. Name your intention and it could be used exactly to describe this movie.
