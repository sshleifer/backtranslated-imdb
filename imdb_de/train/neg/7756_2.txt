I remember seeing ATTACK when it first came out and was recently caught again. The sci-fi channel has gone worse, but not much. ATTACK is a shameless rip-off of Jurassic Park and replaces Saber-toothed cats with dinosaurs. And they are at large and devour as many extras as possible. The CGI is pretty bad and close-up of cat's heads are ridiculous. We get some gore, which helps a bit. Wait until you see the mad scientist who started this mess get it. Apart from Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, the cast is unknown. Apparently this was filmed in Fiji. Good job, if you can get it. Reminds me of all those cheap monster STVs that were popular in the 80's and 90's.
