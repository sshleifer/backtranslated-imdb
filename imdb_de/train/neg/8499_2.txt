This is something that only now thrilled the movie heads. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush knows that real men do not see anything about Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It might have been interesting if Truffaut had something to say here. The motive of the camera as a voyeur was nothing new. Have we all forgotten De Sica's "bicycle thief"? Or anything from Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> So all we get is the adolescent metaphor as Truffaut, who spends all his free time turning his eyes in the cinema, destroys the discipline of the schoolroom, is accused of plagiarism (the many small thefts) and eventually escapes social boundaries to make "his own film". Sorry ... was already too often not to change it.
