In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio can make a Western, with the exception of Warner Bros. The few times they try, it's always ridiculous (except maybe because they fell to the ground with their boots - which is a Western cavalry). I read that Humphrey Bogart, who saw James Cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head, said that he looks like a mushroom. True! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, in their twenties, to be credible in a Western movie. The story here was no surprise and did not help. I think every ten minutes I see Bogart and Cagney drop their small rifles and put their hands in a machine gun to get off the set in a black 1930s car.
