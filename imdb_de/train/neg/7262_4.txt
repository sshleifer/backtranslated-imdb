There are some really great ideas in this violent film that, if clearly stated, could have made him a bit of spaghetti western fatigue. Unfortunately, A TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst-edited movies imaginable! Scenes begin and end abruptly, characters retreat for long stretches, actors' portrayals (and accents) are rather inconsistent, etc. Robert Shaw is a Mexican (!) Revolutionary who, after attending, wipes out a village, remains a priest. !) ... Ten years later, the village is run by "Mayor" Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens seeks revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau comes in search of Shaw. They all yell MUCH and they shoot themselves MUCH. Fernando Rey is also there (as a blind person). The performances are not bad, but they are very different. Savalas sometimes has an accent, as does Landau (who really rubs here). Shaw and Rey prove that they are not able to really embarrass themselves, and Stevens looks a bit spotty (albeit a little blurry among the sweaty dirt).
