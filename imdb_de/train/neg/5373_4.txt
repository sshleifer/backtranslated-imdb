This is a classic example of an increasing problem with movies. Why is the background noise and soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue? What sense does that make? This movie is not alone. Most movies seem to do that now. I wondered for two years if my TV is just not right, but then I have a new TV and there it is again. BACKGROUND Sounds that could play a city block behind the actors drown out the dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this movie, it was even more distracting, as the woman in the English version is always mumbling anyway. I always hoped Jean Reno would say, "Excuse me, would you say something or get the marbles out of your mouth?" If you watch it on DVD and even have French in high school, I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I give 4 because Reno was so good in Leon. People are raving about the landscape, but I've seen them on TV and I lived in the Rocky Mountains for a few years, so "Enh."
