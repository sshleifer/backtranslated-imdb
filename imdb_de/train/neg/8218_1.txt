I never finished this movie for a reason, it was awful and that's just acting. I was not even sure what the movie was about, but it made no sense and the violence was terrible. I usually say I like acting in a movie (lol), but it was just sick because of what happened. ALL the characters annoyed me and it was just full of screams and the camera shook in parts and it looked like a continuation of Blair's project but without good features. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time and would like to take my time back. I would not recommend or even consider this movie to anybody. (N)
