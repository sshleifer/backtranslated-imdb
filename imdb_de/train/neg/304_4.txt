In this movie, Ruth is portrayed as a female, hard drinking, playing and overeating of a sports figure with a small baseball. Babe Ruth's early life was quite interesting and this was left out in every way in this film. Even Lou Gehrig was barely covered and this was a familiar relationship, good or bad, it should have been better than it was. His life was worse than anything else. He was an American hero, an icon, after which many baseball greats coined their lives. I feel like I'm living up to the memory of a great baseball player completely ignored by this movie. Shame on the creators of this film because he benefits from his mistakes and not from his size.
