Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha, ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he has murdered the previous one. Although he witnesses how a treasure was buried, he loses his memory and the treasure map he receives becomes empty. So Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you have an ad for that?) And help direct the path to the treasure. It's amazing how anyone could have financed this pointless movie. The former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as a director, and with Medak's talents in The Ruling Class, you can probably guess which of the grainy, poorly lit scenes Milligan was sitting on the director's chair. Peter Boyle performs briefly as the damned pirate captain in the first 10 minutes of the movie. He's probably pretty grateful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year as this was filmed and canned so he can keep it out of his resume. Franciosa looks like the good-looking scratch behind the scenes, but both he and the salesman look pretty desperate, even Sellers' make-up and hair look pretty awful. They needed to know that this movie was bombing as they filmed it. With such lines, I can understand any discomfort: <br /> <br /> PIERRE: (being hanged right now) You will pay for it. <br /> <br /> SCRATCHER: No, I have not won. I do it for free. <br /> <br /> And that's one of the good jokes. For me, it's amazing that much of Seller's productive material is still in the vaults, but this was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago! How about someone stepping on the plate and releasing the well-received British TV show "A Show Called Fred" starring Sellers, Milligan, directed by Richard Lester, in the US?
