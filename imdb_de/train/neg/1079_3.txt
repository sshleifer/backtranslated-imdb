I feel like I'm the only boy in the city annoyed by Branagh's performance. He's a good actor in most reports, but he just could not dissuade the Southern accent. I mean, it was regrettable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank. One of the previous critics asked why American actors were not cast in this movie. I agree with this idea. It's wonderful when actors / actresses want to broaden their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard to make a performance tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he's such a great director. <br /> <br /> Well, I really do not want to beat Branagh too much for his absolutely vile accent. Everyone deserves to mess up here and there. But it's hard to see something so annoying that you'd rather choke on a chicken's bone or eat a bucketful of dung than sit by the gingerbread man.
