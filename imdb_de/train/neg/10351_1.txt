This movie barely followed the plot of the movie. All the fascinating points in the book did not even exist in the film. In the end, they turned into a cheesy "between" Disney movie "Crush" story between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad that Hillary Duff should play the role or one of the likes. This movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book. I can not believe that Disney could get away with such a cheap basic rendition. If you have ever read the book, you would agree that it could easily become a movie about the equality of Lord of the Rings. This movie could never have used the title A Wrinkle in Time. Poorly made
