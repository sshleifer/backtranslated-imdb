It's a really cheesy parody of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones, the funny, and the acting. But it's after all a soft core movie that's expected and does not matter, because what you really want is sex. What brings me to the biggest problem of all, there is hardly any of it. They feel like watching TV and running the independent films at 3am, and the one who's running was made by a college kid who gets nowhere in the industry. They have a very long time to wait for a real sex scene, often thinking that something is going to happen and then just hanging out. However, the one (maybe two or one with two parts) actually going somewhere is very enjoyable. Personally, I can not recommend that if you did not find it for a dollar or two in an empty container. If you have a good movie with a plot and good acting, you do not want that. If you are looking for a good lesbian softcore movie, you do not want it either.
