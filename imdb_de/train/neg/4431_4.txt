This tormenting comedy drama received surprisingly incredible reviews when it was released in 1979. I remember opening the LA Times movie section and a 2-page ad for "Chapter Two" with glowing captions like "Better than The Goodbye Girl!" And "Neil Simon Do It Again!" What's Neil doing? Simon? He takes on an autobiographical situation (remarrying too early after the death of a beloved spouse) and roasts it, unpleasant and, least of all, gruff, James Caan plays Neil - uh ... that is, George - a writer who does not seem to come back to life after the loss of his wife, give the spirited Marsha Mason (real Mrs. Simon ... who is about to become ex-wife Simon) trying to George despite his moods and general melancholy Mason is very appealing here and might have saved the day if Caan had not been indifferent (not to mention a subplot about the painfully thin, blonde Valerie Harper, the Pr ozess stops). I liked Mason's breakout at the end ("I'm wonderful! I'm NUTS because of me!"), But I did not see a happy ending for these two guys ... and time has proved me right. ** from ****
