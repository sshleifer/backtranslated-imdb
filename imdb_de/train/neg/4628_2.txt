Misty Ayers had a smoking corpse and that was all that this movie was about. Pure exploitation. I started to play a game with myself and counted how often the stick orchestra music was played. And of course, the music has nothing to do with the scenes. A typical example: randomly going into a room and saying "hello" was played with chase music from a Roman epic. I'd like to know why this movie was on the shelves for eleven years before it was released. What I've learned from this film: That there were women's pants with low rise, there was 1954th I speak of Sigourney Weaver in the original alien film panties. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes will slowly pull Misty out and get dressed (except bra and panties, unfortunately). Also contains a dreadful synchronization that leads to a "Achtung! Godzirra!" Leads. effect.
