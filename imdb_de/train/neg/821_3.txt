Stanley Kramer leads an action thriller and lets two important things go: action and thrills. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE identifies Gene Hackman as a convicted prisoner to perform a mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach are his activists - they probably work for the government, but like most of the film's actions, this is never clarified. Hackman asks many questions that NEVER get answered, so the movie is absolutely nowhere to go. As it strives for NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is very well photographed, but that also works against it. Kramer's direction is without style. It is a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> The acting is alright, because Hackman proves that he is quite unable to be bad. Widmark and gelding are suitably evil and Albert is well occupied as Widmark's cruel lackey. Even the usually vile Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's buddy. A curiosity, however, is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We were told that she has a lot of time in prison and she's trying to put on a kind of southern twang. Kramer's idea to make her appear as a trailer rubbish is to let her wear an ugly brown wig. It's a role better suited for people like Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
