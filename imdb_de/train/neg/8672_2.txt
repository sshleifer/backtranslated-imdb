Most action films are gross of Hindi cinema, especially by Sunny and his family. <br /> <br /> The film is a typical Sunny guy with bashes, big dialogues and melodrama. <br /> The film also has a typical Rajiv Rai ingredient for many minions and a weird villain. <br /> <br /> The launch is fine and then the move to Kenya is fine, but then the movie continues and continue. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events moves at a slow pace and nothing great happens <br /> <br /> There are many stupid scenes, as the Kenyan policemen are shown like Joker, especially Sharat. <br /> <br /> The highlight is also extended. <br /> <Rajiv Rai does a good job Music is okay, only 1 song works and that's the last TOOFAN Camera work is good. <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol is as usual, Chunky behaves like a monkey while he is serious scenes are ridiculous, Naseer is fine heroines are made of pure wood Amrish Puri is not even half as scary as in TRIDEV , the rest is okay
