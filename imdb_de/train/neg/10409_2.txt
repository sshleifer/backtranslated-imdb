As if the story were not depressing enough, this film shows how cows are graphically slaughtered every five minutes in a slaughterhouse, while the protagonist tells her early life as a butcher. Funny stuff. Then there is the basic requirement of the hero / heroine cutting off his tail because he is obsessed at work and says he would have gone with him if he was a girl. Is this person a psycho, a masochist, just a damn queen who goes too far? And what traumatic childhood did he have? Except that he was not adopted and had to live with nuns who loved him first and later hated because he was unruly. He tries to explain why he did that, but it's really hard to empathize. Such a sad and unusual self-destruction. Was it fun? What was it really about?
