A reasonable effort is a summary for this movie. A good movie from the sixties, but without success. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance that was credible enough, but not as good as she could have given, other actors were just awful! A terrible presentation. It was not very funny and did not really get its genres because it was not very funny and not dramatic. The only genre that reached a satisfactory level was Romanticism. Target groups were not hit and the film sent confusing messages. A very basic plot and a very simple plot were not well performed or even played well and people were confused as to why the movie was not so good and who the target audience was doing well with moments of performance. <br /> <br /> 4.
