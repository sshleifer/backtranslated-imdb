Jean-Claude Van Damme plays twin brothers Alex and Chad, both martial arts experts who team up to tear down the mobsters responsible for murdering the parents in this empty martial arts actioner who has no plan to do so could better use the gimmick of two Jean-Claude Van Dammes. Some okay action scenes, but this is not one of Van Damme's best.
