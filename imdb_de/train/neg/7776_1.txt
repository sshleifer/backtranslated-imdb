What a junk ... I can not even describe how awful this movie was. The rating here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Especially if you enjoyed the first ginger snaps. The first one was well written, well directed, well executed. A brilliant movie with fantastic aesthetics and atmosphere. The second was "alrite" - decent as an independent film, but clearly not at the level of the first ... The third is an insult to the series, period. I rate the movies at 10, 6, 1. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, and yes, it's really in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all mixed up with a half-hearted-American mythology. The sisters have no real story, no progress or even a clear relationship ... They just try to survive and be 'forever together'. That's about as deep as it gets. <br /> <br /> Staggering that after reading the script, the girls agreed to be in that shit. Oh, and one more thing, staging The action was awful - people regularly appeared out of nowhere as if the girls were turning around and there is a sophisticated candlelight setup with a mystical Aborigine sitting right there talking in a speech. The sets were awful and could not escape the fact that everything was obviously grounded in a set, which really did not help. There was always snow outside the camp, but there was no trace inside (... on the set). <br/> <br/> Arrghh ,,, so bad! I really hoped it would be at least as good as the second.
