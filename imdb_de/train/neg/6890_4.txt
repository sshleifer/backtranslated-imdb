... except Jon Heder. This guy has soaked up the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The action sounded entertaining. A 29-year-old Slacker son (Heder) still lives with a widowed mother (Keaton), who happens to meet a new love (Daniels). Slacker's son is jealous and wants to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but those who had occupied Hader would rather have hot dogs on the beach. Heder's performance is annoying, which would be a good thing, as he plays an annoying guy. The problem is that he is a bad actor to lose this act, which makes this guy sympathetic in the finale. In the end, you still wish you could face the guy in person and you're upset about the end. In the future any movie with this guy will be a no-go for me!
