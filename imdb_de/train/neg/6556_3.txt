I bought this on DVD for my brother, who is a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to see it myself at the beginning of this week. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty entertaining piece that contains two completely separate storylines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two. She plays an aspiring Hollywood actress who has had many short-lived relationships. She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (a normal married man with children) after driving her car into the back of his car. After initially feeling hostile, he offers to drive her home because she no longer feels well. Romance eventually turns into tragedy when his wife finds out. What happens in the end that I was not prepared for, but the slow and routine television industry leads any drama out of the plot. <br /> <br /> The other section includes an old studio boss, played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss, but when he's asked to step down, they all realize her career is nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> Time passes but is not that interesting and I'm glad it was not bought for me. I'm not a Michelle Pffeifer fanatic, but she was admittedly the only actor in the film worth seeing, and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. All in all, if you are not a fan of her, avoid this, as this is very routine.
