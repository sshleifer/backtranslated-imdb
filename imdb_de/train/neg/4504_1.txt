A slow, boring and one-dimensional movie! Good casting with clich√©d dialogue, boring plot and soulless directing by marshal! The conventional and predictable history of the most famous form of prostitution on the Asian continent lacks in heart, new insights and depth. The main character looks due to their tiny, physical and fake-looking contact lenses. The encyclopedia used by the geishas sounds forced and a bit too sophisticated to be limited in the educational pathways. The story continues for hours, trying to convince you that this small, boring, flat-chested Asian is the ultimate geisha. She says in the film "She is destined to become a legend". The film is just boring, it is beautiful to look at, it has a lot of interesting moments, as many as you can find at cigars. Basically, if you do not believe the bot, you do not believe the message, and that girl did not fill the shoe! Borin, boring, skip it!
