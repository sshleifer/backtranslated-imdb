It's been almost 30 years and I still hate everyone involved in this movie. It is still the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before I saw that, I never really cared about Rivers, one way or the other. After seeing this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally see it on TV. <br /> <br /> I was - contrary to my better judgment - dragged through peer pressure. However, when they came out of the theater, these friends swore that they would never pick my film choices. Nearly thirty years later, we still carry mental scars from this movie. <br /> <br /> On my deathbed, one of my regrets is the time I wasted in hoping that this movie could get better. That never did. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the choice, you would prefer to focus your own eyes on sitting, though this movie. <br /> <br /> I have been looking for IMDb comments only in the I hope I can warn others about this movie. If I can save only one person from watching, my existence on this earth would be justified.
