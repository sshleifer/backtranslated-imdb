That was a horrible movie! I gave him 2 points, one for Angelina Jolie and a second for the beautiful Porsche in the beginning ... Apart from the fact that the story was just crappy and cars racing through the cities, 1970 was not that new I was the most annoyed rarely seen something so constructed!
