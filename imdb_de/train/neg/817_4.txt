"They will not shoot these little creatures, first, they did not harm you, second, they may be radioactive." Ah, the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi? Despite this strange gemstone, Superman and the Mole-Men are quite uninspiring even with a 58-minute runtime. It's more than cheap (which one shot of Superman flies incredibly few animated pictures) and quite boring, even though it has a surprisingly altruistic message? The dumb mole-men, tiny actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like Muxzptlk hatless than underground animals released from their underground world by oil drilling, are not malicious, just misunderstood, and George Reeves's Man of Steel Trials to prevent the townspeople led by Jeff Corey killing them. An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.
