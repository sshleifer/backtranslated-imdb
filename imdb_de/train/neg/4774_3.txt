I am not sure if the filmmakers are looking for a Saw-like movie or 12 Angry Men (people have put the facts together to learn the truth). Whatever it was, it was done badly and it's not worth looking at it. <br /> <br /> I do not look for blood and blood, but since this film had little else to offer, he should have really shown it killing More. Most were out of the camera to minimize the horror we were supposed to experience from the deaths. <br /> <br /> It also puzzled me that the policeman was among the victims; He unwittingly contributed to the innocent young man's imprisonment by accepting evidence (given to him by MJH) into the evidence room. (And would not MJH, the prosecution, have had access to this evidence - taken out and returned false evidence - anyway, would not she have needed the policeman's help?). The others often did not realize it was the person who hurt them, but they still played bigger roles in his last demise. The arms dealer should know that his weapons are used for evil purposes. The insurer refused a person who was obviously in need, and so on. But the police's crime seemed small by comparison, as he did not know exactly what he was doing. The filmmakers could have taken it a step further if he had been the one to encourage MJH to provide evidence that would have made him more guilty. And MJH's cry that he (the policeman) got her into this mess makes no sense at all. <br /> <br /> It would be more fascinating if every person died in a way that gave the others a clue why he / she was there and deserved to die. The insurer, for example, would have rammed the motions he had rejected into his throat and suffocated them. The Oriental woman could have eroded her eyes because she was a false witness, etc. Yes, more violent than the weapon, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was not funny, there were no twists, and the end was one of the worst (if not the worst) I've ever seen. The end down threw three stars off my rating. <br /> <br /> The actors did a decent job, especially given the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with. <br /> <br /> All in all a waste of time.
