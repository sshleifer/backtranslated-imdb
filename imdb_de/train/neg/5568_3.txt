Dolph Lundgren plays a lead role as a former cop / boxer who searches Boston's kinky scene to find out who killed his brother, who was well considered in the community. However, he learns how his brother enjoyed kinky sex and that having a serial killer is part of guilt. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this movie. In fact, because of his performance, one would forget that Lundgren's rise to action roles became famous. However, the material does not give Lundgren anything to work with. In fact, in a drab thriller that is both predictable and incomprehensible, Lundgren is left completely dry. Co-star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact the movie works best when he focuses on the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett. If the movie really took the time to explore their relationship, the movie would have been pretty decent. However, the film is lackluster, the storyline is not there, the plot is not sufficiently explored (boring BS for Lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is unnecessarily bloody and ridiculous. Once again, Lundgren is really good (like newcomer Danielle Brett), but the movie only runs from one sequence to the next, which makes this movie especially disappointing. As something else, however, shows how underestimated Lundgren is as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 Out Of 4- (Poor)
