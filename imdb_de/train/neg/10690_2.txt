I think it's possible I've seen worse movies, but this one is a real stinker! The plot is unremarkable, but that's not the worst. The direction is not close to what you expect from Andy Ching. He is capable of doing a good job but could not pull this movie together. Angie Harmon played the main female role as a reporter, who was behind the murder of the president and really slaughtered the role. There was no chemistry for good, her appearance was flat and made of wood, and the 5-inch spikes she wore throughout the film were absurd. This excursion to harmony places her firmly at the top of the "b" list. <br /> <br /> and what was Cuba thinking? He has a number of outstanding achievements, but that was far below what we expect from him. <br /> <br /> Poor James Woods and Burt Reynolds. Poor poor poor poor Poor.
