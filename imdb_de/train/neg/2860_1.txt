This movie has only a 1, because you can not give zero! If you have a weak stomach, do not pay attention to ALL. Human rights people you do not want to see. it makes people into vegetarians I swear, I've seen how it happens! The only cool parts are the case and the fact that it is a true story. It's really scary that this guy worked for ADT while he killed people! Are you still sure if you type this little code? not me! He had access to every code in Kansas !!!!!! I hated the movie, it was not scary, it was mentally scary! Do yourself a favor and do not buy this movie. I think it costs about $ 20 to include your over paying actors !!!!
