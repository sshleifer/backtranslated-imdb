For some reason, in the late '70s and early' 80s, the local CBS station in New York played this film on Friday or Saturday night for some years in its late-night period, usually at 2 am or some other time. It's a fitting movie for this timeline, as it's very hard to follow and pretty weird (see the other reviews for specific story information). Anyway, after catching it several times in the days just before cable TV (and even after it was hit, but before much was offered all night), I began to notice that little weirdness. After not seeing it for many years, I decided to find it on DVD. Well, it's just (from every search I've done anyway) in a pretty lousy, grainy print on the budget label "Brentwood Video" as part of a 4-pack of movies (4 movies on 2 double-sided discs) named "" available. Alien Worlds "if anyone is interested, it's usually available for around $ 10 - but much less if you look around.The other 3 films in this set are available in numerous other collections of public domain films and do not need commenting But I have not seen "Eyes" anywhere else, and although it is in no way a "recovered" version, this expression runs exactly 92 minutes, so the specified runtime of 90 minutes is incorrect for IMDb With a running time of 92 minutes, it's not uncommon for a movie that has been translated into English from another language to also reduce some of the running time, and it seems to be a common practice of the budget conscience to sometimes save money by playing it Do not bother dubbing some scenes if they are not considered important to the story, making a longer version less confusing Who really knows - unless you saw it in his native language ... By the way, my attempts to see it during the day do not work and I just turn it off. It's something in the middle of the night to see what's right in this movie. Or maybe it's just from my previous experience, who knows?
