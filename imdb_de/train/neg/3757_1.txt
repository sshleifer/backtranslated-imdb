How did that come about? I generally love Sci F / Bigfoot, no matter what movies, etc. but I still expect them to be written without so much cheese. The effects were sad, the lines were sadder. Avoid at all costs. I only rented it because it was in the wrong case (I was looking for the Sasquatch movie with Lance Henrikson - I have not seen that yet). The idea of ​​the movie is actually good. There was a lot of potential for making a great little movie here. I just do not understand how it ends up like this. Talk to interested students from Film / Art / English at any high school and you'll find people who can write a better script.
