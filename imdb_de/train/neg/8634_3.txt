A photo of a man attacked by zombies gave me hope that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci could handle his old tricks. Apart from the close-ups of a rotting corpse, in this story, there's no suggestion of killing a wealthy man and his daughter's search to find out who killed him. None of the characters is appealing and if you figure out how they did it (at least that phrase was cool), stop worrying about it. The only good thing I can say is that it made more sense than Nightmare Concert!
