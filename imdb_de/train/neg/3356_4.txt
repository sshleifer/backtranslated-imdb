The Shirley-Jackson novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is an atmospheric story of terror that conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion. The atmosphere is well laid out and the cold is well staged. A haunting masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The 1963 chiller The Haunting stays close to the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, there are only a few, and the horror of the book and the chill is even better on the screen. The black-and-white photography only adds to the eerieness of the film. Excellent! <br /> <br /> And then Jan de Bont did that. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting appeared in theaters - if you could call that remake. Why they had to do a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself, but let's first look at the movie itself. <br /> <br /> It starts off as normal as most horror movies. The set used for Hill House is beautiful and strangely mysterious, and for a few minutes it seems like the movie is actually a pretty good reissue. And then comes the first fear: A loose harpsichord wire cuts the face of a woman (Dr. Marrows assistant). This is hilarious, and to be honest, it almost moved me to tears. <br /> <br /> From then on, the movie just turns down. Acting seems a bit bumpy as the movie progresses, with Owen Wilson's character particularly irritating (it's such relief when beheaded by the fireplace). <br /> <br /> The special effects make this movie handy. , which is a pity, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very outdated. There are numerous examples, so I will not bother to list them. <br /> <br /> So, overall, along with hundreds of others, I strongly recommend that you buy the original cooler or, alternatively, buy the novel by Shirley Jackson. But please, stay away. And if you decide to watch the video, watch it on TV (as many channels show this movie and not the original) or rent cheap, but please do not buy it, whatever you do. Do not waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final rating: 4/10
