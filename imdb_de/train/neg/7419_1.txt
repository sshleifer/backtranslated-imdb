This movie was horrible and an insult to the viewer. Stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom. <br /> <br /> In the usual tradition of Hollywood, the US government is always portrayed as angry. The Communist sympathizer in Hollywood, most of whom are as stupid as a box of stones, loves to take lonely spinner Eugene McCarthy and introduce him as the leader of a huge movement. The truth is that at the time he was considered a marginal figure exploiting a legitimate concern for the Soviet Communists for political reasons. Oh yes, and the US has taken on all these evil Nazis. Like Werner Von Braun, without whom we would not have a space program. He actually loved being an American and became a big asset to the country. <br /> <br /> And yet, the irony is that the dunderheads in Hollywood, an uneducated bunch who lives a fantasy, still believe that the government should govern EVERYTHING and give us everything we want. And yet this is the same government that they always portray in such films as a complete evil.
