I have the courage to tell you that you should stay away from Dahmer, the biographical film based on the grotesque serial killer's real story. 'Dahmer' is more about the mentality of his focused subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered over 15 young men and consumed some of his body parts, was probably the most ineffective serial killer of our generation. The really sick people, however, are the filmmakers of this terrible spectacle, who should have their heads examined before deciding to make this terrible "Dahm" project greener. This is not a simple movie to digest, though Jeffrey offers it with some fiery Brainsadillas appetizers or even some real Mr. Potato Bowls. * Errors
