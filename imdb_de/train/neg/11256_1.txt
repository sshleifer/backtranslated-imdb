What a waste of time! I tried to sit through "Sky Captain .." about 6 times, and each time I start doing something else in about 3 minutes - everything else! It's a boring movie, acting awful, writing boring. And of course a first director because it's stiff. And I wanted to love it. I love sci-fi, the old cliffhangers, and I can appreciate trying to nod Flash Gordon and Metropolis, but my God, what a god! Waste of money: I used to work for Paramount Pictures, and I had Sherry Lansing in 1993 over the Use of blue screens written for screen tests. She told me they were never interested or needed to do it. 10 years later Paramount appears this piece of crap. Sherry was right in 1993, but she had forgotten her own advice when she had this dog on. Blue Screen was an effect shot, but not a whole movie. Not to mention, neither Jude nor Jolie are great actors (but simple.) In the eyes) Paltrow's performance reminds me of an effort at high school. Too bad it might work but only under an experienced director. The funny part is that Sky Captain's director will continue to work after this mess. It's trade, not art!
