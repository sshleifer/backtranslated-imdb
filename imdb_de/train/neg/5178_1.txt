I feel like it's my duty as a lover of horror movies to warn other people about this horrible and very bad "horror" movie. Do not waste your time or money on this movie, acting is bad, history is just one of the worst I've ever seen, and the script was just awful. None of that was good, you're thinking in the end why I look at this crap. The plot had so many holes and they were never cleared in the end, it was just so bad, I do not know how such a horrible movie could be made. Like I said, I love horror movies and I was so disappointed it was an 18, but you see little blood and no fear or jumps. What annoyed me was how stupid things were going on in the movie that did not make any sense at all, like brother and sister kissing each other. Why? is all i can say. Do not bother, there are far more great horror movies, do not waste your time. Life is too short.
