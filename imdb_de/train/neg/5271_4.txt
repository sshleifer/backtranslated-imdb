A squabbling American family vacationing in the West discovers a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. They hardly know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs, and they are pursuing a deadly presence. I generally love such mystery horror movies. "Cube", Spielberg's "Duel" and "The Birds" are great examples of films that do not give answers, but are still fascinating and want more. Apparently, the "disappearance" writer / director Walter Klenhard has tried to do just that kind of movie. Whether he succeeded or not is up to the viewer. Personally, I think he came halfway there, then the movie is just lost. <br /> <br /> The actors are all just bumblebees. You are not terribly bad, but we as viewers never really feel their fear and react to unrealistic situations. Is someone else absolutely sick of characters who just go out to investigate strange sounds?!?!? Give them at least some reasons!?!?!? <br /> <br /> As far as TV movies are concerned, this is certainly an above-average fair. Director Klenhard Should be praised for having really milked the desert environment for everything she has to offer, and some of the scenery was striking. There's a really cool scene in which two characters find an old nuclear test site where the sand has completely melted into glass as far as the eye can see. I wonder if that was real? <br /> <br /> No bunch to talk about, and the "creatures" or whatever, hell, it's after these people, never shown, let alone we never have a real one Indicate what they are (mutants, aliens, ghosts, or ancient evil Indian spirits, oh, that's what makes us so close!) Or where they come from. <br /> <br /> Again, there are many clich√©s. Why is Town Folk always really stupid in such films? Why is there always an old man everyone thinks crazy, which turns out to be right? Why? Why? Why? How about a NEW scenario, people! <br /> <br /> "Disappearance" tries to be different and intelligent, but ultimately fails because we are too familiar with fans of direct-to-video horror feed in many ways. Hey, I have seen much worse movies and disappearance is not bad, it's just too? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
