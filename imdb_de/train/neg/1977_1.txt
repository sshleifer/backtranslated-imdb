Wait, do not tell me ... They threw the movie out and kept the out takes. You know, this movie could have been filmed in a back alley in New York. The Gangster Bangster, I think. Gangster Rap, designer gangster-duster clothing, including the scarf that was pulled from the neck to protect against the dust storms to the head. I think it should protect the head from the heat filtered through the K-Mart hats. "Budget rent-a-horsie", it seems, supplied the horses. The one-bedroom scene in which the girl was talking and the man uttering her words ... I thought he was talking. You know, watching this movie just confirms that it's not about acting anymore ... it's about looks and money. Could not have been too much as far as this movie is concerned. All in all, I think that this movie will go down as the worst movie of all time. Only one more thing, where was Ice T? Did he finally go to Oprah?
