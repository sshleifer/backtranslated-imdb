I know Slashers should always be bad, but come on, what the hell is this? It's as if a bunch of ten-year-olds had saved their lunch money and started filming it at the end of their week. <br /> <Anyway, six young people go to the same house to be killed by the computer screen. We have the head, the slut, the other slut, the black man, the murderer, such clichÃ©s. After one is eaten by one When shaking the boat, the others are chased by a guy wearing a mask that the people at the poor box have rejected. Somewhere in the middle there is a pretty decent murder, but then it comes back to even more boredom and, above all, more false anxiety. We really know that it can not be the killer when a person is attacked because the guy loves his sweet time for everything. <br /> <br /> After every character you wanted to die, the ugly blonde chick dies and her soon-to-be friend is finally captured by the killer (they are crushed down and then fainted) and the killer reveals himself I guess The authors of this movie have just taken a blindfold and a pen and placed somewhere on the list of characters. The motive is just lame and does not make me start with the damn mystery. Of course, the killer will spend too much time explaining everything (and then about ten minutes more, cutting his own arm for some reason) and eventually being overwhelmed by a man with a gun. Hey, not fair! <br /> <br /> Really one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I could have more fun watching a Lindsay Lohan movie, I swear it. I mean, most 80s slashers suck, but at least they threw something. T & A has nothing to offer.
