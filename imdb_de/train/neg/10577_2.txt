Some of the filmmakers participating in this series have made some really great films, but they are sure that they do not show much skill with this series. Especially the writing. OK, first season was a little better, but these new episodes are just stinky. I'm a big fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these consequences are total garbage. Nothing new or really interesting. Only a few of them are visually creative. It's just typically fabricated Hollywood crap, uninteresting, childish, ill-considered, and in some cases completely ridiculous. Like the stories from the tomb, the only good thing this series offers is a great nudity! Otherwise this series will blow hard. I sometimes get the impression that they hired a bunch of eighth-graders to write the episodes. Maybe they did it.
