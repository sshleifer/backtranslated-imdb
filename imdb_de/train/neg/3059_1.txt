Okay, I recently had the opportunity to rent this and watch Santa conquer the Martins. Although the children in SCCTM were much more sadistic, I must say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a Spanish task in Spanish 5, we all had to look at each other. I'm telling you, we usually only talk when we see and eat a movie, but not for this movie. Everyone remained open wondering what the evil Mr. Pitch would do next. Would Merlin help Santa Claus? or would his robotic reindeer save the day? I would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish that I have ever seen and that's why I love it. : D
