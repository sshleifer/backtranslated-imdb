This movie is a farce! Names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is distorted into something that no literary lover can recognize. And they have the gift of giving Beowulf a ridiculous cannon / crossbow weapon. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! In the poem he rips off Grendel's arm with his bare hands! And I can not believe the scriptwriters did that. The presentation of Grendel, however, is impressive. That and the cast are the only positive points of the feature. My English teacher would go crazy if she saw this abomination. If you're an avid fan of the epic "Beowulf", you should avoid this movie at all costs. And even then I would not recommend it.
