<br /> <br /> The movie begins as an ordinary comic-hero movie. It's about the boy who's being picked up, has no parents and is in love with the # 1 girl in the school. Nothing surprising in the film, there is nothing that you can not guess in the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us that he is either not a good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this. Maybe children can enjoy the movie at the age of ten, but for the youngest it's a bit violent. You can not think of movies like X-Men, Batman and Spawn. All these titles are better. I almost went out the last 20 minutes! One thing that might have been good was the computer animation. So my recommendation: Do not watch this movie, even if you get paid for it!
