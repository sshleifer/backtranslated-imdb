This is a very old and cheaply produced movie - in many ways a typical low budget B western. Gary Cooper was not a star yet, and this movie is reminiscent of John Wayne's early films shot for "Poverty Series" studios. Both actors had not fully developed their familiar style and personality. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not seem to be just the Cooper of a few years later (he speaks faster in this early film, among others). <br /> <br /> In contrast to the average B-movie of At this time, there are at least some interesting elements that make the film unique (though not good). If you ever want to see the woman who was married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita is the female love interest and this is a very, very strange casting choice, as she has a strong accent (she was French) and was not even close to being a "movie star". By the way, she was also married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But for me, the most memorable and weirdest aspect of the movie is the seemingly gay subplot - something of a 1930s BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (and we thought this was a NEW idea). Gary Cooper's character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can to keep Cooper away from women. This misogyny alone does not necessarily mean much, but there is so much evidence throughout the film that suggests that the creators of the film have really tried to portray it as a gay couple. In particular, towards the end, when one of them is killed, the other is shot by an arrow and keeps dying so long that he can crawl to the body of his fallen friend and then falls - with his arms around him! This was pretty nervous for the time and I think that makes this boring movie really fascinating today! As for Cooper and the plot, the film is a bit disappointing and very skippable. If you are not curious about it or the homosexual undertones, do yourself a favor and find a better western.
