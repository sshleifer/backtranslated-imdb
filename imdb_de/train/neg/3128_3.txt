... from this horrible movie! There are so many things wrong with this film, like acting, writing, directing, editing, etc., that it's amazing that something comes to the top and turns out to be the absolute worst. The music! I noticed that the film has two composers. This must be the reason why every single frame has music, the absolute worst "D" movie style. You have never heard of the phrase "less is more". It was so painful to hear, I muffled the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was so good. You have to apologize for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they did not see such roles in the twilight of their careers. See it at your own risk.
