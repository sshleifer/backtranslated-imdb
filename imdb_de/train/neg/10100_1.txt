I usually support independent art, and I try to be very comprehensive and tolerant. I tend to support everyone because their efforts are worth limits! <br /> <br /> Imagine the following situation: <br /> <br /> 1. Think of the worst horror movie you've ever seen in your life. <br /> <br /> 2. Think of a great, attractive ART for the DVD box of this film ... and a promising storyline ... <br /> <br /> 3. voil√†! You have ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> You only see it when you really have nothing better to do. EVERYTHING is better.
