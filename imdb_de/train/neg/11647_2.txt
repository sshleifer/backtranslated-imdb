CRIME BOSS is headed by Alberto De Martino. an Italian thriller that was shot in part in Hamburg. A slightly forgotten movie. Despite a good chase, this strip seems almost aimless. A new Don takes over a powerful mafia family and struggles for his own life. Unwritten laws and ethics of the mafia code make it hard to trust someone, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence breed in return. This can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics. Just the look of the film evokes memories of the American drive-in tariff. Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas can not improve the caliber of this thriller. Antonio Sabato also plays with Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
