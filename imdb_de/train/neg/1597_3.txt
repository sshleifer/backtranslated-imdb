This film is a classic of emotions, not the quality of filmmaking. It moves from the improbable to the unbelievable, from the unrealistic to the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The incredible conspiracy revolves around the attempt of two British soldiers and a Hindu Gofer to rescue a third soldier who was captured by an insurgent Indian In the later scene we see a full regiment with a drum and Bagpipe marching in an ambush. In the British Army, a sergeant does not order a rescue attempt, and if you pass it, he will not try it with just another soldier and an Indian servant if a full regiment is available. The Indian insurgents are so incredibly unfit that it's ridiculous ... there are hundreds of them, but they can not hold their prisoner or kill the two saviors, of course not. At one point, we see British soldiers throwing stone blocks from insurgents' battlements scattered around the mountainside in an ambush ... you'd have to have an eggplant for a brain to believe would do any damage. After Cary Grant has shot the rescued prisoner, he lies on the ground and looks at the water boys ... hardly the actions of someone who was shot in the back. The water boy bravely blows a bugle (coming from nowhere) to trigger the alarm ... he does that by standing high on the wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys, and we lose a tear He keeps trying to hear more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the trumpet call breaks into faint squawks ... instead of blowing the trumpet while hiding behind cover, as anyone with half a brain would. This scene was rightly parodied in comedy sketches. If they wanted to do a Buster Keaton comedy, they should have hired Keaton and done better.
