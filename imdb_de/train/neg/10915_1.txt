I believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war, avoid idealism, and respect some rudimentary military principles. Zvezda barely makes the first. Since Zvezda was a Russian war film, I expected patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic images, a lush score, Slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans. What I did not need was the naive love affair, the unrealistic stupid war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a movie that carefully avoided all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust) just to end up with a passport but offensive to our sense of the historical endnote about "the liberation of Poland". A missed opportunity as a movie, but obviously not as propaganda.
