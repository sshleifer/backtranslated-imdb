Whatever you do, do not waste time with this purpose. Movie. A remake that did not have to be retold. Everyone who came out of the theater had the same comments. The worst movie I have ever seen. Save time and money! <br /> <br /> Nicgolas Cage cycled downhill, swam in the murky waters and rolled downhill while being attacked by bees, but his suit was still perfectly pressed and the shirt crisp white last scene. <br /> <br /> Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage was acting, she was as incredible as the movie. It's amazing how good actors can make such bad movies. Do not get a copy of the script first. If you are still interested in seeing the movie at least, wait until it appears on DVD.
