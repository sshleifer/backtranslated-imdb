I am a black man who lives in a predominantly black city. That being said, I have some reservations about Tyler Perry's work. I know that some people feel the need to praise him because he is black and tries to convey a positive image of the culture. But honestly, Perry White would have been the NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson all over his butt. <br /> <br /> I was forced to watch this movie to hell recently and every repeated viewing makes my blood boil. The characters are poorly written and traded. The jokes are so bad that I have to be told that something should be funny. I'm just going to tear down that big pile of sh-t. <br /> <br /> Madea = suck. The character may have had some attraction, but he does not. If the only thing she ever seems to do is to deal with children and threaten adults by force, she is less than useless. It is not necessary. <br /> <br /> The situation in which the woman beat her fiance was common. If a woman was scared to death of her husband, why should she run away while sleeping in bed? Would not it have made more sense if she had left when he was at work? Anyway, the characters in this sheet were so annoying and overbearing that I hoped he would throw them off the balcony and was royally ticked if he did not. <br /> <br /> Then there are the two love birds. A bus driver asks a woman by harassing her while he makes his rounds. I could not believe it. I really could not believe it when she agreed to go out with him even more. But what the cake needs is that a grown man threw stones at a window and passed notes like a ten-year-old by a castrating mega-slut. I do not use that term lightly, but this woman had only two modes. Morose victim and psychomama. No matter which of these two faces she showed, there was one constant. The bus driver would not get one. He even married her without tasting the goods - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there is the family reunion scene. Here we have the mother burden, which includes implicit inzestual taboos, grinding for grinding, shirtless, overly muscular, B-ball, and the great taste of Maya Angelou. When these babes dragged their butts outside and called a meeting, it was wrong to wish that the oldest of them was being attacked by a heart attack. All the crap comes down to reuniting in ridiculously easy-to-distinguish groups and then they ring a bell. When they do, they drop their jobs and set out on a rigorous conversation, just like a pack of Pawlow's Doggies - WTF !! Then you have the last five minutes of the movie. In it we see how the abusive fianc√©e is abused by his longtime victim and the evil actress. There is a spontaneous wedding where black people are dressed like angels and hanging from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason to see it so far apart from testing the pain threshold is the hope that the second villain in this story will also get her ass. You know, it does not happen. Instead, Perry takes the hectically challenged route and plays it safe. The film ends with a tone of forgiveness - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that if I could get a day, I could probably write a PhD on how annoying this movie is. Do not even let me start with the rest of Tyler Perry's movies. I will only say that. In my opinion, as Schwarzer, D.W. Griffith's legacy lives on. The irony is that this is done by a black man who is praised for doing what Birth of a Nation did, and selling us down the river. I just wish Perry's films were dudes so I could kick them nuts. Thank you, dude !! What are you going to watch in 2009 with a comedy about rape and wild beatings of slaves in Colonial America?
