The film begins with people on Earth finding out that their rocket had not been lost to Mars, but was only moving in space near our planet. When called, one of the crew members is ill, one lives and the other two are missing. What happened to them is told through a flashback of the surviving member. <br /> <br /> On Mars, the crew was apparently attacked by a whole lot of very silly, eyed monsters. While the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the stupidest I've seen in the movie. In a strange attempt at realism, the production also used a process called "cinemagic." Unfortunately, this wonderful innovation made the movie look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of Mars AND the intensity of the redness made my eyes bleed - it was so bad !! Despite the whole cheese, the film had a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message regarding space travel. For lovers of the genre it is worth a visit. For others, you might find it rather stupid - see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Even though by today's standards, this is not a particularly good sci-fi movie compared to the films being filmed at the moment Time is pretty good. <br /> <br /> PS - If you watch the movie, pay close attention to Dr. Ing. Tremayne. He looks like the spitting image of Dr. Quest from the cartoon "Jonny Quest"! In addition, he sounds and behaves very similar.
