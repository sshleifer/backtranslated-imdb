When I heard the first news this morning, I thought, "Wow, finally entertainment." It was a bit amusing for a week or so ... But we have to face it, because these news reporters (if you can even call them that) have way too much time to play around. <br /> <br /> At first I thought Jillian was a breath of fresh air. But seriously, this woman does not have the least amount of journalist in her. She is very unprofessional. She repeatedly interrupts Steve as he informs viewers about a specific message. It just got so annoying that I can not see it anymore. <br /> <br /> Jillian is NOT a good journalist. She is more of a celebrity who loves to be a celebrity. Therefore, she immediately turns into a celebrity celebrity to interview her. She is not very professional and she may be more important to her celebrity relationship than a rather insatiable journalist - and that's all I can say about her. <br /> <br /> Also (disappointingly), this show offers more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world, the government, the US, or anything that benefits the public's best interests. They focus too much on sensationalism that everything they talk about appears as a commercial product. On the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly bearable ... <br /> <br /> I think "Good Day LA" is intended for young teenagers and celebrities, and it's definitely not for people who really care about the news To take care of. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE: (I would really rather see KTLA, but sometimes they try to be entertaining, but they are still a bit boring, well, I'll stay with NBC. "Today. "ABC's" Good Morning America "is okay too ... as long as Diane Sawyer does not get too serious.)
