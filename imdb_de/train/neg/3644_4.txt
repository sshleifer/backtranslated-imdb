This movie is pretty bad. The spectacle is miserable and completely forced. In addition, as a docudrama, the film does not necessarily make you more believable, as you will not get away easily, Mr. Dir. Do not be fooled by my comments, because I would recommend you to watch this movie as it sheds a little light on it the psychology or non-existent psychology brings behind the perpetrators of such crimes. The highlight of the film, however, is absolutely garbage! There is no other way to express it! It's pure and just fails to capture a sense of atmosphere! What happens does not mean to me feelings of desperation, panic, fear or fear that would surely be experienced in such terrifying circumstances. No, instead it lets you fall with your chin. "Was that it ?!" They're gushing out of your tongue, and you're by no means being followed by these boy actions. Rather, you're just embarrassed by another movie that started off with potential, but fell flat in the face at the crucial point. Zero Day indeed ... zzzzzzzzzzzzz
