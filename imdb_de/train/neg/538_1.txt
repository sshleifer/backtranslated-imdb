Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sat and thought, this must get better. These actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap. Unattractive characters, choppy scripts and lighthearted pace make for two hours. I could not really hack it and went shopping (the cat litter was more appealing than this movie). The man stayed and confirmed that it did not get any better - when Buddy was killed, one wished they were all run over by a car and would end their miserable life. It would be infinitely more entertaining. Beautiful landscapes and costumes can not keep this alive.
