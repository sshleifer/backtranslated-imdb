The Radar Men from the Moon is a fairly typical tasting of the 50s. The special effects are pretty cheap, the lunar rovers are obviously World War II jeeps with painted plywood and the like. Acting is just so-so. It inspires the imagination of children whom I believe have been addressed. By today's standards it is boring, cheap and bad. In the first 9 episodes of natural disasters, there is also a lot of stock footage.
