This movie is so amazing! - the whole premise is Bunkum; The fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) could fly around unrecognized and kill as many people as the movie implies is ridiculous. The vampire itself would not be out of place in a film by Bela Lugosi. Most of the acting is so wooden that the actors should be treated for blight. I am waiting for the day when somebody makes a decent movie from a Steven King novel (with the possible exception of Stand by Me). This movie suffers from what most Stephen King films do - lack of funds for "special effects," poor actors, terrifying characterization, and dialogue. This movie is cheap, cheesy and fails at everything he tries.
