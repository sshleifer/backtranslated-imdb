Steven buddy, you remember when you said that: <br /> <br /> "Try to find the path of least resistance and use it without hurting others, live with integrity and morality, not just people but with all beings. " <br /> <br /> You have not done that, you have fatally injured your fans and their morale with these "movies". I would not even care if I did not know you were so much better than me. I've seen the videos of you teaching, you're so much better than this, why, why, why ... < br /> <br /> steam roller productions were steamed. I promise, I'm not afraid of you. I'll tell you the truth about your face so we can fix it. <br /> <br /> Well, I like some others who are 90% asleep, but to be fair, I was tired and had a big meal just an hour before the Sensai, what is you doing. 12 million? Really? Do you have any idea what we could have done with $ 12,000,000? It could have happened in theaters and a blockbuster hit if you had wanted us to donate money to a huge homeless shelter or something else. These post-production people are tearing down the man, the choreography was nonexistent, we can make a better man, the winking thing was from the men in the black movie, I half expected Smith or Mr. Lee Jones to appear to say that they were gills were not the eyelids. <br /> <br /> Seagal, you are an aikido master. Why are you doing this for yourself, for us? When you entered the scene, you had such a fresh direct style and it was obvious that you are a teacher because your movements were as clear and crisp as you saw your first three films. I feel like you are teaching me something I feel like you are just being torn down or I think I have to save you, mate. This time, you are the one who was killed. I'll take revenge for you by helping you to make the best movie ever made. I know who you really are, I know the truth about the Nico movie. let's talk. <br /> <br /> contact me man i have some fresh ideas i am a nit picker, i swear you will not be disappointed with my attention to detail and we will do it for the man of the fans, your fans will do better earn, we stay tuned, but the strand is about to break. I swear I will not let your movie out the door with a single mistake. I'm still trying to figure out if that was the worst synchronization ever or you have a laryngitis, but I promise you that I can make a better impression of you voice than the lame **** who has not even tried it. I hope you have him in the nuts as a payment. I can make up a story and conspiracy that can be adapted to your revenge for the death of your student / daughter / wife / dog / houseplant. I promise you that we will bring you back, I promise, I also want to go in the direction that makes people think, if you let me in, promised that we will make a movie where people go away and have a discussion about it a serious thought that alters experience and changes perceptions. <br /> <br Steven Seagal This is my official written permission for IMDb to provide you with my contact details to revive one of the best martial arts heroes I have ever met, as this is not an Italian, he is Irish and a Jew You call it bad acting. I call it grandiose acting because you believe for 20 years that Seagal is Italian. :) Your perception changes a bit, does not it?
