Research is a good word to describe this film. <br /> <br /> Say, every movie has a selling point, a gimmick. The gimmick of Transformers is the fantastic effects as well as the nostalgia of fan boys. Sleepless in Seattle's gimmick is situational in her slogan, "What if someone you've never met, someone you've never met, someone you never knew was the only one for you?" Many romances rely heavily on these gimmicks and some attract big names. Leap Years employs both by using Irish folklore as a circumstance and bearing considerably famous names in the country. English: emagazine.credit-suisse.com/app/art ... = 118 & lang = en Now that the audience is in the cinema with all the usual elements of characters, conflicts or consequences They also expect a stimulating dialogue, more tense situations as a result of the leap years, interesting subplots, and possibly, to a degree, a good turn in the middle or near the end of the story that favors the characters' circumstances. <br /> <br /> This does not try to reach Jean Yeo. If they tried, their goal was apparently at the other court, in the other stadium, at the other end of the planet. She and her writer Alain Layrac have absolutely failed to offer a stimulating dialogue. Most of the lines were constructed. It seems they have a bag full of lines that they would like to use in their film: "Okay, those are the lines and quotes that I have either from movies I've seen or from books I've read before if they sound good to me, they will sound good to the audience, so I just have to put them together, I will use them all. "The result is cathartic. I can not say that the lines were unnecessary and unrelated to story or postponing the plot, but they seem to jump out of nowhere and surprise you with these quoted quotes. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I know people who quote quotations based on most of the situations in our dialogue and try to make it meaningful to themselves while nodding. I do not go out with them anymore, because the urge to beat them is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the characters depicted are stupid and one-dimensional. With the exception of the unnatural dialogue that implies their motivation (necessary to advance the plot), there was no sense of conviction in them. I have no idea who they are. They are all simpletons sprouting from the advice of a women's magazine. <br /> <br /> The leap-and-go game is not enough to push the story because the circumstances are too shallow. On the other hand, there are films with less, but better than these, there is not. They did it with my first and second points. Moreover, the negotiations are inconsistent (not that it's a bad thing for movies) and thin (bad thing). Jean Yeo and the producers try the horrible plot with fancy locations and passable photography. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to get the approval of some viewers than the others when using cinematography, soundtrack and location. These non-demanding spectators. <br /> <br /> It's not even the kind of movie that is so bad that it's good. It's just bad. Do not watch that.
