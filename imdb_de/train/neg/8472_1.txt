The film begins on Julian Sands, lying on his back, a black kitten who is slobbering blood into his expected mouth from where he holds it, about two feet above him. It was so provocative and I thought, "Let's get started! A good vampire movie!" <br /> <br /> And then it died. This was literally the only scene that aroused any part of the imagination. After that it was slow and uneventful. I was deeply disappointed, as my previous experiences with Sand's actors were very enjoyable. However, this attempt was obviously misguided and the script left something to be desired. <br /> <br /> Even the questionable performance of Julian Sands could not save this already sunken barge of a movie. > It rates a 1.1 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
