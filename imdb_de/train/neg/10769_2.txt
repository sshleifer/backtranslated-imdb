I found that on the shelf while I was purring and bored. How can people give this one 10? It should not just be a movie to feel good (I think) because it does not work on that level either. Weak conspiracy, bad dialogue, terrible spectacle; There is just nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but has nothing to do, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just terrible. The plot process (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems as if the writers wanted the plot to take a certain path, and managed to inscribe it without the necessary bits for it to flow. It's only an hour and a half, but that's 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back.
