For the past 20 years, the majority of British films have focused on how cruel poverty is in Britain and how our youth have no chance of living well while living on the streets of British cities. The British film industry is obsessed with the idea of ​​the "broken Britain". Trainspotting, This is England, Kidulthood, Football Factory, Kes and From London to Brighton. Bullet Boy is just another British movie added to this list. The main character expresses his desire to go straight, but he still insists on hanging around with dead beats, carrying weapons, and fighting with group members for nothing. I was never convinced that he wanted to go straight, because nothing prevented him from pursuing an education or a trade. In fact, it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had gone straight ahead and we had a character who would have changed his life. Instead, he spends his time helping his friend commit a murder. I had no sympathy when he was shot by another teenager at the end of the movie, which is sad because at the beginning of the movie I really liked the whole family and their desire for success. I think the creators have missed a great opportunity to show the world that success belongs to those who really want to strive for it (like the pursuit of happiness). <br /> <br /> I know that the purpose of this film was to paint a realistic picture of the life of black teenagers living in British working classes, but do not we have enough films in the UK with the same plot? Is not it time that these talented producers and writers give something to Britains youth to strive for and show them that a better life is upon them? However, to bring success through shock factors (such as Kidulthood, Football Factory) to success, this film offers nothing new for a long list of British films that are effectively boring and depressing. There is no happy ending to this movie or to the others I mentioned.
