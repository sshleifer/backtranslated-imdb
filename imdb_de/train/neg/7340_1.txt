Impressed! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I have ever seen! I did not like the novel, but this movie made it worse! Very bad music, even worse actors (apart from SRK of course, though he does not manage to save the movie) and not much sense. The director makes everything look very confusing, God knows why ... Maybe it's because he's trying to make everything very surrealistic and yet believable. Well, he can not do it. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours, please do not watch this movie! (Say this for your benefit!) Keep looking, you will see something else to see!
