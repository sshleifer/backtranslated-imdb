I saw this movie on TV. This afternoon and I can not see how someone can sit by this piece of rubbish. It's not funny at all and it needs your I.Q. a few notches. I know this movie is for kids, but that does not mean that the authors should take their intelligence for granted. I bet the writers were sitting around a large wooden table and found that a) the word "poop" is just as much laughter. b) A four-foot child can dive into a three meter high basketball net. c) Children should always fight rifles armed with guns, as the kidnappers fall for everything and d) 3 months of karate training is enough to beat so-called "ninjas" with swords. One good thing I can say about this movie is that it contains the world's weakest suburban "gang" that could not scare anyone. Maybe the guys from MST3K could use this movie for a good laugh. Do not bother with this lame ass-excuse for a movie.
