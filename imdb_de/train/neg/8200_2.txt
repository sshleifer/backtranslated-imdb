This movie could not decide what he wanted to be. There were a few negotiations that gave the impression for a while that these objects would all come together in the end ... but they did not. If you want an "Alien in the Frozen Waste" story, stick to the 1950s version of THE THING (not the abomination that was redone in Gore-O-Vision 20 years later). I could not do it The fact that the "alien" of INDEPENDENCE DAY looked pretty much recycled does not go away. <br /> <br /> The "essential" sets would have been more effective if they hired actors who could actually play the intended mood. <br /> <br /> Many landscapes chew for less profit.
