I do not have to agree with the previous comment and the page with Maltin on this point. This is a second-rate, overly malignant Western that screams and groans as it tries to convey its central theme that the Wild West is tamed and sidestepped by the steady passage of time. It would like to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", but lacks the charm and charm of this movie. Andrew McLaglen's direction is weak, and the last 30 minutes are a real botch, with an incomprehensible strategy of heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Somebody gives me a shout if you can explain why they set this hill on fire.) The whole treatment of the rape scene had something stupid, and the woman's reaction to it certainly did not sound true. Coburn is much vicious when half the race was convicted for revenge, but all his escapees are underdeveloped. Michael Parks gives one of his typically erratic, lethargic, mumbling performances, but in this case it was appropriate that his modern sheriff symbolize the complacency that technological advances can bring.
