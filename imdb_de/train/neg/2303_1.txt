Except that people obviously shop in this garbage! Shows like "Moral Orel" have shown that even if you tried to make the most foul-smelling parody of evangelism you can imagine, it would not be close to the hilarity of the show. It's hard to say what happens when you see it. Is it a news program? A talk show? Who knows!? They begin with reports from various international news, but at seemingly random points, the news is interrupted by this strange, troll-like little man, whose forehead is larger than his entire face, mumbling and laughing, and generally scary. > <br /> Pat Robertson does not seem so bad at first glance. He seems to be just a senile, but harmless, old grouse who is in his archaic faith (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who has called for a murder that has become friendly and has offered not one, but two murderous dictators help, who has illegally donated funds for diamond mines, who has supported forced abortion in China and regularly claims that the Caucasians ( especially American Caucasians) are superior to all other races. <br /> <br /> That would be weird, except that he seems to have a large fan base to hold his little show on stage 40 years later (either that or enough money to bribe some TV executives The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people have to watch it somewhere and hang on to every word, even if Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is, people always hear I do not know if it's weird or scary, I think a healthy mix of both.
