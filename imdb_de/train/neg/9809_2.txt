Some wonder why there was no more Mrs. Murphy movies after this movie. It will be because this movie has gone totally crazy. Disney was not the right studio to shoot this movie. MAYBE Touchstone (well, they belong to Disney, but it would be grown-up). The film is too childish, like the book series is not. The casting is all wrong for the characters. The characters do not even act the way they do in the books. And why did Tucker become a man? He is a girl in the damn books! Was this done to appeal the movie to guys? Sheesh And where was tin, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is missing in this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but it was wrong to let Disney burn her job. An animated feature, perhaps in the banner of Don Bluth's artwork, would fit into a better movie by Mrs. Murphy. All in all, I give a 2, because at least Disney made a movie from an underrated book series. But I wish they had done better. Either way, I still have my books to entertain me.
