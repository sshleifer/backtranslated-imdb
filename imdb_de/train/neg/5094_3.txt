This movie is shit. The acting was shitty, the script sucked, and the movie was totally crappy. There were two threads in the film that were not developed, and the viewer had to work a bit to find out what happened. They suddenly find things and are told they have the slightest idea what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> Negative comments of the heroine to the hero. The audience is never shown how they even know about the guy and how he is connected to the death of her fianc√©. The viewer has only a minimal confrontation with the death of the guy. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is suddenly a scene with a lot of guys being loaded and machine guns tensing to the other scenes. No explanation of what's about the weapons and the people with them. <br /> <br /> We gave him a 3 because we did not feel we wanted our time back. It was fun to make the movie look bad, so at least it gave us some entertainment. ;-)
