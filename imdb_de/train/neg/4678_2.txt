This movie had some andrenalin kickers, but it's an old story that just never could happen. Navy protocols could never break down enough for a crew, let alone an XO, to go against the captain. I'm going to Dr. Take Strangelove every day if I want to see this conspiracy. Sidenote - the US Navy did not support this movie.
