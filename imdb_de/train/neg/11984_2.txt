Pooh! Another of these "deceived by the cover" DVDs. At least I expected something with bears, cats and something on the cover. I do not have anything! Bad movie! <br /> <br /> I've been forced to look through all this, thinking that something would happen ... no luck. <br /> <br /> Well, the reason I forgave this at 2 is because of the scenery; Otherwise it was shit. <br /> <br /> The boy was terrible talking to himself (though I suspect he could not just run a movie with stupid music and no dialogue at all) and his lame karate poses on a tree did stump, who threatens a raccoon, eats worms and (what a jerk) a porcupine enters. And he would not pull these feathers out so easily ... they stick like fishhooks. At least he fought a few times (weakly) with the bear. What happened to the flashback thing? It made a bad movie even worse. I wanted to see a survival movie, not dramatic b's about a child who suffers from divorce. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Well, maybe they should have let the bear eat or something. At least that would have been more exciting. <br /> <br /> People, do not waste your time with this.
