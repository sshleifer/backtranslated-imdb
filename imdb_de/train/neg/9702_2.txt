I do not think that this movie was rated correctly. I took my copy and darkened the PG rating and wrote down R. I would NOT recommend this unit to anyone under the age of 17 or 18 regardless of the R-Limit. <br /> <br /> Why? It contains a scene in the jungle with several above without Indian women. I do not know about you, but for little children that's not something they can watch. It may be the traditional "dress style" of the African (?) Indians, but ... I think the partial nudity should give a movie a rating of R. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the movie recently, but I think otherwise it was fine.
