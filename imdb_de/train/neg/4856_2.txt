For the life of me, I can not understand the blind hype and the devotion to this absolutely incredible movie ... and I think I have the qualifications to say so .... I am a former Special Operations soldier with 14 years of age "Lifestyles" ... This film was completely unreal and obviously written by someone who has done very little research into life in the army, in combat or on team or admitting. Three EOD guys walking around Baghdad on their own ????? Get Real ... No chain of command ????? Real ... EOD buildings vacate ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper Qualified Bock Sergeant ???? Get Real ... Wait ... I shot a villain and then let two guys take me away without firing another shot or being hurt. Get Real ... I broke out an Iraqi civilian while I'm armed with only 9 Mil, breaking into another civilian house, being scolded by his wife, and walking back to camp at night without being in the middle of Baghdad as much as a scratch or a confrontation ???? Get Real ... <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no compliance with the military protocol {Army} and no resemblance to an army unit I ever met. Absolutely unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of EOD who, unlike this poor movie, are not adrenaline seekers looking for Yoos, but highly skilled professionals who work incredibly hard.
