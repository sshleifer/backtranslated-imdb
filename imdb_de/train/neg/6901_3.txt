The most positive thing I can say for this boring local "comedy" production is that it's harmless. In fact, it is so amazingly boring that one wonders how many dozens of rewritings have gone through the committee to achieve such a complete removal of the personality. It's not funny, it's not entertaining, it's not enlightening and it's not charming. It's just a laid back, laughless progress from four losers who have to change their behaviors - and their attitude towards women - to attend their best friend's wedding. The Amateur Drama Society of the US, a plot line that is so tired is that 'Allo' Allo's 40-year-old season would look fresh and jokes that the spoiling of vegetables is so funny that Siones Wedding scored ten (yes 10) nominations in NZ film awards recently. <br /> <br /> Luckily, someone saw sense and it did not win.
