Swayze does not make Alan Quatermain very convincing. Compared to Stewart Granger; Growing up was my ultimate hero in such films as the 1952 "Scaramouche", the "Prisoner of Zenda" of 1952 and the "King Solomon's Mines" of 1950; Patrick Swayze fails completely. Even the portrayal of Sean Connery's senior Alan Quatermain in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was very good on an otherwise big flop. Even Alison Doody lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of lead actress, and not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very difficult for someone to fill his shoes !!! For someone who was disappointed with Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I strongly recommend it now if you can not get your hands on the Granger version.
