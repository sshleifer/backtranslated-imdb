So, despite several threats from both of us, the woman and I ended it off. For the most part, boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was very little excitement. The acting was cruel, to the point where we actually giggled several times in some of the worse scenes (for example, the church lady). The dead sister used paranormal means to get in touch with her living twin, though she provided rather useful information than she tried to frighten the hell that looked very much like the ring. Instead of involving the police - which I'm sure the earplugs she found has DNA everywhere - she instead devises a terrible plan to "catch" the man who covers up her sister's accidental death. I call that a terrible plan because it allows him to kill her as well. The movie then turns black. Bad dialogue, bad action, bad end.
