I saw this DVD in my friends' house and thought that this is a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood not very big names. Interested enough, I decide to try later. It was hard to bear to believe me. After finally seeing the credits, I said, "We Turks are really Hollywood-style suckers, which is an insult to the Geisha film genre." But then you wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish movie; On the contrary, it was literally shot in America with an American director and a crew! That made me think! - How can you convince names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to participate in such a project? probably with money .. that has kept me thinking. How can you raise so much money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then all my meditation paid off, and I came to find the answer. By renting the cheapest equipment and crew you can find. And if you still have trouble adjusting your budget: If you write and control the movie you want to produce - or vice versa - I have no information about it. So the bottom line is that this is not a bad movie, as everyone is so curious how they are presented will make you think at least; It wonders you. It leaves you incredulous ... and then it wonders you again ..
