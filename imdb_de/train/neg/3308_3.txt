If you get your hands on a British movie, expect quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; This movie does the business. It is made by highly skilled craftsmen. That alone can give you an hour and a half of fun. If you look under the layers of professionalism, you really will not find anything. Apart from feeling good and advocating a liberalist view, there is really nothing. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the end must be one of the worst Eastern Hollywood. In all his English cosiness it is just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "Full Monty". Why did you make this movie? I have no idea, except of course to make money.
