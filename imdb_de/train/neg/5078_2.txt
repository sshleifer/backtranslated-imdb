If "Exorcist II: The Heretic" (1977) did not do him any good, it is hard to imagine what Richard Burton's extraordinary representative in this shabby exercise saw in non-exciting situations. You've seen it all before: Burton plays a writer who discovered early on that he has the power to move inanimate objects by the power of his mind (and you thought "Carrie" did not affect Hollywood!). Although adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway, "Medusa" plays like recycled goods, though the special effects in the cathedral's finale are solid (albeit typical). Lee Remick is present as a doctor, but otherwise the supporting litter is extremely weak. Burton is hammy, but tired ... at this point, he could not even save telekinesis. * 1/2 of ****
