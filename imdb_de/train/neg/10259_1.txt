I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid, and I always remember it was my first experience when I was torn from a horrible movie with a good commercial. The ad was great, but I later learned that throughout the movie (about 4) there was every blast or "special effect" and even some that were not in the movie. There was a kind of alien conspiracy, but the extraterrestrials were never shown in the movie, as far as I can remember. It was clearly the case that someone put a stop to a cheap movie that was supposed to cheat people. I believe my world of innocence ended that day when I found out that there were bad people making bad movies.
