said a couple who was just leaving the cinema when I entered to watch this. Hmm, not a good sign, but who knows? After all, different strokes for different people. Well, no. They were nice. Godard has published a work that is passionate (contempt), entertaining (band of outsiders) and sometimes both (my life to life). This is just a stupid intellectualism that gets on your nerves pretty fast. During my show, literally half of the audience had left at the end of the movie. If only I had been so wise.
