A young scientist, Harry Harrison, continues the scientific research of his deceased father with flying colors, but his disturbingly dominant mother and her doctor-lover want to sell the serum. When he finds out, there is an accident in which Harry loses an arm. So, he tries the serum and what is a genetically disturbed arm that has its own head. Oh, we've seen it so many times, but what sets this Campy off pretty rubbery Shonky junk is the performance of the movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. Actually, it's not a bad movie from Fangoria movies. There are simply better who behave similarly. "Servered Ties" just does not have its own style. The strange nature and the unpleasant splashes resembled "re-animator" and even a hint of slapstick stood out like "Evil Dead 2". <br /> <br /> The comic story is really flogged with its black humor, but it can become melodramatic and a bit dry in fun. Surprises emerge, especially the end result of the strip. Which is well received, as I thought it could have come out with something more accessible. For a low-budget production, the FX make-up may look stiff and very silly, but there are a few grotesque moments that make you smile, as if you really are about to flinch. Thanks to Elke Sommer's strict, juicy performance as a mother, the story is even streamlined by a touch of sexual tension. Oliver Reed is pretty humorous in a bad sense and he does it very well. They were both immensely confusing as the couple you hated the most. Billy Morrisette is a joyous performer as Harry. Director Damon Santostefano goes briskly along the film and arranges some stylish scenes with gripping and bamboozlem horror. Yes, it's teen and basically stupid nonsense, but you have to give it up for some unpretentious entertainment.
