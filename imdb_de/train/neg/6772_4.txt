When Herbie made his first appearance, I was absolutely happy to look away Dean Jones mug. I just wanted to talk for a few hours and eat over buttered popcorn. Unfortunately, I always have an exciting story when I see a movie when I'm not taking any medications. And that's another good movie for the doctors. There are no big laughs, no complex strokes, no difficult turns. Herbie Fully Loaded is ideal for fully loaded players. <br /> <br /> This was the first time I've seen La Lohan on screen since switching places with Jamie Lee Curtis (and I thought she was excellent at it) and I can not say that I was terribly impressed this time. Apart from her ever-changing and distracting, unnatural hair color, she just did not seem to be true, as the boy next door who had spent a lifetime in road racing. Her "need for speed" was not consistently portrayed in the movie - maybe it was elsewhere - she looked older than her role and always seemed to be looking for something (a party designer is looking for a new place to spend money?) to adjust. I could not see chemistry with Justin Long; this romance seemed obligatory at best. The only time Lindsay got engaged was when she interacted with Matt Dillon, who I thought was over the top as Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy. <br /> <br /> It was great to see Herbie again, and I loved the movie intro with material from the old movies. If Disney broke out with Car 53 jewelry, I might have worn a few, just to be loyal. His new feature (?) Was a bit inconsistent (is he channeling his driver's thoughts, is he skateboarding now?), But anyway. We all knew how it would end, but I wish he had found someone less stupid than Maggie. And my head still hurts from this lesson that Maggie and we had hit audiences home. <br /> <br /> What would the movie have been worth? Have the old Herbie in a real story with a proper plot - at least Herbies is as good as Lassie - but of course that's too much to ask. Why does Disney always go back to the same values ​​of innovation as "Herbie Goes Bananas" and "The Computer That Wore Tennis Shoes"? <br /> <br /> I'm sure this was a great movie for kids and those who have no expectations. For the rest of us ... it's when you have the flu and just can not take the tension from Rear Window.
