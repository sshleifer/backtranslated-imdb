My goodness! This is one of the films that you believe you have reviewed before, but not. I mean, you did not shit yourself, but somehow it came to mind. <br /> <br /> To be honest and to be brief; This is one of the worst, most boring and stupid slashers ever made. I can not say much good about this bitch, because there are hardly any decent sequences that could be said to have been made by professional filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The death scenes are terrible, bloodless and stupid. The plot is kind of good, considering that "Popcorn" from 1991 was copied. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this is not a movie that is so good that it is good. It's just bad. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald tried her best, but it was not enough.
