If you want to see a secret, do not look at it. Although there are elements directly from the Elmore Leonard Territory, this comes closer to an episode of "Dynasty," as the filmmaker focuses on "character development" - d. H. Lange, boring conversations between stupid, uninteresting characters. Some people can make fascinating films without real action (see "Exotica"), but not these. Avoid it, especially if you like the performers involved in this movie.
