Oh, to scream out loud, this must be the LAMEST movie I've seen all year, and I'm sorry that John Cusack was usually involved in this mindless, dubious piece of stupidity. While Sleepless in Seattle delivers the same message, albeit on a more subtle, more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer and then hits it into the psyche for the next hour and a half (and that's one and a half hours of my life, I'll never be back back, thank you !!). It's bad enough that the main characters of this film have the emotional maturity of fourteen-year-olds (actually, I knew better fourteen-year-olds ...), except perhaps Jeremy Piven, who had enough fun. Only the first 15 minutes or so of the film, in which Kate Beckinsale's character plays the annoying stupidity of a game of literally throwing all sensitivities aside, had irritated my best friend and me unbelievably. I told my husband that Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least the characters in Rockstar were not half as dysfunctional as the idiots in that "serendipitous" mess. It is annoying to observe protagonists who seem to have no idea about the choices in their lives and feel that they are nothing more than puppets to the fate and whims of fate. How totally tiring. I am sure that this film will be enjoyed more by those who prefer not to deal with the chaotic disorder, to make more complex life decisions and then to live responsibly with the consequences. After all, here's a movie in which our hero and heroine live together happily ever after, devastating the lives of two other people (their respective fianc√©es) and causing misery, not to mention other relatives and friends, just to get there to get. <br /> <br />
