Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was done. The whole plot is about someone trying to sabotage the Superbowl and any attempts to stop it. I do not care how Tom Selleck and Donna Mills career managed to survive. The most frustrating part of it, however, was that there was no football at all! Avoid this if possible.
