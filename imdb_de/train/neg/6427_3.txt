Overall, I found this documentary strange and really pointless. I know it got awards and things, but personally I did not like it that much. There was no humor or drama to interest you, just a few Wierdos and their jobs. Some people are quite different, which is not bad, it just did not make a good impression on me. I was totally bored with this movie, nothing against my creative writing teacher. The circus theme throughout the movie was kind of cool, but I did not get it, and robotics and lion caging is definitely not my thing. The green thing was neat, I liked the garden with many colorful flowers, but how did these four jobs connect? It just did not make much sense to me why someone made a movie about it. But if you like it, you might enjoy it. Who am I to stand in your way. I only warn you of possible suffering.
