This film was missing ... everything: story, drama, surprise, ingenuity and a soul. After fifteen minutes, I stared at the screen and said, "How could all these guys get together and consider themselves friends (even without the girl)?" After another fifteen minutes I prayed for as much Amanda Peet as possible. When a bad movie quietly raises its ugly head, eye candy is a nice consolation. But that was not much! Cheated on all fronts!
