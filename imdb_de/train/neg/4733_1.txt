I can not believe that I really sat through the whole thing. This movie has the worst acting since Killjoy. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief overview of the storyline: The movie begins with Jojo and the other chick sitting on the beach and slobbering over a thin blond beach "buddy" who looks like he has been in his life have not spent a day in the gym. Everyone knows him somehow, and every chick in the movie wants him. UH OH! Here comes the competition! The stereotypical "hot chick" and her best friends driving an ugly pink car. We'll quickly discover that Jojo's mother has been living in Australia for a lifetime, meaning that Jojo has to move and leave her best friend (oh no, I think I'll cry). A huge storm comes and fills her swimming pool with unpleasant water. Somehow the little chick falls into the pool for no apparent reason and comes face to face, yup, you guessed it, a MERMAID! This is where the story begins. Basically, they want to fall in love with the mermaid in the "guy". <br /> <br /> This is a preteen movie with such bad acting that the 80's look like the highlight of Oscar-worthy performances. This movie has all sorts of clich√©s ... the best friends, the "hunk" everyone wants, the "hot" bad girl and her bitchy friends, the creepy old man ... they call it, it's in there. I took one for many people when I looked at it. Consider my hour and 40 minutes as a sacrifice for you. Please do not watch this movie. Do not do it so that I suffered for nothing.
