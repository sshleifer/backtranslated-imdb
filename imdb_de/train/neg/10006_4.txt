I do not know who I can blame, the shy writer or the unsuspecting director. It seemed to be one of those movies where the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna, and Jon) were paid so much that there was not enough left to really make a movie. That could have been very entertaining, but there was a veil of fear, even cowardice, that hung over every scene. Why was the omnipresent bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why is Sheen strolling through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY CONTRACTS IN THE WORLD? If only they were looking for laughter, why not Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta work instead? This was so predictable that I was surprised that the director was not five years old. What a waste, not only for the audience, but also for the actors.
