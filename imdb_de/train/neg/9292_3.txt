First of all, I expected another hero as well - a fantastic work of art for the action genre. I've only seen parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I imagine it's better than HoFD. Great elements of Hero can be found in HoFD: Great Landscapes, Intriguing Cinematography and Righteous Spectacle I mean, if you do not understand a word that they say without the subtitles, but you're still interested - that's a good acting. <br /> <br /> What went wrong? What begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story. Worse, it's a soap opera-like love triangle. You have three characters who, I believe, fall in love for no good reason. This movie essentially falls apart after escaping from the jail (I fell asleep for about forty minutes). It is almost as if they had changed the writers at that time. The rest of the movie is about how a character is "like the wind". Ick. In addition, you really need to expand your suspension of unbelief to believe the action standards. This is not unique to this genre alone, but since the story is weak, you can not wait for the action and then, when the fight breaks out, it really was not so good. The beginning grabs you, but then the movie goes out of gas.
