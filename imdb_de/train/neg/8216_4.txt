And maybe, as Fred Sandford said, "over the lips". That to those who have released this film to an unsuspecting audience. And maybe to the person in "Rue Morgue" who called this "Fender Hellbender" and said it was good. Five young girls, apparently taking home a short cut from a high school football game, get lost and stop to ask directions in a small shop in the middle of nowhere. There, the driver accidentally strikes a parked SUV & strikes a headlamp, but the girls decide to just go away and not find the driver. But the driver comes to find them, and it's not just that the headlamp is dinged on their vehicle, but for some other reason the girls do not understand yet. When the driver first catches her, she waves (yes, she is one) a shotgun, tears it down, and yells at her: "How much have you seen?" Of course, the girls are afraid of death and do not know what she's talking about. <br /> <br /> When the night burns, the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the SUV driver, who manages to inflict all kinds of injuries to the girls, who are remarkably resistant to firearms and screwdrivers wherever they go you do not want. Eventually, they realize that something happened in this store after they left. This is the reason for the psychotic anger of this woman. And finally, they have a chance to avenge themselves and make it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> There are elements of this film that are rather disturbing and frightening, but unfortunately these moments are undermined by bad action, bad dialogue and great credibility. A girl is hit by a shot and seems mortally wounded, and it feels cold, his life goes by before her eyes, but is she feeling better? And how far can a mini-van go on an almost empty gas tank at a speed of 80 mph? I need one of those things, it seems to have BIG kilometers. <br /> <br /> It should have ended when the girls had avenged themselves, but after that the movie continues a bit further, which is a climax, but at least they learn something of what caused the woman, and the driver is still worried about messing up their mother's car, which is obviously the least concern for everyone. <br /> <br /> It's not like this It's not the worst movie I've seen, but it's too amateurish to be good and yet a bit too scary and cruel to be completely awful. But it takes the cake for a lot of shrill hysterics, and if you see this, you should put two over your ears. Which I can not recommend by the way. 4 out of 10.
