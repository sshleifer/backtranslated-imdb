I'm a big fan of Karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I saw this movie after seeing Fiza, which was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are bad and there are movies that are cr * p. But this movie only takes the biscuit. <br /> <br /> We were so upset that we let our money pay for it with a decent movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
