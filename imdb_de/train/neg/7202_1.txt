Since I loved the Inspector Gadget cartoon in the 80s, I went to this movie. I wasted my money. The plot was very thin. The movie could not interest me for long. I was glad it was over. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Inspector Gadget, look at the cartoon instead. It was much better than the movie.
