John Wayne & Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on Indian territory and for the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic Pictures film shot from Utah, USA. <br /> <br /> An interesting western species due to its characters and It's a more modern environment where Wayne & Dekker play the old and new factions of the West. It's based on a story by Thomson Burtis, who co-wrote the script with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs the world of work appropriate to his career. A secular story is in truth saved by the last third, in which the action kindly raises and resembles something akin to a pulse. The carefree approach to the romantic beach is not quite right, and a glorious fistfight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell's inability to disguise the stuntmen who do the work. But hey, stunt men always deserve their moment of glory. Solid support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne, as usual, have plenty of on-screen charisma, especially when he rattles his gun. Despite its above-average budget, however, it remains a film of interest only to Wayne enthusiasts of the 1940s. 4.10
