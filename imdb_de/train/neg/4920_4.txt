A very sleek modern (sensually hip) reworking of Dracula's story (though it sticks to traditional folklore) with a rather interesting, though not fully captured, story of the Prince of Darkness. The first time I tried to look at it, I could only do it halfway before losing interest. Again, it got off to a good start (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounter with Dracula), but then it was less interesting for me when it met New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. It's a great place to set it, but it never used its attitudes (despite the damnation of a paradise where Dracula could bloom). Produced by Wes Carven (and yes, they're throwing that name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically it had its moments with a few gorgeous visuals, but some kinetic editing and cheap thrusts do not help. The messy script gets pretty stupid. Lussier does a polished job that stays pretty glassy and adds a lot of blood (the make-up is adequately achieved) and lots of "Virgin" advertising. No, I do not mean virgins, it's the music company, because she takes a lot of pictures and Helsing's daughter works there as well. Oh, that was no obvious planting. The soundtrack is an amusing selection of rock music. Now the performances are on display all over the store, but there are few familiar faces (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula just could not get away, because not much presence had formed. He was outshone by the luscious ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's brides. People like Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectable alright. Christopher Plummer makes a tricky turn as Van Helsing and Omar Epps enjoy his role.
