Swedish action films have evolved in recent years into something that mimics American action films like "Heat," but on a low budget. This film follows the same rules as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna". However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard for a cool and hard movie. <br /> <br /> The story has been seen before, the dialogue feels artificially and the acting is very bad, especially by the main actress. The film attempts to paint a picture of hard-boiled military robbers without any remorse and a female investigator who has lost it completely with the problems of the past and at the same time seems completely rational. It does not work very well. <br /> <br /> The style of the Blu-Cast photos does not look fresh anymore and in this picture this is not even good. Only a few scenes actually look good. The sound is also pretty weird and it sounds like the actual dialogue is being recorded afterwards. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this movie is Stefan Sauk, though he does not make a convincing portrait of a SWAT team leader, has some really funny lines. The music is pretty good as well.
