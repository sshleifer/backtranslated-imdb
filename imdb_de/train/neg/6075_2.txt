One of the worst movies I have ever seen with Robert De Niro. The fan is a meaningless cliche of an exercise in slasher punches. It tries to make or twist the genre with absurd plotlines of a crazy, psychotic fan - the movie does not turn into anything. (Spoiler) Are we to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to a baseball player in a luxury hotel without witnesses, security or cameras and murders him? The film is nonsense, trying to pull our hearts out through the ring of baseball, which ends mockingly uncomplicated and unconventional. Not sure what all the actors thought when they were aboard this raid. That's as big as they come. Stay away if you prefer to think in your movies
