Well, I'm blown, a Woody Allen movie that I went out in half an hour, why). Basically, it became clear very early on that we would patronize with a patron from the screen: with a script that sets out his idea as with bullets; a cast, all of whom were trying to be characters of Hannah and her sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevigny), and were poorly managed to do so; and a camera that has been sitting around excitedly just to film except chat and deliver the actor. Theatre? none; It is partially prescinded, but the plot does not help to develop a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Maybe I went too early in this case, but then I decided against an hour and a half -liner Allen clones. The script has its funny moments? I'm almost on the back of Will Ferrell's excerpts in the trailer (again trailer, doh!) Gone. but there is little step to let them fly off casually, as it is best. Worse than that, there is no fluidity. If one says that the film is made of wood, a forest looks like a jelly: the opening discussion in the caf√© is the worst case scenario. The only thing to do with numbers is checking points. 10.2.
