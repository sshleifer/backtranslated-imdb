As a horror fan, we all know that blind leasing is a crap. Sometimes we find a real gem, but we often find that the film for which we have just spent our hard earned money is nothing more than a lazy steamer driven by the totally unearned rave reviews and film festival prizes on the packaging listed, was aggravated. This is the case with Five Across the Eyes (a title I'm sure is a double allusion to the budget of the film and the compulsion that anyone who sees it may need to use all five fingers to close their eyes sting). <br /> <br /> The story, or at least what the * er * writers think appropriate, focuses on a group of teenage girls who unwisely decide to walk on a hillbilly ride late at night after leaving a football game A crazy woman playing cat and mouse with her as a punishment for what she believes the girls were finding after a fender in a gas station parking lot in their car. <br /> <br /> Fairness is an interesting idea. Some of the best horrors have very simple storylines. The idea of ​​Five Across the Eyes comes to mind. The film seeks to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project with its shaky camera work and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its nude bone approach to the material. What we get instead are superfluous scenes of persecution, torture and release; Hunt torture, let go, in this order for 94 minutes with long interludes of swallowing, moaning and incoherent wobbling as ample padding between chase sequences. <br /> <br /> The look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark, which could have increased the suspense and the realism in a better made film. Here it is just annoying. The characters are not developed and the viewer can hardly find anything to sympathize with them. A character stops to get first aid kit and tends to get some scratches on her face, while audible shots in the background indicate that her friends might be killed. Another girl mumbles funny fools like "Do not go out, she'll catch you, if she gets you, kill her, and if she kills you, you're dead." <br /> <br /> was an award from the Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral.com on the box that prompted me to find out. Talk about a false orgasm! Maybe my expectations would have been met if this had been in the comedy department. I'm all for low budget indie horror, but this one takes the crap cake. Put five over the eyes (or FATE, can you get it?) A pass. <br /> <br /> RazorFriendly gives FATE 1 a slash of five /
