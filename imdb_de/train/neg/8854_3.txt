We had a STARZ-free weekend and I turned on the station to see what was going on. It was the movie Howling II: The acting was terrible, but the eye candy was great. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the aforementioned eye candy. I laughed a lot of the few scenes that I saw. <br /> <br /> My friends wonder why I never wanna go into horror movies. If they saw this movie, they would know why. I would be kicked out because of the hard laugh. <br /> <br /> Just a few things: Reb Brown, who played Ben White, had played Captain American in one for the TV movie Marsha Brown. Mick Jagger's inspiration for this song was Mick Jagger's "Brown Sugar" Mick has a great taste for women.
