When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it would be a good Sasquatch movie. Normally, if you have this kind of movies, there is usually a Sasquatch, but in this there is something? 7 or 10 of them? The acting was good, the plot was alright, I liked the scenes where the Sasquatch kills the first victims, very good camera work. I expected it to be a bloody movie, but it was very little. This movie was much better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs to do more Sasquatch movies, I mean, I really liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one I'm checking is fine, but the movie Sasquatch was not, but I check that will not let me get back on track. This movie is good for a rainy Saturday afternoon, but not for other occasions.
