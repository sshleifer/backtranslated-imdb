I only signed up to make this comment (of some of the here quite the same). The acting is worse than Subpar, reference is made to common stereotypes, has some of the worst signs tasteless female objectification (all without a brain). and has some of the kestest lines that man knows. <br /> <br /> Including but not limited to "OK, let's see what these guys can." I should also mention that you end up when they show the crashes of innocent civilians you feel bad for the innocent people and hate the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of stereotypischsten Black personas who simply wrong people in the Direction rubs. It may be a good actor or not, but this film does not allow this type of character research. You want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys? Oceans 11. This film will make you hate the bad guys instead capture the audience. Even the cars can not make up for the curse of a movie. The Enzo that destroyed Griffin perfectly sums up this movie. It's just shit.
