There are some Stallone movies that I like, but this movie did not meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists crashing land in the wild are ready to survive for at least two days. In this wilderness, Stallone and his company also run across bridges and ladders that provide practical shortcuts or plotting devices. Moreover, the financial police do not seem to coordinate with the local rescue services. Even villains who could not beat the side of a barn with really high-tech-looking automatic weapons. <br /> <br /> I initially liked John Lithwow's villain, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he does not. He does not care at all that anyone has his bad guys or they all get killed. At some point I just could not believe the character anymore. <br /> <br /> Not worth the price of a loan, it's not even worth the time to look.
