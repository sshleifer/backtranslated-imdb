I start writing this review during a break while watching the movie. It's the first time I've tried, but I'm having trouble getting through without occasional breaks. That's not because it's intense, but because it's bad. <br /> <br /> It's almost painfully boring and unbelievable, especially when the extremely robust dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) appears on the screen, tragic and bitchy, selfish and selfish-pitiable. This would have been a much better movie if they had simply taken that character out of the story. <br /> <br /> He adds nothing but a funny, maudlin, very irritating melodrama. Maybe someone decided that if they did not convince Ryan, they would just make him disgusting. The problem is, who cares if a rotten, whining, disgusting idiot dies? Not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing this character has for him is the fact that he's dying, and I'm sorry, but that's not enough. Dying does not make anyone special. We ALL die sooner or later. It does not give anyone the right to expect sympathy while behaving like an idiot. <br /> <br /> The other two characters and the actors they play (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah) are very much more interesting, and their story would have made a much better movie without Ryan's self-pitying interruptions. But it's not over yet and it's time to play PLAY again. Maybe something big will happen before the end ... <br /> <br /> No. We are sorry. This rented turkey is going back tonight!
