In the Egyptian films, there are many films with high drama or love value or comedy or action, even sports ... "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL Lam" was banned in Egypt, because it is nudity (Full Frontal Female Nudity) and this kind Nakedness is banned in the Egyptian movies .. When I saw these movies, I felt down ... Fool Story .. Naked Actress .. Bad Action .. Some Horror & Awful Colors .. Dear Friend .. If You Want to see a big movie Egyptian movie ... Simple: Stay away from "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" ... We have great movies in Egypt ... We have great actors who have gained global winnings like: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb .. We have great directors like "Yousef Shahin". Believe me, Pall. You do not need to see this movie.
