This movie was slower than Molasses in January ... in Alaska. The man who compiled the preview should receive a prize for having managed to preview each of the 30 seconds that were interes. I had to wake the people I saw it with several times. After it was over, I felt bad because I had woken her up. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is recorded with the hope that something will happen, but nothing will happen. It was easy to lose sight of people's motives, and the characters were flat and incessant. At the end of the movie, you just hoped everyone would die. Everyone runs around, either contemptuously, petty or pathetic, and usually all three. <br /> <br /> And even worse, we looked at a minute or two of extra features, just for kicks and giggles you understand, and all we saw was that people were addicted to it were how socially aware they are. If they had spent the time with the movie they tapped on the back, it might have been worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I was brought in anticipation of the excitement of "24". I received a lecture on social consciousness through the eyes of the Sandman.
