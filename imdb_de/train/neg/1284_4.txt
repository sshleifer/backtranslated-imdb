This movie was a long setup without a climax. People who end up calling swordplay as big must either be out of their mind or have none. Too often, this film was soft. I'm not saying that soft films are bad. But no matter how much you like sugar, there should be no room on a T-bone steak. This movie was supposed to be revenge for crimes committed against a culture, but it became a little brawl. And only one of them knew what a sword is. Tim Roth's character (and yes, he plays him well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero" with no knowledge of how to use a sword, and the way he "won" was a shame. As a drama, this film had its epochs, but the best performance in this area must match the nature of Scotland. This is a breath of breath in my book called "soap".
