The back cover of the DVD (miss this when it came out) is a Hitler - The Rise Of Evil - as "The Triumph" (The New York Post) and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). <br /> <br />, no matter the post office, but really, who wrote that word in Newsweek in the same context, with the peace of art, art should be dismissed. <br /> <br /> I do not start where to start. Why are you trying to paint the image of Hitler's evil with colors that did not exist? He was evil alright, but now his character is portrayed in a way that is historically often inaccurate (compared to his love of animals, the gentle and muted way he treated women), and so on. The actors are good, so you have to feel sorry for them because they are locked up in their one-dimensional characters. A kind of curse here at Peter O'Toole: This is the second time in his honorable career when he has played an old and failed leader in a failed movie (or, in this case, a television production, to be specific). The first, of course, was the legendary Galigula. The list of historically inexact scenes alone would fill in the 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I'll leave them here. <br /> <br /> This is fine when it's on TV and you have nothing else to do, but believe me - it's best to keep it in your local Virgin store.
