What I can say was a theft of my time watching this movie, and I have to say, what a horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and does not convince in this movie. Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer. The plot is, to say the least, thin, the Cantonese dialogue is not funny. Watch this movie at your own risk. <br /> <br /> David Tang of Shanghai Tang should provide for the low or no revenue generated by this film after the movie. The banal conspiracy tries to compete with other Rome Coms and simply fits into the landscape. It was like seeing the paint dry. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was a total waste of time and space. I have seen better movies on Youtube.
