The film must have been shot in one day, there are scenes in which you can see the camera reflections and their red pointer, even the green light of the scenery that mixes with the actors !!! inspiration (at least as a thriller genre film). Everything that had to do with Poe in the film has a flat and childlike approach. The movie is full of Clise and not exciting. If you want to watch a fun B-movie, have a relaxed evening with friends, then do it yourself (like me), but there's no way to take this movie seriously!
