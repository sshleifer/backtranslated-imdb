Five-year-old Michael sees his mother put to death by his serial killer, The Highwayman, who later committed suicide. "Twenty Years Later," adult Mike (Gordon Currie, of PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends home to his secluded grandparents to master "their own fears" at a Halloween costume party. Morty, a life-size wooden doll kept in the attic by the Indian craftsman, is possessed by the deceased father's ghost and kills her with her phobias. Characters are thrown out of a window, drowned in a toilet, devoured by rats, blown up, etc. Morty transforms into his father and a tree, goes around and makes silly jokes. After finding a girl and stuffing her into a box, the characters stay indoors, behaving happily, joking and having sex. <br /> <br /> The Morty design is good and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees from The original Friday the 13th is surprisingly enjoyable like the grandmother, but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and full of false anxiety, bad acting, brain-dead characters, repeated flashback shots and annoying, distorted camerawork, and only the two minorities (the Indian and a half-black girl) die first.
