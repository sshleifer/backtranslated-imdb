I've seen this movie the other day and honestly say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The play is fair, but the plot is absolutely ridiculous. A murderer was born because of the "energy needed to make the film" and when the film is burned, does the killer die? How unbelievable is that? The characters, to say the least, were underdeveloped ... for example, the man suddenly mentions, "Do not try to finish the movie because your mother could not?" So shall we continue? We had no idea that it was her daughter until half of the movie. The movie really did not bring anybody into the light, we did not know about the main survivors, except Ringwald's character was a crying actress. The guy was on set when people died and Raffy wanted to be like her mother's director. Do not really dive to know who they are. It seemed that things would be done quickly to get to the killings. The whole plot is too weak for my taste and I was extremely disappointed. Anyone who has enjoyed this piece of crap obviously needs to learn a thing or two about filmmaking. I can not believe that anyone would agree to play with this image. It's not funny, it was not scary and it was a clich√© throughout the movie. I predicted what would happen before every scene. I think you were not hard at all to do. It's a shame and I'm so sorry that I spent an hour and a half watching the chaos. 1.10
