The German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has mastered a task that many horror fans considered impossible: he is the unused colleague Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of the director of the worst horror film ever made. Lommel really is Ed Wood of the new millennium. This movie is as modest and ridiculous as the worst of EW. I am proud and ashamed to say that I have seen in toto, morbidly fascinated to see how low the bar could be set. The answer is: underground; Lommel dug a pit and buried it. <br /> <br /> The fun begins with the occupation of international Nobodies. Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles, where every auto mechanic, doctor and postman is an actor or scriptwriter waiting to be discovered, could easily understand how Lommel has found so many would-be actors willing to engage in his ridiculous dialogue to spit with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The main character, a vicious beat cop, is played by a German actor with a strong German accent. Apart from being a serial killer, he is also the oldest police officer in LA. Despite the fact that he detains and detains innocent female drivers, then moves them into his home (which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse) and does all this in sight of his rookie partner, the LAPD refuses to go that far to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja-style raid in his apartment. <br /> <br /> The sets are agonizingly bad. The production designer's budget apparently contained just enough money for a can of paint; enough to paint "Precinct 707" on a cardboard wall. <br /> <br /> As the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals - a sad selection of European emigrants (possibly deportees if they traded in their homeland), bimbos, mimbos and desperate middle-aged women - and little money for them Sets, special effects, locations or other production values ​​was spent, it is only to mention that they jumped for some real-looking police uniforms. Unfortunately, they could not afford a police car; The uniformed police officers cross the street in a shiny new Mercury rental property. <br /> <br /> More than half of the story focuses on the dirty acts of our German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him. One of these young actors is particularly pathetic because he is the only actor in this whole mess and even has a vague attitude towards a real career in the movies. The other part goes well together, with a rockabilly haircut and a tortured Brando pose that needs to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> In the last part of the movie, the title gets its zombie, as victims of our killer are revived after he murdered a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to attract a protective spell. Do not ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of a murder, just accept Lommel's logic and enjoy the absurd ride. <br /> <br /> After long back and forth from thatched street graves, the zombie girls manage to make their appearance. They look just as they would before death, maybe even prettier, with black glamor make-up generously decorated with the airbrush around their eyes. They do not look like zombies and look more like fashion-conscious models for the runway. <br /> <br /> At this point, Lommel lends a creative touch to his acclaimed compatriot Boll and injects large quantities of cheesy Euro-Trash techno into the soundtrack. We speak of prehistoric electronic bumblebee sounds. Things that they could have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his prey. <br /> <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel's girls speak and talk as usual ... um, I mean, the way they did before they get zombified. This gives our author many opportunities to flood us with his golden dialogue. Yes, it is a golden shower. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil anything by revealing the end of the shock. All I can say is that it fits in perfectly with the rest of this masterpiece. The spirit of Ed Wood lives on ... or should I say his mind.
