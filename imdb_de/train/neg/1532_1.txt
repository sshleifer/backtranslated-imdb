Although correctly warned, I actually sat down to watch this movie. For one, because I usually give each movie an even break and because I thought a single movie might not be so bad. I am correct. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick, or Ben Stein could save that turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. I laughed only once, while that humor had given up the parody of a parody. Namely during the Simon scene says. The other jokes are either poorly executed or just out of round. And some of them actually see you a mile away. This movie just does not have what it takes to be a good spoof like the plane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III) or Scary Movie. They all had A. funny gags, B. good dialogues and above all C. unforgettable quotes. Men In White, D. has none of the above. To label this film as bad would be a gross understatement. AVOID THIS FILM AS YOU CAN! OBSERVE YOUR OWN WARNING!
