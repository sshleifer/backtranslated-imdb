Um ... Okay, I guess I get the whole shaky cam-gorilla-like movie technique, but unfortunately I think a gorilla could have made a better movie ... This thing was a total mess right from the start. Bad acting, bad direction, bad story and terrible cinematography. I will never know how this piece of garbage was published, but I saw it and unfortunately saw it. "Five Across The Eyes" was filmed on location in Tennessee by Greg Swinson's directing team and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd). Nose dives off a cliff. Actually, I was embarrassed for these young women, who Hollywood star was certainly promised, but they ended up in this bastard. The dialogue is ridiculous and annoying if you listen to it. As it turns out, this is a horror movie is another mystery, since it is not even scary from afar, apart from the fact that I've seen it doing the math and slapping her ass ... "The End ". Saddly went on for 95 minutes to stun the stupidity ... <br /> <br /> I saw it for free and wanted my money back.
