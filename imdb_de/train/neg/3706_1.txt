I figured the whole joke of the movie would be seeing a rich white guy like Chris Rock and then seeing Chris Rock react to people's reactions. Instead, you see Chris Rock as himself and people do not understand him. There may be 2 scenes throughout the movie where they use their gimmick. That should have been much better.
