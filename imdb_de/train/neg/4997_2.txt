... but it is certainly not without merit. Author and director Preston Sturges is already experimenting with unusual cinematic effects by telling his stories, creating broad but distinctive characters and situations, and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogues. (No wonder the Coen Brothers' next movie will be a tribute to Sturges.) <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the storyline is not quite there yet. It's no surprise, the unexpected twists and turns of fate that make viewers guess. The coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot on, and the end is quite predictable. Frank Capra does that much better. <br /> <br /> If you're new to Preston Sturges, check out The Lady Eve or Sullivan's Travels or The Miracle of Morgan's Creek first. If you have already seen these, then look at them.
