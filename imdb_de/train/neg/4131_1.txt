This film should be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! Apart from a few giggles and one or two scenes from Gore, this movie is a waste of time. Calling it "Campy" does not even cut it off. "Campy" means fun, what this movie was not. They spend the first half of the movie thinking, "It has got to be better, right?" It's fair to say that at the end of the day, it's finally time to explain who the "brother / sister" team is and what they want, but until then, it's hardly important to you because you're wondering the whole second half of the movie Mr. Onorati and Ms. Pacula have made someone of THIS bad for clinging to such a horrible movie. <br /> <br />
