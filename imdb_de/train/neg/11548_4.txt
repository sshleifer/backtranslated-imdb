Geez, only in the 70's ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this quirky mix of spaghetti western and kung fu movie that are all about a treasure hunt. The spices of this trashy co-production between Shaw Brothers and an Italian sole proprietorship include humorous storytelling, offbeat happenings, and some very tame T & A. Additional Campy moments come from Lee Van Cleef's hideous wig, the leather-clad, bible-tapping psycho-shooter Yancey Hobbitt ( lovingly by Julian Ugarte, the man who should have done far more obscure European genre productions) - witty dialogues, witty background music and completely ridiculous sound effects that accompany various little events (especially every leap from Lo Lieh). <br /> <br /> While this little bit of action falls into the territory of Turkey, it's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and you can not deny the charisma of this duo. Do not expect too much and you will get a lot of it. <br /> <br /> That's my truth. What is your?
