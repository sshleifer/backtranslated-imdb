Sarah Silverman is currently the comic "Flavor of the Month". Is she really worth all the hype? Yes and no. She is sometimes funny, sometimes funny (her standup routine is actually quite interesting, if not always funny). In other cases, you feel betrayed by the media because you overhyped another actor. She is one of those really cute comedians to whom men particularly flock and say they seek their intelligence and wit. But if you've cornered her, most men will admit that they only want to sleep with her, and that's why they watch her. It reminds me why many men flocked to Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, although none of them are really "hot" in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least not cigars), so she should get hot when she is 60 years old so that her fans (especially the males) can be happy. <br /> <br /> As far as this show is concerned, as much as her comedy. If it works, it's funny. If not, it is boring and very, very boring. The AIDS episode here is the best. It is consistently funny and has really good satire. Brian Poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in an episode, and it's weird to see him in a Tab T-shirt. But they never really go anywhere, and that makes itself felt. Sarah's character in the show is pretty annoying, the gay couple (Brian Poeshn and another guy) seems to be touched and never really does anything for the show as a whole and the supporting players (including Sarah's real sister, Laura, who does) Looks like she's alright. When the jokes come, they are brilliant. If they do not, they are terrible and I mean really terrible. There is also an obsession with coprophilia (aka poop jokes), which today seems to have replaced the wit and intelligence in comedy. So you should watch this show? If you have a crush on Sarah, do it. You can stare at her and pretend that she is yours. Her show ranges from good to absolute zeros.
