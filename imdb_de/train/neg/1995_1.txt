Well, I only paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie, and it was not even worth it. It seems to come from a bad print and is in the public domain, I think. <br /> <br /> Despite her fame, her price and her reputation, Neagle is a homely British gala that can neither sing nor dance or act. <br /> <br /> Some of the fine Hollywood performers exhibited here must have thought that they make a classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always thought Anna was the most exciting and talented woman on the screen. He was wrong. It was incredibly popular in Britain before and after World War II. Her "serious" roles are even more ridiculous than her musical performance here. <br /> <br /> Only a few of the famous songs are included and none is well presented. Skip this and find the one who plays Doris Day. At least you get real comedy and professional dance!
