I should not even review this movie, as it is not really a horror movie - and therefore the attention of dr. Cheese is not worthy. At least it's not horror in the usual sense. It is certainly a terrible suggestion to spend this time with this crap. That's why I turned it off after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed. Yes that's true. Put simply, this film is b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> "The Order" had many shortcomings, not all of them were unique. In particular, the main problem with the "religious" subgenre of horror films seems to me to be Hollywood's reluctance to engage Christianity on its own terms. It is quite possible to make really scary movies that are also orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. Without orthodoxy, films like these are anything but a smorgasbord of filmmakers' (mostly boring and illogical) notions. <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone seems to have made a film about physics, but not only did the basic laws of physics wrong, but the whole plot is based on their false representations, you would soon be tired of the resulting meaningless plot. The same goes for this kind of movies. <br /> <br /> In other words, "The Order" (and many similar films before) invent stuff about the Catholic Church and the Christian faith and try to build an action out of these inventions. Not surprisingly, the plot is incoherent and stupid. This movie has the added charm of being as interesting as your toenails grow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steamy pile.
