Defocused by Richard C. Sarafian, this catastrophe froze in the Japanese theaters before she came to the US and immediately went to the video, where she was only seen again when the Turner networks needed something other than infomercials to clear their windows of time 3 to 6 o'clock in the morning to fill tape at the bottom of her container. The Smithee name should be used if the studio hacks the movie so much that the director does not want to attach his name anymore. But I'm afraid that Sarafian can not fully push the studio to this studio. The actors, mostly graduates of "Overacting 101", deliver one Cornball line after another. The plot is tortuous. The special effects are not impressive. The parts that are not ridiculous are just boring. The script or book must have been good - why else would Palance, Matheson, Boyle or Heston agree to appear in this dachshund? But something went wrong from the page to the screen. Summary: Avoid. Not bad enough to be so bad - it's good.
