Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox shot a ton of Mr. Moto movies. Towards the end of the series, however, it was obvious that the studio had "jumped the shark", so to speak. This sentence indicates that a TV show has peaked and executives have decided to revive the show by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with "The Brady Bunch" they introduced the annoying "Cousin Oliver" and with "Family Ties" they introduced an unusual baby who was only six years old in one season! In the Moto movies they had introduced the comic relief, because they thought that these smart films would have to be revised. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler. And in this movie, the figure Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone could only be one of the most annoying examples of weird relief, as you always hoped that someone (preferably Moto) would kill him, just to silence him !! Although he should work for the famous Scotland Yard, he shows all the intelligence and brains of a brain-damaged turnip. Again and again his scenes were boorish and superfluous and Peter Lorre only looks painful as he stands there and "watches" this buffoon. It's so bad that it really destroyed what COULD was one of the better moto movies due to its nifty action. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, the opening scene reveals the crown of the Queen of Sheba. Moto is now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he was originally to protect the precious object from theft. In a big turn, several thieves try to steal the crown independently. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is on display, but also sufficient proof that the Moto series should end here. Anyway, with the impending World War II, the films would not have survived much longer, as a sympathetic Japanese protagonist in the US or Allied countries would simply not have been accepted.
