The only salvation was the small part of Larry Miller. It seemed that the film was trying too hard to be "Something About Mary", but I did not even like this film and did not meet those standards yet. The actor who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair is in the stupidity of her character Cruel Intentions. James Brolin was great, but Paul's dad seemed too eager to be the Randy Quaid figure from the Vacation films of National Lampoon.
