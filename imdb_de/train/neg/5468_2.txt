I love the "Toxic Avenger" series, but this weak victim of the Troma people made no sense, and I had to yawn all the time. <br /> <br /> A leaking nuclear power plant (and waxing) Weed next to it) makes the kids of Tromaville High go crazy, causing them to join a gang, have sex, explode and whatever. There's also some kind of monster breeding in high school ... my God, this movie is a mess. <br /> <br /> The actors have pretty much stopped their efforts after this movie and they should do it. The (intended) overreaction got on my nerves in about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointing. 10.2.
