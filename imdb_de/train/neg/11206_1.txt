Nobody is a bigger fan of the Flashman papers of Geroge Macdonald Fraser than me. <br /> <br /> I was only surprised when Richard Lester ran Royal Flash, because I also saw that he had made the Three / Four Musketeers. I did quite well with Fraser. <br /> <br /> Not so Royal Flash. <br /> <br /> I was 12 years old when the movie was released, and had not read any flashman since then, I was intoxicated by A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (me it still is, but after that he never really had a chance). <br /> <br /> What a disappointment (I saw it again when I was about 20, and on TV it seemed to be even worse.) None of the sharp dialogues in the books is transmitted to the screen. The comedy of Flashman's character seemed to me to have been mistreated in the same way one might imagine a group of high school students attempting to parody. The dueling and fencing was terrible and undramatic. Looking back with more mature eyes, the film could not fully exploit the possibilities of the direct satire of previous versions of the Prisoner of Zenda If you've read the book and have not seen the movie, all I can say is that the movie this ends up making Flashman and Rudi of Starnberg quick friends and playing a game that Rudi has just invented: Russian Roulette. <br /> <br /> A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about. <br /> <br /> My comments would be more direct if I had seen the movie lately, but I'm glad I did not. <br /> <br /> If Fraser ever reads this, all I can say is that I think he's a genius - maybe the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but because of my appreciation for this work body, it's hard to believe that he wrote it was the script of that movie when he made all those horrible James Bond films of Roger Moore.
