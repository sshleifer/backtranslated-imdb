I had just watched an episode of this program and could not even reach the end of the program. Every minute I had seen this program, my I.Q had to drop by 10 points. This is basically like a kids program, but with swearing. Not even the cursing and insults she tells other people made me laugh. Anyway, the story must have been written by a monkey, and the people who actually did this script for this program had to be kept at gunpoint and had no choice but to shoot this restrained, disappointing, terribly played program. Sarah Silverman should use the little money she actually made out of this program and get damn acting lessons.
