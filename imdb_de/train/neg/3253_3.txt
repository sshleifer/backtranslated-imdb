I actually saw China O'Brien II before I ever saw the original China O'Brien. And I have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = funnier! And funnier = better. If you're a bad movie fan like me, this is a great material. However, if you are looking for a meaningful act, acting or film skill, this is best avoided. The best part is how they filmed all the combat sequences in the stutter of fast forward. Funny bad. See it for a laugh, you see it for mindless entertainment, but whatever you do, you watch it for free on TV.
