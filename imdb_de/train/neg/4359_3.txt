Wow, after I threw away the disc of Timo Rose's "Rout City" after about 15 minutes (South Park is more than senseless cursing ... I guess some people just do not understand it) I was interested in this movie. I read some positive stuff and the packaging and look of the film seemed a long way from all the garbage I expected to get to "Rout city". Surprise: The movie is not a total garbage, but the problem seems to be just that. Timo Rose tries to follow in the footsteps of German horror / splatter cinema like Olaf Ittenbach and the like. That means "Barricade" is sometimes extremely bloody and detailed. The Gore FX are not really credible, but OK, the acting is OK, but in some cases it's just crap. The Hillbilly Chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and does not get better until it's turned. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem ... the movie is bloody, has a typical German underground atmosphere (including the classic) snapshots in blood), OK FX and a modern feel about how to package it has promised? <br /> <br /> 1. The script is totally BS. You get a typical Hillbilly / Lost in the Wood story with some guys + gal camping out and meeting a degenerate hillbilly family. Everything just leads to the torture / mutilation scenes and seems to be incredibly random and meaningless. This is the first thing that makes "Barricade" halfhearted. <br /> <br /> 2. Random is also the perfect description for a lot of camera work (I liked the repetitive cut of the tweezers in the scene with extended blisters ... either they did not have any material or the editor works in a hardware store ). Even worse is the cut ... sure, it's modern and much better than many other films of the genre, but its RANDOM. They have overused the typical exposure effect everywhere and without meaning ... it's just always there ... all the time. Then there's a bit grainy / loud movie look, which is thrown back and forth here and there. I do not understand the meaning. <br /> Like the aforementioned effects, there is a lot of repetitive stuff here. For example, most kills are dealt with multiple repetitions of stitch and stroke. It's fine, but here it is annoying and unreal, especially towards the end. Annoying is also the "music", which is used permanently without changing the background. It does not take long until the movie is hardly bearable. <br /> <br /> 4. That's the biggest problem of this movie (and many others in my opinion). When you make a splatter movie with trashy movies, it's pretty idiotic to polish it with special effects and new school classes. It looks like they take it too seriously. It's no fun because the decent Gore FX are simply wasted in this regard. And where the classic Gore-FX are okay, the computer FX in scenes like the sting in the mouth or the shots in the ending seem pretty stupid (and 3D Splatter usually sucks me in movies with a budget and decent 3D) Artists) /> <br /> I've often wondered if the time of serious splatter movies is over and "Barricade" is just another example. Maybe it's time to put it to death. It's no fun, has no character and is too trashy for its looks. The script is a cheap attempt to bring "Wrong Turn" and "TCM" absolutely nowhere. You can take that literally ... the end is just there and just as arbitrary as many other things here ("I love you" in a splatter movie ... come on !!). "Barricade" tries to build a lot and fails ... You can certainly make a fast-forward through this movie to defuse yourself extensively, to melt acid, to nip the nipples and to stab in a tent Friday (bloody) Booby Hurray!) , But it's really hard to get through this. Total failure, especially because you can see that it could have been something.
