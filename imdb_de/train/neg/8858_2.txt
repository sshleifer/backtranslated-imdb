Ben, a police officer, is convinced that his sister has been brutally killed and wants to bring her murderer to justice, but he is approached by Stefan, who believes his sister has become a victim of a werewolf cult. So Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan travel to Transylvania to put an end to this evil. <br /> <br /> This is unbelievably horrible stuff from the B-Class and I was wondering how it got published. It makes the original "Howling" like a masterpiece. What did Christopher Lee think, as this must be his worst performance I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was a lot wrong with this really cheap movie, which ranged from the really hammering and wooden performances of Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not to mention Lee), cheesy fashion (those sunglasses), cheap and lame special effects, bad use of lighting, humor ... if there was any trashy 80s music (some of the movies focus only on unknown bands), werewolfs orgies, a sight and a tedious story with flat and annoying dialogues. I thought if it was that bad, it would be terribly funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> What was positive was that the location and settings of the movie looked great, but that's about it ... actually, I'll add Sybil Danning with a short strip scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, the band plays their Misthaus song during a strange montage of scenes from the movie, which makes me wonder why. <br /> <br /> A terrible mess, but at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
