Normally I do not comment on anything (I read the opinions of others) ... but this one I have to comment on ... I was convinced to watch this movie through worlds like Action, F-117 and other high-tech stuff, but already after a few minutes and I changed my mind ... Bad drama, lousy script and a big science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Just ... do not bother ... <br /> <br /> And one more thing, before I watch a movie, I usually check the comments and ratings of the users on this site ... 3.7 points and I give a try, now I wonder who rated this movie by telling him more than 2 points gives ??????????
