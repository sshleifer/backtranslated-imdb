Ok, I admit, it started very well and good, but then it just fell off. I can not believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar could finish the script after about 5 minutes of the movie. The only reason I really sat through the whole thing I wanted to see the twist on ned, and to my surprise, folks, I can not even tell you if there was one because the end just makes you confused and then the credit roll, I was like hell? This did not deserve a run, I'm sorry, but it did not mean it was awful. The only reason I gave him a 4 is because it had some nervous parts ... that's it! You can see it, I do not tell you not to like it, hey you may like it or even love it! But if you hate it, do not say I did not warn you!
