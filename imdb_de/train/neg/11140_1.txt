I thought I would see a scary movie ... and laughed all the way through the movie. In the scene where man turned into a werewolf, I thought they were joking. Today's computer games have ten times better animations. Low budget, is a fitting comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie. It has good special effects as they should be (human transformation into werewolf). If you do not want a good laugh, I would not recommend you to watch this movie. This movie is a joke.
