This is an amateur movie that was shot on video, not an "electrifying drama," as the notes on the DVD liner are a false boast. I have seen much better things from undergraduate students. Most of the story unfolds with an all-finite taxi ride through Jakarta. This movie could have been made with a single video camera, but there are some sections where two cameras were used and the content was later pushed together. The processing is extremely rough. The final editing was probably done with two cameras, with content thrown back and forth instead of a suitable editor. Maybe they also worked in the taxi? The English subtitles were written by someone who does not speak English fluently, eg. B. "Where are you going now?" To say that the production quality is equivalent to Blair Witch is generous. If you are not yet scared, this movie was an ambitious and creative endeavor with many cool and funky images from all over Jakarta.
