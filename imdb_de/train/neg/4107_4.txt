The problem with "The Killer Elite" is that by going to this movie and spending time looking at it, you put more effort into the experience than many of its leaders, especially director Sam Peckinpah. <br /> <br /> The already elusive Peckinpah was in harsh weather with this movie. According to at least one biographer, he met cocaine there. In addition, his jerk is drunk, and it's no wonder things have fallen apart. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the concept behind the film is good and the first ten minutes promise a lot. Mike Locken (James Caan) and George Hansen (Robert Duvall) are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA. They move fast, live well and seem to be their best friends - then something happens that shakes their brotherhood. <br /> <br /> An opening scene shows how they blow up a building - why exactly that is not said for the course in terms of the murky motivation of this film. But the implication is that these people hurt people and do not really care about them - anti-heroes like the Wild League of Peckinpah, who was not that long ago. An opening title tells us that they work for ComTeg, and adds with obvious humor "... the idea that the CIA could use such an organization for any purpose is, of course, absurd." That's a pretty smart way to let the audience know that all bets are suspended. <br /> <br /> Add to that a traditionally strong peckinpah substitute, including Burt Young, Gig Young, and Peckinpah's regular Bo Hopkins in the Plum Roll A madman who does not miss the opportunity to shell out for $ 500 a day and you only wish that the screenwriters, including the famous Sterling Silliphant, are trying to do something more with the story than to turn them into a platform for lazy-liners and bad chop-socky knockoffs. An attempt to inject a dose of liberal social commentary is awkwardly tricked. "They are so busy doing their dirty work, you can not say who the bad guys are," someone says to Locken, as if he or we need it pointed out. Worse, Peckinpah's awkward direction and slow pace. We're 40 minutes before the film, before we get our first fight scene, a totally chaotic collection of random shots in which a group of people we have not even met before are fought at San Francisco airport. Your fight is interrupted by a conversation office suite. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the rest of the cast consists of leading a battle in a fleet of dead Victory ships, ninjas running outdoors to be shot down, while Caan discards a liner undermines every touch of true suspense. "Put me down at seven to five, I'll take the little guy," he jokes shortly before a samurai duel between two ninja warriors - from China, whom we all know is the land of the ninja. (The battle takes place in San Francisco, but surprisingly no mounties arrive to separate things.) Caan is much better in smaller scenes than when curls recover from some nasty wounds By his bosses, played by a slick Arthur Hill , he was from the organization "Humpty Dumping". Caan refuses to stay down, and his recovery scenes, although triggering momentum for the film, are shown as supportive nurses by him and Amy Heflin, Van's daughter. Caan was one of the best actors of the 70s, and his laconic play with Heflin, Duvall and Hopkins, and both Youngs give "Killer Elite" real observability. <br /> <br /> But you do not see "Killer Elite". to think about it. You see it and think of the movie that got away.
