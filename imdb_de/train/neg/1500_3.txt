Oh, that's so bad, it's funny. The only way to explain something like this is a drugged porn party, which meant that a movie should be shot just for fun. I mean, you see porn actresses topless, have sex and then get killed by human mutants. There's a lot of gore, including the classic, "Something's wrong with her, oh no, it's half the person she once was," and the random murder caused by panic. But you can also find funny things, such. B. Guts that are pulled by someone's butt, and a man who runs in the forest and is then beheaded by a wire guided between two trees (which then makes a metallic sound like cartoons). Somehow there is a market for people who go beyond pornography, they really need to know what an actress is, mere genitals are not enough. Therefore, you will see many summary autopsies on killed Bimbos. There is NO dialogue. Jenna and Chasey have really small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when he took on a role here. I think this is a movie that you can watch with the button in the fast forward and just look at the juicy stuff, just to be reminded of the old horror films of the C-class.
