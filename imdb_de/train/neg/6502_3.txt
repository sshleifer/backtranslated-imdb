Since I had the opportunity to write in my own film, to play and collaborate directly, I would probably choose something about robotic women with pistols. Anthony Hopkins, however, decided to make perhaps the strangest movie anyone has ever seen. "Slipstream" is a movie that is so strange that even David Lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say, "What's going on?". <br /> <br /> This is a movie in which in a scene A man crosses the street in the direction of a yellow car to the right, which suddenly turns into a pink car to the left. This is a movie in which two characters talk, with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing the walls. This is a movie in which a man starts talking about "Bodysnatchers Invasion" just so that the actor of that particular movie suddenly pops up as himself (and then shows up in the air). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot right out the window, making fifteen different edits and, for seemingly no reason, switching from black and white to color at all. <br /> <br /> However, I have to praise Mr. Hopkins for his selection of actors in this film (some of whom have several characters). Everyone involved is in their roles, even though they probably have no idea what they are actually doing. My favorite here was Christian Slater's thug with a hat that was impressively menacing as he babbled nonsense and sang the American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins was quoted as saying that he made this film a joke, and that may be the best way to summarize "Slipstream." It's a joke for the audience. They will observe it from beginning to end, trying to understand what is going on, and hope that the answer will come, only to find that the answer never really works. What the point of this joke is, only Anthony Hopkins will ever know. <br /> <br /> I mentioned David Lynch earlier and I'm a big fan of this director. I would guess Anthony Hopkins shares my love for "Twin Peaks," "Blue Velvet," and "Lost Highway." However, "Slipstream" is not as satisfying as most of Lynch's films, though many of his techniques have been imitated (though I was surprised to find that in "Slipstream" nobody talks backwards). It's way too chaotic and random - as another reviewer noted here, it's the movie version of Alzheimer's disease. No doubt there are a small number out there watching and pulling something out of it. Unfortunately for the rest of us, "Slipstream" quickly becomes an annoying and confusing experience made possible only by Hopkins' commitment. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
