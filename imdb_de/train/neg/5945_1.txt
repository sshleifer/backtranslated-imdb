A black man fights ..... and supposedly wins ... yes ... 1/10. Obviously fiction. <br /> <br /> We are presented with a dammigen beautiful title, a really nice marker line and even a nice plotting line. That's it, that's where it ends. We go into fiction about that. <br /> <br /> Michael Jai White, the black guy is not mistaken for the name. He's a black guy. Um, that's all that's in the name. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to find decent help, the black guys must have hired friends to help provoke the low budget and low inability of this movie. The shadow of the camera follows the first scenes .... Yeah obviously an idiot moment for the average guy like you and me .. but yeah ... <br /> <br /> 10 lines. Review filed,. If you've paid to watch this movie, you've been screwed up.
