This movie is the worst excuse for a movie I've ever seen. At the beginning I would like to say that the cover picture of this film is definitely misleading. If you think you're seeing a really terrifying horror movie with a monster clown, you're soooo wrong. In fact, the killer's face does not quite resemble the front cover, it's just an image that they must have found on Google and found it cool. Speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool, there's a scene in this movie where some of the gangs in the old forest are looking for their boyfriend, and then the screen suddenly jumps to a scene where a mother stag is young is in a sparkling sunlight ... I mean seriously WTF ??? How is that relevant to the dark forests they hike through? I bought this movie from a man in a market, hoping it would be entertaining. If it were not horror, it would be funny, right? NOT CORRECT! The next day I gave it to my colleague who freed me from the plague called S.I.C.K. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: do not see this movie !!!
