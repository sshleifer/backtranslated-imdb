Sorry guys, I already wrote my opinion on this movie, but today was the first day I looked at the other reviews. There are a lot of people who agree with me, but it is scary that there are some people who really seem to like this movie. I do not like writing bad reviews or criticizing others' opinions, but I think it's only fair to warn anyone who is debating whether to watch this movie or not. This is not a good movie. I really like movies a lot and I look at almost everything, but this movie made it to the incredibly short list of films I watched, and was glad I could leave half of my films. If you are really tempted, take a look at the trailer. That's the mistake I made because the whole movie is essentially in the trailer. After that, there are no surprises, just a shockingly bad dialogue to lose time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias ​​and would hate to criticize him, but I think it's my duty to stop other people from wasting hours of their lives on a movie like this one.
