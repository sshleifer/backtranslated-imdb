"A total waste of time" Just throw in a few explosions without fighting, exotic cars a jumbled millionaire, car crashes caused by a slow-motion computer and last but not least a Hugh Hefner-like character with hot, hot women, and mix together a mixer and you will have this excuse for a movie. I really laughed out of the "Dr. Evil" like a greatly strengthened connection. The plot was somewhere between absurd and nonexistent. How many millionaires are willing to bet on a $ 25 million car race? Answer: 4 But did not they become millionaires through fiscal responsibility? This was written for pubescent men, it plays like a video game. I enjoyed the Gulfstream II landing in the desert anyway.
