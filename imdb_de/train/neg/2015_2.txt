I was really looking forward to this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I'm a fly nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters. I do not like this program because it brings the imagination to an incredible level. The world record for helicopters was set up a few years ago by a Westland Lynx at 249 mph. The only helicopter ever to be faster was the experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960s. It hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter, meaning that at the end of its fuselage it had a pusher propeller that provides for thrust wing flight. And the Bell 222, the "actor" who portrayed Airwolf, was not very fast even for helicopters. And it did not stay long in production. <br /> <br /> At that time, a movie called "Blue Thunder" came out, which was much more realistic.
