Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are one day kidnapped by threatening guys and taken back to a remote island, where the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited them at the age of ten and have a fortune. All this is a book that presents a rather long review of the first visit of the girls on the island and the subsequent struggle with a cannibalistic family. <br /> <br /> This movie is being cruelly acted by all parties I started to feel bad for poor Hank Worden, who really deserves MUCH MORE. As much as I did not like "Barracuda" (that's on the same DVD), I have to admit that this movie makes it look like Citizen Kane. <br/> <br /> Eye Candy: a pair of tits (she might belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My Note: F <br /> <br /> Dark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage Advertising for different drive-in dishes; and followers for "Bonnie's Kids" (Features Nudity), "Centerfold Girls", "Parttime Wife" (Features Nudity), "Psychic Killer" & "Eaten Alive". The DVD also comes with 1978 "Barracuda"
