Please, even if you are in the worst mood, you should not see this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not think there was anything wrong with this movie. On the recommendation of a friend, I observed this and literally washed the cupboard down for 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life. Bad action, stupid direction, weak action and pathetic action sequences - and if you put this together, you get "Double Impact". Even the slightest expectations were not met. <br /> <br /> I think I've learned one thing: never Van Damme action-flicks. They are a waste of time!
