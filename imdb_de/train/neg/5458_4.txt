This film seems to be a pathetic attempt to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. To do this, they throw out a 19-year-old, probably not "to do this". In no case would they have been able to throw a 12- or 13-year-old boy as a boy, because the love scenes would have kicked everyone out (if they allowed them at all) - as it should. Mary Ann's friend was the same age as my nephew, making her a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of pedophiles does not have to include many children - all you need is one. <br /> <br /> I really do not care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage. She had a responsibility to her students that she did not fulfill. The reason given is that she is bipolar, refuses the diagnosis and refuses to take her medication. It's understandable that she did not think rationally. It is hoped that she now understands her actions. <br /> <br /> Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together, I pray that she take medication and think clearly. Besides, Penelope Ann Miller was absolutely convincing and perfect for the role.
