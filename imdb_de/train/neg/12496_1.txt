To be brutally honest ... I loved watching Severed. That's why I gave him 1/10 stars for his absolutely unimaginative <br /> <br /> story / filming / acting / all. This movie was a RIOT to watch. If you enjoy watching bad movies for fun, you'll really get a kick out of Severed. <br /> <br /> The story It does not really matter, it's about a guy who is bald <br /> <br /> and has a sword and goes around beheading random people. <br /> <br /> But he has a supernatural twist ... nobody ever sees him. <br /> <br /> Even if he goes to a jam-packed nightclub in a memorable scene and chops off the noodles of some girls and nobody sees it. <br /> <br /> Severed does not look like it was filmed on video - it was <br /> <br /> filmed on a camcorder from home. The filmmakers had <br /> <br /> knowledge of lighting (very thin knowledge) and composition <br /> <br /> in some scenes. But most of the time you can not hear the actors ... They can not understand what they are doing, and they laugh when the next target disappoints their pumpkin from his body. <br /> <br /> Go and lend this movie. Support movies like these - they're a shout and <br /> <br /> a Hollar!
