I read Ben Mezrich's novel Reaper a few years ago, and I came by mistake last night to see this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Although it's been years since I read the story for the first time, the differences between the novel and the movie are huge. Very important elements that make the whole thing plausible are simply spelled out or badly changed. <br /> <br /> If the action sounds interesting to you: Go and get the novel. It is much, much, much better. <br /> <br /> Still 4 out of 10, because it was hard to stop watching Ben Mezrich's great story.
