This may not be the worst comedy ever, but it's close. The producers of this movie have stolen one and a half hours of my life, and I want it back! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan is funny for about 10 minutes. His high voice and his crazy beat are getting old and then you realize that the rest of the movie is a lot worse. He falls into a long line of former SNL players who have tried movies. Some were brilliant, others failed miserably. There is not much middle ground in this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant and then was fine and then not so funny and then dead ... so I guess he hits the full spectrum in a career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague. <br /> c
