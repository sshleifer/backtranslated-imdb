Yes, I know that I am one of the few people who want to trample this film into the dust of oblivion. Let me tell you why I feel that way. If it had been advertised as a zombie movie or something similar, I might have enjoyed it. But at the moment I am completely speechless. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure What to ruin * Let's start with the first GIANT mistake. If I had not known that the movie was called "Darkness - The VAMPIRE Version" and if I had not seen some sequences where some people suck blood, I would not have seen the connection to vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Give me a break !!! <br /> <br /> Second bad point: what about Metal? It seems that all young people, but especially the so-called "vampires", like different kinds of metal, mainly based on their shirts! Do not get me wrong, I have been in extreme forms of music for almost 15 years, but no one will scare me by showing me some ridiculous teens in Iron Maiden (all bands !!!). T-shirts that run around pretending to be vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I could use here. Third weakness: the actors. Wait a minute. WHAT Actor?! You mean the wood friends of the director! Words would be waste here. <br /> <br /> Yeah, okay, the movie is very bloody, but what's the difference? It would be a strong point and something to enjoy if the "brilliant" director did not opt ​​for an ARTIFICIAL vampire theme in this film. I wanted to see vampires, but was treated to some stupid kids I would have liked to wear my baseball bat for. The filmmakers should have simply advertised the movie "cheap B-class horror without plot, but lots of gore." This film is a blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. And it makes me sick.
