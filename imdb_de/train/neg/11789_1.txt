Actually, it had to stop. Do not get me wrong, love bad monster movies. However, this was too boring, regardless of the exciting music that never takes you anywhere. The actress had too many teeth and the moment she came in contact with one of the animals was a clich√©. This movie totally reveals the cover on the DVD, which looks pretty interesting. From the cover you expect a giant monster, but you get this cute not as gigantic as expected eel. Moved to watch another movie called The Killer Rats, but that's another review. Deep Shock was really crap, a big shame, considering the budget is quite high.
