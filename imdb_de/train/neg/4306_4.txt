There's a good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! I'm sorry to be so dull, but it's the truth. Too bad that she did not act. It would have made at least this confusion bearable. We see the breasts of another chick, but it is not far from Lola. And man, is Armand Assante old or what? The man looks like crap! "Consequence" is the usual B-movie you would expect. The story had potential. It's as if they have good ideas, but they did not know how to implement them. The cinematography is just awful. Ugly! The director is not inspired and the end result is a fat thriller with lame turns and washed-up actors. Lola Gaudini is great as a vixen in a cheap, sloppy way, but even she does not "save" Consequence from garbage and junk, just old stinking garbage.
