This movie was filmed and cast from my hometown. I remember the excitement and the whole story about the fact that Molly Ringwald was in town ... <br /> <br /> Storyline ... <br /> <br /> Essentially 20 years after one Film "was relocated" To rest ", without finishing, a group of film students set off - with dire consequences - it seems someone does not want the film to be finished. <br /> <br / > The storyline is weak, it has to be remembered that this is a comedy and therefore needs to be cheekbitten, but it did not really kick things up, the characters are mostly transperant and the little information you get about them It's funny to hear Kylie's accent as an Australian, and it was nice to see a kid I went to school with in a lead role, but that does not solve the movie at all goodness knows why the Manufacturers thought they would come to Molly Ringwald. Maybe because of the nature of the movie (it's a kind of homage to 80's movies / bad horror movies), but really an Aussie actor would have put it all right. <br /> <br /> As far as casting is concerned, a lot of it was the show seemed to be clogged. Some of these kids (especially the two main chics - they played "director" and "producer") looked like they wanted to act. That's never a good look. The shots also had a rough feeling. Maybe overexposed? Just not as smooth as you are used to. <br /> <br /> The murderer. Sir. Could it be less scary? However, there are some shock factors and some rough scenes. I liked the movie, but it was not great. It took 90 minutes, but could have taken less. If they had tightened the script, it might have been better. They had killed many characters - but it was not a real build until they were slain. If they had killed fewer people and actually focused on a scary atmosphere, it would have been better. Now I know it's a comedy and elements were funny. Or so incredible that they were funny. But I am not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
