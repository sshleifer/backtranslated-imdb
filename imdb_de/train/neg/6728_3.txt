This movie is hardly good, not great at all. A few memorable scenes and the unfortunate choice of combining Norma Jean with a real actress. Jane Russell has everything for her, Marilyn's smaller wife and / or actress. One wonders why this is considered one of the highlights of her lame career. 3.10
