Actually, it's a horrible trick of a movie. His 70-minute run is very well filled with stock footage. The rest are not describable outdoor scenes and dark interior scenes. The plot exposure is rendered very poorly. They are all just fleeting scenes strung together. In the scene selection, no drama is attempted, but drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors. Please do not ask. <br /> <br /> The plot is a rocket that emits millions of degrees of heat, orbiting the earth five miles up and threatening to destroy the earth. It's a real threat that needs to be redirected when a custom H-bomb can be crafted and deployed in an experimental rocket within an hour. There is not much to report here except a crazy speech by a scientist against the project, because there may be some kind of life on board and thought of the scientific possibilities, but that speech of the compulsory idiotic liberal was pretty much gone by then /> What saves this movie is something other than the footage. I've never seen a bigger selection of fifty jet fighters in another movie. This is by no means a complete list, but only some of the aircraft I've seen. There is a brief interception by a pilot who alternately flies an F-89 Scorpion and an F-86. First, interceptors of the Royal Canadian Air Force have been deployed in Hawker Hunters and F-86 Saber Jets (or Canadian-built CF-13s) and even a pair of CF-100 Clunks. Then for some reason, B-52, B-47 and even B36 are taking off. Further upholstery. <br /> <br /> "These Canadian jets move at a speed of 1200 miles per hour". I do not think so, as one of them seems to be a World War II Gloster Meteor, the rest of the F-80s. The meteors express the attack and they turn into a late F-84F with a flight of early straight F-84 attacking in formation. <br /> <br /> There is a strange tandem cockpit version of the F-80 that does not work It seems to be the T-33 training type, but a kind of interceptor variant with radar in the nose , These are confused in a snowstorm. <br /> <br /> From an angle of 500 meters an aircraft carrier can be seen at an angle. It launches F-8U Crusaders, F-11F Tigers, A-5 Vigilantes and A-3 Skywarriors. The Air Force blurs F-86s and F-84s and more F-89s you've ever seen in your life, as well as F-100 super sabers and F-102 Delta Daggers. <br /> <br /> The F -100s push their assault with sooooo much padding. The F-89 unload their rockets in their wing caps in slo mo. The F-86s fire an F-102 unleashes a Falcon, even some F-80s (F-94s?) With mid-wing rocket pods. It is a very strange setting of a late model F-84 (prototype?) With a straight wing of the early model F-85 in a round, obviously a manufacturer's film (Republic Aviation) showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the F-84 ThunderJet. How it got lost here, is in any case guesses. <br /> <br /> There are other great shots of Ottawa in the old days, when the capital of Canada was a broad point on the street and particularly wonderful shots of the New York City Times Square during one of the civil defense exercises in the early '50s years. <br /> <br /> I think we also have to deal with the idea that this was shot in Canada, with the possible exception of the Auto-Chase, which appears late in the picture as the Pacific Ocean in the background too seems to be. The use of a Jowett Jupiter is a bit dazzling and there is also a nice TR 3. Canada must have been cheap and used in the background rather for free. <br /> <br /> As far as the actual narrative of the film is concerned, there is little to recommend, unless the secret of Ellen Parker Enter your finger at the bottom of the picture. And the safest thing is to throw someone off. Could it be R as in Robert Loggia? The director who dies before this movie was released? Her career, since this was her last merit? <br /> <br /> Like the newspaper the gift was wrapped in, it's more valuable than the gift.
