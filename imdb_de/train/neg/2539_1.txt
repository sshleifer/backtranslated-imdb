The sequel to the at least entertaining original pseudo-documentary film The Legend of Boggy Creek is one of the worst garbage ever unleashed in public for a 35 mm film. Bad script, worse acting, etc. etc. Dawn Wells had to hope that Gilligan would rescue her and bring her back to the island to escape this gossip.
