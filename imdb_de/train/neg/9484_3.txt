If I have to give this movie a rating on a linear scale, then I have to give it a low rating of 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was entertaining and there are some good things about <br /> <br /> Psychiatric candidate James Bishop is assigned to St. Andrews Hospital because of his residence. He is excited and wants to "change the world". From the Beginning In the movie, you know that the hospital hides a wicked truth, but James believes he can make a difference and does not acknowledge that evil. <br /> <br /> The story builds up pretty well, you always know that it's a truth in what patients say about the evil of a resident, and I wonder when and how James will find out , Even when the break comes, James is in a sense chased by evil, and you feel tense until "the fight" is over. <br /> <br /> Add an innocent beautiful girlfriend who arrives at the wrong time other standard horror elements, and you get a picture. <br /> <br /> The character structure is pretty good actually, you are presented to most people who are killed, some of them "get to know". <br /> <br /> The film sets an awkward scene, and that's pretty well done. There are secrets that are revealed in an acceptable way. <br /> <br /> The main character James is very credible - the story about an eager student who starts working is good in this environment. <br /> <br /> What kills this movie is: * Stupid special effects - a modern version of "Plan 9 from the space" - bad (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad acting (or probably very few settings when shooting) - The main characters are sometimes bad and sometimes good. * The sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> I always thought "I could do a movie with my home video camera".
