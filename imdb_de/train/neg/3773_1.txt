If people ask me what the worst movie I've ever seen is this one. It is not even near MST3k riffing or midnight sightseeing in a theater or even as a late bottler of the Disney Channel. The only time I wanted to go to Disney World (or in this case the Disney / MGM studios) was to take Dick Tracey's jacket off the mannequin, tear it to shreds, and tear it in the neck of the tour guides. "Eat that Eat this unholy cloak of darkness !!! " I've never been mad at a movie, not even "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". You want beautiful colors and cinematography? Is not here, baby. The reviewers always say "oh, but it also looks like a comic book", well, for me it's the color of a Gordito after a few weeks in the sun. About as pleasant as that. Beatty wanders around in this landscape and jumps with his watch, himself and occasionally the other actors, hoping someone will tell him when the sequel will begin. To be fair, I've only seen this movie once, but my pain threshold is that of a man, not a god.
