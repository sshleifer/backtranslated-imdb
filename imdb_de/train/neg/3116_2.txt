Most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film is true. <br /> <br /> BUT .... If I had to play a movie: <br /> <br /> Director </ br> <br /> Director of Photography <br /> <br /> Editor <br /> <br /> Can not miss the damn Microphone boom jumping in and out of the movie for almost every chapter of the movie, how can I enjoy the story and focus and believe in the damned thing, though I am reminded of the technical aspects of filmmaking !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> WAIT FOR THE DVD OR NOT OTHER
