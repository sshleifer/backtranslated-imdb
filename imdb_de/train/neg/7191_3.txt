I saw it last night at the Midnight Slam of the Festival du Film du Monde in Montreal. What a disappointment. This movie is clearly overrated by IMDb fans. The acting was only regular. The director did not bring anything new or interesting. The plot lacks considerably: The film is all about the college graduates and the game they play to call pranks (7eventy 5ive). In addition, you can predict the end of the movie in the first five minutes. If you like pranks and a slasher with an ax that only lets you jump once or twice throughout the movie, you might like it. If not, this movie is not worth it.
