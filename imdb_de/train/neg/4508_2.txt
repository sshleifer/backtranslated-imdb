Andrewjlau, I could not agree anymore. My girlfriend is watching this, and I find this movie horrible. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: "You do it all for a man!?" <br /> <br /> I think these women have no intensity, no sense of the struggle between tragedy and identity, and for whom these men are hardly worth fighting. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them over, the men are more than stupid to admire. Japanese have much more intensity than Chinese, and geisha is Japanese culture. I'm sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces do not match the main surface. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is so uninteresting, so American anyway. If a European had done it with European Orientals, they would have done a much better job. <br /> <br /> I have to add: It seems that most of the people who liked the movie are Americans. Sorry, but no wonder. Everything written for you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think the Chinese actresses are lovely, but I could not say that they are good actors in this movie. Yes, the cinematography is great, but really I can not see how you can see that these characters are complex, deep individuals. <br /> <br /> I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure that would be amazing.
