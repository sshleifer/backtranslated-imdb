I saw this movie in 1979, when I was 17 or 18 when it was released. The theater was maybe 1/4 full when the movie started. After ten minutes in the movie, I and the friend who visited the movie with me were the only two people in the theater. The movie was really funny and had no plot or reason for the script, and people demanded their money back. We decided to stay for the whole movie ... why have to endure these tortures? We wanted to be true movie critics ... having a standard on which all other films are based is hard to say that you've seen the best movie (a 10) that always has something better in it. However, it's easy to base all the other movies on the worst movie ever made (and that's it ... at best, a 1). There may be other films that are really suitable as 1, but I have not seen them yet. I now support all the movies I see on a scale based on this worst ... I AM A TRUE FILM CRITIC ... he he.
