Terrible ... just awful. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I've seen pretty bad pictures over the years. The sound is bad for the quality of the picture, the direction, the drama ... etc. The only good shots (which is weird because they are so bad) are the special effects. Overall, there are about 5 minutes of laughter. The rest of the strip causes brain damage.
