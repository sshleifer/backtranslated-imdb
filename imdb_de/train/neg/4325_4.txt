The second in the Vacation series is by far the easiest, as Clark Griswold wins a trip for the whole family to Europe. <br /> <br /> The tasteless, under-the-belt humor that worked so well the first time around is virtually nonexistent here. This mistake is undoubtedly with director Hackerling, who is obviously not as good as a director like Harold Ramis, and a very boring script, in which only a handful of decent lines are scattered. <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase adds some form of life to the process, but it just is not enough and the very funny Eric Idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unhappy Englishman. Some possibly funny moments are not fully exhausted and usually make the viewer more difficult. All depictions of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost universally not funny at all (just as the English are socially polite). Apart from a few scenes hardly a laugh is in sight and the end is not over yet in complete slapstick. But if you're a fan of Chevy Chase (like me), the movie can be seen, but not anymore.
