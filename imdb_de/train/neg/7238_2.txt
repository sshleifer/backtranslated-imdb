The interaction of the characters is a moral disaster. Most characters do not like you, and you do not like any of them. <br /> <br /> Even the two main characters played by David and Gwen are so poorly written that you really do not care about them. The film has no action, no direction and no purpose. The only salvation quality of the film was to see it as an insight into the nasty lives of some losers - and that's hardly stimulating even as afternoon garbage.
