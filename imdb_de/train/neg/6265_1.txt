I happen to be the nephew of the director. It took me years to get a copy of this film in my hands, and I can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies ever. My uncle does not even have a copy of it (I asked). I'm looking forward to bringing him a copy. <br /> <br /> At the moment, the average rating of the film is 1.9 / 10. From what I can tell, it should be in the mid-30s in the IMDb "bottom 100", but with only 206 Voices have not been placed yet The film does not even get the respect of a 100cc title. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm giving family members copies of the movie for Christmas presents this year. Best / worst gift ever?
