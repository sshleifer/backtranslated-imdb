When these people take so many shots, use old footage, and beast animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed in an actor-made set, what can you believe? The old film about countries is beautiful, but the abuse and humiliation of natives by animals is painful to watch in these films. I know racism is fine in these old movies, but there's more to it for this couple to lose credibility. Pictured as aviators, they never flew with their aircraft. Martin Johnson was a former Vaudevillian. He used friends like Jack London to help them financially, while he fended them off royalties that denied his wife's apparent depression, and used her as a cute prop to unbearable. They were by no means the first to travel to these countries or the first to write about them. He was okay as a filmmaker and photographer, but that's about it.
