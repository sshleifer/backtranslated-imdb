In the 1970s, "Seed" focused on the convicted serial killer Max Seed (Will Sanderson), who had killed 666 people in 6 years. He is sentenced to death, but he does not die in the electric chair, even after being shocked three times. Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other policemen hide this secret by burying Seed alive. Seed breaks out and follows the people who put him in his living coffin. <br /> <br /> Filmed by the World's Worst Director (Uwe Boll), "Seed" is nothing more than a snuff movie about trying to stretch the envelope of a decent society and provide no aspect of an action. And he said that this is based on true events, because if a person survives the electric chair after three shocks, they will be released. This is an urban legend and would never happen. Similar to Boll's other abominations ("Alone in the Dark" for one), "Seed" is simply appalling.
