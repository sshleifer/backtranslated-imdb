This could be the worst movie adaptation of a Broadway musical ever. Even the music was destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and every moment rings wrong. However, I will say that it is almost bad enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> The hairstyles are remarkably old-fashioned. I can not understand for my life what (conceptual) is meant when I open the film with an exterior of the theater playing "A Chorus Line". Should we think that these people are auditioning for "A Chorus Line", which contains the stories about the people who audition? Oh no, the show breaks down. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production and heard the album hundreds of times. Why did you do that?
