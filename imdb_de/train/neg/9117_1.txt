... or maybe it's just so bad. The plot is a cheap resurrection of the first, which is strange, as it is supposed to be a prequel and not a sequel. Pretty much the entire movie seems to be a cheap remake of the first movie, with scenes that mimic the things that happened in the first movie, just more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first had a good cast, this consisted of cast members of the B-list and rejections. Acting is usually terribly bad. Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first, like almost every main character, including those who were not in the first movie. I realize that this is a TV series pilot episode, but that's no excuse. They did not have to turn the (bad) footage into a movie. Only one thing is slightly good, and that's the erotic sequences. However, since these are not nearly as good as the first, it does not go beyond a rating of 1. If you have the opportunity to see it for free, and you are a pure guy, this might be the case. It's worth checking to see if you want something erotic that is not porn. If not, avoid it at all costs. 1.10
