Let me say that I've always been a Steven Seagal fan and his films are usually great, but that just does not fit the rest. In my opinion, that's very stupid, that I did not like it all. The biggest reason why I do not like it is that it's very flawed and does not make much sense to me. Acting is very bad, even Steven Seagal does not do any good. The rest of the actors I can see, because they only lead to video films. It does not follow a straight action, but everything happens at once, which is why it does not make much sense. There is hardly anything to do, and to do a good action movie, you usually have to do something. The special effects are very bad and you can say that they are fake. All in all, this is the worst movie by Seagals. So if you want to watch a Steven Seagal movie, do not just rent this movie as if it does not exist. So just avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ** from ********** <br /> <br /> * from *****
