I still have to read Shirley Jackson's novel, something I've been planning for some time. I'm sure it has to be scarier than this movie. I remember having to jump once when I saw it the other day, though I can not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are great and I looked at it on DVD, but I'm sure it was a fantastic sight in the theater. After the first special effects were done, I waited for the development of a story. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie must at least be loosely based on the classic novel, so there should be a good story, but it was not. I was forced to stare at the beautiful Catherine Zeta Jones character throughout the movie, basically because there was not much else to see. Lili Talor was such an idiot. I did not like her, anything about a few people. Also the guy in this movie reminded me with his voice and his face of the cartoon Dudley DoRight. I could not relate to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson has made an admirable effort to break through this movie with some kind of acting cry Queenish Movie! At least there is a kind of entertainment value. If there is no history, at least they fill it with bloody deaths or attractive women. That had nothing. <br /> <br />
