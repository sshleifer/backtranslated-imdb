He only gets the third bill (behind Arthur Treacher & Virginia Field), but that was indeed David Niven's first starring role, and he's charmingly stupid, as PG Wodehouse's fool Bertie Wooster, master (in the name only), joined Jeeves, the insurmountable Valets , As an accommodation, it's more of a watery THE 39 than a true Wodehousian outing. And that's too bad, because the interaction between Treacher and Niven is not too far away. Unfortunately, the 'B' Mystery tropes and the forced comedy become tiring after just 57 minutes. The next year's follow-up (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even more off track without Bertie in sight and of course Jeeves (of all!) Had to play the punch line.
