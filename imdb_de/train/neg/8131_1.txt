Unless the title should be a kind of spoiler for the transformation of the woman (the fiends! Ruin him for us). Anyway, if this movie had not been made for television, it should have been, it's so remarkably cheap, signed, underrated, and hits every clich√© of the '70s except the disco. No one is sympathetic, and you could be reckless about what's going on with this one. Apart from the bad, bad performances he is absolutely forgotten.
