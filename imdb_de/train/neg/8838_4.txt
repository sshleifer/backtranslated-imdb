There are similarities between Ray Lawrence "Jindabyne" and his last movie "Lantana"? a corpse and its impact on dysfunctional life anyway. But while "Lantana" offered hope and determination, "Jindabyne" leaves everything unsolved in a bleak manner that will leave most viewers unsatisfied, perhaps even cheated. A corpse floating in a remote river - based on a short story from Raymond Carver. It became an element in Robert Altman's classic ensemble "Short Cuts" (1993). Lawrence uses this theme to explore and demonstrate relationships within a small Australian community under stress. The film raises some moral questions "Would you let the discovery of a corpse ruin your good weekend?" and for the Australians even more violent "Would it make a difference if the dead were a native?" Acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism that are enhanced by haunting music, much like "Picnic at Hanging Rock". <br /> <br /> If all of this sounds like the basis for a great movie - be prepared for disappointment, the tempo is very slow, and the murder is in its infancy, eliminating the mystery. And so we have this abandoned life and an empty finale.
