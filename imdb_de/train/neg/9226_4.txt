Okay, the audience of the film festival probably loved it. But your average popcorn movie lover, who has cost the ten or fifteen dollars that cost a movie these days, will probably wonder why he made that decision. If it's "Copolla" stamped, it's automatically great, right? Not correct! It's a nice parody of the claims of filmdom. But it is awful "in". I'm worried when filmmakers care more about entertainment than about the public. It's interesting as a cinematic curia and has one or two giggles. However, once it has taken its course in the movies and on television, the dust on the film cans and the tape boxes that hold it becomes denser. Hardly epochal or epic!
