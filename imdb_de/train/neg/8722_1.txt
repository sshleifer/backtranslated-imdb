Not to be confused with Lewis Teagle's "Alligator" (1980), which is actually an outstanding film, this "Il Fiume del Grande Caimano" painstakingly completes the exotic trilogy that Sergio Martino made in the late 1970s (including the more observable "L 'Isola degli uomini pesce' and the not so good 'La Montagna del dio cannibale'). The script outrages the plot of "Jaws" and does not manage to create tension. The creature is ridiculous and its victims are simply despicable. Stelvio Cipriani's lame melody illustrates poorly the adventures of these stupid tourists, who from the beginning were presented as obvious items of the reptilian meal. No thrill, more laugh! We might find this pathetic movie quite funny, if the dialogues and natives' looks were not so obviously inspired by pure racism. Very soon, the giggles stop in favor of a sour feeling that experiences such a paternalistic attitude. We could excuse bad movies and bad effects, but not this mentality. Never!
