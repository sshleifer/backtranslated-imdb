This is not art, but an inner-city, politically correct propaganda! Jindabye's political intolerance is unmistakable. It does not consider people as individuals but as members of categories. <br /> <br /> This is the most patronizing offensive Australian movie I can ever remember (and it's over) against pretty tough competition!). A news film, every tired topic of the trendy left is here: Aborigines are victims; white men are violent or alcoholics; White women are not that bad - especially if they are lesbians - but most likely they are depressive. Four men who go fishing find the body of a murdered woman (Aboriginal, of course) and leave them in the river for several days while catching trout. It's a strange decision that is made almost without discussion, as if the men were animals. The one man who is hot on the heels is the good ... we know that because he lives with a bisexual woman - he likes to keep it very often - and eventually moves to a more fashionable coastal town (away from all those animal bush dwellers ) <br /> <br /> This is a movie made by trendy urbanites living in fear of the Australian countryside and the evil rednecks that live inside. Ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as his contempt. The film is shot with distant views of the bush, which are supported by predictive, mysterious music. In the end, it becomes clear that Aborigines are the only ones who are at home in this landscape. It ends with a painful, implausible scene of black and white reconciliation. <br /> <br /> In Jindabyne, rural life is reduced to little more than a backdrop to a story that implicitly proclaims the superiority of the values ​​of an enlightened left-wing urban consciousness over those of other Australians. <br /> <br /> This movie was not made by people with real jobs, but funded by the government's Film Finance Corporation. It is a product of the artistic set, this soulless emptiness populated by the beautiful people for whom abundant government funds sustain these patronizing offensive projects (as far away from real life as possible), rather than making popular films that people want to see. It does not matter if the movie is a stinker, it gets paid anyway. <br /> <br /> Save yourself wasting time and avoid it like the plague. This movie is more than an entertainment program and not a conversation. The movie deserves to pan!
