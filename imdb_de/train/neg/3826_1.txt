Damn, I thought I saw some bad Westerns. I can not beat this. Damn, I think I'd rather have my eyes open for a Trinity trilogy to scream out loud. I do not think I can watch Ben Hur again without laughing my butt. Only really bad. <br /> <br /> But if you like silly westerns with recognized stars in the matter, take a look at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but a lot funnier. 1.10
