I saw this movie very late last night, and when it's late, I forgive the movies pretty much. Although I tried, I just could not stand this movie, it got worse and worse as the movie went on. I know that it's probably a comedy, but I did not find it funny. It was also a particularly unrealistic and exhausted account of rural life. In the event that one of you considers the country life as the feeling, this is definitely not the case. I have to admit that some of the actors were cute, but the Frenchman was really fake. I agree with trying to have a good lesson in the story, but overall, my recommendation is that no one over 8 watches the clock, it's just too annoying.
