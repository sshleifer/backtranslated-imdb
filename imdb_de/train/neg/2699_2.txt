I have not read a single IMDb commentary for this film that mentions how the Jewish character in this movie bounces up and down like a little baby, while a racist skinhead shows in his face, while the main black character of the movie looks serious down the barrel of a weapon. <br /> <br /> I do not know how anyone can perceive this as a balanced representation of university life. I agree that universities are not bastions of tolerance as they are intended, and the title will fit if Singleton does not turn his characters into such broad cartoons. On the surface, he tries to portray the figure of Ice Cube as the villain who provokes Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who ends up in the movie's redeeming epilogue? It seems that Singleton points out that he is either unable to empathize with his black classmate (I did not say sympathy!) Or just follow the path of a racist skinhead. Many people who have been bullied by people of another race are not turning to extreme bigotry. Even women who have been raped do not immediately turn to lesbianism, which is portrayed as a cult rather than a lifestyle. Honestly, what was the point?
