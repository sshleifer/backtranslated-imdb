This movie was so predictable that during the entire time you have the hope that the obvious suspect is innocent and there is another big turn. However ... it does not. He continues to act weird and she continues to ignore it. Mary found him very incriminating evidence and still trusted him? And what was the "baiting the trap"? There was no trap. She confronted him, he said, "Sorry, I have to kill someone." He left, and that was the end. They try to use other suspects (like this older carnival girl in the end), but they are completely underdeveloped. Actually, all characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth and the environment is just funny ... who hangs around in a recycling factory? It is choppy and nothing is well developed. For example: If she leaves her seat after the beer and he finds the pictures, she runs out and he gets her and they have sex in this car ... what was that? Her reactions were not presented. In the car she looked scared as if it had been practically rape - but then we only see that she takes a shower the next morning. booooooooo It could have been so much better ... sooo much better.
