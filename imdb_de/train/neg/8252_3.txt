What about the sound? It sounded like everything was in sync. <br /> <br /> Otherwise bad. Plot = bad accents = bad (even Dougray and we live in Scotland), acting = bad, harp = bad, sex scenes - bad / wrinkled. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, we watched it until the end in disbelief. How could such a good appeal by actors do so badly? Will they ever get a decent job again? <br /> <br /> Bad, bad, bad. By the way, we gave it 3, because at least we were seduced to see it because of its bizarre action, and so on. <br /> <br /> And to the older reviewer - I totally agree, it was like a 1940s romantic farce. How was it done in 2004? <br /> <br /> OK, OK, there were some OK bits. They had a nice house in Bristol. Dougray had a nice boat. Jennifer looked nice in a little outfit. But how is it that the sister got all the men?
