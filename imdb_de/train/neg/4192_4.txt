In this short film, a townspeople and his wife have a strange life when the man wears an old red pants suit of his mother-in-law. I kept watching this, hoping that I could see the reason it had been made, or why the other reviewers found it funny. For me, that was a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> Not every taste is the same, but that was definitely not mine.
