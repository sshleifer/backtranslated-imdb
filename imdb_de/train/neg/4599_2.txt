The saying "Never judge a book by its cover" was meant as a warning to those who do not look beneath the surface. <br /> <br /> When I saw the artwork for "King of the Ants" I immediately thought of HORROR! The mysterious images, proudly shown on the cover and back, spoke of a dark vision, the synopsis promising a story of murder, betrayal and retribution. What I discovered beneath this surface was less interesting than what you can find beneath your average skirt. <br /> <br /> "King of the Ants" shows Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average man willing to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Except for Sean Crawley, someone you do not care about has never felt pity or compassion for this character. In fact, he is downright unlikely, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), who provokes an uninspired performance as extremely ill-tempered by the extremely ridiculous dialogue he forces to recite. Throw Kari Wuhrer as a grieving widow who seems to have unconditional trust (especially in the homeless) and little to no common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, who is basically a sober Norm of Cheers, but MEAN! <br /> <br /> Now, there are some interesting "hallucination" sequences (the source of the cover art) in this movie, but this movie never goes deeper into this world. They prefer to bombard you with unmotivated characters, bad dialogues and unlikely events after unlikely events. Oh the horror!
