Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see Ollie's new wife and baby. The problem is that they do not exist - Ollie evidently invented them! So it's up to him and his buddy to find a woman with a baby who's ready to pose as his family. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly unique story idea, as I have at least seen a few other silent shorts with just that act. Best of all was Bobby Vernon's DO NOT KID ME. It's much better than ONE TOO MANY - probably due in large part to the fact that it was made a decade later - as the comedy became a little more sophisticated and relied less on meaningless slapstick. Now I'm not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick movies, people wildly start firing, kicking and choking cannons, etc., with little provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of ONE TOO MANY, that's exactly what they do. None of this makes sense, and it was as if the ideas for the story were simply going out. All in all not exactly a milestone in entertainment. There's just not enough profit to look at, unless you're an obsessive, quiet fan like me.
