A family with daddy Louis (Dale Midkiff), mother Rachel (Denise Crosby), the 10-year-old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and the about 3-year-old Gage (Miko Hughes)) moves into this beautiful house in Maine - seemingly unaware that the semi-finished product roars down the highway in front of her house every 90 seconds! The neighbor opposite (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them feel at home ... and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets is a sacred ground that can bring the dead back to life ... but the dead return in a bad mood. <br /> <br /> "" DEFINITE SPOILERS ** Stephen King's novel was good - that's it It took a long time for characters to emerge and situations in which you're interested in what happened. This movie throws off the entire evolution of the character and only reveals the thrill and violence. Animals are killed in front of the camera (I know they are fake, but they are still repulsive); He is met by a semi and during the funeral (in a completely ill scene) his coffin opens and he is returned to life and attacks and kill people, including his mother (I do not wonder how a 3-year-old hang her up could); A ghostly jogger (does not ask) tries to help the family for no reason ... The movie causes the audience to press any cruel death or force into your face. It's just about shocking you. ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Trading is no help. Midkiff is as dreadful as the father - he is handsome and buff, but completely empty. Crosby is not much better. The two kids are just annoying. Only Gwynne saves this image with his effortless good acting. <br /> <br /> This picture shows a total contempt for the audience when it comes to logical leaps and characters do incredibly stupid things (especially midkiff at the end). This film was (inexplicably) a big blockbuster from 1989, which led to an even worse successor in 1992. I saw him in a theater at the time and was worried about how the audience cheered on the violence and was just horrified by what I saw. A sick, disgusting horror movie. A 1 all the way. <br /> <br /> If you think it's all over and can not get any worse, the Ramones sing a theme song !!!!!! ("I do not want to be buried in an animal cemetery"). Really incredible.
