When I saw a video-based rendition of about 8 different Spider-Man cartoons from 1994-1997, I realized why I could not stand it when it first came out. Spider-Man cartoon was the best and the best is still the best. (I'm not in the psychedelic version that's terrible - please give me some traditional villains.) <br /> <br /> The acting in the new stuff is lousy, read off a leaf without feeling or exaggeration. Paul Soles, where are you now? This guy was the best who acted for Spiderman. Nobody comes close. Seeing Secret Wars, a great idea for a comic mini-series, made me flinch. Dr. Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi. In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull has no German accent, while Ock is very Russian! The old 1966 Marvel comic hero series had a much better vocal performance. Iron Man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask, Captain America sounded authoritarian, not like some teenager. Paul Frees as the thing in the 60s was the best thing ever. The old speakers were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them. Have you ever heard Mel Blanc's son? In no case can he replicate his father. <br /> <br /> The animation is clunky. Okay, they all have fancy character shades and nicely painted backgrounds. Sometimes, with less exercise, you can say more when more exercise looks bad. Sometimes, when you let the computer do the moves, they become robots. I really do not think any of these animators know what's in between. <br /> <br /> The stories are poorly written and some of the lines they give the hero are terrible. Why, for example, when heroes are joined together for the first time, are they beginning to fight each other? In Secret Wars it was a lame excuse that brought her into disagreement. I can see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious - like the Punisher, but why Thing and Iron Man can not hold their spirits together is ridiculous. Then the torch joins. This is just another of the later comic trends to get heroes to compete for a few seconds because 'everyone' wants to see the stuff. Give them a better reason to fight and maybe it can be deducted, but "Hey, what are you doing here?" And "you do not tell me what to do" are LAME reasons. Another badly written scene is in The Wedding, where Harry Osborne riddles himself to spoil Peter's wedding. The whole scenario was terrible. <br /> <br /> Finally, another reviewer calls Juvenile Violence - that is, no punches. In Secret Wars, the lizard banned the case. But the thing beats the bad guys over a whole block in the comics. He just has to pick up heavy things again and subdue a bad guy by grabbing him in the cartoons. Sure, these cartoons were not made for us adults, but for kids under 12. Because of this, they can not beat because mom and dad do not believe in this kind of violence. But you can blow things up, these cartoons also contain that. As a kid, before political correctness became fashionable, I saw cartoons beating. What's up with a slap on the chops? Are there really less violence in the world these days because these clever and sophisticated new cartoons triggered the blow? I find that most insulting when I look at the new stuff. They wrote "the blow" because we could all hurt each other. <br /> <br /> Kids, enjoy these cartoons as much as you want, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 rating
