I do not know where to start. The acting, the special effects and the writing are all as bad as you can imagine. I can not believe that the production staff has reached a point where they say, "Our work is done, time for release". I'm just glad that the first two of the series did not make it to the UK. I would really only recommend the film to see how well most of the films were made. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the other IMDb users might find it frightening when the "dreadful" dinosaurs waddle through corridors of rubber goods.
