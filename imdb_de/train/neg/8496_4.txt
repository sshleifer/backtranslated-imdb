Have you ever seen a movie that only consists of long, wide shots? No? Neither do I. Well, I finally saw one in Spring in my hometown, and I have to admit I know why people do not do that. The technique is "arty" to be sure, but it is definitely NOT ready for public consumption. The technique is very flawed, simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and this could be the director's intention. I do not know, I can not read minds and I certainly do not know enough about the director to judge anti-American feelings. As an American, I am very aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I am well aware that we did not always pass angels. According to this blind fool, the Americans were not only at the root of the war, we were the cause of the war and we almost destroyed the country alone. Whatever, Mr. Director. And I suppose you would still shoot this movie in COMMUNIST KOREA if we had not interfered, right? Talk about forgetting your story. It's almost like making the Nazis "good" while the Allies become the "bad guys". This film is so historically na√Øve and so factually inaccurate that it is almost embarrassing to look at it. For a man who comes from a country that owes its existency through American interference, it certainly turns out to be high and powerful and judgmental.
