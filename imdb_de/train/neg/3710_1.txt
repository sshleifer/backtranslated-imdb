The king is dead, long live the king! The triad of Caddy Shack Two, The Family Under the Staircase and Troop Beverly Hills had been tied up for the worst movie of all time, that they were considered as stand-alone icons for so long. But there is a new king ... yep ... everyone welcomes the new king ... "Down to Earth". But some things, like Tiny Tim, are so bad that they are good. One day this could take the inimitable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult movie. So, look at that ... that ... well, take my word for that. Look at it. Everyone welcomes the new king!
