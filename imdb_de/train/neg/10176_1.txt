MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINDER (1998) Â½ * <br /> <br /> Performers: Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Director: John Warren 100 minutes Rated PG-13 (for voice and some violence) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, there is one in the new John Warren comedy "MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO THE MINORS" funny movie scene. It consists of a sequence in which an applied carriage throws baseball hard behind the wall just to hit the cement and hit it back and slap it in the face. It's not much, but with the exception of a few one-liners, all this movie has to offer is ... enough said. <br /> <br /> This film is not only structurally impaired, characteristically undeveloped, predictable and poorly written, but also just bad. Even uncritical viewers will hate this movie with everything they've gotten. It's so familiar that it's just not funny. <br /> <br /> How often does a movie have to be shot about sports? In recent years we have seen the same material in "Air Bud: Golden Receiver". As bad as this movie was, that's even worse. At least "Air Bud" was family-oriented. "Major League Back to the Minors" is too vulgar for a healthy family on a Sunday afternoon. It is too childish for adults. So who is this movie for? Young people? Old? People looking for entertainment so desperate would they borrow something like that? <br /> <br /> The film, like many others, has a basic idea: Teamwork conquers everything. Yes, and what a great morality to prove. Too bad that we've seen and used it so many times before that it has so little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in ballerina costumes. Where the stupid announcers make their own "buddy-comedy routine," she mumbles some liners like "you suck," "This fast kids' ball is clocked with an hourglass." "This guy fell off a while to find something lost - maybe it was his mind" "Someone needs a nap" and "ever sees a sunset as beautiful as this game." Where the characters have so little meaning that we never know her by name. And where the only warm talk about teamwork is so little known that it's almost funny. <br /> <br /> "Major League Back to the Minors" is so bad; It stops and ends in the middle of a good final sequence. The good baseball team has a comeback, they are about to win and - the power goes out. I thought for a minute that this garbage piece had come to a conclusion, but in reality its wrong last scene exists only to extend the run time by minutes. The movie basically consists of a series of disjointed sketches that throw so many lazy jokes that they are not funny. There is another kind of weird dialogue line where a coach and a player talk to each other why a long-time outfielder is no longer wanted in this position. The Trainer's Response: "You are too old, too slow and too fat." The reaction of the player is a dream. But this scene certainly does not make this movie remarkable in your time and is certainly not worth a penny of your money. <br /> <br /> So here's another terrible start to this genre of film, another one doomed to failure with their own screenplay that has not been seen before, and another that's so familiar that it seems like Deja Vu again. <br /> <br />
