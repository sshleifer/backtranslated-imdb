Ahh this movie had so much potential! A good cast of quality B actors, the thighs of Jessica Simpson and ... that's all! <br /> <br /> I think a guy in an unnamed marketing department had an idea. Let's make some kind of legal blond movie, but do it in New York. This big, bright city full of opportunities, power and money, where everyone is a heartless, power and money hungry person. Add Jessica Simpson, Townbimbo, Owen Wilson's brother and for some reason Andy Dick for no apparent reason (just because of him you should ignore this movie). <br /> <br /> Basic plot: <br /> <br /> Boy leaves girl for NY, girl follows, boy cheats, girl stays with cousin in NY, gets a job under false pretenses, mucks up, gets fucked by courting another boy (Brother Wilson) and saving the day kiss together. <br /> <br /> A few words come to my mind when they think about this movie, ie terrible, terrible, unbearable, unbearable and xenophobic be happier. A reviewer pointed to Guantanamo and I definitely agree with him. This movie triggers a shock. And I know what you think ... at least I'll see Simpson naked or close by. It will not happen, save time and YouTube. You will have a better sexy time! <br /> <br /> Filmmaking is weak, acting is unbearable and why are you using blue screens? <br /> <br /> Finally; This is a cinematic betrayal that should be punished as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Another question, why does Willie Nelson always play a kind of father figure in almost every Jessica Simpson movie and why is there no black, Latin, Asian or European? People in this movie?
