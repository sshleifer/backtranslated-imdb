After reading many of the reviews, I do not know which movie some people watched, but it was clearly not the same one I saw. This movie is awful. Acting, especially Moore's, is just awful. The woman can not act. Nice tits, but she just can not act. She never appeared as an actual character. Instead, the spoiled Hollywood actress went to the beach to introduce herself to the boys, which they believe. The training sequences are exaggerated. The policy - exaggerated. The political correctness - exaggerated. The battle scenes - you guessed it, exaggerated. Your mission is to get in and out without being detected. So what are you doing? Why shoot so many rounds and make as much noise as possible. Oh G.I. Jane, you can always be my wingman. <br /> <br /> The premise is good, but once Hollywood hears about it, we end up with tits at Top Gun. <br /> <br /> What's more to expect from commercial US movies? I do not think much.
