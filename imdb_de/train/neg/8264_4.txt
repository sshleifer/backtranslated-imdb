This is a movie in which all the actors are all right, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a film in which each of the three couples meets in a situation where it feels crazy to be either sweet or the story to get started. In other words, it feels as if they were fictional movie scenes and not like in real life. Even if women who work in peep salons ever go out with one of their clients, it just does not seem to be realistic, as it is written in this movie. When one of the characters encounters the overweight woman in the movie, he feels artificially like watching seconds after the fight. Again the actors are all good and the moments of this movie are nice, but overall another indie movie that could have used some rewriting before rolling out the production.
