Holy crap! What a horrible, terrible Spanish thriller! I have had it for about four years and started it the other day. I looked for an hour or so before going to bed. I was pretty fascinated by the whole thing. I finished it last night and could not believe where I left off the night before. I literally stopped it completely in the second before the movie. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was pretty curious and curious where this puzzle went, but it stopped when Simon put the package in the bar. I picked up a laser pistol when he opened the package to reveal and then play a "threatening" laser game. Angry! Then the big revelation is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role-playing nerds. ANGRY! It can be said that the Spanish industry definitely put behind the director Mateo Gil (co-author of Amenabar's two great previous hits). There is an excellent score and great photography. But this scenario stinks of stupidity. How someone sat straight in the last 40 minutes is unclear to me.
