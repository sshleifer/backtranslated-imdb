That's a pretty bad movie. But not as bad as the reputation suggests. The production values ​​are not too bad and there is the weird effective scene. And it has an 80's Cheezoid veneer, which means it's always fun. Also watch out for Jimmy Nail's brief appearance - his attempt to set an American accent is so amazing that he is fantastic. The breasts of Sybil Danning are also fantastic - they make a brief appearance in the film, but the scene is repeated countless times in the credits, which can only be described as the 12-inch remix of Sybil Dannings breasts. As a horror movie, it's not scary, the effects are stupid and Christopher Lee comes through his performance to sleepwalking. I think he bought a new house and needed some money for the deposit. The two central characters - the man and the woman - were so negligible that I almost forgot about them and I saw this movie this morning: The werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie The European setting is pretty good and the music The new-wave band Babel, although quite dreadful, at least lends extra cheese to the movie. All in all, good for a laugh. You do not expect good quality seriou do you expect it? At least you always have Sybil's knocker.
