I love movies. I love independent efforts and big studio productions. I love movies with stars and I love these unknowns. I love drama, comedy, action adventure, science fiction, mystery, western, all genres except horror. I love foreign films as well as English. I love good movies and I also love bad movies because almost no movie fails to entertain or amuse at any level. Apart from "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues". <br /> <br /> When I attended an evening show of "Cowgirls", I came to an audience of about ten years. In less than half of them, I was left alone. Soon I could not even stand the disturbing confusion before my eyes, and I went too. To this day, "Cowgirls" is the only movie I've ever gone from. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to describe this incoherent, vacant, trashy, meaningless movie or how to adequately convey it. Lack of revenue. Suffice it to say that he is considered one of the worst big movies of all time, absurd and inexcusable at every level. It tries to be smart, but its conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. It tries to be funny, but its humor is rude and frightening. This is one of the few films that succeeds in invalidating its own ethos, depicting the protagonists as revolting against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, look at "Waterworld", "Ishtar". Except the new "Alexander". If you choose between that and that, read a book instead.
