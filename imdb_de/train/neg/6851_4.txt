Feh. This movie started in an interesting way, but quickly turned from confusing to boring. Most of the confusing parts happened at the beginning, where the cutscenes are so numerous that it's hard to say what's going on in the first twenty minutes. The boring comes later with a lukewarm romance between the two living humans (both pusses). The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is indeed the liveliest person in the movie, which is sad. If the rest of the cast had met their caliber, the movie might have been better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the story really gets interesting for a while, it seems that the crazy priestess, mother of the dead sixteen-year-old girl, is trying to raise her daughter from the dead, with the unfortunate side effect that all the other dead would come back Also, take a solid human form and probably start killing everyone. A kind of Japanese mystical night of the living dead. This does not happen. Although this hairy, unwashed priest with a tiny basket on his head tells uninteresting teens that this will happen when the priestess finishes her ritual, she does just that and the only person who manifests herself is her daughter. No mass rebellion of the dead, no walking army of corpses, nothing. The priest simply lets the ghost of the girl return to the Land of the Dead, and takes the washed-out whim of a friend with him as she squeezed his back like peanut-breaking (at this point I was tempted to cheer so loudly.) The idiot walked over to kiss and caress the dead girl (ewwww !!!). Robitussen's best friend, who wants to suck, has a long introspective attitude when she leaves the village for the last time, and that's it. No real horror, no real horror that make the Japanese far better than American filmmakers with their emphasis on exaggerated cheesy facial make-up, no screaming mimis. I was very disappointed.
