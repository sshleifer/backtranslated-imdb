The annoying mouse and lullaby really impressed me and really had nothing to do with the story ... It would be something that I would have done in my first year at the film school. Very sad. Besides, the story seemed to stretch out for no apparent reason ... There were just too many things thrown in that had nothing to do with the story. It makes me feel that the creative team did not really know what it was or just that it should have been shorter ... which would have been a blessing, not a crime. Since I've just seen all the episodes up to that point in the last week ... I have to say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with it.
