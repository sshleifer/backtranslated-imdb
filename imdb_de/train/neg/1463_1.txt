Imagine, the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and language, would have been such a mumbling idiot as Carlyle portrayed him in this film. No one would have followed him, not even a desperate, unemployed type in the 1920s. <br /> <br /> This is just a piece of propaganda out of Hollywood cardboard itself, disguised as a "true story". <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for anyone who really believed in this show. Carlyle and the producers were wrong about that. <br /> <br /> Why could Hitler win so many people, a whole country for his ideas, if we were such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? By making him such a loser, they make their own movie absolutely incredible. This movie is a mix of old WW2 propaganda and MTV myths about one of the most important people of the last century. Imagine a film about Churchill, in which the director shows him as a drunk just 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a shame and I wonder how they could get an actor like Carlyle into this mess.
