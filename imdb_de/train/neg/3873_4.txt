Alicia Silverstone (pre-"unaware") plays a modern, criminally-obsessed teenage girl trying to solve the brutal killings of a local girl. Pat Verducci has written and staged this B-strip, which is not very well done, but is surprisingly serious in terms of its main character. Silverstone is appealing and successful at working out an interesting young woman, despite the kitschy undermining of the image. The side cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although the violence in the final act goes overboard. No cheesy camp party, but nothing unusual. * 1/2 of ****
