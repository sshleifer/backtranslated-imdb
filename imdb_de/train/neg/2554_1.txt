Honestly, I do not even joke when I say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! This film has no ounce of originality in its flimsy dialogue or openly plagiarized plot. I can not even begin to count the number of things in this movie that were obviously demolished by The Omen and other similar films. For example, the nanny "Lucy" in this movie is actually one of the devil's minions who are sent to guide and protect the spawn of Satan ... this sounds like another to Mrs. Baylock. Another thing is that the orphanage burned the child a few months after his or her adoption, just like in "The Omen". Fortunately, however, a priest survived the flame and escaped heavy burns all over his body ... another coincidence ?????? And as the coronation of the burned priest, the burnt priest remains in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus on the walls, much like the priest in "The Omen," who plastered pages of the Bible like wallpaper on the walls. Please do not even let me start drawing comparisons between the end of this movie and "The Omen" for you, because as I said above, there are too many to mention here.
