A still famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) has not been shooting for four years. When invited to a new project, he asks the director's clumsy cousin to take him to a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to investigate the work of the manager of a small supermarket. He sees the beautiful Spanish cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and is attracted by her skills. His driver never returns and Scarlet travels with the actor. First, she has a job interview for the position of a secretary in a construction company, and the actor helps her to prepare for it. then spend the afternoon together with a pleasant time. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. The pointless "10 Items or Less" is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget movie seems to have no action, and is backed by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. Nothing happens in 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is just ridiculous. The character of Morgan Freeman returns to his world of silver spoons and tells the simple worker he would never see himself again. Was he afraid to have a love affair with her and to destroy his perfect world with his family? Or was it a class struggle, and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood is not appropriate for a simple lower-class worker? My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "To Astro em Minha Vida" ("A Star in My Life")
