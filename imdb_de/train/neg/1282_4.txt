Here's one of those movies that was spoiled by the studio's push for a happy ending. Conflicts that have been going on for years are settled in a few minutes. Far more interesting would have been to convey a tone of ambiguity. The talented Barbara Stanwyck is ruined by a sudden metamorphosis from an independent and assertive woman to a complacent woman of the kind she has portrayed throughout her life. As usual, Brent is way above his head and then there is the ridiculous situation in which Gig Young plays a character called Gig Young. Someone mentions "Gig Young" and who then appears as Gig Young, the actor! Worth seeing, but far below what it could have been.
