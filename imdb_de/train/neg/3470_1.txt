As with most of Ben Affleck's films, the comedy is dry and the story is predictable. That's if you want to call this a story. Many points were connected without thought. I would like to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say that because that would mean that the torture would have taken longer. With all mistakes made by Ben Affleck, this mistake is no exception and only viable for the other actors. Acting was well thought out and unbelievable even then. The journey back in time with actors I have not seen in years was not worth the price. Everyone thought it should be said that they, too, are quickly joining the series of "hitherto". I had the choice to wait until my car was repaired or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. All in all, I would make a single laugh ... mainly because that's all I got out of it.
