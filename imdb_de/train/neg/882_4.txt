There is a reason why this went straight to the video - the story is smarmy, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a sleazy way - sex in churches - and other scenes that border on tasteless boundaries (like the scene in the laundry room) spoil it Movie. Judge Reinhold as a cuckold is okay - but the movie itself with its themes of humiliation and revenge is not well done. But it's a good movie for trivia competitions - because so few people have seen it.
