A badly made "Blaxploitation" -rimadrama is aimed directly at the black city market of the early 70s. Pam Grier plays a starring role in the title role, a nurse who becomes a one-woman vigilante after drug fighters who turns Coffy's little sister into a junkie. Violent nonsense trudges around with stinging energy and excitement; Only Grier's seething temper lends the narrative a jolt (she's not a big actress here, but she's great with the audience). Not much different from what Charles Bronson was doing at the time, the film was marketed and advertised as gross exploitation, yet it managed to find a substantial inner-city audience. Today, however, it is only a footnote in the history of film in the 1970s and lacks the far-reaching appeal of other films in the genre. * 1/2 of ****
