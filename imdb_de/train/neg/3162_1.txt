I did not even bother to finish the movie because I was so bored that I thought I was going to pass out. I looked at him in the cinemas and I and my friends got tired 2 minutes sitting down I think I'm going to shoot myself now ... and I know the entire movie because my friend told me what happened in the end and me I was not surprised that I mean, who does not know her I would do the right thing and make him happy, I mean, to be honest, you would have to be a total idiot to not know that. I know, I did not miss anything and if anyone asks me if I want to see this movie, I would say "over my dead body".
