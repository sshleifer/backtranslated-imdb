Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. Hollywood has produced films based on one of the darkest days in our country. 911 changed everything. It has changed our perception of security. It has changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. Most important and devastating is that it has changed our world. <br /> <br /> However, I can not emphasize how utterly repelled, disillusioned and angry I am for the careless, unbridled ignorance of Hollywood that seeks to make a lucrative profit from death and destruction. This film and similar films will inevitably lead to controversy in word of mouth between moviegoers and critics. the safest to hear from the mainstream press. Hollywood has dropped to a new low. Even lower than the vile bastards who have committed the most barbarous atrocities and inexorable atrocities. Behind it is Uwe Boll. I am very angry with this movie. How dare they respect the memories of the lost families? How dare you ridicule the lives of brave men and women who have risked their lives to save those trapped in the fallen towers on this fateful day of shame?!?!? How dare you ridicule yourself while using a national tragedy in the fog of a grieving and weary post-911 world?!?!?! How dare you? <br /> <br /> To those who can even think of seeing this morally gruesome travesty, I say this with a heavy heart and all my strength: Remember. Think back to this day and ask yourself if you are a rational and moral person. Think back to that day and wonder if this movie is a shame for the lost life or not. Think of the day when families of loved ones scream. Think back to the day you lost your life on these two planes. Think of the further carnage that resulted from the attacks. Ask yourself if you have a soul. Think about it. Notice. Respect the memories of the life that 911 has lost by not seeing this movie.
