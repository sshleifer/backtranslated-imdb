This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, it's awful. Christopher Lee is good, but he is barely there, the only part is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the title. "End of the World" is really a bad movie. I stopped watching it just before the end, it was so bad, just for the tough B-Movie fans who have the brain to endure this vomiting.
