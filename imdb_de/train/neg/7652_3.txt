In 1967, miners find the remains of an ancient, vanished civilization called Abani, who believe that there are worlds of light and darkness. Ten thousand years ago, when they opened the gate between these worlds, something bad went by before the gate closed. Twenty-two years ago, Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker) headed the Government's Paranormal Research Agency (713), which conducted experiments with orphans. One of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just received an artifact in South America and is hunted by a man of skill. When an old friend of nursing home disappears in the middle of the night, he reveals that demons are returning to Earth. With the support of anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and chief of the 713 Office, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff) and his team fight against the evil creatures. Despite a charismatic cast, led by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "Alone in the Dark" never works and is a complete mess, with no character or plot development. The reason for this may be the "brilliant" interview of director Uwe Boll in the extras of the DVD, in which he says that "video games are the bestsellers of the younger generations who are no longer driven by books". His target audience would be people between the ages of twelve and twenty-five. I'm sorry, but I disrespect both statements to younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends, and they're not such a stupid stereotype, says the director. In addition, IMDb provides excellent statistics that show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Alone in the Dark? O Despertar do Mal" ("Alone in the Dark? The Awakening of Evil")
