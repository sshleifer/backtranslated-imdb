It's hard to believe that people really like this mess! I think children can enjoy it, but for me it's the kind of kids movie parents can not stand. Predictable plot, boring Belushi, and possibly the worst childhood actor of all time. I'll give the director some responsibility for the child, but it was really painful to look at it. I am ashamed of her now because people know that she was. When she sang the Star Spangled Banner, I had to turn off the sound - then I came here and found out they did that because she won Star Search. I've always thought Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade the name of his wonderful, sadly missing brother, and that crap shows why. Zero stars
