In the autobiographical story of the time "Romulus, My Father" plays Eric Bana, known from "Munich," an impoverished German emigrants, who in rural Australia in the 1960s with the rearing of his son Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee) must fight. The biggest obstacle to the stability and happiness of the family is his wife Christina (Franka Potente), who obviously violates her marriage vows by shamelessly clashing with other men. Despite her extremely unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to divorce and masochistically tortures herself in vain hope that she will one day return to him. Unfortunately, it is the kind-hearted and good-natured Raimond, who must witness the whole adultery - and they are his memoirs, which serve as the basis for the movie (Raimond Gaita would later grow up to be a writer). <br /> <br /> Even though I admire "Romulus, My Father" for what he's trying to do, I can not honestly say that I enjoyed it, because during the film some good performances and serious intentions These are just not enough to withstand the sullen action and tempo of grief, so that the audience is as desperate and depressed as the people on the screen. A serious slice-of-life drama is one thing, but this relentless condescension to adultery, insanity, and multiple suicides (let alone suicide attempts) is something else again.
