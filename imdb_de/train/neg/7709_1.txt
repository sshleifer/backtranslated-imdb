Never see this movie. <br /> <br /> It's trying to be a spoof on sci-fi / thriller movies of the 1950s and 1960s, but all that comes with it is that you really want to see one of them has and not <br /> <br /> It is very lame. A parody must have an aspect that has something above average quality. This movie has no such aspect. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but ... do not look at it.
