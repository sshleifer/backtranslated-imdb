There are some extremely talented black directors like Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel, and many others who bring recognition to the film industry. Then there's the Wayans Brothers, who at one time (fifteen years ago) had a hilarious television show called "In Living Color," which included Jim Carrey's career. Now we have stupidity as a substitute for humor and rough out-gags (toilet humor) as a standard procedure. People are not as stupid as those portrayed in 'Little Man', which could be impossible. A baby with full teeth and tattoo is accepted as just a few months old? Baby comes with a five o'clock shadow that he puts off. It is implied that the baby with his foster mother has behind her husband, Darryls, back. Oh, yes, that's just funny. As a master criminal, 'Little Man' is the stupidest on earth. He puts a stolen stone, which is just huge in a woman's handbag, and must follow it afterwards. Co-star Chazz Palminteri, why Chazz, offers the best line: "I'm surrounded by idiots." Based on a Chuck Jones cartoon, Baby Buggy Bunny. That's way too stupid to be funny even remotely. A clue to how bad this movie is, Damon Wayans recently appeared before Jay Leno's BAT Awards and he did not mention this dreadful movie. When will Hollywood get the go-ahead from the Wayans Brothers? If they overcome their white men, in all likelihood.
