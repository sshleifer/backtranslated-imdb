I remember when I saw this movie for the first time, I was in sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw that, I listened to Broadway's original recording, and I really loved it! But when I saw that, I was like, what the hell ?! Many songs from the musical are missing in this movie to scream out loud! Who decided to do all this? I'm really a big fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical he's ever done! The movie looked more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. And who decided to cut all Meg's songs out of the movie ?! <br /> <br /> I'm willing to bet that when Lerner and Lowe saw this movie, they probably asked, "Who in the world has decided to do this to our masterpiece?" Well, they had the right to say that if they did, they were probably angry that Hollywood turned their great musical into this rather empty movie auditioning with flying colors, but you're in a movie that lacks a lot of lyrics. <br /> <br /> Well, if you're looking for a good movie for a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, that's not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
