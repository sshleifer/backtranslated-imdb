The movie was filmed in 1942 and with the 11th World War the film industry decided to use the fact that spies were there. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun because Eleanor Powell danced fabulously. The late Miss Powell was in the true sense of the word certainly a great hoofer. She is again paired with a very young looking Red Skelton. The two also played in "I Dood It". <br /> <br /> Moroni Olsen, who was outstanding three years later, when the interrogator in "Mildred Pierce" reappears as a cop, who orders Powell to deliver an item. The problem is that Olsen and his rogues are really the Japanese spies. Bert Lahr is his usual brilliant self here and he is well supported by Virginia O'Brien.
