Racers say 100 mph are fast until you've driven 150 and 150 mph seem fast until you've driven 250 mph. <br /> <br /> OK. <br /> <br /> Andalusian dog seems breathtakingly bizarre until you see Eraserhead, and Eraserhead seems to be breathtakingly bizarre until you've seen Begotten. <br /> <br /> And indigenous seems to be breathtakingly bizarre until you have seen the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Racing fans, there is NOTHING in the world of film, as in the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Alabama's ghost comes close to a coherent story in each of his films, and it's all about hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, wizards, corrupt multinational corporations, elephants, and mystery gas. And the Fabulous Woodmobile, which of course travels through the Sunset District in San Francisco. <br /> <br /> What's really exciting is that someone has given him a lot of money to make Alabama Ghost. There are sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots of effects. Somehow, Alabama Ghost is SO WRONG. You look at a horrible cheeseball like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least part of the comedy is excused because they obviously put the movie on their Discover cards. But Alabama's mind was made on an actual budget, and that's EVIL. I mean, I've written a script about a cannibal tribe that lives in Thunder Bay, Ontario, built a secret temple in Twizzlers' woods, and nobody bangs against my door with a checkbook and waves a checkbook FOUR of the coolest movies that were ever filmed?
