I'm not sure who wrote these <br /> <br /> glowing reviews for this movie, but trust me it's STKINKS. I've seen hundreds of horror movies and Slasher movies, and this one is LAME, it's only about 80 minutes long and believe me that's all I could take. Plot is awful, acting is even worse. And there is no development at all. <br /> <br /> Even the David Cocteau films are better than these. NOW OFF JIGSAW. I had expected to hate the acting, which can be awarded directly in video films, if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> That was not afraid, very little gore, <br /> <br /> and a really unattractive cast. <br /> <br /> I looked at this with three other friends <br /> <br /> with whom I hope they still talk to me! <br /> <br /> They wanted me to fly the disc out of the window. I can not believe anyone <br /> <br /> could have given this trip a good rating.
