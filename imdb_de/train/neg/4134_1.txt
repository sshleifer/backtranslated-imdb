I have to say honestly that I could not stop the movie from the beginning. Just how bad it was !!! It's kind of like you just make color look a lot more confusing. I mean, you're sitting there just waiting for something to happen, something indeed, preferably something that makes the whole movie meaningful! At the end of the movie, I actually sat there wondering if there was any chance I'd missed the first hour explaining everything, or if I inadvertently fainted during the movie and missed the parts that stuck the plot (if there was one) together! The main thing that really puzzled me about this movie is almost at the end that the main girl (if there was actually a main girl) was in an alternate reality. I mean, what the hell was going on at this point ?! Suddenly, she woke up and was chained to a mental hospital, bedridden by doctors or drugged, and then faster, when I slashed my wrists, it tipped back and she was eaten by a random vampire it made no sense! I'm tempted to email the creators and demand my time back. I mean, I wasted 2 hours of my life looking at this garbage. I'm kind of interested in knowing if the filmmakers themselves knew what it was about! It seemed like someone had cut out all the parts that made it meaningful, although in my opinion the movie would have taken 4 hours to achieve that! I completely stand on the side of the other person who wrote the other review. I was royally seduced by this title, and that alone. I'm just so damn grateful that I did not buy the movie, no matter how many times I saw it at the local pound store. They would have thought that would have given me an indication that the film was a complete pile of steaming film waste, but to be honest, I think Â£ 1 would spend way too much money on this movie !!!! What a hell of a waste of time and a good razor blade, I mean, I wish I loved it, it's less painful than watching this movie !!!!
