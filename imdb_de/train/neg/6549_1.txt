Not that I want to be mean, but this movie really surprised me a lot. Throughout the movie I was like ... er ... what's this movie about? I do not get the animations at all. Probably this film will only be suitable for those who belong to the 1980s. During the film a group of people went. After the movie, many people said, "This is it?" Honestly, I can not believe that this film was awarded the Best Children's Film Award. If you're thinking about watching this movie, I strongly recommend that you do not. You will regret it. I am not joking. You will find that you are wasting your time and money just walking and watching.
