This show is incredible. , , what it represents and what it focuses on and. , , Words can not describe how crazy ET is. They will tell everything. If a celebrity is even indirectly associated with the story, ET will report it. If a dog poops in the yard of Tom Cruise, he will report it. When a celebrity dies. , , They'll talk about it for weeks until the public envies this celebrity. When a celebrity is in court. , , ET will report it to MONTHS at the end. There is no end to what this show will tell, and no time frame that determines how long they will focus on a story. Is it legitimate reporting at all? The reports are also so annoying, with hard, wriggling voices and end with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of importance. I can not see this show without questioning the existence of humanity. ET is an important reason why I generally avoid eve shows. I'm sorry that IMDb can only allow a rating of at least one star and not zero or even in the negatives. For this show earn -10 stars.
