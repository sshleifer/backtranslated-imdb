Amazing. You would say that, if you've been through this movie. Just unbelievable. In fact, it's so amazing that someone was stupid enough to throw money into this monstrosity that you just can not believe what you see. This, my friends, makes the movie really scary. Someone thought it was a good idea to do it. <br /> <br /> Well, here is another amazingly original story: high school students (who occasionally looked like a college character) have a whore for a mother, lives in a trailer park, and is an "artist," which is ridiculed for being "everything else". Well, of course that poor ridiculous boy is finally killed, and here is the original part, his soul lives in a scarecrow (underneath he is killed by his mother's slutty mother). Then he deals with the standard murder of all the people who hurt him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - An amazingly funny movie, even if that did not want the clearly drunken filmmaker. <br /> <br /> - This and the sequel to a floppy at Wal-Mart is $ 5.00? So it's just a little overpriced. <br /> <br /> Did not hurt, did not help: <br /> <br /> - The violence and the gore are a kind of standard. A person is stabbed to death with a corn cob. <br /> <br /> - Sounds like she's busy with the music, but it does not really suit the movie and is not that good. <Br /> <br /> The Bath: <br /> <br /> - Terrible, terrible spectacle. <br /> <br /> - Another slasher settles down with sexy women? None of them takes off clothes. When did that stop being a staple of low-braash slashers? <br /> <br /> --Riddle story. <br /> <br /> - The scarecrow spits out one-liners blushing Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger. <br /> <br /> - The underlying standard love story goes nowhere and is done badly. <br /> <br /> - Some of the killed seem to be randomly selected? They never really know who someone is and then they are killed. And you just assume that they have to have it. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - Extremely average Slasher prize, held only with a murder scarecrow? well, all that crap. <br /> <br /> - Nowhere as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky or even Angela from the "Sleepaway Camp" series, all of whom are better at this cruelty. <br /> <br /> - The absolute worst dialogue I've ever heard in my LIFE. The script is full of delays that I never imagined they could exist. I'm serious, it's a full step beyond the terrible. Do not get me wrong, it's damn funny, but I've never heard so many jokes, even in "Slumber Party Massacre III". This movie makes "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> - The man who kills the boy who becomes the scarecrow: The worst wig of all times. Same dialogues. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - The one in which elementary school kids spit out their own witty dialogue: "Hey, let's find little animals that are torturing, huh huh." <br /> <br /> Story: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Character development: 2/10 Special Effects / Make-Up: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 No nudity, Mom is a whore, Girls do not wear bras) Violence / Violence: 5/10 (Low quality, mediocre crowd) Dialogue: 0/10 (Extremely ridiculous, blatant, exaggerated and painfully funny, so bad it is good first rating for dialogues in any movie!) Music: 5/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> All in all: 3 / 10 <br /> <br /> Another for just people like me who like to see pure crap. Or Slasher movie completeists. That's not a good movie at all. Laughable dialogues and characters prevent it from getting boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
