OK, another movie I and Joe Swatman bought. OK, that's not the worst movie I've reviewed this week, but he still sucked Royaly. We had a lot of fun watching this crap. <br /> <br /> The Monster Jigsaw is a mish-mash of all these dysfunctional student ideas. You only know that you have trouble, if someone sawed him with a buzz saw and a shotgun, the movie was not as bloody as we had hoped, I mean, one of the deaths is a heart attack. I think the acting is shitty, the sum of the actors has to be porn stars and for some reason you get into your underwear. <br /> <br /> The worst is the end, it leaves it open for a bit of Jigsaw 2, but that will never happen, let's not let it happen. <br /> <br /> My ratings: <br /> <br /> weird 4/100 mock (how much fun we had mocked about it) 73/100 as active 8/100 in general 12/100
