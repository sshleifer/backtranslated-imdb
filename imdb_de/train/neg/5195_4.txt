I had heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to seeing another great cable series (like Entourage, Sopranos, or Mad Men), however, with each episode I did in the first season saw, slowly eased. (did not go beyond the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The writing was unoriginal, invented and the portrayal of the Blacks embarrassing. The dialogue was forced to act as if the authors were trying too hard to be smart and hip. It was a rare moment when I actually uttered an audible laugh. <br /> <br /> The characters never evolved enough to take care of them, they were selfish and unsightly. I absolutely HAD the addition of the brother-in-law (who was supposed to have been dragged away to Catch A Predator) and the removal of the Hodes daughter Quinn from the cast by being admitted to a boarding school in Mexico was so unoriginal and clich√© I had to conclude that Authors have tested the loyalty of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Episode by episode I liked the characters less and could not get past many technical mistakes in the storyline. <br /> <I also heard that the second season is not so good, so I lost all motivation to follow this game. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect this show will be a challenge for you, unless you are stoned and then all bets are banned.
