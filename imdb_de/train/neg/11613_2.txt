Terrible movie with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here he gets involved with a dead woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Rome will soon be set to find out what happened to a woman. Of course it is the woman under the sea. Her roommate Lainie Kazan is soon dead on the ground. <br /> <br /> An aging Richard Conte plays a policeman and a friend of Rome. When a local club owner is killed, the blame falls on Rome and it creates an interesting persecution scene. So bad is this picture if you have to rely on a chase scene to deliver the action. Raquel Welch plays beauty in intrigue. Her acting leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Martin Gabel is a retired Hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him. At the end of the movie, you do not know why the girl was murdered. Do not even bother to ask.
