Love me ... Peter Sellers was one of the most uncommonly talented actors ever. For example, his choice of films after 1964 was very unhappy. He did not seem to know how to use his talents. It would have been better to work with more Kubricks on the film world than with the people he made. Of his later films, only "The Optimists of Nine Elms" and "Being There" impressed me from those I've seen. <br /> <br /> That is, the Boultings and Sellers had previously made a few films that does not sound so bad - I still have "Carlton Browne" and "Heavens Above!" - At least in the sense of a good use of sellers. But "There's a Girl in My Soup" is really a bad movie and Sellers' extravagant decision on character. In his films from 1955 to 1964, one can usually expect at least a very imaginative twist and always an enigmatic conviction in his roles. Here's Peter Sellers trying to play a typical romantic track. It is almost a seller who plays a Niven Cad without the joviality. He certainly does not convince, tries it the way he does, or creates an interesting character. He would have had to leave such parts to masters like Cary Grant and focus on the fascinating dramatic and comic roles he was famous for. Hawn and Sellers really do not establish real chemistry; This is not a simple, ingenious romance by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It's very artificial, all the way through - I know it's part of Danvers, that he's a dry mediator of ladies, but he does not really change in a way that convinces. Sellers has a very cruel way of playing "charm" ... this character really has no depth and really does not arouse the sympathy or interest of the viewer. Sellers goes through the movements in a way that you would not believe possible, remembering the magnificence of his volatile, iconoclastic performance in "Lolita". <br /> <br /> There is really nothing to say about the plot, the direction or the characters. frankly, they leave little or no impression. This is truly one of the most anemic, smug, misguided and slightly boring movies I've ever seen. A "vehicle" for the undisputed talents of the seller. <br /> <br /> Rating: - * 1/2 / *****
