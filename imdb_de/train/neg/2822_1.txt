OMG, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did she need the money so badly? I love AJ and have seen almost everything she has ever been to. It was so bad! not even bad, just bad. There were one or two funny little moments, but overall it was bad and a waste of 101 minutes. I can not say that AJ looked good because she did not. The plot is predictable, unless you expect a retelling of Romeo and Juliet. All around disappointing. If your 12 might be a good movie, I really do not recommend it.
