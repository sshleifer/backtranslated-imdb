I was delighted to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy series, director Stanley Donen. So far, what is not to like? It's the kind of movie that makes me wonder about two things - when did all those involved (including some well-known names) realize that they have a turkey in their hand, and what's the worst of it among a series of issues? I still think about the first thought, but my vote for the latter is in the writhing plot of the wordy, sometimes presumptuous script, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and the lack of relationship between characters , You have to add a lot of unequal acting to the critics, but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and also seemed to be undervalued. Often they can barely bring their lines out fast enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urban personality, but at times seems uncomfortable and staccato. However, I must say that I was relieved when the first suggestions that his character would be associated with the unspectacular vulgar Jayne Mansfield will make Suzy Parker's performance disappear. What is the movie like? - For me, especially the beauty of Parker, who behaves also reserved and Grace Kelly-worthy kind. In general, the movie is nice to look at. The navy characters are very smart in their uniforms - but you really have to wonder about the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant can not look elegant in his. Back on the credit side, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character, and I had an interest in hearing the heroes of Pre-Hogans who speak Werner Klemperer without a supposed German accent!
