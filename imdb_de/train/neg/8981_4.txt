This Paramount version / rip-off of OKLAHOMA! / ANNIE GET YOUR GUN / CALAMITY JANE is not that unusual or innovative. The marketing and intro comments could serve to save a really bad Western western movie shot on stage and in a live TV show. I do not think using the background cyclorama, which is so innovative in different scenes of yellow, pink or red or ... is so innovative. Like I said, to me it looks more like a movie produced with a TV budget: All stages with minimal sets supported by the illuminated Cycs! (Compare with NEW FACES (OF 1952).) The actors are doing quite well. And this style was realized much better when Paramount 1959 LI'L ABNER turned her thinking? "
