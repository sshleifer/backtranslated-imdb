I think that's almost everything I have to say. However, I feel obliged to explain my actions. Basically, I have never seen such a valve production, and I mean that in the truest sense of the word. Although he physically works with the camera, the Boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are ridiculous. Unfortunately, these are not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike some of the classic independent films that have been scripted for great characterization and action, this one unfortunately has a horrible script, horrible drama and the worst, terrible annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It is a crime that for every independent film distributed like the Haiku Tunnel, there are 101 other indie films that have died in silence. I do not know who the Kornbluth brothers know about Sony, but that may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production ever got into distribution. I'm pretty amused about why they recorded this. <br /> <br /> The ONLY part of this film that expresses any intrigue is the title. The reason for this is even a disappointment. I hope this review will save a few people who might be intrigued by this movie title to watch it. I've watched a lot of movies in my time and I'm very forgiving in the cinema, but that was too much. I will never forget "Tunnel" because I have marked an important point in my life experience in the cinema. It's a pity that it's such a low point.
