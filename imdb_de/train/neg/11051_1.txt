A terrible movie with a plethora of Canadian D-List actors who seem so confident they're on camera, that their performances are overly melodramatic and rather forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie is badly written. badly edited and badly addressed. It is incoherent, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. McDowell does an excellent job with what he's given, but he's the only one in this movie who does that - he really has a bad story and a bad script to work with. It is not even enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> I do not have to believe Van Pelleske to be believable, and even under-figures like Iron (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that it's a lot in Toronto instead of a barge off Africa. <br /> <br /> Has the director not seen the creature look like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? The fight between the blue flashes and Pelleske's orange sayings of 'magic' (!!!!!!!!!!!!) is obviously the result of bad actors, without choreographers superimposed with fully derived special effects Director on set or in the editing room for this catastrophe movie (not the good guy) <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... Do not even waste your time with this, you'll regret it like I. I have nothing left to say about this celluloid waste.
