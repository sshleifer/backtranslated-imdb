Adrian has just left asylum, rich and without parents, his life seems to be empty. One day he meets Gonzalo, a poor boy whose mother is prostituting himself. Desperate to earn some money, Gonzalo helps Adrian find his life and who his parents were. This is a film by a new director, and in most movies it is perfectly clear: scenes are not properly directed, dialogues a little forced, some inconsistencies in the script ... In any case, the end is unexpectedly well done (well, just one little) and that saves a bit of the movie. Actors are known and of excellent quality. Still, they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting. Everyone has done better papers in other films. The movie is boring and you'll probably spend most of your time thinking about how much time it will take to finish. Of course there are many worse movies, but of course there are many better ones.
