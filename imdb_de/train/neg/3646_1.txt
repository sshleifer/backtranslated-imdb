Oh ... my ... god ... this is undoubtedly the cutest movie I've ever seen. Acting is bad, the story is weak, the characters are weaker and the whole movie just does not make sense. Combine this with a mediocre direction, really strange scenes (like the one in which the boy grabs the gorge and mysteriously falls in) and a totally miserable dialogue ("Look!", "Musta peed his pants!"). , And you get a complete error. Not to mention that the only thing that seems to beat Mr. Atlas is a case of chocolate bars. However, this is part of the charm of the movie. Sit down and have a look with some of your friends for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it's just so bad!
