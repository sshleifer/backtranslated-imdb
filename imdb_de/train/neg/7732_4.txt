Before I wrote this report, I went back and read the reviews of others. This film was a particular disappointment to me as it features two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, who often wield miraculous Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights", "Ice Station Zebra", "The Thomas Crowne Affair")) The dance was stilted, unmotivated and unoriginal, the songs were forgotten, the story a joke, even the costumes were not particularly flattering, only the photography captures the right mood and the right spirit, I am glad that other people "The Young Girls of Rochefort ", although I certainly did not.
