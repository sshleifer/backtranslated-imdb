I hired this movie to watch a bloody action movie with no end, and got this overly sentimental and super low-cost drama that makes kickboxing look like The Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam, and when Lou rescues Reb from the caves, he gets shot in the head, which is easily one of the worst effects ever. The Vietnam scenes are shot in the backyard by someone, I swear! Lou is now a brain damage and Reb and he live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is determined to fight for money in a cage, and Reb makes a mock frenzy to get him back. There are no good fighting scenes, the strokes are two inches from a person. The personality of the characters changes in seconds. One guy is bad and in the next scene he is good. The acting is terrible and the music is an overly sentimental Frank Stallone song that would make you sick. I hated this movie.
