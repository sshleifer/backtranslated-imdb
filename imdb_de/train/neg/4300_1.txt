Bufords Beach Bunnies gives B & B films a bad name. As a fan of the genre, I was horrified to find a small attempt to exploit the talents of the young actresses. I refer specifically to the marked lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. What's the next generation of sad teenagers watching this on late night TV?
