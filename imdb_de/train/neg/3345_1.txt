Usually I do not feel qualified to check something that I've only seen for half an hour, but I'm making an exception here. <br /> <br /> Let the dialogue speak for itself! Here are some of the bad guys: "I smell ... Teacher!" "Sorry, teacher! You get an 'F! "" <br /> <br /> Bad guy and bad girl (right after you killed 2 policemen and stole a van full of drugs, they get hot and heavy): <br /> Him - "How do you think about shooting some innocent bystanders? " <br /> <br /> Her- (purring) "You really know how to show a girl a good time ..." A generic kid who ran for his life instead of helping someone sums up his life and life his personality in this line together: "I AM A CHICKEN TWIT! (This was the US network version) My old man was right! No wonder he left us ..." Boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> (Not really a spoiler) Badger (on fire) yells "Aargh! Fire!"
