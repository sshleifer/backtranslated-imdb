Weak, stale, tired, clich√©d; wants to be Basic Instinct, but misses opportunity for new perspectives, new insights. Fade, banal, grotesque and without the possibly redeeming value of brevity; Oh, wait ... it was only 90 minutes long ... it just has to be * much * long *! I would rather clean the toilets of the bus stops with my toothbrush than to get through them again. I say an opinion here: I think I did not like that.
