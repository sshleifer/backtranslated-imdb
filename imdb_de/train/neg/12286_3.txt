The summary in my cable TV guide has made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen, a track previously held by "Urban Legends: Final Cut". From the opening scene, I could say it was going to be really bad, but I was so bored that I could not care less. This movie contains ridiculous acting, especially by the guy who was tormented in his dreams, unbelievable as in unbelievable twists of the plot and some of the craziest music I've ever heard Nsync dominate the airwaves. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it's not funny. It would make a movie boring and boring and NOT frightening as it would try to add a few funny lines here and there, but no. We tortured the wayward friend of Guidance Guy, who tried to be funny, but instead seemed annoying. (Spoiler) And please, tell me, who in this crazy world is insane and self-hating enough to visit a scary prison in the middle of the night? Nobody! If you make a horror movie, at least make it believable. This one is anything but.
