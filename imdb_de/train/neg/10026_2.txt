I had some expectations for the film, as he had a beautiful star cast and the return of the duo is Akshay and Saif. Well, I was reluctant to watch the movie because the same guy did this, who wrote the story for the Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2. But if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt good because he was well placed. Well, the very first scene has satisfied me. The main drawback of the movie are the action sequences. Me and my friends laughed madly at these fucking fights. It was like Akshay against 30 thugs, and the thugs even got machine guns! Phew ... you have to see that to understand how bad the action sequences are. <br /> <br /> The other thing about the movie is the much too predictable story. It reminded me of some of the films of the early 80s. <br /> <br /> Well, the only thing the movie is worth is sexy Kareena, who looked really hot in this movie 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please ... please ... do not see that this is a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this to laugh at the terrible fight scenes. <br /> <br /> That's all.
