I bought this video quite cheap and thought that the cover looked pretty good. And it was nice, but the movie is garbage. I can handle B-Grade, sometimes I even enjoy a good slow train (ie "Surf Nazis Must Die" is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but that was just boring bland. Incredibly boring scenes have been sparsely resolved by good, cheap porn and entertaining dream-horror sequences. This movie has very little to offer.
