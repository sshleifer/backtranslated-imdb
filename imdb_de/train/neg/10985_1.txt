I do not know what Margaret Atwood thought so this movie has the same name as her book. I've always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to learn that a movie was in progress. I realize that the translation from book to film is not perfect, but this movie was the worst ever. The names of the women are correct and some of the background stories are correct, but that's about all. I feel like I lost a lot of my time trying to make it through this movie. This should have been a mini-series to tell the story as it was written. <br /> <br /> The actors for Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well-chosen, although I was initially skeptical of Mary Louise Parker. I just wish they had a better script that they could work with, because it really had nothing to do with the book.
