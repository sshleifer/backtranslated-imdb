I was of Puerto Rican descent and had mixed fillings about this "documentary". At first I was offended that Mrs. Perez compared Senor Campos with Che Guevarra. Only a fact, sir. John Leguzaimo is not of Puerto Rican descent. His parents came from Colombia. Whoever researched this was not very accurate. I feel that the future of our race is based on education. This message should have been in this movie. Education is our way to freedom and power. I think all future efforts of this production team should focus on that.
