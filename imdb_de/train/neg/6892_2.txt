Oh, my goodness. This was a really big mess that could not help. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and does not intend to go anywhere. Until his mother meets a wealthy businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels), with whom she might marry. <br /> <br /> It would have been an OK movie if Heder had not played his Jeffrey so annoying. At the beginning there is no chance to like him, and it only gets worse. In the end, we should like him, but there was no reason for that, because he had not changed from the egotistical blank he had at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Keaton does not even look up and is in terrible shape after 2007 because I said so. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where should they believe their mother and son? The only salvation is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, although they do not look very interested either. Apart from a few small smiles, the movie really does not deserve to be called a comedy just because there is hardly anything to laugh about! If you're in the mood for a recent Diane Keaton movie, check out Mad Money or Smother, which are far better than this vile effort.
