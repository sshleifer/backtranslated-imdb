I lived in the Middle East (in Israel) and was excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana. After seeing the trailer and being a thriller lover, I first anticipated a fast-paced, breathtaking film that cleverly plunges into global politics and the relationship between oil, power, and corruption from a new perspective. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The tempo was painfully slow, almost all the characters were stereotypes, the intertwining of logic made the logic intertwining very difficult, but in the end, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, you do not care. Save your money, save time and choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
