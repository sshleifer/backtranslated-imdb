I had high hopes for this movie because it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But those hopes broke down in the first 20 minutes. Palance was ridiculous. Not even Heston's acting or Annabel Schofield's beauty (or short nude scenes) could save this movie. Some of the room effects were pretty good, but others were cheesy. The conspiracy was ridiculous. Even sci-fi fans should skip this. Grade F
