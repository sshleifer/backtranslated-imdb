ALIEN LOVE (as this movie is known in the UK) is a very strange movie. I do not mean that this is an esoteric art house movie in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman. I mean, it's a TVM with cursing, sex, some really good T & A, a bad script and a very retro feel. One can only imagine that someone like John Hughes directed it ten years earlier, although of course he would have given up the T & A circumstances. <br /> <br /> Back to the bad script, one of the problems is that only a few of the characters do any kind of motivation, especially Amanda. Why is she picking up Connie at the bar? Just so she could hit an alien? Do you understand what I mean by retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT, and many other mid-1980s films had this kind of plot, most of them more defined and convincing than the one shown here. The plot continues to follow a poorly defined, unconvincing and illogical path. <br /> <br /> That is, I found ALIEN LOVE observable and not just T & A. As a sci-fi sex comedy, she is much better than FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY
