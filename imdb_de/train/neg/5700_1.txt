How this movie gets a rating of 6.7 is unimaginable. It deserves nothing better than a 2.0 and should definitely belong to the worst 100 films of the IMDb of all time. National Treasure is an affront to national intelligence and just another attack on the American public that Hollywood has made. Critics told of action holes that could be passed through with a 16-wheeler. <br /> <br /> I love the justifications of this movie because it's good ... "Nicholas Cage is cute." Come on, people, no wonder people around the world think Americans are stupid. This is the stupidest and most offensive movie I have ever seen. If you wanted to see a really decent movie this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. Unfortunately, National Treasure got a lot more advertising than these great movies. I'll bet most of you reading this have not even heard of them, as some have not been published yet. Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor - when he's in the right films. Time and again, I've seen Cage squander his incredible talent on awesome, startling films like Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. If his talent is used as in Charlie Kaufman's adaptation, he is an incredible actor. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I would rather hand my hand to a wood chipper than to be exposed to this visual cruelty again.
