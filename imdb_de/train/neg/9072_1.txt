This movie has no action and no focus. Yes, it's supposed to be a stupid comedy, but the scriptwriters have no idea what the movie is about. Even the title does not fit the movie. It should have been called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. The characters are not developed and nobody cares what happens to them! The girl-roommate character (from That's 70's Show) was the only person worth seeing. She was funny and stole every scene she was in. The others must make sure that their own higher education diplomas are in progress, as they require a career other than acting.
