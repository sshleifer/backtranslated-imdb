Against All Hope is a very bad, sometimes painful movie. This is Michael Madsen's first film, and he shows that he is not so good at it. Some people may find the story ridiculous; An alcoholic realizes that his life and family are falling apart, and he calls a preacher for help as a last resort. After telling his story to the preacher, he takes Jesus Christ to his heart. <br /> <br /> I have indeed found many of the religious scenes, as if Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to church, but is quite realistic. I also like how Cecil knows his life is breaking up and trying to get help, but recognizes that only God can help him. In the end, with the help of God, he realizes that he can go through life without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This movie is not well done at all. The acting is bad, the script might need some work and looks worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Just because you become a Christian does not mean that you can automatically stop an addiction or heal your broken family. If you're a Christian, you'll appreciate how that movie is Christianity, and if you are not, you may be called to learn more about faith.
