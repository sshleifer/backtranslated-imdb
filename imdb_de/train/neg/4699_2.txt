Wow, the Naked Brothers Band. What can I say. I think I can say that this show is just crap. Number one: They have no talent, they probably can not even play the instruments. Number 2: The commercial was said to be famous, but no one had heard of them until a shitty show occurred there. See, I really do not hate it so much, I would give it like a 4 out of 10, but what bothers me is that everyone says they have such a great talent and Nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics. Deep in my ass! He speaks of hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings. Wow, I could read what's on the walls of a bathroom and it would be deeper. And they did not become famous by themselves, their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be such a bad show too. I feel like it will be canceled soon.
