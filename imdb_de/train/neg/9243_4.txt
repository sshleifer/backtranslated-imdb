Simply put, I do not like Westerns. And since I had never eaten one from beginning to end, I decided to see "My Darling Clementine" and make it through, no matter how painful it was for me. At first it was agonizing as expected. I found the acting ridiculous, the scenery (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and its timing wavering on the verge of pain. However, after talking inwardly about fighting, after the first 20 minutes it became a bit more difficult for me to endure. Focusing on cinematography and how John Ford managed to make even the most boring situations (boring, in my opinion) sometimes seems quite amazing and has made it much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not say that I liked the movie in the end. But it was good enough for me to finish and that impresses me.
