I saw this movie last night, and even after a few beers, the only giggle of this movie was when I realized I actually saw it. in a word it is not funny. Listless. I totally believe the rumor that Jack Black has apologized for making this junk. I can not believe that Barry Levinson threw this script not just when he read the first page. besides, I can not believe that I have seen more than ten minutes of it. <br /> <br /> I gave 3 out of 10 * because I love to see christopher walken making terrible movies for the paycheck. even the horse "corky", which only exists as a character in this film, is actually quite ridiculous.
