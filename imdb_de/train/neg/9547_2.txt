A substandard-looking video game becomes a conspiracy that discovers the next terrorist in the backyard of the United States. Welcome to the madness of cheap direct movies. It is full of nameless actors and actresses with little valuable conspiracy. <br /> <br /> This strange game goes on and our "hero" uses real money and does it well. It's a bit like gambling except that the gambling part is gone and it annoys. Instead, it's an online game with little real value, and when you do good, you get authority over the tail. <br /> <br /> What makes it even more peculiar is that two foreign computer programs are defending themselves somehow and everything is being stored in the computer. I'll leave the audience to see how it all comes to fruition. <br /> <br /> Not even worth a $ 1 rent. Please lend it out. "D-"
