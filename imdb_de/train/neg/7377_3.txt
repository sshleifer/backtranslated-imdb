Although the plot was very detailed and the plot was understandable, the fact that the voice of Steven Seagals was dubbed in a different voice was worrisome throughout most of the film, as you were not sure who was speaking. There were many places where he would start talking in his deep, harsh voice, and then another's voice made the conversation for him. I do not know the reason. However, if he had trouble with his voice during the production of the film, the events that did not contain his own voice could have been resumed when he recovered. I rated this movie 3 out of 10, based on the quality of the movie. When you pay for a movie, be it in the theater or on DVD, this movie was not worth the ticket price that was paid. I am a longtime successor to Steven Seagal and all of his films that he has made in recent years. To this day, I think that this is one of the worst we have ever seen
