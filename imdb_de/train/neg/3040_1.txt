With such a title you get a lot of rubbish. Bad act script bad director bad. Grammar bad. <br /> <br /> Films make a lot of noise, which is really not music and many people are screaming. Film makes bad racial stereotype. Why is every movie with black heroes drug addicted? Why does a hero always have to dance to be successful? Why does a famous rapper always have to be in dance film? Why can not letters "s" be in the title? <br /> <br /> Hollywood has to stop a dumb audience and make a movie that has people who know how to speak proper English. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and do not see.
