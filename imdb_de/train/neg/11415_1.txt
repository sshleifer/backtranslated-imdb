Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This movie is a cliché piece of garbage. A high school comedy in a military training camp. I am sorry that I had to give this star 1, which he did not deserve. <br /> <br /> THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Everything is totally enforced, unconvincing and unrealistic. The HEPO (Military Police) will not pick you up if you do not show up, especially not on your wedding day. The actors were quite embarrassed in this scene because the scene did not work because it was so unlikely. You can feel it in their voices. Even if they were not such bad actors, they would not have saved the scene. <br /> <br /> Next, the guy must train in his wedding suit. No, there was no time to get him a uniform first. Man, that's great movie art! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There are also GIRLS at the camp - exciting - one of them even a model, though it does not look that great - and the worst actress I've ever seen. I doubt they'll say a single line in a B movie in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Okay, girls in the military! That's fun now. The girls are even on the same floor, so we can sneak into their room at night! In reality, they would be placed in another building at a distance of two kilometers, separated by two fences with barbed wire. <br /> <br /> There are tanks that we can use in our free time for a fun ride that we have plenty of. No, the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are plugged. Nobody will notice the engine noise, especially not at night. <br /> <br /> There are a number of sex scenes and references, and all are below the drop line. We need them, so that the sexually obsessed Germans like the movie. Switzerland is too small for a feature film. Well done! <br /> <br /> There is a sex scene in the kitchen. Certainly none of these facilities is ever locked. The military routines are as sloppy as they can be. <br /> <br /> At the end of the mindless strip, the mafia men are about to take revenge on the poor man who tries to shoot him! Because he left his fiance! Sure, I buy that, the Italians are like that - a jealous bunch (not). <br /> <br /> The bad guys try this in the open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not at night in a dark alley. Again, military practice sites (where live ammunition is fired at) are open to the public, and anyone can drive or run there freely. There are no guards or fences. <br /> <br /> However, the deed is prevented by the good captain launching a rocket into the car of the Italians in time. The explosion strikes the struck men and the enraged fiancé off their feet. No one 40 feet away is injured when the car is blown up. It's a comedy, do not forget. <br /> <br /> Okay. It's a comedy, I have that and I can live with it. No realism needed. Filmmakers can easily prevail if it's weird, the page splits funny or entertaining, interesting, challenging. Unfortunately, that's not part of it. It's just embarrassing. A rip-off of mindless American comedies. The latter are at least professional, without lay actors. <br /> <br /> It's pretty boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially for those who play the full movie, as I unfortunately did. Yawning.
