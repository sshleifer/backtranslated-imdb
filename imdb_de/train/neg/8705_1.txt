This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's funny how bad it is. Throughout the time I watched the movie, I half expected the music to start and the doctor start dancing (better plot). When the bird of prey tried to get in the door, I threw it as if someone had one Plastic doll thrown from a distance of about 2 meters against the door. But as I said, it's so bad that you have to see it, so you can see how bad it is for me to explain that it does nothing compared to looking at it. I do not recommend renting it, but when it comes on TV and watch it for about 30 minutes, just to see what I mean. I could not watch for more than 30 minutes, but if you can handle the whole thing then you have good willpower
