My score for this crap: 1/10 1 only for the technical area. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that does not make sense. It seems clear that creating a good screenplay for film or television is almost impossible. <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they're one of the biggest liars in the world, but it's hard to understand how to make such miserable films. <br /> <br /> We have to believe that people are taken for idiots. Maybe that was the reason to believe that 99% of the movies are crap. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> If you look at the price we give Oscars, we better understand why we continue to make films that are more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And strangely, it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to hear that sound, press the "Super Fast Forward" button (at least 20x).
