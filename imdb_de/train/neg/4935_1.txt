"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations and not in a good way. It was worse than I thought. Basically, here's the show: The cavemen are an alternative race, they face prejudice, etc. Pretty much the dumbest idea ever created; almost worthy of the writers. It was shown in a show how the cavemen went to a club to pick up girls, and then nothing else happened. It recalled a 22-minute conversation with Andy Rooney, followed by the death of steak knives over dwarf cannibals. For those who have not seen this show, here's an example of the dialogue: "You're sure you can go out with a caveman." "Yes, that's alright, I already had ten thousand!" Hilarious ... Maybe the best font I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 22 minutes Caveman with terrible makeup coping with tough social problems ... Sounds like a fun night out. I also love how bad the recent ideas are that they make a sitcom out of a car insurance promotion. I wonder if they will do the gecko next time so I can get a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I would even say that this is worse than "Viva Laughlin". At least "Viva Laughlin" was torn off by something that was a little bit inspired. <br /> <br /> Shows like these make me hope there's a comet somewhere on Earth. Honestly not honest ...)
