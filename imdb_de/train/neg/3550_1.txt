I lead a group to stop the exploitation of comedians, and I've spent the past two months hearing horror stories from comedians trying to audition for Last Comic Standing. If they do not have a good agent, they do not even have the opportunity to audition, so more than 80% of the comedians who show up are rejected before they can show anyone they have talent! If they make it to an audition, I'm told it's "predetermined" when they get a second chance. What the TV audience sees is NOT the best comics in the US. <br /> <br /> If the comics make it into the show, most of them will not get any IMDb credits. I know that because I did the credits for all 6 seasons of "Last Comic Standing" and I'm not paid to do the work of the producers. It's really a shame. One month ago I asked "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook why the producers did not give out IMDb credits and I was excluded from their Facebook page !!! I'm not a comedian, so I have no personal part in it. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like being exploited and that's why I helped the comedians. Comedians are exploited on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a BIG THREE network, so those in charge should be ashamed to admit this exploitation to Comedian, who was victimized: http://www.youtube.com/watch ? v = RMB4-hyet_Y
