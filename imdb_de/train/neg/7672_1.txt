Obviously, many talented people who worked behind the scenes worked on the film. So do not look at the credits at the end, you will only hold it against them. No one seemed to see this movie, only three were in the theater; Two fainted after 10 minutes and they were the lucky ones. The "monsters" were the jobless worm of Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the alien space creatures. Obviously, the creators of the film did not want to overshadow the third-rate movie monsters, so they hired rate actors who apparently could not remember their lines, or in some cases learn to utter the words before the filming began. Some scenes are incredibly inappropriate when it comes to conveying exactly what should happen. If you are unhappy enough to be in a theater where this movie is going on and you do not faint, you'll laugh at the supposedly scary or exciting moments in the movie. The implausibility of several scenes will only stun you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spitting out of the "Queen Mary of Curse Words" makes you feel like anyone who pays it has the feeling. If you need to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until he finds himself in the box in the video shop. If there is justice in the film industry, one of the main characters will give it to you.
