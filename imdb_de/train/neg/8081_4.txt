One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it becomes satire, is that it is somewhat plausible. I would think that an antimatter bomb would do far more damage than what it intended. But I leave that to the physicists who may have seen the solar crisis. <br /> <br /> It's a crisis exposed to the earth because solar flares are completely out of control. They come so close to Earth that it gets unusually hot, as if the whole earth is Death Valley. The answer is an antimatter bomb that has to bring a spaceship to the sun and explode there. This will distract the torches towards the direction of Mercury, provided it is not in direct alignment with the earth. <br /> <br /> Who will deliver it, but Captain Tim Matheson and his crew. That is, if he can focus on the business and not on the out-of-control son Corin Nemec. Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father, and Nemec's grandfather take care of the family's family problems. <br /> <br /> There's a villain here as well, Peter Boyle, the CEO of a multinational corporation. This crisis is trying to control the food supply of the survivors worldwide. The idea, which he may not survive, does not enter his thinking. He is doing his best to sabotage Matheson's mission. <br /> <br /> Solar crisis seems to be a bad mix of 2001, A Space Odyssey and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Boyle seems to be saying goodbye to Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently he's the only one in the cast who realizes that he's in Turkey and acts accordingly overclocking. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is brave, true blue and dull. Except maybe desert rat Jack Palance, who finds Nemec and cares for him. <br /> <br /> The key here is that the movie was directed by well-known Hollywood Flood distributor Allen Smithee. The movie gets up to four stars for the cast and it was on time for a Thanksgiving carving.
