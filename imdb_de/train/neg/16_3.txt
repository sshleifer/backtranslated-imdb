There are many very good-looking people in this movie. That's probably the best part. Maybe it's even worth it to look at it. <br /> <br /> "Loaded" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who is leaving his mark on the world. He is the son of a wealthy family with a good reputation and is on his way to law school. But like so many such attitudes, things are not as perfect as they appear. The expectations in this family far outweigh the love. With the exception of the school Tristan's father rarely leaves the house. This seems to be the result of a traumatic event of the past that shook the family, partly revealed by flashbacks, but described only at the end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment makes him extremely angry at the first opportunity when his friends take him to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party, and from then on Tristan becomes friends with Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who pulls him into an underworld of drug trafficking. Film suffers from a lackluster script and a plot that is not very appealing , Compared to this film are also some constant camera ticks, which were generally distracting, such as slow motion, fast motion, stills and echoes. These are the kinds of effects a director can normally use to show a character's perspective on drugs, except in this case they were occasionally randomly thrown into a cheap style attempt. <br /> <br /> Despite being relatively unknown, performance was good all around, especially in relation to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect we will see at least some of these people in larger and better projects in the future. <br /> <br /> When I mention the actors, of course I have to mention their looks. In this film, the results are rated 11. The women in this movie look amazing and almost distract you from a boring movie you are watching. I'm sure the male characters are also pretty attractive, but you have to ask someone to comment. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not recommend this movie, not to buy, rent, or even see for free. Unfortunately, it is not worth the effort to prevail.
