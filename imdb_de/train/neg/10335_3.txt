Average (and surprisingly tame) Fulci giallo, which means that it is still pretty bad by normal standards, but with its solid structure and some nice details, such as: The known weaknesses of the genre are in full swing: banal dialogue, Wooden games, illogical action points. And the finale lasts way too long, while the denouement turns out to be rather lame or I say flabby matter. Fulci's ironic handling of the Giallo standards, however, is amusing. Yellow notes wherever you look. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 limping killers
