The perfect murder is thwarted when a woman (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who directed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker that has the misfortune to receive a visitor who is currently in Movement is the corpse out there ... an insane madman in a Santa Claus costume (played by a vile Larry Drake). She fights for her life as she tries to hide her husband's body. She decides to use an ax once she has knocked down the Santa Killer, who misses several ways to cut off the woman's head to frame the killer for her husband's murder. Santa Killer locks her in a closet and tracks the woman's daughter as she desperately tries to break free to save the child. Subject and also added the often-used woman (adding murders), her husband-to-a-man, whom she cheated on - with routine. It is essentially Trainor who is trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body he is killing while keeping a safe distance from a madman. There is nothing refreshing or new about this plot that goes through the movements quite a bit. No highlight of the show.
