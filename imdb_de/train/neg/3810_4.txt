When I was younger, I liked this show, but now ... BLECCH !!! This show is sappy, poorly written and rarely funny. The three main roles were all good actors and funny men (Saget's Stand Up was much better than what this show brought, just as Coulier was a better stand up and Stamos was a better average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted out of the show because he wanted to do something more serious (who could blame him?). The show was eventually canceled when many actors demanded more money. <br /> <br /> Here are a few things that make me crazy: <br /> <br /> 1. The Tags: How many times can a person use exhausting buzz words like "how rude," "you're crazy about it "," Nerdbomber "," cutting off "and" mercy "in 24 hours? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler - the most annoying character ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. Writing and clichés as an oreo cookie. There is good cliché writing and bad cliché writing. Full House had written a bad cliché. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living together in San Francisco. Enough said. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic stuff - too much to remember. <br /> <br /> 6. Trendy Kids - The girls had the latest fashion houses and you can see posters of trendy recording artists they would be into. <br /> <br /> Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I can not say anything bad about those involved, as I think many of them have talent. But this show was so cute that after some time I could not stand it anymore.
