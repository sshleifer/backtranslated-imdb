Greetings from the darkness. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? In "Avalon" and "Diner" he made two of my favorite favorites. He also had some good movies ("Rainman"), but always offered something interesting ... until now. I think the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" is the definition of boring. I've never been a big fan of pure slap-stick ("Dumb and Dumber"), I was just amazed at how awful this movie is. There may be 2 giggles in the whole thing - if you can take care so long. The best part of the movie is the running gag of the title song from a redbone sound-like one. If the movie had been written the same as the song, it would have been bearable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I know that they all want to make a comedy (also Julianne Moore), but the real world reveals a weakness. SNL actress Amy Poehler has become an ordinary princess in her role as trailer garbage. The catastrophe of the film is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work commutes together promising, but then their chemistry disappears due to the bad writing. This script is like most of Jack Black's ideas - not a bad thought, but no hope of success.
