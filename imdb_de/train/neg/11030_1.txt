I recently watched this movie at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival and, to be honest, it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Do not get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad movies (eg "Manos ?? Hands of Fate") and then there are the horrible bad movies. (This falls in the latter category). The cinematography was incredible and not in a good way. It felt as if the cameraman was deliberately out of focus (with the exception of a free nipple shot), the lighting was something between "a man walking around with a light bulb" and "missing". The actors were as bad as soap actors, but not as bad as porno actors, and they gave the impression that every line was completely surprising to them. The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look by Jason Vorhees of Friday the 13th. The plot was extremely bad and the end worse. I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs an example of what a horror movie should not look like, or maybe an insomniac who needs sleep.
