This British movie is really horrible, and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is there, even though he's pretty sleepwalking. The idea of ​​a bomb in a train sounds good ... but it turns out that this train is parked for the most part of the movie! No action, no movement, just a static move. The area where the train is parked is vacated. So there is no danger for everyone. In fact, this film could be used in a movie class to show how NOT to do a suspension film. Real excitement comes from informing the audience about things the characters do not know, a fact that the director seems to be unfamiliar with. SPOILER: The train actually has two bombs, but we think there is only one. After the first bomb has been defused, it seems that there is no reason to watch the movie. But at the last minute, the villain, who has no obvious motivation for his actions, reveals two. We're not sure WHEN the bombs go off, so we do not even have a classic "ticking bomb" voltage sequence. A good ten minutes or more, the French wife of Glenn Ford checks to see if she has left him and then asks himself where he is. She's such an annoying character that we do not care if she's reconciled to him. When she does that, there is nothing emotional. Most other characters are fairly free of personality and no one has problems or problems. It's only 72 minutes, but it feels long because it's boring and boring. Do not waste your time.
