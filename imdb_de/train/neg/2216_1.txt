I'm a lover of B movies, give me a genetically modified bat and I'm in heaven. These movies are good for stopping you from thinking of everything else in your world. Even a stupid B-movie usually makes me laugh and I still think it's a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, which was so horrible that I had to register with IMDb to warn others. First, there was the science of creating the shark man whom the film barely touched. To keep the interest of the audience, they paid attention to blood every few minutes. During an attacking scene, the camera moved away from the attack, but you saw that a stagehand had apparently thrown a bucket of blood, which let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (which would be fabulous special effects). Back in science, I found it very interesting that the female subjects were kept naked and the test device required monitoring by their breast tissue. Anyway, this movie had a bad plot, a horrible story, and I'm sorry I have to say pretty bad acting. Even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could not save that stinker.
