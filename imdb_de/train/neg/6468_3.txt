That is a good thing. The score came as a farewell performance for Marlon Brando because I did not like to think he was running out of free money. Not what his fans should remember. Brando in his last years looked more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of movie Welles would have been looking for to fund his own work. Brando is the guardian of a local jail, which is usually the largest employer in the region in America if it's in a small rural area. That gives a responsible person a lot of clout. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has a weakness that he indulges in, his two twin bimbos, also known as daughters. Even if they become pregnant at the same time by two losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts are still with Daddy. <br /> <br /> Not to worry because Brando is ready to give them jobs in the prison where they work in conditions not much better than the convicts. What to do, but commit a robbery of a train that drives around and brings in the spent money to be burned by the Ministry of Finance. <br /> <br /> Although Free Money has a few moments of humor, it is usually far behind the talents of everyone involved. Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also a straight arrow FBI agent. Of course, these people and the rest of the performers have worked with someone many are considered the greatest American actor of the last century. If Brando's presence had not been 40 years ago, Free Money would have played the drive-in circuit in the red states of America, where people could see it satirized. <br /> <br /> Or a a feeble attempt is made to satirize her.
