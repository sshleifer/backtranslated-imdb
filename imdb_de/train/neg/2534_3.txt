* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes referred to as "Life Everlasting". This is often taken as a reference to the final scene, but more accurately describes how dead and buried this once-estimable series is after this sloppy and illogical farewell. <br /> <br /> There is a "Hey kids, let's put on a show air" over this telemovie, which can be sexy at points. Some fans will feel like insiders when they choose the various cameo appearances. Co-writer, co-producer Tom Fontana and his buddies are packing with friends and favorites from other shows as well as real Baltimore personalities. <br /> <br /> This is the profit of almost all The members of the television show varied occupations, your old favorites and later non-favorites. <br /> <br /> There was always a quality-conscious executive producer Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura, and the rest of the creative team against budget-minded NBC executives who simply wanted another stupid police trial, such as "Nash Bridges," which regularly " Homicide "in the ratings. The pressure that went on in the show, between the intriguing realism that went beyond its form, and the sloppy sensationalism that humiliated it. Unfortunately Fontana, the co-authors of Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer as well as the director Jean de Segonzac were a shame for this movie. They recorded the most ridiculous story in the series, filling it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new storyline and laying the burden of carrying all the chaos to one of the weaker performers. <br /> <br /> Some time has passed since the last episode of the show. The former heart of Baltimore's murder squad, Yaphet Kotto as Lt. Al Giardello, is now a candidate of Kurt Schmoke for the mayor, and Schmoke himself makes a cameo. However, this promising start immediately and unlikely begins a tragic turn. <br /> <br /> The spotlight changes to Giancarlo Esposito as Giardello's son Mike. Esposito, a handsome man who has done a good job elsewhere, was one of the pretty faces that supposedly enlivened the series. But the question for viewers has always been: is Mike uncomfortable as a son of Gee or is Esposito uncomfortable in that role? <br /> <br /> To be fair, Esposito has no chance to play the main story without interruption. That's because the writers choose this moment to revive another plot that inspired the intelligence of the show's loyal voters. <br /> <br /> An obvious snuff streaming video was advertised on the internet and seemed to be actually happening. After a few red herrings, the detectives arrested a dismissive suspect. But Zaljko Ivanek's harassed and overworked Deputy Prosecutor forgot to apply in time, and the suspect was released, only to be later murdered. <br /> <br /> Let's summarize: He forgot to file the paperwork because he was not the most sensational case of his career, because the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire legislature of Maryland, the US Public Prosecutor, NBC, Court TV, the BBC, AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The LA Times, Time Magazine, The Times of London, The Economist, The Johannesburg Mail and Guardian The L'Osservatore Romano, Figaro, Paris Match, L'Equipe and Computer World did not call every 10 minutes to ask about the state of the case. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the old group of detectives and associates are pouring into Baltimore to help. There are quite a few talents to see. Unfortunately, due to the limited number of dialogues, some of them can only be seen. <br /> <br /> Two of the strongest actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are being criminalized while Jon Seda is wasting time and Michael Michelle could be better spent on advertising. The authors seem to saturate this and present Jason Priestley as the newest detective. On the other hand, they give Michelle Forbes a laid-back, laid-back scene. <br /> <br /> There is another clever casting, with Lt. Gary D'Addario, the center of the book, led the show and played another detective. Guests come from other shows, such as Whitney Allen, who plays with her dead-temper and her perplexed "Miss Sally" from the children's show, loved by the inmates on Fontana's "Oz". Dina Napoli from WBAL TV appears as herself. <br /> <br /> Even though they are entertaining, these guests can distract. Ed Begley Jr. is actually advancing the story in his brief appearance and playing Dr. Victor Ehrlich from Fontana's "St. elsewhere". He is still a lively character and fits in a hospital environment. Do you remember that St. Elegius was not the imagination of an autistic boy? <br /> <br /> The most useful cameo reflects the synergy of companies. This film was made when Court TV bought series rights to the series. This network helped make Helen Lucaitis, who had interviewed the Homicide team, later appear on "Oz." The TV correspondent does an efficient job by summarizing the news, ie plotting points for late arrivals. <br /> <br /> Although she is so skinny that she disappears when she turns to the side, Lucaitis also copes with some physical comedy with Esposito. In his scenes with Lucaitis he shows more juice than his usual colleagues. Maybe the two should have done a spin-off. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds, the cream of the cast rises. Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor overcome it, even though they are equipped with a loser script. Their performances remind audiences of what made Homicide a remarkable track, the best show on television, and one of the best television productions of all time. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch top professionals doing their stuff; It's just a shame that this movie gives them no chance. Hard-core fans might want to watch this movie anyway, but you can live without it.
