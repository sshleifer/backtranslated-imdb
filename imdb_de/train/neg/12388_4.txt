** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> If you can deal with the most unpleasant subjects, this film will provide tremendous help for the outrageously camping melodrama. Surprisingly, this film has been copied and demolished several times over the years, though it's hard to fathom any filmmaker inspired by this seedy drama. None of the Hemingway women can do anything here (although Mariel HAS has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers the only track of the class as a prosecutor, and Chris Sarandon is alternately wretched and unintentionally funny as the schmoozy, dingy villain Das Piece. <br /> <br /> Veteran director Lamont Johnson can not make a silk handbag out of that sow's ear of a script, stuffed with howling bad conversations and odd situations. For example, the final sequence in which Margaux grabs her gun and strikes Sarandon after his last shocking act is thrilling, but is said to produce a hearty chuckle instead. Add a notoriously shrill and spicy music by Michel Polnareff, and you'll have a feeling of guilt, even if you're likely to feel grubby after looking at it and need a hot shower. Do not say that you were not warned.
