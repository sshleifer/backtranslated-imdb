The Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy plays a major role in one of his weakest werewolf films ... but wear me a moment. Most people will be familiar with the most famous TV title, THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and there have been many versions of home videos over the years. But if you want to be serious, there's the most functional edition I've ever seen, THE WOLF MAN NIE SLEEPS, and it's an unedited and full European version that restores some disturbing scenes to the original nude photos missing in print from FURY. It is also a mailbox. <br /> <br /> Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky and returns home from a trip to Tibet, only to find that he has a curse of werewolves and that his wife had an affair. He takes care of her and her lover in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy doctor and her assistant. Apparently, the Doc is trying to "tame" the werewolf, and between her and the hairy and fake Daninsky, who is at least in the original version under her trance, there is a very strange sado-masochistic love scene. Ultimately, we get two werewolves for the price of one, as Daninsky fights a wolf! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie is that the director (according to Naschy's claim) was often drunk and the results are indeed rather incoherent. When watching the copy of THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, it's not that hard to see what's going on, though editing in places remains cruel. The worst is occasional mismatched footage from Nashy's ravender werewolf, which was taken directly from another previous movie (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka "FRANKENSTEIN BLOODY TERROR") and was dubbed into this movie for no reason! The clothing of the wolf changes from black shirt to white and back, as well as his appearance; In a moment the wolf walks lethargically in a hypnotic trance of FURY, and then he growls and runs wild in front of BLOODY TERROR. Really bizarre.
