Good night, Mr. Tom starts in an incredibly exquisite village in the south of England, where the sun is always shining. Before we know much about the time, we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II. Soon a train brings steam clouds out of London, and when the shy little William gets clad with the reluctant, gruff old Tom (whom you just know he'll have a heart of gold), our story begins. <br /> <br /> And what a load of sentimental gossip it is. In fact, it's just the old buddy formula. Are not new stories written? <br /> <br /> As I have hinted, there is not much time in the village and not much in London, except for the old ambulance rattling in the area. And certainly no indication of the horror of lightning as the citizens of London politely place in air raid shelters. Even if the husband of the local school teacher is declared dead, he is later brought back to life. <br /> <br /> I found "Goodnight, Mister Tom" a clich√© and obvious, and John Thaw's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker's The Two Ronnies with a straw in their mouth, which sets his "Country Bumpkin" accent. By the way, my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons I did not like it, and I look at other Imdb reviewers that I seemed to be in a minority of one. <br /> <br />
