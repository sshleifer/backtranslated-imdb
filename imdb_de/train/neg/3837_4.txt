I have seen (far too much) flicks from this company - this is roughly in the middle of the pack. One of the good sides, a little more stylized and in control than some of her favorite children - less of the sophomoric attempts at humor and more adherence to history (for what it's worth). Many of their titles, such as B. Sexy Sixth Sense are buried by Baaaad performances and laymanliness. On the other hand, I found the simulated sex scenes not as sharp as other movies (like Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). Misty Mundae is always a 10 on the Peter Meter, like Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce hot at school, and Ruby LaRocca was a sexy little girl. <br /> <br /> See this with the remote firmly in your (free) hand, on a night when you need a break from porno. Do not waste your time looking through history - you have better things to do in your life. It's not a movie, it's pure T & A, but not bad in that respect.
