I was largely convinced to write this review for a variety of reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. 2) If he does not receive more reviews, he will not be listed in the list of the worst films of all time - what he deserves, 3) I was a bit lucky - I paid five pounds for it. I have seen it in stores for Â£ 15. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS FILM! They will be very angry. 4) There are a lot of movies in the horror genre that (in my opinion) are not getting a fair rating, and if this movie gets a higher rating than it's criminal, <br /> <br /> The Story Summary: One Man without friends meets a trample that promises the world - well, the magical ability to appear to everyone else like someone else. Our hero cleverly turns into a young girl and joins her gang - sitting on swings, babysitting. He kills them in turn until he is tracked down and found by the police. Why is it so bad? In the beginning, the acting is very bad. Someone compared it to a school production. No, that's worse than any other acting I've seen on a school stage. <br /> <br /> I bought some of these previously banned movies from the DVD company vipco and was not as disappointed as me. Okay, the acting is bad, but the movie does not deliver in any other way. What was the point of making this movie when there is not even a bunch! okay, no blood. What else can a movie offer? Breats? No, not even some kick! <br /> <br /> It is true that this film has a certain charm in its unique naffness, but every potential buyer / viewer of this movie should be cautioned that this movie is only worth one in ten at best.
