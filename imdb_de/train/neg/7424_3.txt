Very, very modest film prices here with Stella Stevens, the instructions of someone in disguise (it was not too long to guess who it was) in Old Nevada Town outside of Vegas looking for a money robbery at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens heads her group of three and they realize they have to act much faster than expected. Despite some great glimpses of Las Vegas in the '70s, very average but believable action by most involved and an action with potential, Las Vegas Lady lays a big boring egg. It always seems like the movie is about to get going, and if it just stutters here and there, it never really accelerates. I was a little disappointed in this movie. Sure, I did not expect anything great, but at least I thought this could be one of the great exploitation movies of the 70s or something like that. Not even close. Nobody dies. Between the squeaky Stuart Whitman and the offensive George DiCenzo, a lame shootout takes place a year before his great accomplishment as prosecutor Bugliosa in Helter Skelter. The shootings have the tension to watch a waterfall. There is a blow and a head with a blunt instrument. In addition, nothing to action. And as for the girls, you will not expect much there. Stella and her girls (both very mediocre but handsome talents, go into a sauna and a bath.) What do we see? Nothing but a sketchy side profile.) Stella wears these beautiful open blouses that emphasize her true talents, but I wish her it would have been something more open with their performance. That way, I could write something that would recommend the film: Unfortunately, it should not be, and I have little to say in favor of this film. It's not a horrible movie in any way. It just has nothing to offer. YAWN.
