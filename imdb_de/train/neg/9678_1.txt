I'm sorry to say that it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Although visually intriguing (for example, the use of color was absolutely mind-blowing), it was quite boring and disturbing (see Father / Son Incest). <br /> <br /> And the music is totally missing, and if you remember those wonderful soundtracks by Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most Greenaway films), you can imagine the difference it makes. <br /> <br />
