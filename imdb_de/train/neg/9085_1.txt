One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Acting was terrible for both children and adults. Most to all characters showed no, little or not enough emotions. The lighting was terrible and there was too much confusion by the time the movie was shot (In the river scene where only the boat was destroyed, there are 4 shots;) The sheriff and dad are on their boat at night, Jillian and Molly swim in the evening, the rest of the children during the day * when it's supposed to be on the riverbank in the evening, and the doctor, Beatrice, and Simonton get out of the boat in the evening, but not in the evening.) The best actor in the movie was probably the sheriff Cappy. (Although the pulse detector has a slip-up. * Whatever that thing is, when people die, it beeps *) Cappy died, he still moves while it's still working. You hear a beep, and while the nurse checks her pulse manually , then it shows the pulse again and THEN it finally dies.) I think it will not be perfect, since it is an independent movie, but it could be even better. Not worth it, honestly, even for children. Also look at something good, like The Lion King or Toy Story, when you see something you remember.
