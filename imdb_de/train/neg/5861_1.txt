I saw this movie when it was first published in 1978 when I was a high school student. I made an appointment to see it. I did not "get", needless to say, because the movie was so bad! Joan Rivers' career has never been as bad as she deserves after making this terrible, merciless crap. In fact, unfunny is not a serious term: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! They start from the feeling that every laugh that may have occurred has been knocked out of you before it could happen. This is not worth it, out of curiosity or for some reason, to be "so bad, it's good". Not even the gang at MST3K could have been worth seeing! The fact that Billy Crystal's career has survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
