I have just seen The Convent for the second time. I had enjoyed it before and figured it would make for a good, drunken Friday night movie, a bit of gore, some style, a little humor and the like. I was sad when I found out I could not appreciate it anymore. It seemed as if someone had decided to rethink cheeseball epics like Night of the Demons for a modern audience, but lost the things that were worth the original. I'm not even a big fan of Night of the Demons for the record, but there were a few things I really got to grips with. The monastery makes the cheese but the goodness not so much. Apart from the main girl (sympathetic performance of Joanna Canton), the Goth girl and a sweet cameo by Adrienne Barbeau, pretty much all the characters were unbearable and feverish on the very lowest levels of moronic, offensive jockhood. The film is then severely hampered by the total absence of unfounded nudity, meaning that in view of the terrible dialogue, it is difficult to see the characters, and the good points of the film are more difficult to appreciate. The evil nuns are original in design and get plenty of good scenes, even if they are not scary, definitely kinda cool, and the movie also brings a decent amount of decent blood with them. In the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on site, the movie gets pretty entertaining because all the vile people are dead and it's a wicked nun that stirs up rage. The stylized direction also gives occasional good results, although sometimes the camera just moves too fast. All in all, this was a movie in which the good points for me just can not make up for the things I hated. Those who love this movie may enjoy it a lot more, but for me it was not a good time.
