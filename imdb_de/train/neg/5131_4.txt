I liked it, but I think I might have ironed at the same time. This rewrite of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is an extremely unpretentious, formulaic Romcom who was saved from pure video contempt when released through the sharp curve of Janeane Garofalo. As a Frasier of Pets, she plays in a love trap when she dismisses her best friend (Uma Thurman) as herself because of the insecurity when a caller comes around the corner. <br /> <br /> interesting film in the fascinating career of Ben Chaplin. As an average British actor, he photographed the Hollywood treadmill with this film. He is inconspicuous and his anonymity in studio productions is not surprising, although he appeared in the two later Terence Malick films in big cameos. Uma Thurman makes a true autopilot, and Michael Lehmann packs everything together competently. Icky phone sex. 4.10
