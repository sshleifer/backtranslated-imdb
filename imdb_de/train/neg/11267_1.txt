OK. So there are not really many great movies. New gems like American Dream, The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 are usually not that close. But boy (!) Balances this movie of quality. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what these people thought. Are the financiers in this world so easy to convince to finance such a shit of ****? I can see it right now ... <br /> <br /> Producer - "So we have Joe Fiennes, he's cute as a button and was pretty good at Shakespeare in Love and we have Rhys Ifans, who's not cute but cool in Notting Hill, mix us in a really mediocre score, some memorable post-Britpop songs, hemlock root and lizard brains and believe me, it's going to be a tough job for the next thousand years to do such a bad thing. "<br /> <br /> The Bank -" I like it! Any unnecessary sex? Bad camera shifts? And what? about the worst accents this side of Devil's Own? "<br /> <br /> Producer - "Yes, we have many of them." <br /> <br /> The Bank - "Sounds good, where do we sign?" <br /> <br /> Please.
