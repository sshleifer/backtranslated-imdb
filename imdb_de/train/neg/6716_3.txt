The Fluffer may have strong elements of the porn industry - but that does not make the fact that it is rather shabbily judged and acted - and that with a very mediocre script. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing to think that the public offers this piece as an example of the state of the art in gay movies. <br /> <br /> Hopefully it has a limited lifespan in gay film festivals and allows a natural death to die on video. <br /> <br /> This film will open on the 10th of April 2002 the Queer Film Weekend in Brisbane It is heavily influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed at the previous cocktail party - she will need it.
