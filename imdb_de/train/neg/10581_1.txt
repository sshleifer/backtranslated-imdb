There was no original idea in this story. Topics were drawn from different sources; some are the ninth gate, in the mouth of madness (another Carpenter movie) and the ring. It even went so far as to show the same damn glowing circle from The Ring and use it as the film's namesake. The soundtrack of Cody Carpenter was almost lifted from Suspiria. Hopefully, nobody will resist this comment by whirling around the word HOMAGE. Yes, I saw that the theater was playing Argento's Deep Red. To demand a tribute would be a bullshit cop-out. This was the bottom of the barrel. If you throw gore and "disturbing" pictures into the pot, that's not a good horror movie. The carpenter knew that. He should forget or buy a time machine.
