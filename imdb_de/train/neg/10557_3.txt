It's a vile little production that causes headaches as well as nightmare. It's an unsightly mix of live action and ugly stop-motion animations. It's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, a strange journey that anyone could optimistically expect. It's the cold, inhumane, unkind, morbid, even weird sort of thing. There's absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney has done fantastic work with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall has done far more attractive things with stop-motion. Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, the stereotype that the French have no concept of uncanniness is enforced.
