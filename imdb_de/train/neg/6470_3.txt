Disney goes to the fountains too often, because anyone who has seen the original LITTLE MERMAID will obviously feel outwitted. To celebrate the birth of her daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan to introduce her to King Triton. The celebration is quickly crashed by Ursula's sister Morgana, who wants to use Melody as a defense to obtain the trident of the king. Ariel and Eric break off the attack and build a wall around the ocean while Melody wonders why she can not go there. <br /> <br /> Terrible and terrible describes this direct episode of the video. LITTLE MERMAID 2 makes you feel that everything you see comes directly from other Disney films. I think Disney can only plagiarize itself! Do not tell me that the penguin and the walrus do not remind you of another duo from the LION KING! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments are the rematch between Sebastien and Louie, the royal cook. They played it terribly! The peak between Morgana and ALLEN seemed to be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal anything, but in 75 minutes everything seemed incredibly tight and too much to handle. An embarrassment for Disney, LITTLE MERMAID 2 is better to rent and laugh. Then you can prepare for the rest of the sequels, where Disney will later drown you.
