This is a very cheap made Werwolffilm. The video is dark and poorly lit. The sound is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. The script is a clich√©-riddled junk with the usual characters like the tough detective firing werewolves with his silver pistol [filled with silver bullets, of course]. The drama is as wooden as the characters. The FX are absent, many extreme close-ups of werewolf claws and biting. The only thing that's shown is a lot of soft core T & A. Instead of dropping $ 30 for this trip, look at a really great new werewolf image: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
