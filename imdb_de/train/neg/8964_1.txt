Those who are familiar with the previous two Cube films know pretty well what to expect: a small group of people trapped in a pile of booby traps, paranoia, bad acting ... but this film is a bit different , About half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we can observe the people watching the people in the cube (or at least five of them). <br /> <br /> I think Cube Zero wants to explain that. You can deal with the cube, but you really do not experience much more than what was shown in the first two films. Sure, there is some kind of explanation, but it feels pretty lame, as suggested in the first movie. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero (like its predecessors) looks pretty cheap and the fact that it is so More than just a few empty rooms just shows that feeling. I was also pretty confident that there was no danger that any of the actors would receive awards in the foreseeable future. However, they have brought back the traps of Cube 1 (by that I mean they are almost the same, which is a bit of a pity). I know a lot of people know about it somehow I appreciate this movie and its ties to the first, but I just feel that this is a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that was not that great at first.
