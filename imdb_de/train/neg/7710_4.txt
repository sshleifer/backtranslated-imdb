"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" usually consists of shaky, poorly assembled material in search of a movie. The plot makes no sense and the different characters fall into the picture without explanation. If you look at this stupid parody, you feel that so many other comments have been so accurately recorded: that it's easy to make a cheap, inferior movie and then the "parody angle" as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality In a scene, female swimmers are afraid of tomatoes swimming in their vicinity. How far can "suspension of unbelief" go - even in a parody?). The title song is great, though. (* 1/2)
