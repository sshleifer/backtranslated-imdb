After I discovered the high rating at IMDb, I decided to watch this movie. In addition to this high rating, I deliberately avoided reading the reviews. I wanted to go to the theater with a clean slate, without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> Considering my rating you can see that I was disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager tried to keep him from entering the hotel room. When Enslin entered the room, I was ready for some scary things. <br /> <br /> First chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin responds credibly. He freaked out. I am encouraged and I think that will be fine. The people who made this movie know that less is more. <br /> <br /> But next is a big disappointment process. The subtlety is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun ... Just pop the audience into the book with every Hollywood scary trick and hope something works. Let's see, a clock radio that turns itself on? Well, that's always scary. Objects that move in space? Well, you can not complain about that. Blood dripping from the walls and sinking? Great. Ghosts committing suicide? Well. Anything else? How about loud noises, trembling, fire, more trembling, confusion in the room, more blood, etc., etc. It's all good. And everything has been done before. Overstimulate our attention deficit-undisturbed audience with all sorts of things in quick succession and they will not be able to look the other way. <br /> <br /> Well, it did not work for me. And do you still know something? When I see a horror movie in a theater, it is typical for several groups of girls to scream in fearful moments. But this movie did not have any scary moments. The audience was silent and uninterested. I did not feel cold on my back. Nothing. The Shining was 100 times what this movie tries to be. <br /> <br /> So, who are these people who say it's one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? Sorry, I just do not get it.
