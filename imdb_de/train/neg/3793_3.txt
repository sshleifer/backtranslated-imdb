The nutcracker has always been a bit of a problematic ballet. It bears little resemblance to ETA Hoffman's original story on which it is based. In the ballet, the story is essentially over in the second half when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the kingdom of Sweets to see a series of character dances. <br /> <br /> There is an infinite variety of stage productions that reinterprets the story in countless ways (not always successfully) to offset the ballet's weak libretto. <br /> Balanchine's version has no sense of drama or story at all (despite the fact that there is plenty of drama and mystery in Tchaikovsky's wonderful first-act music). The result is a completely forgotten Christmas party in the first half, when hardly anything happens and in which the dancing (the little that is there) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Especially Drosselmeier's pantomime over-function, which may look passable on stage, just looks stupid for the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when we come to the Kingdom of Sweets (Act 2 on stage) it does not look much better. Although there are a few choreographic highlights, most of the choreography is bland and boring. This is certainly not a classic Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I have always thought he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets. The reputation of this movie version of The Nutcracker's stage production has only confirmed this view.
