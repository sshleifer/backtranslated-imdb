When a little stinker of the space age lands on the earth, he soon consumes earthlings and increases. The only part of this pointless ride I enjoyed was all the cool vintage cars. This dog had so many holes that it could be cut and sold for Swiss cheese. This thing has actually made 20 million dollars? And McQueen's salary was 3K? All were heavily overpaid. The 'Monster' looked very much like a big beanbag, and the 'teenagers' looked like they could have children approaching their age. And those explosions from the shotgun; sounded like a pellet rifle with silencer. The end was pitifully banal; Obviously, the producers left the door open for a sequel ... and there were many. Thumbs down.
