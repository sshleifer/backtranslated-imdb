This film moves from the fourth to the first movie, without occupying third or second place, and drags gear up to the juicy b-movie finish line. The Con at the beginning is easily the best and smartest part of the movie. That is worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub is so fast that you might miss her. Definitely not worth the whole ballyhoo that Robert Osborne provides in his TCM intro to this mediocre average confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the characters of this supposed marginalized society turn out to be saints - especially the incredible character of Al. I wonder if he has a job in Cincinnati for me?
