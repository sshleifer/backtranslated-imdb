About half of me realized that these characters did not matter to me at all. But I still looked a little bit more. Unfortunately, I came back the next day and finished it. I should not have bothered. <br /> <br /> If you * know * something about the movie, you know that the main character will be a plane crash survivor - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of ​​what's going to happen afterwards - he will answer the phone and call people about it! That was almost as bad as "Snakes on a Plane" (another bad catastrophe movie in aviation). <br /> <br /> I know this is an old movie, and the acting style was less naturalistic than it is today. But even by these standards, the spectacle was embarrassing. These were not characters, but stereotypes. I suspect this movie was, more than anything else, an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband's career (Gary Merrill). Without success - I have seen that Eichen show more real emotions than he. Davis's happy cripple (ie a not glamorous role) was probably considered nervous and daring. Career It was not It was just boring. She was a kind of Tiny Tim in the movie, who made Trask (Merrill's character) recognize the truth about love and forgiveness (though she was less tiny than Tiny Tim), calmly calming down wisdom about life and relationships, without a hint that her beloved husband had just died. <br /> <br /> The last scene in which Trask calls his wife back to reconciliation in Iowa was so affected and exaggerated on both ends of the phone line that I almost shuddered. I had to remember that these people were actually paid for what they did in this movie. <br /> <br /> I noticed that many people seem to enjoy this movie. If you found it uplifting, that's great. But honestly, I just thought it was bad. There are many old movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood that were written and played much better.
