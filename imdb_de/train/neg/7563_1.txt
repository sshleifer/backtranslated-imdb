Unfortunately, this movie does not do the original well. Nicholas Cage, a pretty wide-ranging actor, gives the screen a whole range of skills that he does not like. The supporting cast is not better. <br /> <br /> The story remains very similar to the original, but much worse. Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to enter into what is being sold. It turns out that this is just an invoice with poor goods. The unbelief can not be lifted, nor can a doubt exist. The only savings aspect of this film is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and whoever should scout the location should be recommended. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of laughter in the audience and several boos, literally the end. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait for the original to appear on TV, pour in a whiskey and enjoy it.
