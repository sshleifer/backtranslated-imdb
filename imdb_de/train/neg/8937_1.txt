Generally I like horror movies, but unfortunately this fell out of the 1 pound bargain basket in the hands of my friends. We sat down to look at it, ready to be scared, and sprayed food everywhere we laughed so much. The concept is not so bad, but why they chose number ten would be happy that I do not know. The worst thing about the movie is the actors. The camera work was bad, the special effects are actually not bad if I am generous, but overall the story could not be linked at any level, as the actors were as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm. They were immeasurably made of wood, especially a young, fifty actor, fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as a government agent. He actually looked more like a schoolboy. There was a really amusing sex scene in which he looked like he was looking for apples, when a busty lady rode on him and later his diaper-sized pants were hysterical, but then it occurred to me that it should not be a comedy. I desperately break my brain to say something positive about this movie, apart from the occasional flash of breasts, but that just does not exist. Let's hope ten were the lucky number and they do not do any more. I am not sure if my ribs could carry them.
