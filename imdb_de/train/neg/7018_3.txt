Totally forgotten. Especially because of the weak action. This is the first movie I saw with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, it has been around since the late '90s. I thought he was a newcomer because his acting was so mild. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I've seen her well in other films, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not an actress who gives the character a fiery, emotional personality like Diane Keaton could, but it was strange to see her in whisper mode. It seemed like there was simply no good chemistry between the actors, and I think Diane Keaton sensed it too. She is a fantastic actress, but seemed a little over the top in this movie. It felt like she wanted to get this movie over with as quickly as possible. I would not blame her.
