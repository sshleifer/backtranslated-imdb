As soon as it hits a screen, it destroys all intelligent life forms in the environment! But on behalf of the producers, I have to say that it does not fall into a well-known movie category, it deserves a completely new name! It's a "neurological drama"! Every single neuron in a person's brain becomes sad and depressed. <br /> <br /> It's the closest thing to a stroke without suffering one. It makes you speechless, all your members go numb, your mouth opens and stays that way, and the strangest symptom of all is that you want to blind and numb yourself, kind of a "movie". <br /> <br /> The only word that comes to my mind after I finish my ordeal is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
