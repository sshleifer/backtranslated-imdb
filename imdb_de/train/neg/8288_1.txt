What a shame Alan Clarke has to be associated with this coach. But that does not exclude it; Bring together a group of Guys and Stellas and keep this time running and rolling around in tears of laughter on the floor. Great wasted nightwear. Al Hunter hosts a well-publicized late-'80s theme that hooligans were well-organized and did not really care about football itself - often with respectable jobs (estate agents ???). But how does Clarke convince us that any one of the two-bit actors who are turning away from other low-quality TV productions (Grange Hill) or soon to bad drama (Eastenders) can give the impression of a nanosecond, they are a tough football bat is ridiculous. Are we really to believe that the ICF (which of course is based on the drama) would even go to another city to fight only six guys? The ICF would oust subway stations and the like HUNDERTE Andy Nicholls' Scally must be read before even thinking about a story of this kind. The acting is awful and makes for the most laughs - Oldman is so amazing, the camp is amazing. Most of them look as if they should be in a Mr. Matey bath. A real inspiration for anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a bargain.
