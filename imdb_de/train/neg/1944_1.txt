I grew up with Scooby doo all my life. My father grew up with Scooby doo. We've just seen the first episode of The Travesty, which calls itself Shaggy and Scooby and gets a hint. Which planet are Warner-Bros, which let this chaos in the air. The figures could have been better drawn by my younger sister. The story could have been better written by my three year old cousins ​​(who are also Scooby Doo fans). Scooby and Shaggy are just not !!!!! If anyone but Shaygy's voice is doing the voice of Shaggy, it will not work, folks! Trust me. <br /> <br /> This program was a shame. What's new? Scooby Doo is much better. Why change a winning format? Get that piece of garbage and go back to the real Scooby
