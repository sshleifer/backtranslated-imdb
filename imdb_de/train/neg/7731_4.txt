The comparison may be unfair, but inevitable. Those attracted to the intimacy and depth of the Umbrellas will be a little appalled when they discover a cut-and-paste musical in the American style - awkward, stilted dialogue with inexplicable song and dance numbers. Gene Kelly's French accent was apparently so bad that a dreadful synchronization was replaced (as you'll recall, the synchronization in Umbrellas was almost perfectly subtracted). The translation of French (for subtitle versions) leaves much to be desired, although this is not attributable to Demy. The film also has some self-assured moments that seem a bit confusing, like references to songs on LeGrand itself. And the costumes - well, the tight combination of pants and white boots and the unusually unnatural colors are reminiscent of an Austin Powers movie , , <br /> <br /> But Demy rewards the viewer with allusions to umbrellas; Note, for example, the suitcase that Maxence carried with him when leaving Rochefort - this is the same suitcase that Guy took with him on his departure from Cherbourg. Also note the "Convenient Brunette of Resolution" - Madeleine in Umbrellas and Josette in Young Girls. <br /> <br /> In general, those who expect the natural feel of Umbrellas (except for the floating bike scene) or are looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in Umbrella's script should probably go through them. Those looking for a French version of a thin American musical from the 60s will be very happy.
