Amateurism best describes the adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "The Celestine Prophecy," which follows the spiritual awakening of an unemployed teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Home video quality actors present so-called characters spitting out revised exposure and metaphysical hokum while the film is driven by the extremely harsh storyline of Armand Mastroianni. Even though there are visible attempts to match the astonishing proportions of ABC's "Lost" or Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code" and find interesting fans, the filmmakers are barely doing the job justice. This film stinks of ill-conceived spiritual propaganda for mass consumption and the results are so terrible that few can wipe through this mess to see a real point.
