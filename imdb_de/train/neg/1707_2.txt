and a budget of $ 30,000 and this movie still looks like it was made for $ 50. You can tell from the first frame to the last frame that he did not care about the continuity of the movies or the plot, he was just happy to make a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> What the end result shows is a lazy filmmaker who loves zombie movies. It could have been great if he had only given a care. The end result is an endless zoom on poorly executed gore and even more poorly produced metal games about it. What happens when you combine high hopes, big dreams, a reasonable budget, hard work and one idiot behind the camera.
