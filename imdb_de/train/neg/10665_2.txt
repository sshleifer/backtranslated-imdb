After about three minutes I started the fast-forward and paused only during the nudity (why are bad movies always so good-looking women?). In ten minutes I was done and wished I could get my money back from the rental. The people writing these films should be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come on, writers - the bad guys ALWAYS climb with the bomb, which is activated by the remote control of the good man! This is how it has been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! To insult the injury, the "twist" in the end was so formal that it came from any action movie written in the last 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should focus on real films. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - Run away! Run away!
