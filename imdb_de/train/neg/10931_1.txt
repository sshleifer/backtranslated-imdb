I saw this movie with low expectations and thought it was a nice piece of fluff. Unfortunately it was not even like that. I could hardly sit through the movie without wanting to go out. I was with my two children (10 and 13 years old) and asked again and again: "How much longer?" After I had finished, I wondered again and again who would approve this script. Even the reliable Fred Willard could not save the banal dialogue, the state jokes and the banal conspiracy. I would suggest that anyone who has written and directed this film (I use the term loosely) should take online screenwriting lessons or attend film lessons at its local community college. At least there are many books on directing, screenwriting, and producing movies that teach them about structure, plot, dialogue, and tempo.
