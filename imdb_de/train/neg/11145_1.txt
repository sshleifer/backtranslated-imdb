Where should one start? , , , I feel hurt! That's right, hurt! I've just spent 1.5 hours of my life, 1.5 hours I could have done something more useful, like drying paint, not dramatic for this so-called horror movie, it's not an action, it's nothing ... <br /> <br /> It's predictable, it's boring, it's tragic ... <br /> <br /> I could be a bit tough here, but beware In this movie, you feel the same way ... or ... no, do not watch the movie unless you also feel hurt.
