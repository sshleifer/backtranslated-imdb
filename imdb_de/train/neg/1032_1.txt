Although I have never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (due to its terrible production values), it seems like Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap that Hanna-Barbera brought us! No doubt Scrappy-Doo is the most annoying and horrible character created for children (including the Teletubbies and the Tommy tapeworm). Whose idea was to create a kind of short mutant dog that would allow him to talk and then saddle the Scooby Doo characters ?! Who it is deserves to die or to watch this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog just is not annoying, annoying and annoying - and that's only in the BETTER episodes !! After many years, it would have been better to end the franchise than to create this mess! I can see why the villain Scrappy-Doo was made in the live-action movie Scooby-Doo - because almost everyone hates him!
