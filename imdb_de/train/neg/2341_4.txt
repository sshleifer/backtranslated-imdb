Okay ... it seems like only the Barman fans have commented on this film so far - time for a counterpoint. Attention, this article is * LONG *. <br /> <br /> For those who do not know (mostly the non-Belgians): Tom Barman, director of this film, is the front man of dEUS, one of the better-known rock bands of the late '90s here in Belgium. In fact, they made some very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly became nationally famous. Then the egos began to hurt and the band basically broke apart, and Barman and a few others still had to do under the dEUS-monicker albums. As always happens in such cases, PostEuration dEUS was much tamer and less interesting than the original. They tried to make an international breakthrough in 1999 with their album "The Ideal Crash" and presented a much watered down form of their earlier songwriting style. They did not quite make it. However, the egos were still quite large, it seems Barman was big enough to see himself as an artist for films. <br /> <br /> Mostly this kind of thing is a VERY big mistake, and this movie is no exception. And Barman decided clearly for * art *, another very big mistake. For one, he is a musician, not a director. On the other hand dEUS is the best fun and provocative music, but never something close to what I would consider * art *. It shows. <br /> <br /> What is this movie about? Basically, it tells the story of a group of completely uninteresting people who do uninteresting things in the course of a completely uninteresting Friday in Antwerp, since they do even less interesting things when they are uninteresting. The characters are flat, the plot completely pointless, and the movie simply has no other redeeming qualities to compensate for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole movie made me smile (a little) about 3 times and actually managed to provoke a single 5 second laugh (not quite loud). Mood? The movie does not seem to show any emotions or feelings. Secret? Well, (* MINOR SPOILER *) The idea of ​​the "windman", who inspired the name of the movie, is as intriguing as a banana pepper pizza - not much and has been done a thousand times before (everyone remembers Johny Destiny) - one of Tarantino's worst performances yet) (* END MINOR SPOILER *). And well, it's * artistic *, so do not expect any real action to catch up with the previous one. In other words, except for a few smiles, it bored me out of my shorts. <br /> <br /> So what's left? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, although it suffers from the same problems that other OSTs have recently shown: First, the movie looks like a commercial for the CD. Second, it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs, which just does not work. In the end, the movie only looks like an illustration for the songs. And unfortunately, it is Barman's own contribution to the soundtrack that attracts the most attention, though for me that is the weakest part of the entire soundtrack. All in all, Barman knows more about music than about movies. The camera work is fine too, but nothing that would make you scream for joy. <br /> <br /> The only thing I noticed about this movie was the sight-seeing factor. Since I'm from Antwerp, it was fun to play a kind of "local exchange". However, I would hardly consider that a quality. <br /> <br /> All in all, another chance lost to the flemmish movie. I notice time and time again that the best Belgian films have come from the French part of the country lately. The main reason is that they at least have something to tell and manage to tell it in a way that is both sharp and emotional (the Daerden brothers come to mind). Perhaps the Flemish arthouse filmmakers should try that as well.
