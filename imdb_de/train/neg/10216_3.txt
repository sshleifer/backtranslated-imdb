STRANGER THAN FICTION annoyed me so much that I signed in to IMDb to write this review. STRANGER THAN FICTION is a surprisingly complex, touching and thought provoking film right up to the end. Once you've had several logical delays (why did not Will Ferrell hear Emma Thompson's voice ten years ago when she started writing her book?) "The phone rang, the phone rang again." .) the film demands its own thoughts about mortality, fate and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The short history of literary topics by Dustin Hoffman was intended primarily to entertain former English majors. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure, even if Will Ferrell could just as easily be an ax-murderer as a bumble-bee soul. Her quick faith in him is a great leap in faith. <br /> <br /> Ah, but the end. Until the end, I would have given this movie 9 out of 10 stars. Film as a metaphor for the journey of life, as a tribute to the notion of "writing true," as a reminder that great literature is either a comedy or a tragedy, but not both, is outstanding. The entire film leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of Will Ferrell's fate. And no matter how gracious a character he has become, we know exactly why we will accept the end. The last act is executed, the screen turns white, the credits are rolled. A profound and powerful conclusion of an almost perfect movie. An end that has been discussed for weeks. <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!! No loans rolled Say it's not like that. Suppose Hollywood did not make another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermines the integrity and heart of the movie. Dustin Hoffman got it right when he said, "It's not a masterpiece anymore, it's alright." A fitting review of the movie. It was not okay except me. I was so offended by the treachery of 'writing true' about the decision to smuggle the film that I actually burst into angry tears explaining it on the way home from the movie. I do not cry often. Most movies might interest me less, but I'm still angry. <br /> <br /> My questions to Zack Helm, the author, are: Is the original movie over when the screen turned white? And had you been compelled by the dark movie forces to put an end to things that did not do justice to the core of the movie? Or did you put this Maudlin on its own? I read that you are brilliant. I hope your original script finished the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> I know that Zack Helm will never see this review, and I could not find a contact person for him to ask for myself. But, please, movie-goers, am I the only one who feels that way about STRANGER THAN FICTION? One good thing came from me when I saw this movie: I now admire LOST IN TRANSLATION twice.
