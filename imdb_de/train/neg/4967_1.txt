Scifi has been extremely unlucky lately when it comes to producing high quality movies (like Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is said to be based on the great epic Beowulf, but deviates so much (and offers in comparison to so little) that the advertising on television could call it a "crappy Christopher Lambert movie". I did not expect it to be exactly like a Hollywood production, but I expected that "artistic integrity" would not bother the actual story (even if it changed a bit to allow a two-hour storyboard to flow into the assigned ones time slots). <br /> <br /> Did the director and producers have any idea of ​​what they were doing (did they investigate this?). Of course not, as you can see from the massive horned helmets worn by Beowulf and his crew (except the mullet boy). One major problem I had, however, was Grendel's appearance if Beowulf wrestled him, should he not be sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? Even Grendels death segment was missing in every way? In my opinion, the epic was actually better than the printed trash in the script; For example: Grendel should have torn off the arm of Beowulf ?? not cut off at the forearm after being set alight by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300 pounds! And Grendel's mother? At the end of the epic, did you associate her with the dragon, where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds? And honestly, what the hell was wrong with this mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie because it's related to the epic? ... not because there really is no one (except character name). I can only recommend this film if you liked the movie Druids (by Jacques Dorfmann)? although I recommend not to look at it.
