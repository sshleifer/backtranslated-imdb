All of them turn Disney into a movie that surprises everyone. One that wonders you until the end. In the tradition of the Pirates of the Caribbean, this film is sure to turn into a ghost and kill and rape your village. It is terrible. If you want a pointless, pointless, predictable action movie, just keep going. I believe that young children can enjoy it, if they want it, if WELL ALWAYS wins. But I like movies where it's a downer who will win. This movie never lets the Bad Guys have the upper hand. In the end, when the heroes are in an "inevitable" pit, they just know they can come out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, he never has to think about a puzzle or clue for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex it is. Watch this movie if you want to see impressive scenery, not if you want to see good acting or a good movie. Watch a Superman movie that would be much shorter and the kids want it more. For example, the scene in which Cage flees from armed men, and the bullets are all diverted through the railing of a fire escape. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just ONE LITTLE POLE) This movie shows the decay of movies and the movie industry into cheap jokes and boring, unrealistic action that this movie delivers in large numbers.
