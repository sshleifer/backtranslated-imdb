Right now I'm debating whether to take a look at this movie's "Poppycock" again. They had a pretty interesting idea with the buried movie set, and that was it. So far, this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There is the buried set, a wolf monster running amok, an amulet, and a lot of vicious actors being attacked by the wolf, whatever he is. What I would have missed if I had the common sense to utter this nonsense is a chased hunting in the dune hunt. Apart from the original idea, this movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities. My mistake, that I continue to watch. - MERK
