Terrible spectacle of Potter and a flat, tensionless plot. And as for the feminist polemic, that's ridiculous. I saw this trash when it was first released, and although I found it unimaginably boring, I'm glad I saw it. I now have an immediate answer to the question, "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" I also have the comfort of knowing that every movie I see for the rest of my life will be better than The Tango Lesson. But I have to admit that I was impressed by the way Potter wrote a script that would bring in the maximum number of art scholarships from around the world (as shown in the finals). I've recently seen Orlando, and I can See how Potter learned the wrong lessons from this movie. All it took was a pair of frilly-costumes, a few hard looks from the lead actress, and a laid-back plan to bring the movie to the public. Why should not she think she could get away with the self-indulgent nothing like The Tango Lesson?
