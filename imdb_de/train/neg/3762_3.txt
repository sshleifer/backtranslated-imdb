I got this movie out of blockbuster on one of those shelves where you can get 5 movies for $ 20. I have to say, I have brought my money to this value. I had expected terrible dialogues, fucking monsters and shaky cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, two out of three are not bad. <br /> <br /> Acting is bad, though not as bad as in some movies I've seen. Or maybe I've seen so many low-budget movies lately that I lost perspective. There are some places where acting is downright horrible, but mostly it's at least high school play. <br /> <br /> The CG for the Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed that another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man in a monkey suit would have been better. Chunky stop-motion animations would have looked better. <br /> <br /> So you're wondering why I call the CG the second worst part. Because the worst part of the movie are the sound effects. They are loud, annoying and constant. I've camped, I know how insects sound in the woods at night, and even though they can be loud, they're not stunned like the cacophony in this movie. Normally, if the "background" drowns out the dialogue of the film, that is a bad thing, but I have not missed much of what I have learned from the dialogue of this film. <br /> <br /> The action was rare and boring. The tension was absent, as was the feeling of empathy of the characters. Speaking of the characters, they were all cookie cutter and bland. The only mild side play was between ... I can not think of anything. There were a line or two that made me smile a pale smile, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was decent, a foot or two above what you normally see in a movie like this one. However, it still had the "home theater" quality that you get with pocket-changing movies and a prayer. <br /> <br /> If you're like me, taking advantage of the cheapest budget genre kicks, and you see them in the dollar bucket, you should think about it. Otherwise stay away at any cost.
