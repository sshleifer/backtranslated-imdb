There's a word for this kind of movie, and that word is "drifting". It was dizzy when it was a VHS rental, and it was now driven on satellite repeats. <br /> <br /> It might deceive you, because it has 2 moderately well-known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, decent soundtrack music and a beautiful landscape in Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> It also has a woman with curly hair who fights a lot. <br /> <br /> If that's all you expect from a movie, then maybe that will keep you happy. <br /> <br /> However, it is still dizzy.
