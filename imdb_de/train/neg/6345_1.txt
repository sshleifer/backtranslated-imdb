This movie is just an excuse for the author to make a movie out of two failed scripts. <br /> <br /> The characters are just a collection of characters with clich√©s, tragic or comical attributes whose sum resembles neurotic dialogue. Only Woody Allen could write. Woman loves that because it's like looking in the mirror so they'll probably enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy this movie because there was no chase and the movie had no fights. There were no drug lords or Gang Banger either. Not to mention a lack of snakes. This movie had no snakes. Not my cup of tea and maybe not your ether. So think about what I said before you watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not look like a woman, you have weight problems, men enjoy sex and the city and McBeal alliance makes sense to you.
