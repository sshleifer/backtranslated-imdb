Basically, this is a couple who wants to adopt a second child. At the adoption agency they meet a mouse (Stuart) and they decide to adopt him. If you think that's stupid, hold it because it's getting worse. Stuart comes to his new home where he is treated like a human child. (Protect me!) The rest is pretty much the usual cliché, about family problems, jealousy of the older "brother", and in the end all the problems are solved and they are all a "happy family". As boring and exhausted as that is, it is also shown in a blunt and uncomplicated way. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the director thought he was creative by putting a mouse in the cliché. or he's just been trying to fill minutes, but he's just gotten the stereotype from boring to repulsive. <br /> <br /> Why did I give a 3 and not a zero? Because of the family cat that Stuart loves as much as the "brother". And because of some funny performances in which Stuart makes good use of his small size. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think the movie would work reasonably well if: a. Stuart was a PET and not a "sibling". b. She'd gone to the funny gigs, like Stuart trying to outsmart the cat, and left out boring clichés that had nothing to do with anything else.
