This is the saddest collection of clich√©s lined up in a straight line, with no apparent conspiracy or any decent way to act that I've seen for a long time. Scenes from Star Wars, Kingdom of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter were cannibalized and the spectator war was eradicated. Was this movie good? It was not a movie at all! <br /> <br /> Even though it's not so funny to be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy, the movie laughs. The trick is to place the copied scenes in the context of their original films. Gandalf can be funny when talking Korean. The basilisk looks like a snake when compared to a kitten, and the evil henchman can be a lot of fun switching back and forth between Sauron and Jaja-bing. <br /> Conclusion: Any pleasure from this movie arises, depends entirely on the state of the noise and the imagination of the audience, not the director / author. Shame on you, Shim!
