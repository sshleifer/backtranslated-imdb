This movie was more of a disappointment. After the very slow, very intense (and rather bloody) beginning, the movie begins to lose it. Too much plot leaves too little time for explanations, and when I came out of the theater, I wondered what it was all about. The characters remain flat, the story is not convincing at all, most of it is Déja Vù stuff with no parody hints, and there are some very cheesy parts. Of course it is night and it is raining and he has to do it alone ... yawn! Or The Manifestation of Evil: "Nazis" plus "Genetic Manipulation" ... Wow, that's really original. There are a few nice things, like the fistfighting scene, the mountain views and some (running) gags, but (though Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can), this is definitely not worth it. (3 out of 10)
