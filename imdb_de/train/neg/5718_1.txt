There was no characterization in this film and really shows how much this talentless hacker who directed this film has to learn his craft. All of his characters in this movie were so unlikely and I could not care less. The best point in this movie was the credits and hours of showering afterwards, because I felt so damn dirty that I wasted money on that stinking load. Hey Genius ... Triads and Yakuza are from two different places and learn about the Asian culture. The dog scene in this felt so attached and useless. This DVD proves to be useful. I love my new coaster. <br /> <br /> So children do not waste their money on this crap-hostel.
