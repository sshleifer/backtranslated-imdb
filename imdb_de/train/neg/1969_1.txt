I've just watched this movie and I have to say that although some effort was initially made to produce a decent movie, it was absolutely terrible - but not in the sense that was meant, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> It was as if a child were addressing this insult to the intelligence, believing that all potential viewers are idiots or extremely difficult for conversation or both. Thank god for the fast forward! I can not imagine what kind of viewer the producer had on this movie. I mean, you have actors who are trying to be serious, if not so, and a script that screams for a complete rewrite ... I just can not say it anymore. If Harlequin Romance has chosen horror films, it would be a good effort. If you find this movie entertaining, then I strongly recommend that you look for instructions on how to shoot for a movie. There are much better prices out there. Join a club, READ THE REVIEWS, but above all, avoid crap like this.
