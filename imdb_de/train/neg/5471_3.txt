Typically, Troma-Trash, this smutty 80s movie is considered one of the "highlights" of Lloyd Kaufman's famous production studio, along with "The Toxic Avenger," which was released a year earlier. "The Toxic Avenger" is far better if you ask me, but this crazy splatter movie is still bearable. Just make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door. The events take place in Tromaville, a small town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world, and they certainly do not lie. Safety at the local nuclear power plant is inferior, to say the least (even Homer Simpson has never been casual) and toxic waste invades nearby high schools. The first drunken victim is the stereotypical nerd who begins to spew green matter from all his body cavities, but it is believed his death is an accident because he had no fewer than two microwave ovens in his house! Oh, the humanity! Shortly thereafter, however, the nuclear leaks also affect the weeds plantation of the school and the thing really starts to get messy. After smoking a joint at a party, the cutest couples in the school produce a giant worm monster that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage scum. "Class of Nuke 'em High" is a horror film at its best. The dialogues are so stupid that they hurt your ears and make-up effects that give the word a completely new meaning. If you like to melt, chop or halve, this is definitely a must! Unlike the aforementioned "The Toxic Avenger," this film suffers from some really boring and extra-long moments when nothing really important happens, such as when Chrissy and Warren find out what's wrong with their hormones. The rough humor is not as effective as in "Toxic Avenger" and the acting is unforgivably amateurish. Continue only if you are an avid Troma fanatic.
