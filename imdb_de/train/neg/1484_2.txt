Please do not rent or do not even think about buying this movie. They do not even have it in the red box, which would cost a dollar & I think it's worth less. The main reason why I rented this d movie was because Jenna Jameson is in the movie lol between 2-5 min. I'll admit that the movie had hot girls and a lot of nudity, but otherwise you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing no one you know. Ginger Lynn has more acting time in this film than Jenna and she is not even on the cover of the movie or her name to see the time. This movie is a big disappointment and a huge waste of time.
