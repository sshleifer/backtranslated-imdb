I can go through the movie once, but I doubt I could do it a second time. Easy to entertain, mainly because of the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon (thinking a little bit about Mary) and the reappearance of a seriously acting actor Michael Keaton. This is not the funny trumpet The Love Bug, but it can be seen. One of my main drawbacks from the movie was the fact that Herbie had become R2D2 antics. I was bored with the headlight's eye effects, the second time they were used about 30 times, and the curved front fender caused the same reaction from me. Look at this with your little ones, d. H. With the "single-digit bracket," and do not expect much from this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
