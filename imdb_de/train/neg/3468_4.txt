A student filmmaker asks a B-class actress (a delicious diva MOLLY RINGWALD!) To complete the horror film that her mother (a terribly boring Kylie Minogue!) Wanted to shoot 12 years ago. To say the least, it's a curious choice, as every Australian horror fanatical knows that the genre is missing from female directors. The film has a curse because Molly had to kill a psycho-killer on the original set. But she is back because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately the curse is still there and people are starting to die on the set. Cut is an Aussie attempt by the modern Slasher, but unfortunately it does not bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, it rips apart half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. Many movie world names dropping a la "Scream" (except the Aussie name dropping - Jane Campion ... see how that is not so funny) and many "Is this really or is this a movie"? la "New Nightmare". The cut is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are ridiculous, almost everything is bad. Fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: Once a well-dressed girl in the film crew tells the owner of the house where they are filming, "Do not worry, we treat your house as if it was our own" on that he answers, "that does not mean anything to me, you look like you live in a dump!" Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough to not regret it. "You have a Diet Coke here somewhere?" (as she rides in the film professor's car) and "Does anyone know where I can buy tofu?" (the first thing she mutters on the set) and "Where the hell is my agent?" (Oh, wait, I thought that for her.)
