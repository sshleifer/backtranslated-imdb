I am glad that the IMDb people were able to find out in which genre this film fits. I suspected it was a comedy, but since it also seems to be a dark and serious melodrama, I was not sure. For a comedy, it's amazing that even the slightest entry into the realm of humor is missed - to the ridiculous "twist" ending, which confirms what a waste of time the whole movie actually is. It's hard to describe how amateurish THE HAZING really is. Did anyone involved in this movie have any idea what he should do? It really pays off to look at the screen in disbelief at how horrible it is.
