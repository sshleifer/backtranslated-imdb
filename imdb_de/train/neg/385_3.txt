Badly written conspiracy drama / mystery about the possibility of AIDS being publicized by the government. Wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers - that would be hard to find for anyone within this foggy conspiracy. Although cinematography is praiseworthy in its own right, the camera starves for characters with true depth rather than flat, amateur acting, which unfortunately has to convey them. Note: D +
