I saw this movie on the grounds that Amber Benson is rocking and Nick Steel is generally pretty cool - I figured any movie with two actors I like and respect would not be all bad. And in that sense, I was right - considering the terrible dialogue they have given, they both work quite well. Not good enough to keep the movie from sucking, you know, but good enough that I could make it through the 75 minutes of the movie (and that's the main sign of a horrible movie: when you see you after 40 minutes) already, that it is over). <br /> <br /> It's hard to know where to start with the problems in "taboo". Dialogue is, as I said, appalling. made of wood and completely unnatural. January Jones' acting is unbelievably bad, and since she is the character we spend most of our time in the house, this is an unforgivable mistake. The plot manages to be so complicated that it does not make sense while at the same time being so clich√©d that it is completely predictable (literally, none of the big "twists" in this movie would surprise anyone but a toddler). Apart from a few interesting shots, the director tries too much with little success, impractical camera shots and annoying camera work that distracts from the small element of the story. Three of the stars of this film are excellent for the fact that it contains Amber Benson, and the last one is thrown in on the grounds that one of the jokes made me giggle a bit. I would never recommend this movie to anyone under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
