Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of the guys from the past who seem pretty forgettable. I never thought his show was that great. This is his one-dimensional characterization of a criminal chief with very predictable results. If you take the chases and take the general raid, there is not much plot development or action. I find mafia films boring because I have no respect or interest in ordinary criminals and their actions. Hollywood and in this case Italian cinema treat these guys as heroes. I have seen the movie and will not remember it in a few days. Many shots, innocent bystanders die, treachery, and that sick loyalty. The film is pretty well photographed and the drama is decent. But the synchronization is so bad (due to voices that just could not come out of those bodies) that I almost looked for Godzilla approaching the bay.
