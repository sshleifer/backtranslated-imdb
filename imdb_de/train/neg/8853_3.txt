In the first howl, we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized. The plot in this movie made sense. A television reporter examines this and tries to uncover the truth. She has to kill many of them, including her friend who becomes one. Then she shows the world that she exists by transforming herself on live television. The special effects were just ridiculous in the first movie and do not get any better in this movie. Be it the transformation or the evil dolls or the cheesy computer graphics that shows the superpowers. <br /> <br /> The plot is not so bad; You have to kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason. This will not destroy all werewolves and will not really end the werewolves threat, because it ... they just want to kill them. I think there was a sad reason for that, but it's really lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the movie "ends," we have a 10-minute overview of the movie we just saw, and every other scene is where the female werewolf leader demolishes her top and her big ones Breasts uncovered while a devo-bubbly band plays in front of a crowd of werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie worth seeing is Christopher Lee.
