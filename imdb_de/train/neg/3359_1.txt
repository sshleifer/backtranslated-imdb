You messed up this story! In the end, Nell is anything but heroic and has to stand up for the team to save all butt from Hill House and so nonsense! They added heads that were hacked, wires that cut people's faces, and the blanket became a giant hand! What is this about ??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original movie and the book are so great is that it scares you so much without showing your mind. There is no wound. There is no ceiling hand. It's just the ghost display of how ghosts can really kill a human. They can not kill us, they can not throw us across the room or throw a knife in our heads. You can only drive us crazy. Take away all our safety senses. Nell was a selfish woman. She just wanted good things for herself. Yes, she cared a little for the others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont made a noise in this great story! I hate this damned remake!
