It starts with a nice touch, just to dwindle quickly and lower expectations. The characters of Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) are not properly built before Mac's boss decides to meet him with three stewardess. The rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations that sometimes seem forced. <br /> <br /> About the cast, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor whom I thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook. Akshay Kumar is bearable, John Abraham is very bad about stumbling furniture and Rajpal Yadav is the only saving grace in the movie. <br /> <br /> The second half of the movie is sometimes funny, but in all DUDs (songs are boring) and disappointed when it comes to healthy entertainment and comedy.
