This is an art film shot in either 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says in 1969 and IMDb in 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the movie definitely seems to be very indicative of this general era - with some camera work and pop art styling that is purely late '60s to early' 70s. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three simple pictures that are distorted with different, crazy camera ticks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or action. This was obviously intended as a kind of performance art, and like most performance art, it is initially interesting, but quickly becomes tiring. The film, to put it more clearly, is totally boring and would not appeal to anyone except maybe those who made the film, their family and friends, and maybe a few people who are just too hip and "so with" us mortals to be understood.
