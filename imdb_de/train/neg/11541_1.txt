This movie is the worst I have seen in the last 5 years. It's surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie have accepted to trade in such worthless garbage. The film is rape / revenge and revenge. A couple went to the party and on the way back they hit a deer and he finished it when a jeep full of bad guys comes. He did not go to her car, instead he was kicked and punched well while she tried to run the car engine that betrayed her, and she was raped by a gang. Then she is somehow in her father's house and one of the bad guys is her neighbor so she took the gun and wanted to kill him ... So stupid scenario! Bellow Hollywood! He was against this revenge, but "She's being raped." "They're laughing at her," so she has to kill them all ... But once she was in the house, she was content to push the rifle shell into evil guys and leave away while he went crazy and execute bad guy. I personally believe that the director runs out of money before he finishes the movie because the movie ends before he executes all the others involved in this gang rape and beatings. LoL This movie is not even intended for people who enjoy watching rape because they do not see anything they are looking for ... This director should be banned ... It is for the annoyance that this garbage dump through British film art I personally like and that's why I saw that. Do not do it yourself. You have better things to do than film stupid scenarios ...
