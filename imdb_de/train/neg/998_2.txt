It's pretty bad if the generic movie overview contains more information than the movie itself. The paragraph-length "plot summary" that was written on the movie page contains details I could not extract from the actual movie. I found myself constantly in the background to see what details I had just missed, what could tell me what the (beep) was. Unfortunately, to no avail - this movie omits monstrous parts of the story, if you could call it a story. It's like trying to convince us that there is a kind of film here that is filming so much that it resembles a story and leaves the rest to our imagination. Newsflash to the creators: I've paid to make a movie. I can sit at home and imagine plots and storylines for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is someone I've never paid enough attention to to put the name in the face, and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial appearances I've ever seen for a lead actor in a movie, A or B. I thought it was good, maybe she did not really want the role, she just got an extensive offer for a movie she was not in? Not correct. She was listed as one of the producers. The next time you produce something, you should not book as a lead if you can not trade. If you can really do it, then create a decent character that you can become. Someone also mentioned white / Latino - yes, I hate to say it, but this movie acts as an act of revenge against white college-aged men wearing baseball caps. This happens when the movie is nothing that can excite Latino characters. The Adrian character looks like a playful idiot who is no better than the opponent of history. She did not seem like a real person to the Mayan figure. At least I am ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was even made.
