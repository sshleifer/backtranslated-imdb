Christ, oh Christ ... You look dumbfounded, incredulous, and possibly confused, as this shabby exercise unfolds in a lazy filth with all the wit and skill of an injured Galapagos tortoise. Can this be something? Is this film actually existing or was I the ignorant guinea pig of a shadowy international drug company sipping my coffee, unaware that he had been spiked with a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of movies and a lot of bad movies, but nothing prepared me for that; In the end, I was a wheezy, wheezing wreck, ripping my teeth like a dog on the carpet, scratching the walls and howling until my lungs were sore. I desperately prayed for mercy (to which this appeal was addressed, I do not know) and longed for a burning desire for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro. Sweet weeping Jesus, the memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm the most vulnerable, when I'm least able to handle it. I shudder, I tear in tears, I bite my fingernails until my hands are covered in blood, but I can not quite banish the horrible flashbacks from my head. I'm being persecuted I'm damaged I'm a man's tank. <br /> <br /> The other user comments here suggest that I'm not alone with this horrible experience that can only mean one of two things: a) the movie does indeed exist, or b) I'm just a victim among the legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is really crazy is that some people seemingly enjoyed their ordeal or at least were not traumatized by it. Maybe they are part of the operation. Damn it, the maniacs! God damn, they all to hell !!!!!!
