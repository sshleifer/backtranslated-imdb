Loving the original "Caligula" despite all its shortcomings, this remake trailer was awful. <br /> <br /> Jovovich says in this lazy American accent, "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." I'm sick The set does not look Roman at all ... It looks like a Hollywood mansion of a rich actor, and the Roman costumes look like cheap crap that you can buy in a suburban home. <br /> <br /> The "charming" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Hispanic-American, terrified as if she did not know it was a movie trailer. <br /> <br /> Acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. Most of the lines I hear are random actors who yell "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" as loud and unpleasantly annoying as possible. <br /> <br /> The random sex scenes filled well 40 or 50% of the trailer and the scenes with notable actors / actresses like Gerard Butler (who decorates the screen) shadows for every three and a half seconds) they do nothing but seem uncomfortable or go over the edge with their minimal lines and simply pull it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery. <br /> <br /> Courtney Love's Part of it is that she looks like she's just a normal dumb crack-whore self, leaning against a door that murmurs over the moon or something. You can not say it because she is either drunk or tall or just mumbles idiotically. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just annoying ... laughing by chance and yelling so that she irritates you. <br /> <Helen Mirren ... she was original, and her return to "Caligula" consists of ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I "love" especially (and with love I hate) Ennias line: "Caligola ... j00 no maki me * something incoherent * .... * something that sounds like j00nalo *" "It is also very arrogant, The Year of Reign was greater than Jesus' birth and death, this is the worst, most exploited, selfishly arrogant, "art" bitch I've ever seen, even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula not to show up or give his name to this bastard, no matter how much they paid him (unless it was a trillion trillion yen) worst trailer ever.
