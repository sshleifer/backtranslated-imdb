This film is different from the usual "wonders of the human body" documentaries in that it boldly, albeit bizarrely, decides to elicit disgust from the viewer. In one scene, the camera approaches a gigantic 50-foot model while a teenager squeezes pus and liquid out of it. In another case, the camera is half submerged in a swamp of half-digested food and stomach acid, while portions of a pasta salad fall off the esophagus and fall into the cudgel. In a concluding act of strength, the camera takes the viewer on a shattering ride through a forest of youthful armpit hair. Unfortunately, I do not do anything about it. Watch this movie if you have to, but bring your vomit bag with you and do not have any pasta salad before.
