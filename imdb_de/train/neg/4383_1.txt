The worst Bob Hope comedy ever (and that includes strong competition). Hope, on an island with sailors, dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl "steering his ship". Someone has certainly driven this Hope hacker over the cliff, as it contains Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and still can not stand a laugh or excitement. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need him?
