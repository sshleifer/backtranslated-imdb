It's funny. I have seen a number of Fassbinder films, and I've found that some are extremely creative and interesting, while others are repulsive and selfish confusions - like this movie. For me, it is enough from great to shit - without much in the middle. I know that he has a lot of fans among the "demanding" fans, but I can not help but think that many of his charms are pure hype. From my point of view (and I know that I get a lot of negative reviews for that), he has too many movies shot too fast and was too rampant. His gay or gender films (like this one) are usually very bad - sloppy, sometimes quite boring (like QUERELLE and THE BITTERSTÃ„RTEN by PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes just rough (like this movie). Could not his message of acceptance of a person's gender confusion be better handled than to show that she is being fooled or that cows are cruelly slaughtered? Show some sensitivity to the theme and make your characters more human and likable - then I might be interested in the movies. <br /> <br /> I'm honestly at the point after watching this movie that maybe I would not deal with Fassbinder movies anymore - the bad seems to outshine the good.
