I chose this series after seeing the endless ads on the BBC over the last few weeks. I did not like it despite the fact that I do not like the presumptuous stuff that Alan Hollinghurst writes (sorry to his fans, but I think we have a case of new clothes of the Emperor with this author's work). I admit that the acting is excellent, it's beautifully shot and I was reasonably entertained - but I found the plot extremely thin and after seeing all three episodes, I feel very dissatisfied with this rather empty production. The "explicit" gay sex talked about by the media has been made several times on television. So it was nothing very shocking. Full score for production values, but low for action / content, I'm afraid.
