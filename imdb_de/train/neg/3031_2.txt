Tony Scott destroys everything that could be interesting in Richard Kelly's clich√©d, spotty, over-script. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who got out and became a bounty hunter. This is her story ... "kind". <br /> <br /> The problem with this garbage is that there is not much history and Scott's extreme graphic stylization of any attitude acts as a distancing mechanism. That makes us indifferent to anything in Harvey's chaotic life. <br /> <br /> You just do not care about Harvey. Knightley plays her as a hideous, cynical brat who has done nothing to justify our respect. She beats people she dislikes and throws out her clothes and inhibitions when the situation demands, but she's not the least bit real and Knightly is not the least convincing. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring. It's also loud and connected to one of the most annoying source music scores I've heard in a long time. The last twenty minutes are a bad repetition of Scott's 'True Romance' climax. Domino's gang will hit two sets of enemy villains, the - surprise! Surprise! - destined to shoot each other out at the top of a Las Vegas casino. Unfortunately, Scott's potentially exciting conflict is utterly frowned upon and becomes a confusing, overbearing, pointless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not an artistically courageous or experimental piece. It is a failure at every level because it does not give us access to the lives and dilemmas of its characters. <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks good as a bounty hunter, but he disappears as a "narrative" progresses. Chris Walken turns around in another awkward cameo and Dabney Coleman, always solid, is underutilized. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the complex, gimmicked surface of this movie. It's still a shit, no matter how hard you polish it.
