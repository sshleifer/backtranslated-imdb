The brain that would not die is a horrible piece of film stinking from the opening credits. It has all the classic signs of being bad: incredible plot, horrible drama, inferior sets and lighting. The plot looks like this: When a doctor and his fiancee get into an accident, she is beheaded and he takes her head and takes her to his lab, where he holds her head in a pan with a special liquid that keeps him alive , I bet Virgnina Leath, her head in a pan, had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time carrying this pan around her neck and squatting under a table. In any case, the doctor tries to find a new body for her and hires two strippers so she can choose one for her new body. Bad all the way, so bad that it was torn to pieces on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
