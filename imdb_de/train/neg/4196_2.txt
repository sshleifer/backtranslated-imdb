This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Not only the story but the drama is terribly bad. The dialogue sounds like someone is reading the news. <br /> <br /> This is rated as comedy / drama / romance, it's not one of those things! It's a little action, that's it. There really is NO comedy and no drama. <br /> <br /> If you went to the cinema to see that, I'm sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Pretty much everything else you choose will be better. This is pretty much an action / thriller. The action scenes were bad, and part of the crime story was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you are not really interested in a good story or good acting. And you just want to see a "foreign" movie to be the incentive to be foreign. Then that could be for you.
