The film version of Sandra Bernhard's One-Woman-Off Broadway show is overblown by air. Sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars, but her sense of irony is just very interesting and funny. Her fans will say that she is truly honest, and that may be true. But she is also shrill, with an unfriendly bravado that is not suitable for a film in this genre. She does not want to be nice - and she's certainly not out to make friends - and that always rubs the wrong path for many people. But even if you meet them halfway, their material is seriously missing here. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer, and although he is not directed by him, the film has its cool, detached signature style. Bernhard wrote the show together with director John Boskovich; The strangest thing was that Sandra's entire audience looked completely bored - a feeling that many real audiences will most likely share. * 1/2 of ****
