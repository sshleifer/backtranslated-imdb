Many stupid plots in the movie. First, we see him watching his Master at Kung Fu and dying in the middle of his practice. That's OK for me. And then, at the end of the film, we see him using the kung-fu that he learned by watching his master while he was a kid. Is that even possible? I do not believe that. <br /> <br /> This show is for Jay Chou fans only, and the film lacks depth in terms of character development, cinematography styles, and the plot's unfolding. Someone notices that the basket team captain (forgetting his name) and deified player Li Xiao look so similar that they feel they were the same person? Long hair, sunshine boy look, tall and strong. The two looked as if they were coming out of a mass-production factory designed to produce products that girls scream wildly in orgasm. Not that these two actors had anything of value to even contribute to the movie for the film industry. <br /> <br /> The jokes were lame and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> The scene regarding the 4 Masters of Jay Chou, who had returned to support him on the basketball court, became a pointless conspiracy as they began to admit their Royal Rumble-style opponent beat. Worse still, as the four masters won the fight, the crowd started to cheer and the game went on. It was really a WTF? Moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the game, all thanks to Jay Chou's outstanding kung fu skills. It's a mystery how he gained these kung fu skills, because the show somehow shows him how he achieves the skills by watching his master. <br /> <br /> And then his long-lost father comes out of the wood to acknowledge Jay Chou, as his long-lost son, seemed to be a little too fast for the director to finish the film. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a jay chou strip (instead of the usual "chick strip"). Just look at it, if Jay Chou is your fan. If you're one of those whose taste in movies is very similar to those in the list of the 250 best IMDb films of all time, this movie is not for you.
