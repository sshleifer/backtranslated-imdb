The topic seems to be quite outdated today. Adapted for TV from the book by Rona Jaffe; we stumble and stumble through a fantasy existence. Four college students play a deep role in a live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). A player, a young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world too deeply. His teammates must come to his rescue and save him from self-inflicted damage. David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace complete the foursome game of the game. The cast consists of experienced actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> On this day it seems cumbersome and tame. The highlight of the audience, however, is that Tom Hanks can be seen on the screen between his salad days "Bosom Buddies" and his big splash in SPLASH. The youngest viewer will have the most fun.
