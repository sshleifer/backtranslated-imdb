I just watched the movie last weekend, I'm upset and disappointed. In essence, the film says that immigrants, especially from the former Soviet Union, come to this country, bring everyone from the old country and march in and take over what the Americans work for. This is a very wrong view of immigration and a much worse way of telling people about it. That's the main thing. Another thing, writing, governing and filming is at the level of village amateurs. The actors were doing pretty well, but it was not up to them except this pile of crap. A few jokes were funny, but most were bad and cheesy. I could not wait to get out of the theater, wanted my money back.
