Decide yourself. Personally, I found it as funny as getting a spine marker from Stevie Wonder. No offense, Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's a comedy, but I just thought it was stupid. Not the first two ways to babysit your children; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two sellers of energy drinks to ward off the jail, are being ordered to look after two children at a development center run by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch). One of the outsiders is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a disgusting fifth student, and the other is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a shy young man playing in a medieval fantasy world. Wheeler and Danny are desperately trying to give their charges an invaluable insight into life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is weird with her dry analogies. Supported: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
