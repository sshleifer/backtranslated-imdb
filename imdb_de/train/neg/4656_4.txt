Unobtrusive and memorable remake of an old, famous English movie. Although it may be overly blemished as a total disaster (which it is not), it never builds tension and betrays its TV heritage. Richard Burton strolls through his role and Sophia Loren's closed face (in this movie) also shows no great passion. (**)
