This movie is just stupid. <br /> <br /> From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the fat climax, the film is an exercise in wood predictability. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is one of the true sociopaths of detective novels. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who have put pieces together to solve the puzzle, Hammer breaks things to get to the truth. This movie turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with villains who are ... well, too stupid to get away with anything. One is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack. <br /> <br /> Other parts of the movie are straight out of the Three Stooges playbook. For example, Veldas dance in the barre or the villain who accidentally stabbed his boss in the back. And the continuity breaks are shameful: Miss Blucher runs down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight against her lower legs, but she sidesteps when the camera retreats for a wider shot. The worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The villain chasing Hammer goes a second after our hero, except that the clock is seven minutes behind our guy. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale is so bad that it has to be seen, which is the only reason it gets two points out of 10 points.
