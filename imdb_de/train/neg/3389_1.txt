I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway God White and knew how many times passion, despair and joy came from this live theater experience. Michael Bennett knew that he needed to re-imagine "Chorus" for the screen, but he could never figure out how to do it. If the man who invented the show is baffled, this should answer your question. There are some shows that are simply made to watch live - with an audience. Richard Attenborough, fresh from the musical work of "Ghandi" and the dancing with animals in "Doctor Doolittle", ended up being the director of this film, which had little or no resemblance to the stage show. Horrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), Great songs were dropped or passed on to other characters (which made no sense). Michael Douglas was misunderstood. People who could not dance tried to act, and there was the sexy "Landers" woman who could not sing, act or dance. I think she was just finished with Ghandi's wife. The dances of Jeffrey Hornaday look like nothing more than a splash of "flashdance" and nothing works. I was amazed at how something so fascinating and nothing nice could happen. If you really love this show and you return to Broadway in 2006 - do not see it, do not think that the long-running musical event "A Chorus Line" has anything to do with this film.
