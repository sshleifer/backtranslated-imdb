This book movie is really terrible and a big disappointment. We have been waiting for this movement for over a month. Many film critics were hopeful. It also made a lot of sense in newspapers and on television. Unfortunately, when April 29 comes, many people have noticed that the movie is really awful. Why? At first the story was so monotonous. There were many unspecified scenes, sometimes it's hard to tell what's going on. The actresses of Hulya Avsar were not harmonized with their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She works better in comedy films. In this movie, a kind of drama, she could not miss her previous role. And finally, Movie is too short, only 66 minutes.
