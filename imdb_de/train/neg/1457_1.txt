I have seen this movie a few times, and I can only say that this is a low budget junk and that it has nothing to do with the facts of the story. The performances of the actors are very bad, but they are the result of limited play possibilities. Anyone who has seen this movie now thinks Hitler is an insane, crazy lunatic running a gun like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that in these years there are much better films about Hitler and Germany and that Rise of Evil is very below average. I can recommend the German movie Downfall, where you can see the brilliant performance of the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz in a role of Adolf Hitler.
