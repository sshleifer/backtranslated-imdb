Believe it or not, "The Woodchipper Massacre" has given me full blown gonorrhea! That's right, I got a rainbow of discharge just because a group of kids played around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the devil and got the distribution. I can not understand how anyone with moderate intelligence could endure the burden of a movie. The only reason I managed to get through it all (not without several suicidal attempts along the way) was because I was bored with boredom and secondly - I wanted to explore this newly discovered kind of hate. I experienced it ... This film is a "horror / comedy" study of three siblings staying in the care of their bitchy older aunt over the weekend. The youngest child inadvertently nudges the old lady with his Rambo replica hunting knife. They can then dismember the aunt with various tools (apparently she did not have a single drop of blood in her body!) And lift her into her father's rented wood chipper ... Then her convict son searches for his mother and after the child ends up also this donkey ... I can not remember ever seeing a cast of annoying actors that actually caused me nausea. Seriously, that blond chick's voice kept wincing in pain. All the actors were downright cruel - literally just screaming their faux-sounding dialogue and cracking jokes written by a chimpanzee who just did not care! Well, I can usually appreciate independent efforts, but only from those who can see that people other than their relatives might be watching! I do not need to see a three-minute shot of a car coming out of a driveway, and a painful, embarrassingly long grass installation playing some ridiculous, fluttering music over it. Besides, why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano? There was a piano in ONE scene and no one is killed nearby! I'm done thinking about this movie. If you do not like unbearable crap, I would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this garbage.
