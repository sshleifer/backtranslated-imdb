War, Inc. - Companies are taking over the war in the future and using a lone assassin, Brand Hauser (John Cusack), to do their wet work against the rival CEOs. A dark comedy that misleads the military and corporations alike. It was often difficult to find out what was going on. I've always been waiting for things to make sense. There is no reason and no method for insanity. <br /> <br /> Cusack considers it a "spiritual successor" to Grosse Point Blank. That is, war is more or less a consequence. We see Cusack again as the assassin, protecting the * spoiler * he should kill while dealing with his conscience. To be honest, John Cusack looks somehow believable in eliminating half a dozen guys with relative ease. The short fights look good. The rest of the movie does not. It's all quirky and often borders on bizarre. War Inc is not funny enough to be a parody, and too vivacious for anyone to even think about whatever the message of the movie might be. I suppose it's the heartless ways in which corporations, like war factions, compete and contemplate, regardless of how they affect average citizens. Interesting, but the satire just does not work because it is not funny and basically the movie has no heart. Let's joke about how the war affects Cusack's shell of a character and not the millions of lives the war has torn apart. John Cusack gives a decent performance. His character trots with spicy sauce and drives the smallest private plane, but quirks are to replace character traits. Marisa Tomei slumbers as a romantic buddy journalist. There really is not much chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and does not make a fool of himself. Joan Cusack just screams and whines and wigs out. Sheet. Ben Kingsley may have to return the Oscar if he does not get a decent performance from time to time. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> It's not a horrible movie, but in the end you have to ask, "War, why is it good?" Absolutely nothing. C-
