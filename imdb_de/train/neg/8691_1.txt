If there was a ZERO rating, I would give it to this movie. Today I tried to see it a second time, and I still could not do it from start to finish. I can not believe the multiple stars awarded by others and can only assume that they either know the actors or are a disguised publicist! Acting is cruel everywhere, the screenplay is blah, the kid who plays Nichole shows no emotion, even when threatened. The "southern" accent of the actress playing Amber's Mom is ridiculous - I'm from Georgia and have friends from Texas - believe me, NEVER talk like that! None of her feelings seemed real in any scene. The topic is very serious and deserves a much better treatment.
