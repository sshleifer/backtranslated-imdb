* SOILER * It's a fake! The whole thing is a fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a lord and his cousin or brother or half-brother or similar wants the castle and its title for itself. That's why he's investing this overly complicated and unnecessary plan on SCOOBY-DOO to make Alan commit suicide. The main part of the movie is that he collects redheads and attacks them. He does not even kill her. He goes to sleep and the girl disappears and he thinks he has buried her somewhere. If he looked at the so-called spirit of Evelyn, he could say that she was wearing gloves! My God, what a waste of time. Do not look at it, rent it and if you have bought it and you have not seen it yet, sell it. Fast! Do yourself a favor and stay away from THE NIGHT EVELYN. I give this stinker the CRAP-O-LANTERN.
