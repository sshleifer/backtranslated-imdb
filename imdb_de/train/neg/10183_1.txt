This is a very bad production. In general, everyone agreed that although Princess Margaret might have been pampered and spoiled, and perhaps had too much luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the weakest point of production, the actress could not convey that. It also seemed that the production budget could not extend to a barber - from the beginning, the hair of the figure of Princess Margaret had a permanent bird's nest and looked like it had been pulled through a bush. The actor who played the Duke of Edinburgh seemed prepared for his role as he watched Rory Bremner mimic Prince Charles and was a farce. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
