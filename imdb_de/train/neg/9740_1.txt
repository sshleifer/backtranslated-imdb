Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwnwnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn! : = 8O <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. <br /> Oh, um, sorry, sorry, I fell asleep for a mooment , Where was I now? Oh yes, "The Projected Man", yes ... ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. <br /> Ooops, sorry. Yes, "the projected man". Well, it's a British science-fiction festival that's not about anything. An orange guy projects with a laser and gets the breath of death. Finally he disappears, the end. Actually, the movie is not even that interesting. Boring, booming, starchy, stiff and brittle boring, "The Projected Man" is 77 minutes of nothing, with no one. Matt like rinse water. Matt like doorknob dust. Boring like Ethan Hawke - we're really talking DULL, folks! But wait, with regards to our boring cousins ​​from the puddle, the MooCow will now do a proper check on "The Projected Man": <br /> <br /> .. <= 8.
