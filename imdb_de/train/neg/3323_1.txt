I've seen a lot of cartoons or animated cartoons because I have a little girl who enjoys watching TV. I started to watch this movie to see if I wanted my little one to watch the movie ... and no. At the beginning, I thought it was such a sweet movie as the Bambi movie, but it was like saying the duckling was a homosexual. The info said that they made fun of him because he was not good at sports, but that was not the case. It just seems to be a movie where children learn to be alright, to be gay. It was also very sad when it came to the duck's father and everything. I do not know, I think, if you're gay, you like it, but I do not think I'll take another look at it with my little one.
