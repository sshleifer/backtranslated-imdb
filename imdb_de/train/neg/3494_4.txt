Given his popularity, I found this movie very disappointed. Maybe I expected too much from this movie. After all, it's one of the 70s best-known martial arts films, but I've never been able to figure out why. The story is uninteresting. It's also a very talkative movie with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not provide a character that I could use because the intended hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style and he can not hide the glaring imperfections of the narrative. I know that this is not supposed to be a fine art, but I found the movie boring. Certainly not the best example of this popular genre. His cult status escapes me. I recommend you to skip it.
