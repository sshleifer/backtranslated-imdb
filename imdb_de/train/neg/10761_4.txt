This movie was a mess. It had the absolute worst cut I've ever seen. It was almost like the end of a scene in which the writer wanted to go in advertising, and the filmmaker added a second black screen to fulfill the writers' dream a glimmer of something good. A good idea, a convincing spark. But somewhere it went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is about a quasi-psychic priest trying to solve a series of murders. The first thing that is hard to bite is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well, the part does not ask him to be a good priest, and he does it pretty well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as a crazy villain. He always plays the crazy bad guy. Very hum. <br /> <br /> Oh, a thought occurred to me that maybe all the nervous, terrible editing and incoherent plot was trying to add a sense of confusion to the character (Grieco). And just to prove that it was invented, they rolled out the credit backwords. Not a good sign for a movie. <br /> <br />
