I saw this movie and was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler, he is a man who sadly tries to be Hitler. The film is lying, it does not reflect the truth. In the scene, Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler had never met anyone, he beat no people with his fist, but with the fists of soldiers. Understand?? Another thing is: it's too obvious that Hitler is evil, he was smarter than shown in this movie. No German would have accepted him as a leader, because he can see that he is evil. So the real Hitler did not show people his evil side. <br /> <br /> Did any of you see Yankees watching the movie "The Fall" or "The Dawnfall"? This is a great movie with great actors. And it is a german movie. I think this theme of Nazi Germany should not be realized as a film by people who know nothing about Germany. People! Take a look at "The Downfall": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about a very sad time for People around the world.
