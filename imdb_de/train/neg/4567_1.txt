What a bad picture of professional police officers is shown on television when looking at this alleged reality show. One can only hope that the actual well-founded suspicion that leads to a probable cause that causes all the circumstances to make a "stop", then the "pat down" of the outside of a garment, and then to articulate why Officer went into the bag and got smuggled goods from the scenes. If this is not the case, the arrest will be dropped in most places if they let a supervisor pass. The display of an arrest warrant over the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the arrest warrant, unless the sender has the original arrest warrant in hand. If the dispatcher reads from a computer printout, it is good enough for arrest, but does not necessarily mean that the arrest warrant is still in effect. Since I did not see a CBS spellblender (I may have missed it), CBS could be in trouble.
