This is my first movie review on IMDb. After watching this movie, I had to register. I can not confess with a clear conscience that this film is not rated by me. People have to be warned! <br /> <br /> First of all my rating is 0 (like in "zero") <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and Christopher Walken and yet I hated this movie. There is an action, but who cares if there is no script. The dialogue is unreal and boring, the situations are invented, the flow of events is slow and arbitrary, the characters are disagreeable and uninteresting. This movie is a piece of poo. <br /> <br /> It does not matter to waste MONEY for this movie, it's not even worth the TIME it looks at you. Please do not look ... I implore you!
