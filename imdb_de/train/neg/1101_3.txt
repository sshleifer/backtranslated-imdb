This fake journey does not close to the wit and craziness of the great adventure these guys made in their first movie. This issue tries to turn away from their prequel to catch some new blood from the joke, but it takes a wrong turn and traveling nowhere interesting or funny guys who make a rock concert (and many people look on "Free TV" since when does that happen?) Sure, the scriptwriter could have done something more creative; Take a look at how all the random elements of the first movie were put together through a merge in the scientific presentation. Not in this movie that pretty much ended the Bill & Ted franchise. The joke was over. <br /> <br /> The Grim Reaper is thrown into the mix for some reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, is poorly performed and sparks are missing for the comedy or audience involvement. There is a ZZ top impression that is taken for no reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or funny. <br /> <br /> Skip this wrong thing.
