My first encounter with the Templarios & no good. I was thrilled to find this title among the Anchor Bay video offerings that brought us other cult classics like "Spider Baby". The print quality is excellent, but that alone can not hide the fact that the film is deadly boring. There is a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers practice a terrible Templar revenge (and get it going), but everything else in the movie is slow, cumbersome, and ultimately unfulfilled. Add insult to injury: The film was dubbed and not promised as in the video jacket.
