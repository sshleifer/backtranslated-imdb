Another to bad the lowest they can go here is one. Otherwise, this would be a slight zero. Really one of the worst movies I have ever seen. In fact, Peckenpah's name was not on the thing I never thought possible. In fact, one of the people in San Francisco I know was on the set a lot and since sunrise, he says Sam just shits. It shows in spades. The laughter at the beginning of the movie is the ONLY thing in this mess that is worth a second look. Not even Gig Young can be seen. This is a real test of masochism. If I had been forced into a theater to see it, I would jump up screaming. And now I really feel guilty because I saw everything from a very comfortable couch that was just too good to walk. What a mess, it seemed less written than make-up as they went on. It's not just a bomb, but a backward spelled bmob. Yikes !!!!!
