Pokemon The movie was a horrible movie. In contrast to the first movie, this is not a good movie at all. The graphics were decent, but the story was flat and no real drama was built. In the first, the interaction between the characters was decent. The subtraction of Brock and the addition of Tracey was bad. tracey really does not have much to say or do, and unlike brock, it does not offer any weird relief. the only good point is that you can see that foggy is actually jelousing over ashes, and her early pondering about calling his girlfriend was entertaining. Overall, this film is not worthwhile, and the short film before has neither brought anything for me nor for my wife. and we consider ourselves pokemon fans. oh well, maybe the next one will be better
