For me, every work of art is judged according to these criteria: form, function and meaning. Guernsey seems to be dedicated to the forms: beautiful shots and sometimes interesting drama. The long close-ups indicate a function that the viewer can fill in himself. Due to missing texts, the story becomes a quiz. An introvert suggests depth, but sometimes it turns out she has nothing to say. This movie looks like an introverted person. If you have not read the summary, you can not see that suicide (and the unanswered question Why?) Changes Anna's view of life and makes her suspicious. "Why do not you talk to me?" asks Sebastiaan. Anna does not answer, she just looks at him for a long time without saying a word. What is the function of this recording? What does that mean? My question is like Sebastiaans: What does this movie have to say? What is meant by this movie? The answer for me: It shows us a handful of people with the passion of a glass of water. The story of her life is simple and boring. Reasons for their actions are not shown. The rest is: skins, houses, landscapes. Beautiful and artistically made, but pointless, without having instructions for use. In my opinion, this film is made for colleagues, not for the ordinary viewer.
