I saw this movie last night at Tribeca Film Festival 2006, and I seriously wonder if people actually show the films at the festival before they are selected. The movie was just awful - I say, without exaggeration or ulterior motive - it was awful. Matthew Modine's days as a leading man are over. Gina Gershon had an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. Gloria Reuben had a weird little cameo - she should be ashamed, too. The script was horrible and we had absolutely no reason to worry about the characters. I very much doubt that this will be taken up, but on the other hand, it is known that people in Hollywood sometimes make mistakes. I really think that "Kettle of Fish" is a serious contender for the worst movie I've ever seen.
