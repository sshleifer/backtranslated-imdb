A warning to potential viewers: If you're looking for an adaptation of the classic story "The Most Dangerous Game," look elsewhere. "Seven Wives for Satan" <br /> <br /> addresses the original work only superficially, using the name of Zaroff and saying that the character may be murdered or corrupted. <br /> <br /> Boris Zaroff is played by director Michel Lemoine. While his ancestors hunted men because they were the only prey that presented a real challenge, the victims of Boris are usually in a position where they can not defend themselves. The film grazes from scene to scene with almost complete blur. The director seems to ignore the tempo and leave the viewer with a suffocating film. Some single scenes are somewhat interesting (eg a torture rack sequence), but as a unit the movie can not entertain. Viewers, who are more interested in a selection of attractive and semi-attractive actresses in various stages of the undressing, may find the film as something to see. Most people will probably find that their time is better spent watching Mentos commercials. <br /> <br /> In a side note, the DVD extras contained a lot of information about the history of the movie. It was apparently banned for several years in his native France, which ruined his chances of widespread use.
