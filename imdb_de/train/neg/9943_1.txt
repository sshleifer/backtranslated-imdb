The cover (with a man holding a spooky pellet gun in his hand) would give the impression of being a martial arts film. (Hardly.) <br /> <br /> I find it interesting that the actual title of the movie is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a condom brand in the US.) This movie is full of homoeroticism. If you like the stuff, then this movie is really not that bad. However, note the following points: <br /> <br /> There are numerous close-ups of the abdomen and buttocks of the actors (A scene even shows every actor with an erection that is bulging in his pants) Colors like lime, peach and red. From the perspective of a cameraman, this movie is a drag queen! Some scenes feature characters who stand side by side and occasionally touch each other when they are talking. The hero's cousin also likes women, and every other man in the movie tries to kill him. Is there a message the filmmakers want to convey here? <br /> <br /> Should I go to the fight scenes? (Yes, someone's private parts are packed in a fight.) The martial arts scenes are short and unimaginative. Nothing special here, just your standard moves that you would see in an old Chuck Norris movie. There is also a chase, which may be the first LOW speed chase.
