I can not vote on it because I would not look at garbage from these people. They got my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I vowed that it would never happen again. I feel that it is my civic duty to help people stay away from this garbage. Go to the forums of this movie and read where the actors try to behave as if they are seeing the movie for the first time. A man even reacts to himself ... with the same name! There are shills in the forum that say it's as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Not even close (by no means). If this is the company's second film, it should be better than the first one. That means, the 3rd movie should be much better. Not like that, I saw it. I just want to know how you constantly distribute this garbage of the same name. Having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is fine ... but do not try to market this garbage!
