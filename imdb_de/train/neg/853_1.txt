Ok, honestly, I do not understand why everyone thinks that's so great. It really is not. There were two good things that came out of this movie: 1. Jack's performance, he was very good, I can give him my hat. 2. Danny's performance was good. No other than that it was pretty stupid. And what did Stanley Kubrick think of designing Shelly as Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this movie was the end. I would have had more respect if Kubrick had done otherwise. And the movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So do not see that the movie has read the book, and you're feeling much better. 10.3.
