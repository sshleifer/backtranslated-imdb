I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig during the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. However, I was very anxious to leave the seats as soon as Big Rig was over. Big Rig is made up of several "big rig" drivers who choose to deliver goods that are driven in the United States. The characters are all wonderful people, but the filmmakers have never dug deep into the complexity of them as human beings. Instead, the story winds as much as the cards in the movie should serve as a guide, but never. At most we get lost. We - the audience - land nowhere and end up like the direction of storytelling somewhere, but without direction, location or action. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? Storytelling is sloppy, and the directors' intention to "humanize" a group of people they see as "overlooked" and "invisible" seems unconscious and irritatingly condescending. The problem here is in the perspective of the directors instead of truck drivers. The directors make their naughty assumptions about Trucker and then simply edit the film to confirm these assumptions. All in all, the story lacks any excitement, the movie is too long (should have been a 15-minute sketch), the big question "so what" is never answered, and the entire movie is a piece of transparent propaganda, which does nothing to "enlighten" the outside world (as the directors say) about big riggers.
