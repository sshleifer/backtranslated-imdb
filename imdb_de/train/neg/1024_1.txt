I have seen this movie with quite strong expectations at the Toronto Film Festival. The film has a great cast and was closed at the festival, so it must be good, right? how wrong I was <br /> <br /> I knew that we were in trouble when the director talked about how, while shooting a Wiseguy episode, before the movie, he had an unknown actor named Kevin Spacey (a director / Author of Wiseguy making his feature film hit debut = blah) ... Well, Edison's director / writer must have some offensive pictures of Kevin Spacey killing a homeless man because I can not see him ( along with the other actors of the film) would ever agree disaster. <br /> <br /> this movie is absolutely terrible! It's a mix of every hard-boiled clich√© of all the cops. With Edison is nothing new. The acting was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like the previously mentioned episode of wiseguy. This was the best casted video I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> a few examples of nasty stupid moments in Edison ... morgan freeman dances in his apartment for no reason to rock rock music ... justin timberlake receives creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles ... llcoolj drive a vintage firebird ... 3 guys are shot in the head ... <br /> <br /> this movie is the opposite of good. <br /> <br /> OFF EDISON!
