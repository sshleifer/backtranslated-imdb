OK, it's very rare that I complain about something I got for FREE. I think this movie has exceeded this limit. I saw it for FREE at Hollywood Cemetery and was very disappointed. Asking a member of the audience to use the Native American references as "bookends" instead of being better woven into the film basically says everything that this film failed to do. <br /> <br /> Native American REFERENCES --- The Native American references felt out of place and resourceful. It is obvious that this director and author has tried to master an arena in which they have never played before. They should have followed the old saying, "Write about something you know." If they are really familiar with it, it certainly has not been shown in the movie, or the beauty of this unique culture has not been adequately met. Clichés and the nose - I agreed to watch this movie based on its indie. So I held it to higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was an indie and saw it before it became so popular. Before it ever came to a publication, I already raved about how it will be a hit. Unfortunately, I can not say the same thing about "expiration date". "Sunshine" brought us to cliché incidents, but the filmmakers were so wise in their approach that the result would take us in a different direction to avoid the trap of a "cliché". This film, on the other hand, had no way of not being trapped because it was PACKED from the beginning. The antics of the psycho mother, the couple Hendrix, etc. <br /> <br /> I hate to say it, but the best and worst movie I've seen this year was both indies. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this movie is the worst. I wish I could say otherwise. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the filmmakers for learning so much from their family members in the cemetery.
