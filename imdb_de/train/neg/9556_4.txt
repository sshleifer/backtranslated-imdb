This movie consists mainly of chase scenes and special effects. It is very weak on the property. Most computer talks were just hoaxes. I looked at it because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie, based mainly on computer facts and real computer terminology. This movie had none of this. Most computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic for real computers and networks, but lame. It's as if it's written by someone who does not understand real computers. <br /> <br /> The Ripley game was lame and essentially just an arcade game. No real hacking, so what was the point? The movie was boring. Lame sequel
