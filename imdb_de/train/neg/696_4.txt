Eh, not a very good slasher movie. Acting, effects, decent, but familiar and not imaginative soundtrack. <br /> <br /> There are three deaths in the immediate vicinity of the beginning of the movie, resulting in a pretty good scene in which everything seems to be. Besides, many characters wander around, failing to see what's going on, or chasing red herrings; more murder of time than of people. There are more deaths, and the killer is a killer who accepts equal opportunities and is not indifferent to a device. The killer also wants to get other people to kill innocent people. The identity is not revealed towards the end, and the motive is quite thin, and we really do not care. <br /> <br /> The movie is supposed to be running around Christmas, but that does not matter. A scene is illuminated by Christmas lights, that's it. <br /> <br /> The movie is usually pretty dark with a muddy image, at least on the videotape I saw. Part of the dialogue has been lost in some of the opening scenes. The end should have been stronger than it was. We believe that we recognize what has happened, even though there is a possibility that something else has been done.
