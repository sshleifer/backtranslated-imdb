Having just watched FIVE ACROSS THE EYES, I have to be honest ... I just did not like it. I read so many good reviews in this movie, but I just did not know where these reviews came from. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of time for newcomers in filmmaking and I 'm sure the directors will be good for themselves, but the budget they had was the main problem. Two cameras were used throughout the movie (which was fine), but they seemed to be really cheap cameras. Another problem was the noise, you get all the girls screaming and screaming at the same time, everyone talking - it's just impossible to hear what they say. <br /> <br /> It had a good idea, in short, they hit a parked car and then drive off. A short time later, they are followed by the car they hit. They are driven by a crazy woman who wants to kill her and has many chances! ... and on the other hand, the girls have many escape possibilities, but not! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... I just scratched through!
