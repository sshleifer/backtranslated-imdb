There is much talk of torture these days. That's all in this movie. It's about a good person making a bad decision. Because of his friendliness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. From then on it is a real attack on him. I do not know when you do something about it. There's a woman and a kid out there. He has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there should have been some times when he could have acted. The movie seems to be someone's joke. I suspect that after the Manson murders we had a certain fixation on such people. Why would anyone still make a movie? What appeals does it have except sadism? The conclusion is completely unsatisfactory, but that could have been remedied with an obvious twist of the plot. Well. Another hour and a half of my life.
