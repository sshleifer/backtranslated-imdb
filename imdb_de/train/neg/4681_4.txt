We laughed out. This script is so incredible that you either zap to CNN or go to sleep. <br /> <br /> My dad was a seafaring captain for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie. <br /> <During his experience as an officer, he once commanded the ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey a day and (sorry) s * t on his desk. Of course, it was not a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, the fire in the kitchen is the most important fire on any ship, whether nuclear or not. Exercising at this time is just a Hollywood script. If a Captain is arrested, he will be arrested. They take all his keys and open the safe where the weapons are stored. This is stored within minutes in a well-guarded room. He can NOT escape, it's just like in jail. <br /> <br /> Funny, my father also had a dog on board, but we see Hackman peeing him in the control room. That's never done. My dad cleaned up all the mess the dog made wherever he was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make the three stars for which this film is credited, everything else is bulls. > If we know that there were still 23 people living on Koersk, then this film will have an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rental: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
