Although I totally disagree with a critic who has labeled Charley Chase as inglorious, he is certainly safe in this film. It's a shame, as I suspect the other reviewer had only seen a few Charley Chase types and guessed that the guy was not funny. Films like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHAT PRICE GOOFY? are very good chase movies, so he could be really fun with good material. Unfortunately, he has given absolutely nothing in this movie. Even the inclusion of the normally good Oliver Hardy as a slide is no help, since the basic requirement (boy wants to marry a girl, but the girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. It's a shame, because I really wanted to love this movie, but I could not. By the way, for those who have been looking for Charly since the mid-1920s, you'll be quite surprised. Chase wears no glasses or mustache - and looks like you expect it.
