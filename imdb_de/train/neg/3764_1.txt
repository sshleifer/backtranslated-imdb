This is definitely the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen, and possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actresses were terrible and it seemed they were trying too hard to play their roles as dorks, tough guys, idiots, knowing everything, etc. etc. It seemed like some computer-generated image from the days of Atari & To be Intellivision. At one point near the end of the film, when an army of Sasquatches chased after the survivors, one was shot and when he ran, it looked like a poor version of donkey kong itself! And you get hit by a bullet and the blood that comes out of it was a terrible animation. Somewhat annoying was the music. Far too much music (classical score or whatever you call it) throughout the movie. It never ended. Oh yes, the movie is boring, too. Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I strongly suggest you pay your $ 3 or whatever to rent this movie and spend it somewhere for a gallon of gas or a value menu. Really terrible!
