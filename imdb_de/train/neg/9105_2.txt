What can I say to Cruel Intentions 2? Well, I can honestly say, I'll only watch this movie once more, when I'm attached to a chair and my eyes are open in a clockwork-orange style. <br /> <br /> The movie "Stars" Robin Dunne (No, I've never heard of him), whose horrible impression of Ryan Phillipe made me flinch through and through. In the case of a horrible casting, Dunne tries (and fails) to play a handsome, charismatic charmer. Since the actor is neither handsome nor charismatic or charming, the character remains totally unbelievable. Amy Adams (she was once in an episode of Buffy) tries to continue where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off to bring Katherine to life ... However, Adams is a not-so-good actress and her performance was flat. She had no real Emotions and often looked like reading cue cards in front of the camera. However, there were two good actors in the film, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Ms. Kensington in Austion Powers), who as parents of Sebastian and Katherine performed very good and entertaining performances and are the sole reason why I rated the movie as 2 and not 1 <br /> <br /> The film itself is a poor version of the original with lows such as carbon copies of dialogues and imitated scenes that lacked the originality of the previous film. <br /> <br /> I think it may have worked as a television program, but if it had been redesigned with people who might actually be in the main parts.
