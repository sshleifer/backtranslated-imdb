They know that a movie will not go well when John Carradine (a.k.a.) reads the script and plot overview) about his character's funeral procession, just five minutes before the movie. The narrative is the last will and testament of his character. It dictates that his fortune be divided among his 4 children and servants. The children divide equally $ 136 million, but if anyone dies, that portion will be split among the remnants. If all children die, it is divided among the servants. To be eligible, they have to live for one week in the family estate. It sounds like the typical plot of a reality show. <br /> <br /> There is little subtext about the nature of the Deans. They are a powerful and serious malfunction, but the real trouble starts with the drowning of this dog. From the opening voice of John Carradine, expect this movie to lead to a Machiavell cat and mouse game with a twist-end. <br /> <br /> This journey is painfully slow and pointless. We trudge by watching minutes of people playing billiards, throwing darts, shooting the "fish-bowl" abuse, dramatic conversations between men wearing silk-tails, constant quarrels, misplaced circus music, bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of faux-german expressionism Horror aesthetics of the 4th grade and heaps of dramatic transitions. All this inevitably leads to the expected and thankless end. You will be happy to be alive, but the pain may be too great to endure on your own. Children share, share. <br /> <br /> celluloid rehab
