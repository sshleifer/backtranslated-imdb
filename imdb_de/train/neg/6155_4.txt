A weird mix of the traditional '80s, smarter, Chevy Chase style, "every ten lines you'll make for fun," farce and sickie black comedy. In some places slightly amusing, but absolutely tasteless. There is a ski sequence that contains the farthest back projections since "On Your Majesty's Secret Service". (**)
