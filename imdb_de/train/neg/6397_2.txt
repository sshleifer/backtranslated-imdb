That's a problem I have with movies that come on TV when there is nothing else to see. I'm somehow involved in really bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this one was pretty good to see. The idea of ​​being the only one on Earth after finding a comet and then finding out if any zombies are around makes me laugh. And that's why I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. The story was stupid ... but that's how you're made to laugh (too stupid). I think I just saw it because the guy from Star Trek had the lead. I was surprised to see him as a younger guy ... and he was the only funny character anyway.
