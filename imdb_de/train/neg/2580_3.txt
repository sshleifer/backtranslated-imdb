Well, it's official. You just killed American Pie. The first three were absolutely hysterical, but these and the others were terrible. I mean, the story is about two college brotherhoods battling each other for their homes, I mean, come to a weak plan, the first three are about growing up, changing and marrying. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the biggest joke. I know he's trying hard to compare himself to Steven Stifler, but not a cigar. I give this movie a 3 because there are 2-3 funny parts in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character in this movie is of course Jim's dad. I do not know why he keeps making bad movies.
