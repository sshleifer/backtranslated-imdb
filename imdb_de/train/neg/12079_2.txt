Poor Will would turn in his grave if he could make that audible German TV adaptation of his classic. It is obvious that very little money was spent on it. A stage break, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns run as a set. The film was improperly dubbed in English, with the English speakers murmuring their lines again and again. The entire production felt incredibly dark and bleak. And where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this sad production the treatment she rightfully deserved. <br /> <br /> Being or not being? I wish this movie would never have come first.
