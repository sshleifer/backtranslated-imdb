Things I learned from The List. <br /> <br /> A decent cameraman, a hot girl who can act and Malcom McDowell could not stop this movie. <br /> <br /> Blockbuster won 'I'll give you your money back. <br /> <br /> Even if he reads the script and "Ugh! Really?!" says, Malcom McDowell is still trying. <br /> <br /> Chuck Carrington needs urgent acting lessons <br /> <br /> Hire a writer. <br /> <br /> Jesus also hates me and punishes me by forcing me to pay $ 5.50 to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you make a movie movie, you do not need an end. Just leave everything inexplicable, unresolved and uninteresting enough for the audience to fall asleep BEFORE the end. Genius. <br /> <br /> Any random landlord can cure death by drawing a cross on a window. Make friends. <br /> <br /> Your maid can bring you back to life. Chuck Carrington still needs acting classes. <br /> <br /> Your roommate will hate you Make fun of yourself by bringing this movie home. <br /> <br /> Excuses are not accepted.
