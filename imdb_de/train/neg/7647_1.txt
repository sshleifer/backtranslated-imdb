Bridges of Madison County is a better-made version of this story. I thought the end of this movie was not as sensitive as in the original English movie. This movie is very indianized, if you are a very sensitive person crying in a movie, if the hero dies in the end, you will love this movie. On the other hand, if you are a fighter in life and think crying is not like wimping for the end. But by and large, it's a pretty good topic for Indian standards. Taboo was good as a caring wife and mother. Everyone did well.
