"Seed" is torture porn ... no doubt. But strangely enough, Uwe Boll has written, produced and directed a more polished film than any other he has done lately. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch a Boll movie, I feel that some pages of the script must be gone. There are just big gaps in history and dialogue. Of course, nothing makes much sense. The films are somewhat surreal in this regard. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> Why are the six police officers arresting Seed to arrest them? Their separate ways when they come into the dark house, as opposed to real policemen who would enter the house in twos or threes? Why do the cops never use their radios? How can bodies decay so quickly, a process that would normally take many months? (I know it's time-lapse photography ... but Seed would never be on schedule and kill people if he'd always waited for the previous victim to go to the point specified.) How come that Seed is a Latzoverall and a jumpsuit wears a mask while waiting on death row instead of on typical prison uniforms? How can Seed enter a high-security prison, walk around the block of cells, and then walk out without being stopped or even noticed? If nearly 80 people were murdered (according to some newspaper articles shown in the film), why is only one investigator working on the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should look for Seed at Seeds House, where he was originally arrested and where he murdered his victims? (Did not he think to do this sooner?) Why is the police officer going alone, without support, and without the dispatcher even having to know what he was doing and where he wanted to go? <br /> <br /> This is especially frustrating when Boll obviously does everything to understand why the electric chair is not working properly. He spent a few minutes setting this up, if he could have done that at least a little bit more logically. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <In short, the film only serves as a framework for a few different scenes (perhaps Boll would consider these as his "visions") of a brutal death Sticks, shots on the head, electrocution and hides of live animals raised for their skins. (The opening scenes of skinned animals were indeed needless and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The centerpiece is undoubtedly the clumsy death of a middle-aged woman by Seed with a hatchet. It is obvious that a lot of time has been spent on it and it vaguely reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs", but without the Steely Dan soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Is that a good movie? Is it worth seeing? Only if you are a dedicated fan of the torture-porn genre or if you absolutely want to see a sample of torture porn. As I said at the beginning of this review, although this film is pretty disgusting and can get sick at certain points, it is really much more competent than most of Boll's films. Maybe he will continue to improve as a filmmaker. I can only hope that he goes beyond torture and goes more in the sense of "Postal".
