I own this movie. I bought it for $ 3.99 from a fairly large video retailer to do some "indie" movie research as I just completed my own feature and just edited it. Just sit down with a plate of biscuits and Severed. Within a few minutes, I feel great. <br /> <br /> I hate talking to another filmmaker, so I'm only using constructive criticism: 1. Find good actors The Time. It really helps. 2. When you record a video, your scenes are illuminated overnight and become darker in the computer. 3. Close-ups are better for videos. 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a little before you see something /> <br /> let them talk so we know what's going on and who's talking 5. Never point the back of a door while we're wait for someone to open it. Damn the $ 3.99 worth of <br /> <br /> The real horror would get the reviews Severed had on IMDb here. And you have to give these guys credit ... they were distributed.
