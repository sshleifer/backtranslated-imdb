As a cinema fan, White Noise was an absolute disappointment, as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good, well-lit, good camera work, sensible direction. But as a movie, he was as predictable as any other so-called horror movie that recently flooded the market. Although it had a bit of the "chill factor", the whole concept of the E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did not seem credible. In this film, the reasons for certain incidents were not explained, but they were continued. Acting was far from blowing the main character who starred without emotion, as in many new thriller / horror movies. <br /> <br /> By no means a movie I'm going to buy on DVD, and would not recommend to anyone who sees it.
