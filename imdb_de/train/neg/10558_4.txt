I do not know why these are the fans, and I do not know why I even rated it like me. That is absurd. There are many giallo where you have to stop unbelief, roll the picture and catch up somewhere before it goes astray, and a poor cop will eventually have to explain what we've seen. However, this has very little cause and has overlong sequences in which nothing happens and is relevant to nothing, while we have to listen to a repetitive soundtrack, even for Italian standards. It's not a giallo, it's a complete mix of horror ideas in which Klaus Kinski performs in one of his most blatant "phone-based" performances. I think he turned up, worked one day and left Mr. D'Amato for others to fill out. Ewa, of course, is pretty, but no Everywhere in town, long after we've lost all interest in this pointless and arrogant dichotomy. Maybe I just was not in the right mood!
