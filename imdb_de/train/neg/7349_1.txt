Polyester was John Water's very first film I saw, and I have to say that it was also the "worst" movie I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Water's group of talents was made up of several people. I'm sure he worked for the food and was willing to say the lines that Waters wrote. Everything about the movie is terrible, drama, camera, editing and the story about a woman who was played by 300 lb transvestite Divine was absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> That means I have to recommend this movie because it's very funny and you will not believe the crap that happens to poor Francine. Her son scrubs solvents and trots unsuspecting women's feet in the supermarket. Her daughter is the cutest slut in the city. Her husband is a throbbing a-hole of a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate the poor Francine. Edith looks and sounds like she's reading the lines of a cue card and has never seen the script before shooting. Despite all the efforts of Francine, Waters cooks a fabulous Hollywood ending and all (the survive) lives happily ever after.
