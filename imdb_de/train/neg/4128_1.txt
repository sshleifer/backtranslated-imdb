This movie is one of the most terrifying I have ever seen. The dialogue is not only terrible, it never stops. You think it ends, but it's not like that. How long does it take 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know that I will never see it again. It's as if someone had taken a romantic comedy, taken out the comedy and then decided to play down the romance and leave us the pile of crap that managed to get to the screen. But do not take my word for it, find out for yourself how awful this movie is.
