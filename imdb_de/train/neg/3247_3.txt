I was really looking forward to this movie because it seemed promising from the upcoming attractions: Jim Carrey with Godlike powers was an idea that worked most definitely for me. As a huge fan, I was sure that with such a promising premise he would be paramount in his element, and what could go wrong? Yesterday, my bubble grew up, boys and girls, because I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The first act (which states that he hates his life, he is an angry employee and a mostly unfortunate camper with an ax pointing against God) is the second act (where he God is calling by phone and receiving the powers of the Almighty) is great - Carrey enjoys his new "toys" and it's a pleasure to see them, really funny. But the third act is incredibly angry. <br /> <br /> The rottenness begins after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who does EXTRAORDICALLY well in this film, considering her role only matters) Plot device; even her NAME smells of uncertainty) - she thinks he'll crack the question, but instead he tells her (on the knee) that he finally gets his newscaster job, and is not it so exciting? <br /> <br /> She does not believe that. She wants him to marry her, you see, so she lands and leaves him, look, although she still loves him very much, you see, and the rest of the movie is spent looking after us with a pathetic, beyond serious next there was a spiritual-sounding cliche, until at the end I also prayed. , So it's over. <br /> <br /> I did not mind that there were no subtle details in the first two acts (for example, in the second act, after Bruce has received his powers, Bruce dances into the room and sings, "What would be If God is one of them, we're just an idiot like one of us, "blah blah blah, and I was even ready to miss the amazing amount of contradictions that were flung upon us (for opener says Morgan Freeman) / k / a GOD - that he can not violate the free will of another, but he does so often.These decisions were forgivable - this is a Jim Carrey comedy directed by Tom Shadyac - they are not Remains of the day. <br /> <br /> Or rather, it should be a comedy if the scriptwriters lose track (in the dreaded act 3) and try to turn the process into a kind of (gag) message movie, we get hell on E instead Bruce recognizes the flaw of his selfish behavior, he realizes that GRACE is his salvation - he must say - grace, and that his priorities in life have been badly misunderstood. All of this, however, could have been communicated in a much less harsh way. The film did not have to go in the dump truck to make these points. Unfortunately, the writers and Shadyac did not seem to have any idea how to cleverly and recklessly resolve the story in any way, and so they went the bang-em-over-the-heads route in the hope that we would not notice them would. In the end, they even tackled some surprisingly listless out-takes in the hope that this would reduce the bad taste. It did not work for me.
