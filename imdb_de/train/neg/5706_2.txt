This movie is like the thousand "cat and mouse" movies that precede it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but really only describes a large class of films.) There's the passionate, clever main character, his stupid but well-meaning buddy with his poorly placed attempts at humoristic commentary, the initially hostile but soon supple beautiful lady , which unleashes the inevitable "unlikely" love story, the relatives were taken hostage and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal henchmen. Everyone has seen countless of these films, and "National Treasure" is like any of them, with only slightly modified packaging. Every twist of the story was easy to predict (and I can assure you that I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed). I am so tired that after leaving the theater I felt cheated out of a Hollywood movie for money. If you've ever felt that way, pay attention to my warning. Stay miles away from this movie.
