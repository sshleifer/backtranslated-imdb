Skip Mission: Galactica and check out the original Living Legend episodes instead. The network combined parts 1 and 2 of Living Legend in an action with the terrible Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica suffered from network-directed writing and lacked time to prepare for proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in space is by itself one of the worst consequences. As a historical note, you can watch Galactica, the Star Trek original, and the Revival Trek series. You'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.
