What happened to one of the most innovative and ingenious storytellers of our time? Well, he made a typical summer action food that could be available to anyone outside the film school ... and indeed, they probably would have done a better job. They put at least half a thought in the awful screenplay. Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who crossed a kind of wormhole and landed on a monkey-dominated planet. (gasp!) Aside from this time, the monkeys wind their way through groaning dialogues, nonsensical conspiracies, and eye-catching special effects, which confirm in my mind over and over again that this money could be put into about ten independent films that were considered ''. Masterpiece next to this threesome. <br /> <br /> As much as I like the great acting talent Tim Roth, his performance as a bad monkey leader Thade is nothing but an intense composition of limp and labored breathing. Fortunately, make-up allows him to maintain some dignity as an actor, and most of the manure dialogue hides behind his moaning and sniffing. <br /> <br /> And the ever-reliable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and ultimately connecting them with no relationship development or cause. And the "haha, we are so smart, right?" So Hollywood blends references from the original POTA into these. Sigh ... <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing this, spend the night in and call some friends and hire 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Batman' or even a little 'Sleepy' Hollow ', and remember the time when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... no shame and ridicule.
