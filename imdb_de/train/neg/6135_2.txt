America needs the best possible man to win The Game, so who are they hiring? A gymnast (Oh brother!), Played by Kurt Thomas, who has the skills needed to win in a game involving ninjas, a crazy village, and Richard Norton, who is asked by Kurt Thomas, "his hardware in the To keep pants ". (His exact words) I missed that in the cinemas and that's a good reason, because I would probably have been kicked out because of the laughter I regularly broke into. The first thing that went through my mind was how lame these ninjas are when a gymnast can kick their asses. Kurt Thomas is like 5ft 4 and he hardly beats one as "the best man for the job" As for the theatrical talent of Kurt Thomas, if you can not say something beautiful ... In all seriousness you have to ask yourself how much cocaine was used to deliver such a stupid idea. Only the decision to occupy Tara Reid as a scientist surpasses stupidity. For 18 years this was the title of the stupidest movie I've ever seen. Not to say that I find that unsurpassable, I laughed so much that I almost suffocated. Twice. It was only in the 80s that a movie with such a bad idea could be made. For the record, this is the only movie in which ever such a tiny hero has been shown that he can not even pull a clamped sword out of the ground. This is the weakest action movie ever made, and one of the hottest. <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bath)
