In 1993, "the visitors" was a great success in France. The sequence was inevitable and unfortunately this sequence is one of the worst ever made. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not live up to its promises. In fact, it should tell a single story. Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier with him in the Middle Ages so that time can usually follow their course. The problem is that Clavier feels perfectly well in the world of the twentieth century, and that's why it's pretty hard to bring it back in the Middle Ages storyline. As a result, the film is sometimes confused, sometimes a bit confused. <br /> <br /> But the movie also suffers from the performance of almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap, which they were able to avoid in the first film: they exaggerate and become annoying. Why did Jean-Marie Poiré, the filmmaker, hire Muriel Robin in the female lead role? He made a mistake because she seems uncomfortable and absolutely pathetic. The other actors are no better: Marie-Anne Chazel does not exist and Christian Bujeau is unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film contains some good moments with efficient gags, but it often falls into vulgarity and ease. Certain sequences and dialogues are affected. It also seems hollow, because Poiré takes back elements that have ensured the success of the first film. Therefore, a young girl takes Reno to a close relative of her family and asks him to attend her wedding. <br /> <br /> A tedious and disappointing aftercare. What is the interest of this movie otherwise commercial? <br /> <br />
