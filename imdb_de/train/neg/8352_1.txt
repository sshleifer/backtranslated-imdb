I rented this movie because it falls under the genres "romance" and "western" and some Grand Canyon landscapes are thrown in. However, if you expect a typically healthy western western, forget it. This movie is garbage! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MEDIEVAL MAN! The child is also sought after by other suffering men. It is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is portrayed as virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and her character is usually the one who persecutes the relationship. He tries to scare her off first, but eventually he gives in and they leave as a happy, loving couple. It is outrageous. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this movie can appeal to anyone but pedophiles.
