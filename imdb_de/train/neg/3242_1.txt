Here is a review for people like me. This movie is shit from beginning to end. I threw popcorn on the screen and made my way to the MSF2000. The plot depends on random events and is based on the stupidity of people who are supposed to be intelligent. The lead falls to a cheater, and it does not occur to her that she may be cheated ????? And she is rich ???? And she is a famous psychologist ????? Come on people. She enters the bar at the right moment, when everyone is gathered to talk about cheating on her. This was so staged that it felt like a slap in the face even in half-understood moviegoers. Rainman would have been insulted. I also admit that I understand the dialogue of Mamet with the kind of passion that some people have for meat eaters, war starters and fur carriers. My hatred is so complete that it contradicts logic. But I will try it. That it should not sound real, is good. I do not care. It's like everyone speaks the same way. Mamet can not create characters. All he can do is relentlessly give us his voice through various actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They are confused that everyone has the same character. (His later films, however, are improving.)
