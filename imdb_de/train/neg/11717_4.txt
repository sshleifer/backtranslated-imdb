Many themes or parts of the story are the same as in Leon, other parts felt like another movie, I do not know which, but there is a familiar feeling throughout the movie. It was kind of nice to look at, but it would have been fantastic! If the story had been more original. The topic girl, evil assassin from Leon, is just a little bit changed. The opening scenes are really good :-) It's strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in the cinema :-) My biggest problem was to remember which parts are from Leon, Nikita and whether they are from French or American Version come. If you have not seen Leon, this is a good movie. If you liked this movie, I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Best regards / Rick
