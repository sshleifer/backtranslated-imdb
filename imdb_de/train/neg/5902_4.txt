I assumed that the movie would be completely stupid. With so little expectation, any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the movie, but it was also amusing to enjoy the nonsense that goes on in the individual sections. <br /> <br /> This said there were many things about The Singles Ward that were totally annoying. The entire film was badly dubbed and made the listening of the mouths when listening to their voices very irritating. This lack of professionalism has been surpassed only by the cameos of Mormon celebrities who have no business roles. <br /> <br /> This movie will do well under Mormon, especially in college communities where Singles Ward exists. The conclusion, however, will not provide hope for the poor losers who find themselves unmarried. (Only the pretty girls in the singles ward marry, the fat, the ugly not, but all the ugly men.) Finally, we find out that the entire movie was an advertisement for LDSSingles.com
