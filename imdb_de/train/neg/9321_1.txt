I rented this movie about 4-5 years ago and was immediately disappointed. <br /> <br /> I wanted to watch a B-movie Slasher movie, but got a bowel movement for my eyes. Acting was similar to seeing grass dry. I saw better acting in a softcore movie ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a crazy killer coming out of nowhere baffled me. How was that a horror movie? <br /> <br /> The production value of this film was ridiculous at best. There was no fear. It seemed like a high school student had gotten a new video camera for Christmas. The plot was everywhere, if available. If you are bored of a bad horror movie, if you want to rent it, skip it. There are much better B movies out there.
