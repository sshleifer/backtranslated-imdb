I saw this move several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival, if I remember. I liked it, it showed great potential. I think most of the people here are filming this movie because the movie seemed to be interlinked (according to the filmmaker's own statement on the official website - the short film was shown as a "rough cut") but it was an uncomplicated comedy. I think a lot of people try to read too much into a comedy. They should just make you laugh - that's all. I just did it on his show, so it was successful at this level. Only my 2 cents.
