I found this movie pretty weird. I found it extremely difficult to like this movie from the start, and now that I've thought about it a bit, I can pinpoint the reason for it. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him to the smallest detail (I think Zentropa is one of the best movies ever made), is pretty miscast here, and although I can not imagine who would be better, I'm mine surely it would have been easy enough to take its place and make this film work. Everything else is fine, except for the stabs on weak comedy (A parental joke meeting is not really necessary, filmmaker!) And I really like Richard E. Grant as a British major. It suffers only one thing. Jean-Marc.
