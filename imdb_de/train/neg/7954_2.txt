OK, this movie was really "unique", we should say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented person in the film, though she allegedly had a coke problem during the film. but she said she can not remember much about it. Well, that's her excuse, but what else is it? I can not imagine that they all had a coke problem. Whatever it was not so bad, I mean, the plot was alright and there were some pretty funny moments. although the part the guy gets the thing in the head was a bit too heavy for my taste. I think I was disappointed because Carrie Fisher is so great and this movie has not done anything for her.
