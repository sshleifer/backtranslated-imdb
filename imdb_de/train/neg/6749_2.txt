This mess is so bad that it is not even considered horror. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent is totally wasted in this movie. She is not even the bad guy. The rest of the actors look like porn wannabes and the plot is so lame that I will not even mention it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip the credits to the up and coming band TwoMarlowe "Better Than Sex" is a totally 80s disco candy song. Nice tempo song about gambleing & sex. Much more entertaining than "Bleed". To put it this way, if you have the equipment to copy videos but decide to record the song at the end of the movie, you have a really "BAD" movie.
