This show is terrible. No comedy, no plot, no good characters. America you blindly give the price of real shows. I hate this show along with 30 Rock. Honestly, I'm so glad they canceled this show. Thanks, CBS. hold two and a half men, hold Christine, keep the rules of engagement, see how I meet your mother, who is not funny, but much funnier. This show is a rip off of friends. So that's okay with the same director. But keep this show forever and never bring it back. never never never never never. The only reason I did not rate it as 1 is that it stays awake instead of sleeping. These are the types of movies or TV shows I give. The only reason I was still awake was the audience's laughter and I was looking forward to the next show. I really wish this show would be funny, sorry, but my opinion is stupid. very dumb. I do not understand why everyone loves it. again my opinion but I think the Big Bang theory somehow stupid. my bad sly class bye bye now I have a smile and it is not to look from your show.
