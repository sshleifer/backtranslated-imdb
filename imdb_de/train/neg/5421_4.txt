This is one of those topics that I can deal with a bit more than most people do, as I hate noise and have no idea what they look like in big cities and in New York, especially how people can sleep at all! I am surprised that people today can keep all the noise out. The basic idea of ​​the film is that it becomes an interesting topic. It is a pity that it is so. Tim Robbbins is decent, though apart from a few scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel that looks like Margarita Leiveva), he did not really seem to be around. My biggest hope for this movie is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning and talented actress Margarita Levieva. She does not have much to do, but she is beautiful. Even if they try to look at more girls next door. It saddens me that there can be people like Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian in the world with no retractable skills or talents who are more celebrity and successful than this talented beauty. I was not particularly interested in this movie because the script is not very good, but I'm glad I saw new talents. I hope producers and directors think about Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in their big budget movie. If she can make Megan Fox a star (she's not so hot, and her acting talent is worse than being made for Disney TV shows) from a movie, it should be easy for her, as she is beautiful and has talent ! I would recommend her to change her surname so that we can pronounce him and make him more marketable. I hope that makes her a career, and if there is justice she can come up with some great summer movies over the next few years.
