The movie is a bit boring. It is mostly a silent movie, with the main part of the story being conveyed through a series of voice-overs. Making a silent movie like this is not a bad idea, but this is one of those movies in which the dialogue and the repetitive early scenes just make it boring. They do not understand the reason for the boredom until far into the picture, and then it is too late. The first 40 minutes of the movie are a slow piece of Mexican soft porn and unimaginative soft porn. Later in the film, the style of the first 40 minutes makes sense, but it is too late, because then the audience is lost. There are some nice filming locations at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I've often wondered why there are not more movies being made there. The campus is on the edge of lava fields, giving the campus a very secular atmosphere. My biggest problem with the movie is that the director / writer made the movie as he wanted it to look, regardless of how a viewer who does not know the story will see it. You can not ignore the audience when you tell a story.
