Terrible ending - and I can not believe that Moore spent a year with it. It smells of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, which Hubbard wanted to prove in just three weeks. That was actually disappointing enough to throw my discs from the first 3.5 years. Well, the first 1.5 hours were action packed, albeit absurdly in the premise, and then they deteriorated into a slow, painful release of the series. Unbelievable how slow and tedious the last hour was. Should we think deeper? If I wanted a lesson in materialism, I would read Daniel Quinn's Ishmael again. Absurd to think, 38K people would give up everything for a "new beginning". Absurd to throw a vanishing Kara and a resurgent Baltar and Six. Absurd to throw the mitochondrial night. Simply absurd.
