As a "Jane Eyre" fan, I was excited when this movie came out. "In the end," I thought, "someone will turn that book into a film that follows the story actually written by the author." Not correct!!! If the casting director intended to fill a "Jane" that was unique, he would undoubtedly succeed. Surely he could have found someone who could act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the ghostly tension of the novel when the laughter seemed to float out of nowhere into the night? Where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother? Why was the story changed in the end? One wonders if the screenwriters actually read the book. What a disappointment
