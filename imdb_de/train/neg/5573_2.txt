I can not understand why so many Godzilla fans think this is excellent, one of the best Godzilla movies ever. This movie is horrible and one of the few Gojira movies that I can not see anymore (the other one is G. vs Megalon). <br /> <br /> The plot is too fussy to be in the Heisei series, a series attempting to turn the aging Godzilla franchise into good action movies turned to ideas that came into force in 1974 It just sounded ridiculous, especially on some topics, such as the WW2 scene with the Japanese soldiers A dying Godzillasaurus, a sad and serious sound, praises the exuberant former commander who is serious about his capitalism and his death takes, in a movie that his fans called laughter somehow, a silly game of guilty, illogical fun, if that's the case of one of the tastiest movies I've ever seen, but I think it was the talent that the filmmakers lacked, and this was the case when an action movie right in front of the film went bad. It got worse and worse by the fact that the special effects are incomparably terrible, from the jetpacks to the Android to the hokey sound effects that emanate from everything. It's impossible to take anything seriously, and yet the movie does not expect you to nudges the camera. <br /> <br /> As with almost all Godzilla movies, there is a meaningless romance, and this is no exception, though it can be said that this film is particularly futile and inexplicable. There is literally no reason for romance, it just happens and there are 360 ​​degree commitments to the romance. Apart from that, the other horrible aspect of this movie is the dialogue. Both Japanese and English are terrible, clunky and possibly the inspiration for Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> The Tristar DVD adds the problems together and makes everything look grainy. blurry, muted and just ugly, the same was for the sound. I've seen the Japanese Region 2 version for the first time, and the differences are day and night, with the original vivid colors and textures, the remarkable result, and the fighting scenes, especially the battle scenes that can actually be seen. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the Heisei series is a disappointment, with the exception of Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version) there is little to praise here, and Godzilla Vs. King Ghidorah is an example of this failure. It's not nearly as close to earning the reputation and fans it gets. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points
