A perfect little atrocity ... I doubt that a single shot lasted longer than the regressive MTV of 4.4 seconds. Wistful casting, even worse than in Kusminsky's version (remember: he managed to abuse Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But the rich got what they deserve. Dark and brooding Heathcliff, reduced to the state of a golden-locked angel, the frail and shaky Catherine, portrayed as a chubby melon-breasted pepper, meek and weak, Linton is a peeping tom, and the innocent Isabel becomes Sara Michelle-Gellar's figure Cruel Intentions. The 15-year-old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch are attracting attention. This thing was made for you. It's an hour and a half long music video that gives you everything. They are saved from the uncomfortable need not to even try to understand the complexity of the characters, but even before the initial shock of their actions. The actors tried, but as I said, they were abused. Decent photography, but the cut is at the level of television production class in high school. I implore you all: read the book or even the Cliffnotes; Look at the previous versions, even Kusminsky; However, stay away from the many future reruns where you can not use the commercial premiere.
