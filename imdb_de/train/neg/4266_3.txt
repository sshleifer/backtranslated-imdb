Certainly NOMAD offers some of the best equestrian scenes, sword fights and fantastic landscape shots you'll likely see, but that does not do a movie well. It helps, but history has to show through on these things. And here Nomad wanders. <br /> <br /> The story is matted, which makes them feel like they've been thrown together to just make a "cool" movie that looks "great". Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region where this story takes place (and obvious names like Lee and Hernandez). If filmmakers want to immerse us in a culture like the Jugars and the Kazaks, they damn better use actor / actresses to play the role. <br /> <br /> Tribes, Prophecy, Brotherly Love and Respect A love interest that separates our "heroes" are all addressed, but with so little effect and screen time that most viewers turn them into the next combat sequence, the next Action horse scene or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape will be pushed aside. <br /> <br /> It's worth noting that while filming Nomad, there have been some major changes, especially the director and cameraman. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov and Ueli Steiger (cinematographer) by Dan Laustsen. In a sense, Laustsen seems to have the better eye, as his visions of the countries have made the final cut that we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, switching to Bodrov as a director may not have been the wisest choice. From what I see here, the focus is on the battles and not on the people I feel are Bodrov's eyes and not Passer's. A true travesty. <br /> <br /> The most disgraceful aspect is that this could have been a really fantastic movie that has both character and action lines. Unfortunately, the colleges apparently decided that action was what was needed and took the cheap (intellectual) way out. <br /> <br /> Although I can not rate this movie positively, it's worth looking at it for the amazing movie work. But that's all.
