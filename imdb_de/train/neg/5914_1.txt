This movie is really boring. It was banned in Chinese cinema and I can see why. It is not because it is critical of the communist regime, but simply because the film is of such low quality. I would never want to pay money for it. I love movies from Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and I am disappointed that such a bad movie could come from China. It seems to ignore the audience completely and the director seems to have made the film for himself. The shots of a person who does nothing for a minute are hilarious and there are many of them. The movie quality and video quality are unbelievably bad. I checked this movie on the internet and it seems like people really like this movie. The only explanation I have for that is that some movie fans think that if a movie is not in English, it's automatically good. I see no reason why people would like that. This is not an art film, but a waste of celluloid. (That's when they were actually filmed on film, which they did not do).
