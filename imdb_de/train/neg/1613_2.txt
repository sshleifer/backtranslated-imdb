Now that Che (2008) has finished his relatively short Australian movie run (extremely limited release: 1 screen in Sydney after 6 weeks), I can innocently join the two presenters of "At The Movies" as I take Steven Soderbergh to the task , <Br /> <br /> It's usually satisfying to see a movie director change his style / theme, but Soderbergh's latest stinker, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), also has a story missing, so that narration (and cut? Suddenly those of Soderbergh are the main challenge. Strange, after 20 or more years in business. He was probably never good at the story, just hiding it well in "nervous" projects. <br /> <br /> None of this excuses him that he almost failed. As warns David Stratton, "two parts of Che (not even) make a whole". <br /> <br /> Epic only in name, Che (2008) hardly qualifies as a feature film! It certainly has no legs, because apart from the uncharacteristic, final dissolution that history has imposed on it, Soderbergh's 4.5-hour resentment simply goes nowhere. <br /> <br /> Even Margaret Pomeranz, the more forgiving Australian At The Movies duo, notes about Soderbergh's repeated waste of (HD Digital Storage): "They are in the forest ... They are in the forest ... They are in the forest ...". I am also surprised that Soderbergh did not give us another 2.5 hours of DAS somewhere between his existing two parts, because he still left out large parts of Che's "revolutionary" life! <br /> <br /> For a biopic of an important but notorious historical figure, Soderbergh inexplicably alienates his audience, if not deliberately, insults. <br /> <br /> 1. Never provide most of Che's story ; <br /> <br /> 2. Imposing unreasonable movie lengths with sheer Dullard repetition; <br /> <br /> 3. Ignore both the true review and a narrative of events; <br /> <br /> 4. hardly develop an idea or a character; <br /> <br /> 5. remaining claustrophobic episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. Ignoring the right context for scenes - everything we get bothers us in annoying timeshifts. <br /> <br /> 7. Linguistically dispatch all guests (even Spanish speakers are confused by the contradictory statements in English); and <br /> <br /> 8. mindless whitening of its main theme in one dimension. Why in this late phase? The T-shirt franchise was a success! <br /> <br /> Our sense of claustrophobia is certainly due to the fact that Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen are based their script exclusively on Guevara's memoirs. Like a poor student who has only read ONE of his assigned texts for his commission, Soderbergh's product is extremely limited in his perspective. <br /> <br /> The audience is held captive in the same limited knowledge, scenery, and circumstances by the "revolutionaries," but that does not trigger our sympathy. Instead, it dawns on us that "Ah, Soderbergh is trying to limp his audience just like the Latino farmers back then." But these are the same Latin American peasants who sold the good doctor to his enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to equate ourselves with them and mentally capture us equally? Such a forced hunt for the public must have a purpose. Part 2 is more chronological than Part 1, but it is literally mind-blowing with its repetitive bush bashing, the misery of prospects, and the lack of variety or character sheets. DelToro's Che has no opportunity to grow as a person as he struggles to train his own disciplined troops. The only drawback is the humor, while Che deals with his sometimes completely ignorant "revolutionaries", some of whom are forcibly lacking self-control over local farmers or food. We certainly do not get any insight into the causes of the circumstances and no strategic analysis of their guerrilla insurgency as it was. <br /> <br /> Part2's agonizing countdown remains terribly episodic: again nothing is telegraphed or contextualised. So the scenes with Fidel Castro (Demi√°n Bichir) are unexpected and confusing. All selected events are presented in a minimal and Latin-centered manner, with part1's interviews being replaced by delayed meetings between the corrupt Bolivian president (Joaquim de Almeida) and US government officials, who request a CIA (!) Pledge The rest of Part2 " Woods' and day-by-night blue filters only annoy the audience until they look at the exits. <br /> <br /> Maybe DelToro felt the frustration of many non-Hispanic Latinos too much to never get a truthful, unbroken history of Che's exploits in their own countries. If foreign governments still do not provide their people with a free press - for whatever reason - you can see how a popular American indie producer might put on the not-so-read ("I do not like it.") but I'm NOT illiterate! "- see The Inspector General (1949)) in their own cinemas.The obvious neglect and gross simplifications of the film strongly suggest that he is only interested in understanding the less informed WHO STILL If this were the case, they would have already read books on the subject and criticized the relevant social issues - and learned lessons from history as they should, these insights are exactly what societies still need - and not just the remaining illiterates of Latin America in Central and South America - and Che (2008) unfortunately can not make it. "Soderbergh buries e leadership, because he is weak the narrative. I am amazed at why Benicio deliberately chose DelToro Soderbergh for this project, if he knew that. It's been 44 years, in retrospect, Guevara was urgently searched: That's what I've seen this movie for, but the director robs us diabolically. David Stratton, who starred in The Australian (03-Oct-2009), said that Part1 was "uneven", but "Part2" went from there "downhill" and "Ches last campaign in Bolivia in a painful detail" What "... feels almost unbearably slow and nervous". <br /> Che: The guerrilla aka Part2 is certainly not a travelogue for Bolivia and paints a picture of misery and atavism. The entire second half is resolved only by the aforementioned humor and the dramatic - but tragic - capture and execution of the film. <br /> <br /> The rest of this endless movie screening is just confusing and irritating - shocking for a Soderbergh movie, at all costs. It breaks the hearts of all who know if they know just a little bit about the subject. (2/10)
