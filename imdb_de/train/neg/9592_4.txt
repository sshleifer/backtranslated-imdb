I've only recently seen the movie, though it was released in 2001. I was hoping to see an entertaining movie, but let me tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The "princess" is not very talkative, as you may have noticed ... It reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who just wanted to stare to hold his own, and then beat his opponents the crap. Throughout the film, I waited for at least a confession to hear what she liked, why she fought, who she loved and trusted. I waited in vain. Shitty movie. Foolish dialogue. Just look at it if you do not want to be bored! It's so bad that in the end I wondered how I managed not to scream for frustration for an hour and a half. CA. I give 4/10.
