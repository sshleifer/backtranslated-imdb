This is certainly a comedy I will probably not forget for a while. <br /> <br /> Normally, I would not be interested to comment on this movie: it's so small that no one would ever see it, but as it happens, it's popular in P2P sharing networks like Kazaa, and therefore, this Saaad production must be shown as it is. <br /> <br /> What is it then? Of course it's not a comedy. Instead, it's meant as a horror movie - here, "intended" is the keyword. The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess, the special effects are special only insofar as they are particularly pathetic, and as far as acting is concerned, let's just say that if my final papers had been in elementary school, my teachers would do that swollen over our talents. <br /> <br /> Of course, I realize that this is a very low budget movie and that in these cases you should lower expectations, especially in terms of special effects. Although I'm a big fan of the horror genre, I realize that these films are rarely the place to look for interesting scripts and first-rate acting. <br /> <br /> But still. <Br /> <br /> B movies often have some redeeming features to compensate for the lack of financial resources, such as humor. The only laugh in Cradle to Fear lies in the ridiculous performances. If you can find the humor in it - and I might nod in the first 20 minutes or so - that's the only thing the movie has to offer. Oh, that and two or three pairs of breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how exciting. <br /> <br /> As far as history is concerned, she does not even try to convey anything: the victims either consume drugs and / or are involved in serious crimes. Lesson: Take care, naughty boys and girls, because one day you will be paid to pay for what you have done. <br /> <br /> I'll let my case rest. <br /> <br /> So all in all a bit of sex, a decent amount of drugs, but absolutely zero rock'n'roll. <br /> <br /> I rate this as 1 in 10, but would go to 0 if I could. Or maybe I would not: It deserves a 1 if the names of the actors in the titles are spelled correctly. I mean, that's something, Innit?
