This movie has such an unstoppable cheapness of the B-class for all its scenes, effects, etc., that you think you spent 80% of your budget on Connery. It's like watching some Wing Commander stuff after Star Wars (quite apart from the content). <br /> <br /> Story can be described in one word: FLAT. And oh my god, I can not remember a villain who's been so uninteresting for a long time. We have no reason for him to be so evil (an innate defect, we have to think :), nor any persuasiveness or a sense of his wickedness to hire you "Hunting Forrester".
