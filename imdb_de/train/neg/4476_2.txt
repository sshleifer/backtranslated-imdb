I've just watched this movie on MTV. I have to say that was extremely mediocre (best). The dialogue does not explain the story very well and I felt that there were many storylines. There is no sympathetic character in this adjustment due to bad action. I just think that all characters are far too possessive when it comes to someone they love. The love of Cate and Heath also seems to be very incestuous. They look more like siblings than lovers. I do not understand why the father would accept such a thing under his roof. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie because of some actors I respected and loved in previous films, but like I said, it's extremely hard to like the characters. Katherine Heigel's performance was terrible, which was a shock. She was terrible because she was Edward's bitchy older sister and there just was not enough lines for Aimee Osbourne so I could even criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth was good and it was great to see him in something new, and although his character was a bit crazy, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, but they seemed weepy and overdramatic. <br /> <br /> I just did not enjoy this movie or the music so much. There was a short appearance of the Christian punk band MxPx, but this little gig would not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV really convinced me, this was a movie it was not. I imagined something so different.
