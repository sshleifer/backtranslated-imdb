Holy crap. This was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. All performances are ok, but there is no action. Really! No plot A few clowns talk about this and that and that's your movie. Ug ... Robert Duvall's character is senile and always asks the same people for the same questions. This always brings him the same answers. I'm pretty sure this movie has reached six, because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and well-respected actors, but the actual complete work is a hot shit. Well, maybe this is a bit deceptive, because steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a bit like something that happens in this movie. bag
