I'm not saying the Twisters Night was terrible, but it was not great at all. Mediocre at the absolute best. However, I believe that every time a movie type is released, a second movie has to be at about the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak). Night of the Twisters is really just Twister, except bad and with mundane special effects They were not great, it was the movie itself, the director, the special effects, the whole plot was just too weird to interpret. A series of tornadoes hit a city, and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and dealing with the damage. I really do not know why it seems like duplicates of disaster movies were almost synchronized with each other, but with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt that would have been better.
