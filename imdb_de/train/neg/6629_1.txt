If you've seen the Sholay from 1975, do not look at this movie. If you have not seen the 1975 Sholay yet, go to WATCH IT. But do not look at this movie. This movie contains all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with a remake of Sholay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the best role as a psycho villain (probably the only 40 minutes of the role that should not be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and just amitabh play with his character, it's still worth it. But as Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not live up to his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely outlandish and the only reason I think he plays Prashant Raj in Raj's role is that he has striking similarities with Amitabh of his young days. Sushmita Sen wears well, with grace and make-up. But the price for the "worst performance and every role to date" must go to Nisha Kothari. She manages to reduce her acting to such a level that even a high school drama would surpass her performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a mortal enemy, take him with you in this movie. :)
