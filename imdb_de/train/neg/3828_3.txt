In 1976, the Western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this movie knew it clearly. Instead of getting the project under control and saving ourselves from watching, they did it anyway and managed to do it anyway. Apparently they needed an interesting thread to get the audience to watch the movie and decided to make it as obviously violent and unpleasant as possible. Damn, it worked for The Wild Bunch. Why should not it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a great script, but The Last Hard Men's script is just old-fashioned garbage. <br /> <br /> It's hard to figure out what Charlton Heston and James Coburn have attracted for each of their roles. Heston plays a retired lawyer who is following an escape from convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is abducted by the convicted and subjected to sexual humiliation. <br /> <br /> This is indeed a bloodthirsty movie in which every time someone dies, this in a top detail. It's really disappointing, because the star pairing sounds like an incredible view. There is also no sense of speed or urgency in the movie. It will take forever to get there, but when the action finally comes, it will be adversely affected by the emphasis on wickedness. All in all, this could be the worst movie Heston has ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he wants to reject in his illustrious CV.
