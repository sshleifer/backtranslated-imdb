Every Sunday, three buds meet in a New York diner to celebrate their sexual conquests of the previous night. Sometimes a newly married ex-comrade and Hoochie hunter joins them, hanging on them like a mallet's beak. They are carefree horn dogs, and Mia, who sees them looking for witnesses, decides that they must be taught a lesson, damn it. Ergo, she makes an appointment and empties - why not? All three! <br /> <br /> Gasp. What a wild idea. What a radical, naughty girl. Women now have the right to a date and sleep as much as they want. As much as men too! <br /> <br /> There is one ridiculous element in "Whipped" - the fact that not only during the detailed discussions of the Amigo, the physical functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners who throw them away are the other customers Turn around at the diner and say, "Dude, we're trying to eat here." In fact, a heh-heh gag has an older lady who eagerly takes into account the beneficial sexual properties of certain drinks. A fat fat Kermit the frog "Sheesh" to it. <br /> <br /> It's really unfortunate that a buddy film with a great backdrop, a smart, cute heroine and three possible pairings has to end this way. <br /> <br /> PS - 30 "Whip Oosh" effects for the scriptwriter to use the phrase "You go, girl". It was tired in 2000, and now it is tired. <br /> <br /> Save time and watch some Sex and the City reunions ...
