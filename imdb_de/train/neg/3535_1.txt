OK. Who was it? Who gave the revolver 10 out of 10 points? Are you stumbling with ecstasy whistles? There were so many of you. Did you make it a challenge? Is that a kind of cult? Or has Guy Richie registered 788 times under different names? <br /> <br /> Before I say anything else, I say that. Just because you do not understand a movie does not mean it's not great. Maybe you had a bad day at work or you sat to watch a movie after arguing with your wife and then you were not in the mood. Maybe there is a more basic stumbling block - as if you just do not have the mental capacity or a sophisticated philosophical sense to deal with it. BUT. And that's a very, very big but. The XXL elephant size is a mega-but-all-rounder. <br /> <br /> PLEASE do not confuse the inconsistency because of the complexity, and please do not confuse this two hour non-squirter for an interesting movie. Really. You may think that you are quite smart. You may even think of yourself as a kind of romantic figure: an independent thinker who demands a masterpiece against a chorus of sheep-like naysayers. Please do not. You are embarrassed. <br /> <br /> Revolver is a waste of everyone's time. If you think about whether you have a few minutes, you would recognize it. It was a waste of occupation, a waste of crew, a waste of caterers, and definitely a waste of precious minutes (you can not get them back, you know) from someone unhappy enough to get through these unspeakable, miserable people put mess. <br /> <br /> "No - wait," comes a voice in the darkness. "You just do not understand it, it's NOT LINEAR, that means the story is not in a straight line, this is actually the COMPLEX and SUBTLE work of an AUTEUR, it's addressing difficult EXISTENTIAL questions, and anyway - they FIGHT CLUB planned when it first came out - did not you hear? - because they could not handle the COMPLEXITY - they're eating modest cake now, I hate lynch movies too, Doncha? "<br /> <br / > I do not want to disappoint you, but I'm a big lynch fan. I prefer Memento so an unconventional story does not necessarily fill me with fear. And although I only briefly studied it a few years ago, I am very interested in philosophy. I do not like Revolver for these reasons. I do not like it because it's supposed to be about weighty, generous issues, but it's so insultingly treacherous that they're ridiculous. I'm not a big chess player, but Richie's idea of ​​how chess works seems to be that of a precocious four-year-old. I do not like it because the characters invariably completely alienated me. "Aha!" shouts the Richie apologist. "Guy cleverly tips his hat to Brecht!" Maybe you are right. I think it's more likely that he can not write a decent screenplay for Toffee. <br/> <br /> Comparing Revolver with Fight Club is really educational. The Fight Club has a sour, nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. Revolver has outdated fortune cookies that reject one-liners that bleed your ears. The Fight Club has a great twist, allowing you to reevaluate everything that has happened. As far as I can tell, Revolver has several incomprehensible phrases that are not satisfying, because ... well, they do not make sense. If you keep pulling the rug out of people over and over again, they finally kick you out of their house. And then they lock all the doors and windows. And they never let you in again. Guy Richie always seems to think that it must be philosophical to repeat a mantra of little buzz phrases. Mostly they are spoken, but often they flash with attributions on the screen. It is almost pathological. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film particularly noteworthy is the way in which something so incomprehensible can be so neatly married to all the tired gangster cliches of the world. After all, it is so insignificant. You are not interested in anything. You understand nothing. You go home. <br /> <br /> I actually liked something I really liked: the assassin, who is in a crisis of confidence. He is great. But I can not recommend that you watch the movie just to see it. He is only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please believe me. It is terrible.
