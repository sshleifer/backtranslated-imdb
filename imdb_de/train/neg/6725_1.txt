What could have been a welcoming and emotionally charged character study is completely undermined by the predictable factor. Fox is fine as Nathaniel Ayers, the Julliard-trained musician who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney Orchestra, until he comes into the streets with schizophrenia and finally drives him out into the streets. Reporter Steve Lopez is looking for a good story to improve his career. He gets to know him and tells his story. They take all the elements of the classic movie "How we hit the skids" movies, lend themselves very generously from "A Beautiful Mind", take the wrong attitude "feel good" from movies like "Rocky" - you pick the sequence number - and Lots of melodrama in the style of the 1930s, all that's left on the screen is a burnt out cover of a movie. It is trite, banal, absolutely predictable and too often plays on our feelings. I hate to say it, but this is the kind of movie that when you say you hated it, people will make you look bad. I really wish I could say something positive about this movie, but I really can not. Acting triggers it a bit, but not enough to give more than one star. Strictly made for TV movie material. Not worth your time
