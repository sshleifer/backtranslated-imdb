One question: why? First of all, the premise is not funny or captivating at all. They use tape interviews and animate the audio with animals that speak the parts. First of all, the interviews are not funny or entertaining at first, and even if they were, I'd be sure they were much more entertaining than if they were original without being turned into cartoons. How does that somehow fun? I turned on the CBS Monday night sitcom cast (which has become a normal way for me to relax after stressful Monday working days) and found that out. Of course the sitcom line-up would be repeats anyway, it would be summer, but watching those episodes again would have been more entertaining. I tried to give "CC" a chance. I really did. When it started, I thought, maybe it'll be funny. Nope. And then it went on. It was a long half hour. <br /> <br /> And I can almost see if there was a purpose, if the interviews were shown in their entirety and had points. But no, it was just one-line clips that were quickly cut and put together. It was like a dreadful horrible version of Cartoon Network's "Robot Chicken." I was not a fan of CBS 'now discontinued sitcom "The Class". While that was going on, it was half an hour of setup that I would have had to fight. But when it came down to me deciding on a whole season of these or three more episodes of "Creatures" ... let's just say I'd take the "class". Considering that it has aired for a few hours and I come here to see that I'm the first to comment. Cartoon Roadkill.
