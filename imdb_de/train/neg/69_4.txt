I thought that this was a very confusing version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles and gave their characters some personality. but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical. <br /> <br /> The beginning could have included much more; Maybe start with a shootout and then flash back to see how they got there or something. And I felt that every scene was routinely predictable and signposted, like a very bad TV soap. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to this movie and hoped for something better. I can only say that it surpasses the Mick Jagger version, but not much.
