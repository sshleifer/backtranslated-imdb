Garbage / bad movies are usually not bad, as I will find them pleasant. This is so bad that I have no words to describe it - it is under "bad". At the beginning of the film, you will find instructions that tell you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, the lesson and a dozen or so of beer left me with the whole movie. A tagliner compares this with KILLBILL, which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligence. Obviously. This tagliner had a plan to tempt you to buy this DVD. If you think about buying, do not think! If you do not have this DVD, do not play it and immediately throw it in the trash.
