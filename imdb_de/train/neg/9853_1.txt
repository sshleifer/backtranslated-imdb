I think almost everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist, and this film shows no restraint when trying to make the most of it. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are state of the art, but from a scientific point of view, it just does not work. Hydrogen-filled flying bubbles? They would have to be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there is always the possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with the imagination, do not try it as a fact. Some people will always misunderstand. All in all, the movie is entertaining, but I kept saying, "Oh, brother, what a load ...". If you want FAKE documentation, you will see This Is Spinal Tap instead. Or at least turn off the sound.
