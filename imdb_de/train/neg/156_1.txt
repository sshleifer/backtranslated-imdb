To Warriors should definitely have been an animated series, because as a film, it looks like you're watching an old anime on Acid. The movie just starts out of nowhere and people are flying around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons, until this princess sacrifices herself for your lover on a cloud or something. Whether this princess is a god or an angel is a mystery to me, but soon this flying wind villain comes in and kills her as the guy with the razor wings fights another mystical god / demon / magic thing. The line of action is either not present or it is extremely difficult to follow. You have to be incredibly intelligent to get this movie. The plot will soon follow this Chinese mortal who is being asked by this god to fight against evil flying. We have a very poorly choreographed Uwe Boll fighting scene with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something. Even the visualization is strange, some may say they are stunning and colorful, but I'll say they are blurry and sour trip like (yes, that's a word!). I saw that it was both dubbed and subtitled, and both were equally bad and difficult to understand .... who I joke, I do not understand it at all. It felt like I saw episode 30 of some 80's anime and totally missed out on how the story started or when I read a comic series of 5 in number 4 because I had no idea how this thing was there I can honestly say that this was one of the worst movie experiences ever, as if I saw Inu-Yasha drunk in episode 134 ... yes, that's right, you know not, what the hell is going on Brain is trying to figure that out.
