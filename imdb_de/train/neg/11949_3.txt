This stupid comedy is really a good job to waste comedic talent. Especially Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are badly abused here. I may have laughed once or twice during this movie, but in general it's a boring movie, with a bit of stupidity that's a good measure. Although the premise was routine, it was still not bad, but after the plot was fixed, the movie went nowhere. Do not waste your time with this dropout.
