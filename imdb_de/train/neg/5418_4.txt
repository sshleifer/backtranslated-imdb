This film is like the material S.E. Hinton wrote in the '70s, and Copola adapted to the screen in the early' 80s. If Trueblood had actually been a product of both, the results (especially in the drama department) would have been much better. Instead, we get a rather bad as funny mediocrity. Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street cleaner, I think is the exact description. This was in the days of action movies, in which men were used in their 40s and mid-30s, and they were dressed in greases or some sort of sophisticated selection of aisles, and they fought with lousy 80s music. Nevertheless, Ray is the only janitor of his younger brother Donny (Chad Lowe in a part where he screams a lot), which he inexplicably has to leave behind in a train station as he is rushed to escape the cops and forced to spend time in the Marines to serve. Flash is in the present day and Ray is back in town looking for his brother, who has also become part of the street gangs, although in a gang Ray was an adversary and now old values ​​must be forcibly regulated (and again police must be replaced and this time, the honor of a lady in the action movie sense is defended), before Ray can live with his brother Donny at normal pace. <br /> <br /> The movie is mostly ridiculous. For me that usually causes too much overreaction, even though Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn does not play the waitress he makes friends with. The gang guys and Lowe himself seem a bit over the top in the streets of New York Street. However, the larger lay-up consists of recycled plotlines and perhaps a kind of film that went far beyond its heyday as a product of 1989.
