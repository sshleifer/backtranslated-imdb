This is a kind of weird movie as Santa lives on a cloud in space and fights Satan and his minions ... but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> It has some real laughs. , whether all were intended, is however quite controversial. This movie is not good, but I can say that I really enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br /> I would like this movie about "Santa Claus conquering the Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow or "Santa Claus" with Tim Allen.
