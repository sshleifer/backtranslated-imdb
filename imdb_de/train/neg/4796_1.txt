I love John Saxon in everything he is in. He once takes over the camera, even though he directs a film that should more appropriately be called the "Zombie Death House". The $ 1,000-dollar shock insurance certificate is the expensive way of dear Fred Olen Ray, who has to spend $ 14 on a filmed dump that was whipped up by a big 1970s cheesecake. Ray is the front man at RetroMedia. Incidentally, Ray makes Charles Band hotter than the stucco covers of a Ford Falcon. Just bad now, the two - and boring. It's great that Ray has unearthed this old stuff, and in some cases it's in common like the rest of the dollar-video Huckster, but in the case of Zombie Death House (the word "zombie") is plumply layered over to ownership and to increase the interest of FOR) THE ONLY WAYS TO USE THIS TRIPE IS THE SOLUTION ON THE DOLLAR MARKET FOR CURIOUS COLLECTORS AND SAFE FANS !!! If you want to see real Saxon, get Black Christmas, Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove.
