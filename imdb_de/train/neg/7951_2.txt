I gave 'Kôhî jikô' a low score, not because it was a bad movie, but because it does not do anything worthy of praise. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any work by Hsiao-hsien Hou, but for the uninitiated (including me), "Kôhî jikô" is being announced as a tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. (A Japanese director whose last film was, incidentally, 1962) The film is a very sparse work ... with very little dialogue, history, music or emotions. <br /> <br /> Yo Hitoto plays 'Yoko' an unemployed, wandering character who spends her time at her local café, or loosely explores a Taiwanese composer she likes. Tadanobu Asano plays her boyfriend, who works in a CD shop and occasionally gives in to his otaku interest in trains. And that's all. <br /> <br /> We watch Yoko drinking coffee alone ... walking around ... waiting for a train ... catching a train ... falling asleep on the train. The worldly reality that everyone in Japan can see every day. They capture these ordinary moments of this character, but without understanding these vignettes, it's a completely pointless movie that you can make or watch.
