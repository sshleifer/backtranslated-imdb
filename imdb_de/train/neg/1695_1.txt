OK, when I saw the previews for this movie, I found it really scary and was pretty excited to see it, as well as the group I was in. I live in America, especially during these elections. I see some very deceptive things, but I have to say that these previews were at the top of the list. I do not see how many people this film could fear. I really only noticed two real jump scenes and only one jumped. The whole movie was extremely predictable and that may have messed up some of the jump scenes for me. As far as the sound effects that scare so much, I found them funny at best. Oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the funny moan. How does that scare someone? I can make that sound easy. Do not get me wrong. I've always loved all those really bad, scary movies that you just laughed at all the way.
