Two years ago in Sundance, I loved Josh Kornbluth's directorial debut haiku tunnel. So I was looking forward to his brother (and frequent collaborator) Jacob's, the best thief in the world. This is a drama about a seemingly good kid who grew up in a lower layer of New York. The film is not without its poignant moments. But sometimes Kornbluth works too hard to express the obvious: life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair. <br /> <br /> Finer and more important is our understanding that these characters, in spite of all these somewhat hideous cultural foundations and antisocial behavior that they produce, have no lack of kindness and humanity. We can rely on their language and their living conditions, but we can not exclude their intention. And indeed, their struggles to keep a family under such adversity have a certain nobility that most of us can scarcely appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this area, and his compassion for the people is evident everywhere. <br /> <br /> After all this has been said, the best thief in the world suffers from many painful mistakes (including the title). The characters are not very credible. The writing is uneven. And the plotting line is barely visible. And for many, the most disturbing thing is that Kornbluth uses two young black guys imitating gangsta rap between scenes. Something for everyone, but although I do not want to question the potential realism of this phenomenon, it hurts to see 5-year-old kids having sex with a number of women and talking about it. It is an unnecessary shock and is a forced interest.
