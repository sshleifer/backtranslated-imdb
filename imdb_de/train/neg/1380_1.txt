This was the worst movie I saw on WorldFest and received the least applause afterwards! I can only believe that it receives such recognition, based on the number of well-known actors in the film. It's great to see J.Beals, but she's only a few minutes in the movie. M.Parker is a much better actress than the allowed part. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is completely unsympathetic and therefore boring to see. There is no real emotional depth to the story. A movie about an actor who can not get a job does not feel very original to me. Also the development of the policeman is not. It feels like one of many direct movies that I saw in the 90s
