Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and he shows Rick Hill, who is a kind of bodybuilder and is famous, if I understood correctly. The conspiracy ensues when Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something back from the evil Lord and he has to travel to the Lord's Cave. He encounters many dwarfs and monsters on his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien and, of course, to Conan the Barbarian. This is a rip-off for Conan's great success, and although this is a very stupid movie, it has a lot of good garbage credits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerant movie junkies! <br /> <br /> There are not many feature films in this movie. Some scenes are almost atmospheric and intriguing, but what Deathstalker shows here are naked women and huge muscles from Hill. Women are usually helpless and very stupid, so this is a very macho movie and therefore can not please many feminists! The fighting scenes are nothing special and quite boring, and the monsters are nothing special either. And all the other aspects of the movie are also very amateurish and poorly done, but what did you expect from such a low budget? This tries to be as big as Conan, but fails quite miserably. As I said, fans of turkey cinema might like that, but no one else. This belongs to the category where it is so bad that it is great! <br /> <br /> Deathstalker is still not as bad as it could be, and as a turkey movie, I appreciate it almost as much as other turkeys that are fun. If bad movies are your thing, try them and have fun, but if you do not understand "enjoyable bad movies," stay away. And if someone can not stand much nudity then stay away. Here there is more nudity than violence, and because of these scenes, the film has a rating of R. Otherwise, this could be a sure film of the PG family! <br /> <br /> 4/10
