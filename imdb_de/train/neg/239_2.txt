I will not say this movie was bad, but it was not good either. I expected something good, but I think Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. That was completely old-fashioned. At every stage of this film, I hoped for a turn and what do I get? The girl is burned and wins the love of her aunt. <br /> <br /> Despite their commitment, they must seek permission for every little step they take. You are so damn shy, even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal. Everything she did was crazy crib. <br /> <br /> Hey, we also have kids, but we do not watch them and always have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. Happy family, a cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the father of the poor bride and now it's the other way around. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway, I think I wasted my time. I give a 2/10.
