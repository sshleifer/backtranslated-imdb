Do not get me wrong now, I like Christmas movies. i love a wonderful life and i really enjoy the versions of a christmas song with george c. Scott and Alistair Sim. But this movie is awful. I find the song I love Life, which sings the spirit of the Christmas present, especially painful. Albert Finney sings pretty well in Annie. I do not know what's wrong with him in this movie, but it sounds like someone's trying to sing dead gerbils in a sip. The only thing that saved this movie for us was to turn off the sound and watch the dance numbers that were accompanied by the South Park Christmas CD.
