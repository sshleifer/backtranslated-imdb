I chose this movie for the cover, which was a bad move. It was not funny at all and the main characters were disgusting. The girl was beautiful, but the story and the acting were terrible. It had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. Terrible movie with a surfing theme that has nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie is likely to revive just because she is now in the limelight and married to Gordon Gekko. A bad movie with BIG surfing, REAL surfers and amazing, beautiful cinematographs was IN GODS HANDS.
