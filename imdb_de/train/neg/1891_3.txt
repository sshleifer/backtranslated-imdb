Documentary about nomadic Persians, who make a treacherous crossing of massive mountains to bring their herds to grass. Watching this dumb, black-and-white feature, partly influenced by a twinkle twink twink oriental-funky music that could not have been used in the original show, is even more boring than it sounds. The spectacular scenery is lost on a small black-and-white screen, and it's absolutely impossible to pinpoint any kind of plotline. I loved Nanook of the North and March of the Penguins, but despised this movie despite the similarity of the theme. Physical difficulties alone are just not that interesting.
