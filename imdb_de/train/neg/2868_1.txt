This is an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK killer. The events in this film are not even true. Why they could not make a film out of the real events makes no sense, since the real events are more interesting than this farce. Do not even waste your time and look at it for free. Low budget and a shameful presentation of the events that should not be made fun of what the movie really did. If you would allow me to give this movie a -10, I would do that. The acting was shitty and it looks like it was shot on an old 80s VHS video camera. Save time and money by not watching this movie.
