"Dahmer" is an interesting movie, though I would not use "horror" or "thriller" to describe it. It is rather a minor character study that seems strangely sympathetic to the killer. Jeremy Renner portrays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged, murdered and dismembered his male victims. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and "Rodney", which is well played by Artel Kay√†ru. <br /> <br /> Rodney is almost the more interesting character: he's in love with Dahmer and after escaping an attack, he returns to Dahmer for sex and survives a second attack. <br /> <br /> I think the film is incoherent because it does little to portray Dahmer's formative years, as events may have provoked the human monster we see on screen, and gives no insight into Dahmers Believing he could create sexual zombies of his victims Roles are played well, but the story is thin.
