Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the four films, because there's not much plot, bad acting, quite boring and some really cheesy jokes. But. And that's a big but there is a good actor, a good recurring joke and a good start. The good actor Tim Curry, who a good recurring joke is scary, funny Butler with the sickening hand, the laughs always spasmodic, but laughing things. And the good start is the parody of the excorist. <br /> <br /> The story about Scary Movie 2 is the main character of the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay in a creepy old mansion evening, but they survive the night? This film is not very good, but if you get bored, you can see it just as good!
