Well, I like the blood in this movie - it's undeniable. Everyone who has been to the dentist knows why. The story is really not so bad, the motivations of Corbin Bersen's character are much more meaningful than in most horror films. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse drama, directing, scripts, etc., but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie. So it depends on whether you enjoy this kind of thing or not. I tried to watch the sequel, but it was exactly the same as this movie. Remember, if you enjoy having people tortured by the dentist, then this is the movie for you!
