A bondage, humiliation, S & M show and not much else. The plot is flat, actually only a banal setting for the stylish degenerate set pieces. The moderator of the above-mentioned show, a stupid little man who plays around on stage in dresses, was almost as painful as the attempts at artful editing. The dreamlike end felt attached. Aya Sugimoto was quite persuasive as a tortured main character. Flower and Snake was compared to Eyes Wide Shut. Apart from a few minor similarities on the surface, Kubricks is easily the multi-layered, artistic and atmospheric image.
