!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> You think a story with Archie Gray Owl - an Englishman posing as an Indian - would have brought a lot of humor. In fact, I would say the only way to handle a movie like this is when a remarkable man treats the gullible audience as a comedy. However, Richard Attenborough does something like a crime by making GRAY OWL a serious drama. Worse, he also made an extremely bad movie. Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role, and the romantic subplot between Gray Owl and Pony (played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau) lacks any kind of screen chemistry. But to be fair to the cast, they did not help with the script, which Archie does not portray as the cheeky little friend he makes to deceive everyone because he thinks he's an Native American. The producers and the scriptwriter have made the big mistake that the film has turned around the plot that Archie is an Englishman. That's why I wrote "Possible spoiler". It was revealed late in the movie that the title character of the title is English, but it's obvious that everyone who watched this movie knew in advance that there was absolutely no surprise. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the scenery is sexy and deep is the ecological message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the twentieth century, if truth be told. And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN (and possibly THE TWO TOWERS, if you would like to call it a green message), there was not a really good ecological movie. In fact, most eco-friendly films suck, and that includes GRAY OWL, a movie that did not surprisingly have a serious problem finding a dealer
