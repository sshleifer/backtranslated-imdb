Well, the previews looked weird and I usually do not go to filming on the opening night, especially with my kids because ... well, you never know. Here's a movie that's not appealing to kids or adults, as the jokes are too perverted for kids and fall completely off the floor for adult entertainment. In fact, it was embarrassing for me to be with my 9 and 6 year old and explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells. What happens here is essentially a total distortion of the classic of Dr. Ing. Seuss. It adds a wicked and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for their money. If this was a subplot, it might have been good, but it's the main plot around the movie and "the cat" is more of a subplot when she introduces her mother's neighbor who she really is. Take my advice, read the book and pass the movie on.
