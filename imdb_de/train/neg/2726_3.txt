Considering his descent, this movie should be a lot more fun than it is. Even with a lapping collection of eccentrics in the cast - which lover would not eagerly await a movie that unites Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - The entire event is unremarkable, bleakly shot and often funny. Kim Novak's gifts were not necessarily funny, as she confirmed in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a good comedian, as he skillfully demonstrated in films from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey. I think he gets better out of this mess than anyone else. Except maybe the cat.
