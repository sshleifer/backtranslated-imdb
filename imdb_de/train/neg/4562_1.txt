I did not feel like I was raped like THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS, but BELLE'S MAGICAL WORLD is still the opposite of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its audience, though not so extreme. It's ugly, unconventional, idiotic, and the writing is terribly bad. None of the stories works. These are not the characters we loved about BATB, they are a bunch of people. I wanted to disassemble it, but after a few minutes I gave up because no one who was wise took this claptrap seriously. What we have here are three stories. "The Perfect Word" is a presumptuous, cumbersome study of forgiveness. "Fifi's Folly" works only if you can accept that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that she is a James Bond villain and that Lumiere is an idiot who affects women. "Broken Wing" (or "Broken Wind", as I like to call it) is probably the most vile of all. Beast hates birds? Since when? Do not look at this crap - every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic, a transcendent celebration of love, art, intelligence and the human soul.
