I almost never commented on movies, but I saw the glowing reviews of this "film" and decided to balance myself with my own rating. An instructor of mine got this movie in the mail mixed with his Academy staff (aka the guys who vote on the Oscars) and was so impressed with how awfully constructed this movie was that he brought it into our class. Demonstrate us as you DO NOT put together a movie. <br /> <br /> This film has no plot, the scenes are awful, terribly edited (often with faux "24" picture - in - picture techniques) and the performances (especially the lead role, which it even misses to act as a bad actress) are usually unpleasant. Someone really did not understand the meaning of an introduction, namely the creation of the plot. There is no setup! After half of the movie, neither I nor the rest of the class knew what the movie was about. The inaugural killer shot that triggers a murder is never addressed, and now that I think about it, it may have been a flash forward, the rest of the movie is a flashback, but that cuts off from scene to story directly to the next one as such , <br /> <br /> Pah, I could really go on and on. At the very least, this film gives me new confidence in my own filmmaking skills.
