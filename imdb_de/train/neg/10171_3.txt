A comparison with American graffiti is inevitable. So save time and money by renting this timeless classic. Speaking of punctuality, there was an episode of Cheers in which Norm and Cliff set out to find the most anachronism in a movie. They loved this movie of some songs and some of the clothes were wrong. There was a clever hint, "They built paradise to build a parking lot". The filmmakers hoped to bring us a smile, but basically made me moan. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are incredibly political and socially ingenious for teenagers. Almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the damned movie. Very little of what the characters said was believable. Combine the bad writing and bad acting that this film simply fails. Although there were two exceptions, Kelli Williams revived things as a future flower child, and despite what another reviewer had said, Rick Shroeder was pretty good. To show this brooding quality, which would come to a boil on his later appearance in "N.Y.P.D. Blues".
