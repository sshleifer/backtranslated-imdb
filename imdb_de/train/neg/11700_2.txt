I was really looking forward to this movie, but after seeing it, I was really disappointed. The best was when Stephen King was there. Rober John Berk can not act to save his life, and none of the others. At some gigs, I even laughed out loud! The film was not what I had imagined, after reading the book, which was great, I thought it was darker and much more frightening. If I were Stephen, I would be really angry! <br /> <br /> I do not know why they changed the end. I thought the end of the book was very good. If you just found out that the pie killed your daughter, would not you pass it on to anyone else, right?
