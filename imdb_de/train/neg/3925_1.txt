I saw this "hot" movie when it came out in 1986. He had an X rating for a short oral sex scene, but was played in mainstream theaters (it was an "art" movie). It's probably the first movie ever to feature a respected actress in an explicit sex scene. What I saw was a boring story about a schoolboy (Federico Pitzalis) who (understandably) was in love with an older woman (Maruschka Detmers). As already mentioned, Detmers is very nice with a good body, BUT she has also shown a very good performance. Pitzalis was (to say the least) pretty poor. No wonder he has never made another film. Despite the infamous sex scene (which is explicit but rather short), this was a slow, boring story that bored me silly. The good spectacle of Detmers only helped to a point. Most of the time I looked at my watch and waited patiently for the end. Without this sequence, this movie would have been long forgotten. Boring and slow. You can skip this.
