Granted, I think that Al Pacino is a bad pleasure. He was a good actor up to Scent of a Woman, where he overdosed seemingly irreparably. I had hoped that this film, of which I had heard almost nothing, would be a beautiful little gem. An overlooked, intelligent and engaging urban political thriller ahead of its time. It is not. <br /> <br /> City Hall is a movie that covers its plot with so many characters, names, and "realistic" urban issues that for a while you think it's a plot whose reach is so far-reaching and implicit. Once you learn the truth, it will blow you away. In truth, however, these negotiations and digressions ultimately lead to rather tame and very familiar hallmarks of urban history such as Corruption of Power, two-faced politicians, mafia with police ties, etc. And theoretically, this build-up allows for an exciting thrill that will not keep any of the characters safe is and everything can happen! But it really does not. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and we have several "confessional" monologues who as a whole should form a modern form a kind of fable, a lesson in the moral ambiguity of "real world" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider web of lies and cover-ups, the audience is usually given a somewhat satisfying revelation. I do not think that keeps us in town hall, and although it's a very full movie, I do not think it's very rich.
