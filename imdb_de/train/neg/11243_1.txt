In short, this movie is completely worthless. <br /> <br /> The idea is to make a movie from the perspective of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future. An interesting idea, but the lack of captivating stories or characters prevents us from ever exposing our disbelief, and the idea flutters. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the whole movie was made with actors in front of green screens and we're supposed to be impressed. However, as a graphic designer, the over-softening was an obvious crutch because it masked the difficult sharp edge problem with the green grid. The color is washed out largely without affecting the image quality. And I do not understand why anyone in this movie sees the rendered image as groundbreaking. If anything, the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics - they do not even match the ancient Jurassic Park graphics. The models for the robots were so simple, straightforward and very convincing. On this island there were a number of crazy, prehistoric-looking animals, which are in no way explained. <br /> <br /> The story is unbelievably awful. In fact, I can not believe I did not just leave this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated and based throughout the film on mistrust and fraud. Why is the Morris Paley character even there? We are in no way convinced that Joe is heroic - I mean, he flies a plane and has rescued a person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, there is a great hero for you. Dex has very little time on the screen. Why should we care about Joe trying to save him? Who were the Nepalis who locked Joe and Polly in the pit vault, and why should they do it (remembering that the entire skull operation was robot-controlled)? (a big fall from her outstanding character in "The Crow") are the robots who had captured Joe? They searched for the vials and did not find them. (2) Why the hell should Dex be captured but not killed (he does not or does not know the vials and the bad guys do not know that Polly had the vials and was connected to Joe and therefore to Dex)? (3) Polly states that "they" do not know about Skull, but she has a secret source that contains a fairly complete FBI file. (4) The blank space on the map as described by the Nepalese - if they know all about this mysterious area, why is their map empty at this point? (5) At one point, Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they are burned) - Joe gets new clothes that are identical to his old clothes, but Polly then has to wear a very strange-looking, bulky dress in the same line of continuity Polly suddenly returns her original clothes. <br /> <br /> * sigh *. How far should I change my brain to see this crap? <br /> <br /> We are supposed to be amused by the overproduced music, even if nothing interesting or exciting happens on the screen. <Br /> <br /> And the acting? We're supposed to be impressed with a lot of bad British accents? Which character is not annoying? I think Ling Bai's dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie (she does not have a single line). The dialogue was not a camp and does not even rise to the level of the cheese. It's just bad and annoying. These people are not heroes or captivating; They are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate from, if you ever had the misfortune to meet them in real life. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie is rated above average IMDb. IMHO should compete with "Batman Forever" in the bottom 100 of all time.
