Sure, I like short cartoons, but I did not like them. Of course, kids would love it. But on the other hand, I'm not a kid anymore (though I still think I'm young). I will not tell you anything about the story, for the simple reason there is no story. How is it possible that this comic's dragon was nominated for an Oscar ?! Well, I think that's because people were not much happier in the 1930s than they are now. In the present, in which we live, everything has to go fast. Look at the films today and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society where people are not slow. That's a shame. I wish I had lived in the 30s because it seems so peaceful. But every time there are ups and downs, I think ... <br /> <br /> Finally: If you like music (and frogs), you have to see this cartoon. Do not treat yourself otherwise.
