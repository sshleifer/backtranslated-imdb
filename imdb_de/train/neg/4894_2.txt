Redundant, eternal shots, useless shots, useless scenes are what you'll find in this movie. In other words, it seemed technically bad to me. The musical pieces are amateurish (no would-be synchronization, poorly dubbed, bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The movie is long and boring. At some point, it makes little sense and even less sense. <br /> <br /> But there are some good ideas. Some of the comic elements are actually efficient, especially the opening scene. However, the film is getting worse, so that he is completely unbearable and not understand until the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, which is not true for the movie. That is, the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual movie comes very close to a rip-off.
