After watching the 1996 remake, I thought it would be the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting punished for torturing animals for their skin. The whole movie was pretty funny and in my opinion better than the animated one. But it was actually no second needed. First, when Cruela returns, she does not heal and drive her crazy again. Just let her break out of jail and that's a rap. I did not find it very funny. It's just meant to return an original puppy. I expected it to be Lucky, since he was the most appealing and also had Roger and Anita back. However, they opted for a complete rewrite and addition, not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies and a parrot who thinks he is a dog (smart). Gerard Depardieu's part was pointless. In the end, Cruella suffers too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. She is baked in a giant cake. This was a desperate attempt at physical humor that was supposed to mimic the same effect as the first one. That just did not work. It was too much over the top and not too funny. I was really sorry for Cruella.
