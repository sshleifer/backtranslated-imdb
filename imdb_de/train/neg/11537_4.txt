I had been watching the movie for a while and maybe expected a bit too much. I think Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are good at what they do and were interested in seeing what Dan Reed was able to bring out, but unfortunately it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the movie does not really seem to understand which genre it falls into, and as such does not impress with drama, horror and thriller elements because it does not focused on just one of them and doing well All trades and masters of none. <br /> <br /> The premise (as with most revenge films) is simple, couples get together and leave, something bad happens and they take revenge. It's a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years. Unfortunately, in this case, it is as if Dan Reed thought, "It would be great to do one of those revenge movies that goes a little deeper, showing all characters a more human side and more immersing them in their mental state." There are also some important elements missing in this type of film, there is usually some kind of warning, do not do this, or this could be an element that adds to the tension, but there is nothing like that here Just then, nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens and then it ends. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of really tough competition in this genre and hats from Dan Reed, because I've tried it. No problem with his directing skills, but as far as writing is concerned ... I would say that next time he should stick to the formula for the kind of film he does instead of being too clever, and he will be a quality movie have hands.
