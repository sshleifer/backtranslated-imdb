Jane Russell turned out to be in the eponymous "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" ?? but unfortunately this movie wastes those skills. There's a budget and nice Parisian photography, but the movie just does not work. Ms. Russell seems to play Marilyn Monroe. So no one can play Jane Russell appropriately. Some of the other players are far from their element. <br /> <br /> There are several embarrassing scenes; Above all, be warned: There is a musical number where African cannibals "cook" the brunettes in a pot with their heads after Alan Young sang in a gorilla suit, wasting resources. <br /> <br /> *** Marry Marry Brides (29.10.55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
