The first new recordings of 'Husbands' (less than five minutes) were surprising. I can not say that the new material was Grade A material, but it provided a very solid foundation for a "good" original film that could have "been". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film was put together in 1955, during one day shooting schedules. After the new footage, Jules White decided to include only short footage of "Brideless Groom" in these short films, which makes for a not so smooth transition of the story, leaving Jules and Felix Adler with a short new movie on the end, giving us that Old, worn-out ends of the guys (in this case Moe & Larry) are shot in the butt. <br /> <br /> 3/10
