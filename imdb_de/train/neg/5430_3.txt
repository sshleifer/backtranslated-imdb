Priyadarshan: Whenever a person heard their name, his first thought would be "comedy." For this man is known, or rather. After giving amazing blockbuster comedies like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train is slowly derailing with films like Chupke Chupke and some others whose names I can not remember at the moment. Well, ugly movies like Dhol would torture the first word that came to mind after hearing his name. <br /> <br /> Dhol is a mixture of bad, unpleasant toilet jokes, some drama, poor tension and idiocy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two scenes that were funny but not funny, and secondly, the acting was decent except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (compared to the others in the film), then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and finally the two above mentioned idiots. The mistake in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. The grandma initially resembled a ghost, and she was not funny at all, but rather stupid. <br /> <br /> The plot was the same that was seen in front of you. Four boys behind the girls who need money, but with a few twists. There is a "bad" man who is ridiculously stupid and stupid. And finally, the good wins over the bad and everything is good. The idea of ​​having a Dhol with a ton of money is just not funny. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is its length. After about an hour you are exhausted and want to leave the theater. However, being a critic, it is my responsibility to tolerate the entire two and a half hours of the movie. The film goes on and on, and the same jokes are repeated over and over, and the situation is only permanent in another place. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law comes to your house and starts making fun of everything, send her for this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10.
