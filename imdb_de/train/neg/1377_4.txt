The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters. Fortunately, much-praised director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second-best volleyball movie of all time (lower than Side Out and higher than um). Do not let the cover of this movie put you off. Kill Shot Stars and the upcoming star Koji as modern Sherlock Holmes. With such high-tech equipment as a computer less powerful than my Gameboy, Koji can help the FBI agent to persecute a man who has not committed an obvious crime. While there are other actors in the film, including short cameos by Denise Richards, a gay Negro and a nasty ugly and annoying girl, Koji wears this movie alone. Any fan of movies like The Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot.
