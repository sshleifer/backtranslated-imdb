This movie is the perfect example of how not to shoot a sci-fi movie. The worst tendency in science fiction is to make your subject a terrible, sophomoric, pseudo-Orwellian / Huxley / Whersonian "vision" of the "human future". <br /> <br /> Sci-fi filmmakers (and authors), take yourself very seriously as a geek in view of the high ratio of scrap to gut of their genre. I think other genres with a high CTGSR (yes, I just made it up, relax), like horror or action or even romantic comedy, seem to understand a little better that they are not changing the world through profound changes , "Message." <br /> <br /> Sci-Fi can be quite serious, as many great filmmakers have shown. However, there is an immense disadvantage to the overall concept represented by "Robot Jox" with its low-cost construction of "the future" (unique design element: the bizarre, chic-looking billboards everywhere encourage women to get more babies) and its painful hard "Iliad" parallels (He's NAMED ACHILLES FOR GODS SAKE! I did not pick this up until I saw the movie for the tenth time, but I went to the public school, so the filmmakers are not relieved.) Of course, if you do a crazy movie freak like me, this disadvantage has a big advantage. I love movies like these, because bad movies are often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. I guess it's a kind of Lester Bangs approach to watching movies. <br /> <br /> Note: The main character in this movie (Gary Graham, is that his name? I refuse to look.) Is not that bad. He gets rid of it. He's kind of cool, especially when he's drunk.
