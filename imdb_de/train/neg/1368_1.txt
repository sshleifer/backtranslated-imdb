One is the highest rating I could have given this movie because zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee yew, mindless jumble of a movie with lots of wasted B-list actors who did a better job, written and directed by a man with the mentality of a twelve-year-old who smacks and laughs and jokes in stupid puns. For example, the character of Gene Stapelton (Ding-Bat of All in the Family), who told Marilu Henner's character that she is sexually "swinging in both directions," was a cheap attempt at humor that suggests the general lameness of the film. cheeky humor? Rent Animal House, American Pie (Part 1 Only), Old School or Office Space.
