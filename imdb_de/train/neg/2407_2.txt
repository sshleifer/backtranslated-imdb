I looked at it today, partly attracted by the All-Star cast and partly because I enjoyed so many other films of this kind. However, this should be avoided. There are dozens of badly cut scenes in which continuity does not flow, for example the billiard game at the beginning. The battle scenes with the natives are about as good as you would remember in those old black and white Tarzan movies, you know where to fly a spear through the air and see camera cuts to a dead native who is motionless lying on the floor and protruding from his thigh Is that the immediate death? There are also some pretty unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, like the little girl being saved collecting flowers. The really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch. If you watch this movie, the crabs, which go about 5 km / h forward, the highlight. Somehow, one manages to crawl to David McCullum and give him a sip. It's as if there's no time to get out of the way, as if the obelisk tips over in the city, the natives have all the time in the world to take a step to the left, but he does not scream and he falls on him , Because of Ekland, I only have one 2. And why does the voice of Mccullums develop a stutter in the course of the movie?
