Well, maybe that's the worst movie I've ever seen. They tried these 666 children of Satan, the anti-Christ films, about 1000 times and none of them is good and that is perhaps the worst of them. They think it will be a better movie as they use this wrong blood more often. This movie has no idea, actors and movies are just awful. Not even make up the 10-line minium of this movie. Really nothing to tell, but that's just terrible. How they can make movies in the right head, that just can not understand. That can not be a Hollywood movie, right? Just do not shut up if you use your money wisely.
