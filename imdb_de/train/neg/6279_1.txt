No, <br /> <br /> Basically, you see something that does not make sense. So as not to spoil the movie for people who really want it, take a look at the movie. I will tell the story her own car She follows her, and during this time many events take place, to which she and her family belong. <br /> <br /> I specifically made a report to comment on this movie, how terribly written. The acting was great, the events were great, but history just did not bring it anywhere - it could be added enormously and turned into a worldwide epidemic. I am not sure what the author wanted to achieve with it. Usually most questions are answered at the end of the movie, but in this movie you are asked: what has just happened and 1 hour and 20 minutes have gone by for nothing /> <br /> Spoiler launches__ <br /> <br /> They had this area between two dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would come into our world and kill us. It has not been described extensively throughout the movie, and you never know how it happened, why it was or when it happened. Nothing is explained during the movie. The main character should not even be the main character. At the end of the movie, the guy who finally finds it out and runs away (his sister's boyfriend) should be the main character, but unfortunately the movie ends 20 seconds later. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10 and kicked it out right afterwards. Do not waste your time. I really hope that does not happen again.
