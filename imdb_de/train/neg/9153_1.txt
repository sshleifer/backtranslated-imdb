I have never posted a review, but I had to do it for this movie! This movie is so bad, I tried to justify how bad it is by trying to treat it as kitsch or parody. But it is not. It's really bad unconsciously. This is a serious attempt that falls gloriously. Other reviewers have pointed out the movie's many flaws, so I'm not trying to repeat them, but I urge you to watch this movie. I was either speechless, literally gasping with disbelief or hysterically rolling on the floor. I have not had so much fun watching a movie in years. In fact, I will try to make all my friends see it, because it's the kind of movie that needs to be shared. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: - If Arthur plans to go -go boy (his dancing is incredible) - The gratuitous nudity (the director / main actor just had to get a nude shot) - The preacher's office with his Cardboard and crayon reproduction of Christ - Of course the famous wedding scene with the palms and the forgotten rings (which narrative function does that play?)? - The ex-wife's wrestling match with Ben to take possession of her weapon - The detailed order in which Arthur kills the preacher; he apparently burns him with this incredibly modest game - yes, the gay, religious-fanatic brother with his bleached hair and his WeHo fashion - and my darling using Joplin's "The Entertainer" as opening soundtrack and "Pachebels canon" in D major "as a final soundtrack! - the list goes on and on - a MUST SEE !!!
