I prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles (eg Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The World after Garp). These are my favorite movies by Robin Williams. But Seize the Day, though well played, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie (even worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice) br /> Any good History will have its ups and downs. However, this movie is a giant. I do not need a good Hollywood cheese feast, but I have to have utterly hopelessness for anything but 90 minutes. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse), because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far a person can fall. The answer? Who cares.
