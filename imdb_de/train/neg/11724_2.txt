I once used the name of Wesley Snipes as a clue to look at a new, untested movie in which it appears. This is my Snipes method of film recommendation failed for the first time. Completely. I should have come here first to see these reviews. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be ashamed to waste his otherwise serious efforts in The Contractor. <br /> <br /> One of my worst fears has come to bitter results. I feared that the shaky, blurry, pseudo-documentary, "unconsidered" style of directing and editing (which Paul Greengrass first brought to the attention of "Bloody Sunday") could spread to other films. In the last two films of the Bourne trilogy, Greengass's foul-smelling style has been brought to new heights. My fear had come. In my opinion, these movies are made really bad by these motion sickness-inducing methods that call blurred wiping effects "action reinforcements". But the "Bourne franchise," as Greengrass so affectionately calls his cash cow, apparently convinced other Hollywood's to become unprofessional in search of fast, big money. Action must be clearly photographed and presented, not only hinted at by bad, sluggish cinematographic techniques. <br /> <br /> And "The Contractor" goes so far as to imitate "The Bourne Ultimatum" in indecently repetitive sound bites in the hope that their youthful (apparently evaluated) audience will not notice them. For example, when I hear a police radio crackle again "Yankee-Romeo," I just scream. The chances are good, I can not hear it anymore: I will certainly never see "The Contractor" again. <br /> <br /> I commend those of you who have not seen The Contractor yet: Just be satisfied with the peace that this shortage offers your life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points; I'm tempted to lower that to 1.
