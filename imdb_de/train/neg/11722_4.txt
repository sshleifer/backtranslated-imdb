The problem with THE CONTRACTER is summarized in the opening scene. The CIA wants to kill an international terrorist, so get in touch with the black assassin James Dial. The terrorist appears at the Old Bailey court in London, raising the question of why they want to scare off a terrorist if he's going to spend the rest of his life in jail. He will be taken out of circulation one way or the other. Did not the CIA stand a chance before being arrested? If he accidentally gets a non-guilty verdict, kill him. There is no logical reason to kill someone who will spend his life in a high security prison. <br /> <br /> As the premise sets the story, an audience might ignore the plot hole, but the assay itself gives fuel to the fire. Dial's colleague is killed by a police bullet, and the taxi she drives crashes, but Dial manages to escape. So the police were close enough to shoot somebody, but too far away to catch someone from a car accident? The movie of this kind of conspiracy. Later, Dial finds a police inspector who is pointing at him with a gun and says, "This airport is surrounded by armed copper," but Dial easily manages to escape without explanation. The whole movie cheats on its audience by relying on things that are never explained. This includes an important minor character named Emily Day. Why is she helping Dial, even though he is a wanted refugee? Your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty bad thriller and does not impress the characters of "big names". Wesley Snipes had earlier qualified as a movie star, but killed his career by playing in more and more inadequate films. Charles Dance has also starred in big budget Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3, but he's also known for being a direct dvd player these days, and he's playing a cameo role anyway. People like Lena Headey may become big players in the movies, but they definitely will not include THE CONTRACTER in their CV
