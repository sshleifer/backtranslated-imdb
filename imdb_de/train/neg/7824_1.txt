I saw the movie last night and really wanted to like it. My expectations of the film had been rising and falling since I heard it was made. Some days I saw something spectacular and some days I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I'm a fan, I had high hopes for this movie, but in the end I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I love the Richard Donner films, I may not like their sometimes muddy nature or the changes they've made to Superman's character and powers. Singer, however, chose the worst elements of the Thunder movies and added them to his version. <br /> <br /> Although his Lex Luthor is a bit darker, he is still nothing more than a shyster, a conman and a common criminal. He is no smarter than when Gene Hackman played him. Kevin Spacey is doing his best to play Luthor well, but in the end he succumbs to a simple writing and an unobtrusive dialogue. <br/> <br /> His followers are two-dimensional than even comic followers. Most of them literally have no dialogue in the film. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same figure as Ms. Tesmacher. She seems to be as evil and cold as Lex Luthor, but she only proves to be a submissive who melts after seeing Superman in trouble and betraying Luthor quite predictably. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the movie was Frank Langella Perry White. I was not a big fan of the overflowing Perry White in the Thunder movies, but at least he had a soul. After all, he was an experienced reporter, interested in the truth and a good story. Langella's Perry White is nothing more than a business stooge. He wants everyone to focus on stories related to Superman because they sell newspapers, although every other newspaper does the same. The real stories, the true secrets like blackout and what Lex Luthor is doing now because he's not in jail, do not interest him. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Langella is that he is DULL! Some actors can be calm and sober and yet have an undercurrent that informs you that the water is still deep. Frank Langella is a puddle. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. He's okay, but there's not a single memorable line in the entire movie. Not the fault of the actor. His movements are clearly designed to be graceful, just as even the slightest movement of his fingers affects the way he flies. But it still looks choreographed and artificial. Lois Lane, while poorly written, was played surprisingly well by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, for a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and writer, she is as eloquent as any teenager on Dawson's Creek. James Marsden was my favorite actor in the entire movie, mainly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without superpowers, he manages to find out the message of Lois Lane, flies a plane to the place, boarding the yacht of Luthor and rescues Lois and her son. <br /> <br /> The only moving moment in the movie is when they are all trapped pantry as it is flooded with water and the ship goes down. They see how they are slowly submerged in the water. You know that Superman comes in at the last minute to save her, but you can still feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is very coincidental. Unlike Singer, this is not a movie about a superhero who returns and tries to find his place in the world. As soon as he comes back, the world welcomes him with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy to see him again. Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because he has a chance to settle the score with the man of steel. Superman is proven to be one of the dumbest heroes in the universe. A large green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor is released from jail, he now knows Superman's abilities and weaknesses and yet is unable to connect the dots so Luthor would use kryptonite against him. <br /> <br /> According to the movie, the only thing Superman is good for is really lifting really heavy things. The action sequences are all incredibly predictable.
