Before I saw this movie, I could already say that it was a complete copy of Saw (complete with the hut-like location they were in, and the black man who wanted to break someone's hand to get out of his cuffs get). MJH's name in a movie would normally dismiss me (ugh, can we say BIG?!), But I wanted to try anyway. <br /> <br /> At first I was a bit interested. The acting is absolutely terrible and I laughed at almost every reaction of the characters (especially the man who played "Sulley"). MJH was the worst, but I kept watching. <br /> <br /> But the end was the biggest joke of all! I was seriously shocked and thought, "THAT was the end ?!" Is that a comedy?! <br /> <br /> I thought this bunch of crap would be funnier than the "Scary Movie" pofs and that really says something!
