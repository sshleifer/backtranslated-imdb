What's the most horrific movie ever made? The gynecological nightmare of "Cries and Whispers"? The sour psychodramas of Fassbinder? The unpleasant black comedy of 'Last House on the left? I'm sure that the part of the film-loving audience that ties its masts to Buster Keaton's good ship has only one answer - each of his sound films. <br /> <br /> I do not know what made my soul peel sharper in this movie - the basis of Keaton's intricate and extended physical art for simple slapstick; the painful hesitation of this filmmaker with dialogue - not that he does not have a nice, funny voice or that he can not make fun of dialogue; It's just that the studio does not seem to have given him enough takes, and he seems to remember his lines before he delivers what only gets him - Keaton, not his character, to look stupid; or is it the humiliation of seeing Keaton caught in a shabby sex-farce when he gave us some of the richest reports of romantic frustration in the movie? <br /> <br /> No, I know what was most disturbing - Buster Keaton, the cinema's biggest comedian, seeing him staring alongside Jimmy Durante at his show. It is such horrors that make Dante compose your infernos. <br /> <br /> MGM seems to have the curious idea that the best way to adapt Keaton to the sound was to turn him into a Marx brother, verbal pedantry, lavish, boring "clowning," gambolic slapstick , Theatrical Performance, Triumph through the Chaos and Thelma Todd. Keaton just was not such a funny guy, and where Groucho's malicious tongue and merry opportunism could have made this conspiracy easy, Buster's socially inept professor can not, he's too studied and predictable. <br /> <br /> What Buster needed was an experiment like Lang in 'M' or Rene Clair. he would never have tried to hold back the flood like Chaplin. When talking about a movie like "The General" - playing around with moves - the loss becomes even clearer. <br /> <br /> And the problem is that the film in spots in the flat direction is not so bad - there is a great jerk when a camera on the bus leaves Keaton alone at a train station; and the dissolution, though hardly original, is at least more alive than what has gone before. The way Keaton slows down an action that needs all the zippers is pretty appealing. <br /> <br /> There is a film about loneliness, emotionally crippling order, the numbing effects of education, etc. and fighting. The best way to appreciate this film is not to see the tale of Professor TZ Post, but the disfigured genius Buster Keaton, imprisoned in a jail of mediocrity, puzzled by new technology, mocked by a vicious fate (this Case the studio) a stoic grace preserve. In that sense, it becomes a kind of masterpiece.
