Absolutely nothing happens in this slow, annoying thriller thriller led by Amenabar's usual colleague Mateo Gil. The film, which in a way deals with the effects of boredom and the search for thrill, actually does not provide anything and seems to be an exercise in boredom. The only mildly exciting moment is the highlight of the film, which lasts about 30 seconds of the whole agonizing 100 minutes and is too easy to solve. The plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and although the idea is original, the way history unfolds is arbitrary, and every instrument of action or turn is a result of external influences (Deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without being compelled to show initiative or ingenuity. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll see "Tesis" instead.
