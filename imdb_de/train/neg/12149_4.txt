In Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding the Masses seeks a satirical look at the role of the media in the government. At best, it could be used as the US tries to control the media during the Iraq war, but they feel hollow at the end. There are never really tensions in the story and acting never very well. Worst of all, the direction of the movie is disgusting. Focus more on odd camera angles that convey nothing more than "Is not that a weird way to hold the camera?" Special effects are pretty bad ... at one point the video of a blast is shown green over the city, and it's ridiculous at best. <br /> <br /> The film has some bright spots ... namely the promotion of post-zombie services (including a recovery service and a party bus). But it is not enough to make the movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same low production value, but it has a lot more humor, humor and talent behind it.
