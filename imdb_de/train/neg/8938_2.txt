I still can not believe how bad this movie was. If I'm not a massachist, I do not know if I survived the visit. It looks like it would cost about $ 1,000, but it was not the money that brought it down. The acting was awful - not bad, the third grade students could have read the lines better. Second, the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin, and that's painful in this movie. We do not even see the more attractive chicas in the buff. <br /> <br /> Well, better luck next time, right?
