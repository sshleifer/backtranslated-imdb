I was supposed to check that for a website, and I was optimistic that it might be a cheesy but entertaining rip-off, and it was not even good enough. <br /> <br /> "666: The Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen (even worse than "Godsend"), with scenes that are unceremoniously torn from "The Omen". The ending is even very similar to "The Omen" ends. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that acting, writing and history are all just kidding. When these films make money, I'm sad to see where asylum is going. It's embarrassing.
