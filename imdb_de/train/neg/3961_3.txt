What a dog from a movie. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is pretty good, but she's in the middle of a jungle of hideous script writing, mediocre directing, and playing wood from most of the cast. Many of the characters are terribly wrong, especially the always overrated Colin Friels. <br /> <br /> There is not much in this overbearing trash. Much of the "character development" is done by a stupid, frightened voice and often contradicts completely the behavior of the characters on the screen. In fact, it's hard to understand who the voice overs are talking about because they describe so many different characters that we see on screen! How should we know that Colin Friels (Javo) is an unpredictable, violent and unreliable junkie? One of those stupid voice-overs tells us. If you shout aloud, the nature of your character is half of the movie, and the only thing that lets us know is a funky voice! The real killer are the characters. Everything about them. Her clothes are perfectly groomed and fresh looking from the stand, though we are constantly reminded that they are meant to be artistic children. They are all absurdly well spoken for "junkies". No one seems to have a real understanding of life on skids or gossip, and yet most of them do. <br /> <br /> Monkey Grip does not deserve more attention than a weekday TV movie. So fucked up, perfectly shot and technically presented, but a clich√©-frightening drama that shoots so far that it's plausible and meanders for hours without really going anywhere. At least Noni goes to her birthday costume on every occasion. There is no other reasonable reason to endure this garbage.
