Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review is that there is nothing wrong with this movie. Even if B. Mattei had never done a masterpiece with which he did his job, with some humor and craziness that made him a funny director of Eurotrash. But in the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it. This movie is simply empty, nothing to wake us from the deep sleep you fall into after the first 10 minutes. No sex, no blood (it's supposed to be something snuff?), No actors, no dialogue, just as bad as a 90 'TV movie. Even worse than his last cannibal and zombie epics. So rest, Bruno, you will be remembered forever thanks to an unforgettable event. Gems like: Zombi 3, Robowar, Rats, l'altro Inferno, Virus, Cruel Pine and some others. So if you want to see B Mattei obsessed with jess Franco's new movie, pass it on. I know the career of this nice artisan to track down his old movies and have fun.
