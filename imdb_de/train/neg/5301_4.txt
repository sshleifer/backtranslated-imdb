I bought this movie because it was Shah Rukh Khan's debut. And I also wanted to see how he would do that. I have to say that he is outstanding in his role. Vivya Bharathi is outstanding in this film. Rishi does a wonderful job. Susham Seth is supported. Alok Nath was good in his role. Amrish and Mohnish have also done well. Also DALIP was good in his small role. Doctors shine in a mediocre film. The direction is average. The processing is bad. The story is boring. It tells us about Ravi, a famous pop singer. He has many female fans. One of them is Kaajal. Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and marry. Ravi is killed by his cousins. Kaajal is a widow of Ravi's cousin. They go to Bombay. She encounters Raja. She falls in love with him and marries. Ravi returns. The story is predictable. The climax is predictable. The first half is bored of the actors and the music saved. The second half talks. The music is catchy with a few beautiful songs The first half looks but unimaginative. The images of the song are boring with the exception of "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and a rain song. The costumes are outdated. At some point only for the actors and music Rating-4/10
