I'm a fan of Shakespeare and MST3K, so I was anxiously waiting to see this episode. I'll comment on the movie first, then the MST3K episode. The recipe for this film: Take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material and a budget of $ 1.25. Mix everything well and skip all life and movement until you are dull and lifeless. Serve cold in a large, simple stone kettle. Movie, I give 3 out of 10 points because the actors at least deserve a bit of credit. Okay, now the MST3K episode. I admit it, when I saw it for the first time, I fell asleep halfway. I understand that this was also the reaction of some other people. When I saw it a second time, I realized that there were a lot of smart references and good lines that I had missed the first time. The trick with this episode is: Listen carefully! It takes a few considerations to capture each line. Give a second chance and you will see what I mean. MST3K episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.
