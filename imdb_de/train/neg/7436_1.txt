This movie is a waste of time and money. I waited the whole hour and a half, waiting for it to get better. It moved slowly, the action jumped around, it was not scary or interesting and actually never meant anything. The credits during the introduction were long and long, which was basically like the rest of the movie (long and drawn). Many parts of the story made no sense. I had thought several times during the film that maybe I was "zonet" because the conspiracy was wrong, but my companion had the same problem and assured me that I would not "quit" out of boredom, but it was actually the movie. I have never actually posted a film about a movie here and have been actively watching movies on IMDb for many years. The fact that I actually take the time to write something should be enough to tell you how bad this movie is and that you should not waste time and money on it.
