How can a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel have ANYthing funny? Believe it or not, 'House Bunny' has made it better and funnier. I hope the headmasters had a nice holiday and some money - this film is embarrassing for everyone. It is a cliché from beginning to end. Clichés work well with a script or at least an idea. This film uses only stereotypes of clichés instead of ideas or scripts. It uses the pre-existing persona of actresses, rather than developing characters. Bad, sad and garbage. Now I have to have ten lines of text for a comment. "Really?" Why? As an IT operations manager, this is another example of sloppy coding.
