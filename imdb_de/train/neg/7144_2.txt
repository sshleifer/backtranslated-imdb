It was almost worth it to sit through this horrible "movie" just to know that I can never do such a bad thing again. Drama - 0, Script - 0, Fighting Scenes - 0, Men 's Guide - 0 (Cheddar Bob of 8 miles as a polite war hero who gets the girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is great and not a terrible actress). This is the criterion that I used to average for two. I've lost the count, but I think there's ever a film clich√© in this movie. When the driver, who had allegedly killed her father in a miraculous manner, finally showed up and stood up to her, he consolidated the previous statement from nowhere. Besides, he just shows up without a reason. He has never been mentioned before. I do not know what else to say. Just look at it when it appears on TV in a few years. At least some of them will be cut out for commercials.
