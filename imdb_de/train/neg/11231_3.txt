I love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this movie. But this movie is static. The production value, which is very noble for its budget, does not matter, but the pace is deadly. Granted, these guys do not do much with a lot, but the film fails at the most basic level. It is boring. The editing is glacial and the pacemaker stands. It should have been 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde, who is not seen nearly enough. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, with the trembling of Baltimorean-Brits stutter, we must suffer through endless and tedious portrayals. It feels like a backwater play that has dedicated itself to the video. <br /> <br /> Noble efforts of all involved, but a story that needs this tiredness requires a kick in the pants voice. Instead, it's just a lame retread.
