The gospel of Lou was a great disappointment to me. I received an e-mail from the theater that showed it was a great and inspiring film. It was neither great nor inspiring. The cinematography was pretty funny with the whole movie. The scenes were often flashbacks done in a way that sometimes could not say what it was about. The voices were often distorted for no reason. Also many people in the film were far-fetched. The relationship he has with his ex-son is never clarified. Also the whole movie mostly has a direction, and then suddenly BAM is healed and inspires people. The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life, so he lets his life live the way he lives it. However, if he changes, he does not leave boxing, he teaches others how to go box. Thumbs down.
