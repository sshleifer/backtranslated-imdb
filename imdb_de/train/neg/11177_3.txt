In the seemingly longest 1 hour 35 that I've had to endure for a long time, Al Pacino delivers a precise performance to be sure. Not his usual guy, that was nice. But his character was just pathetic. Somebody to complain about when he stumbles around and forgets dates when we realize that social life in Hollywood has drained him of his vital energy. But in this movie we needed someone we like. And for some reason, every character in the picture said, "I do not know why I like you, Eli" to Al Pacino's husband and I could not even approximate him. <br /> <br /> All other actors played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn did not change their established personalities on television or in previous films. And Kim Basinger was not even long enough in the movie to deliver any performance. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie did not have any momentum. Most scenes never drive the story, but only collect factoids about characters that later led to an anti-climactic ending. It had potential except that she was not ready to build on the story. <br /> <br /> What's the point of the movie? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would make you believe "If Hollywood has you first, you can not get out." Yes exactly! That's why so many people are fired in Hollywood.
