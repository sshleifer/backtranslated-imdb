Nicolas Roeg? He directed the classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NOW, right? Oddly enough, the aforementioned movie was broadcast on BBC television over the weekend, which did not favor today's performance of COLD HEAVEN. <br /> <br /> It's impossible to compare COLD HEAVEN with DON`T LOOK NOW, as they both have the same director and structure, and for the first third of COLD HEAVEN, I thought they had the same The same conspiracy, except that a dead husband had been used instead of a dead child, was indeed focused on this movie, which was about a grieving widow when she saw her deceased husband walking through Venice with a red anorak. This is not the case, but after a third of the runtime, there is a tremendous turn of action, and although it is a major plot turnaround, it is not explained in detail. In fact, very little is said in COLD HEAVEN, which ruins the film. <br /> <br /> People have mentioned the rather poor production values ​​of COLD HEAVEN and it is impossible not to notice them. If I had not been different, I would have thought that this is a TVM, since it creates a television-made feel, to white capital letters in the title sequence. Roeg also tries to introduce Kunsthaus ideas through spoken thought processes, but this does not help the film either. One can not help feeling that Roeg has put all his effort into the scope of action that is completely flat on the screen. </ B> <br /> <br /> Cheap production values, disinterested directing and a really bizarre premise and script make a bad movie
