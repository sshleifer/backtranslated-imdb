It's hard to describe this movie, and you want to make an effort not to reject it too quickly, because you have the feeling that this might be the perfect movie for a 12 year old girl. <br /> <br /> This movie has a nice concept - the modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a twist. It has pretty dreamy pictures and some nice sketches of the relationship between the boy and his single mother and his schoolmate ... a nice start, you could say, but then it got a bit greedy, very greedy, trying to be a science Fiction, a drama, a thriller, a possible romantic love story, fairy tales, a comedy and everything under the sun. The result made the audience feel inadequate. For example, the scene where the girl (played by Risa Goto) was finally awakened by his (Yuki Kohara) kiss, rather than being romantic, it's scary to make us laugh afterwards ... it's a cheap trick because it ruins all the anticipation and emotions that it tried to build for the better half of the movie. I did not read the original story the movie is based on (it's the well-known work) by cartoonist Osamu Tezuka is famous for his intriguing and complicated stories.) I wonder if all the problems are in the original story or in the adaptation occurred? It is illogical even to someone who is used to the "fussy logic" of this Japanese comic. For example, how did Yuki Kohara's character manage to get to the hospital immediately (if it takes a long bus ride) to run away from Risa Goto's character in front of the TV cameras after watching her live interview on the TV? <br /> <br /> There are also some scenes that are copied directly (very uncreative!) from other films and all seem pretty pointless. The famous "The snapdragon has my hand" scene from "The Roman Holiday" <br /> <br /> The film tries to be everything, but he will not do anything ... he is not a fairy tale did not have enough jokes to one To be a comedy ... and oddly enough, there are some scenes that seem like an unwanted "ghost" movie. Nevertheless, one should admit that it has managed to control some of the feelings of the Japanese teenager <br /> <br /> When I watch this movie, I feel that there should be some films that have a warning which states that this film may only be suitable for people under 18 years of age. it would definitely have been on the poster of this movie. <br /> <br />
