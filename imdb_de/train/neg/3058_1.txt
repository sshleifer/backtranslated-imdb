When I was a kid in the 70s, there was a childrens matinee in a local theater every Saturday afternoon and Sunday afternoon (does anyone remember that?). You have shown this thing a year around the Christmas season. Me and some friends went to see it. I was expecting a cool Santa Claus movie. What I got was a terribly dubbed (really scary) movie. <br /> <br /> Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician (do not ask me what they are doing in the same movie) fighting Satan (a joker in a silly devil costume with horns!). The pictures made me shake my place. I always thought Santa was scary at first, that did not help. The guy in the Satan suit did not help. What really shocked me, however, was the wooden bridle stags that pulled Santas sleds. When he wrapped them up and the scary sound they made and the movements - I remember nightmares about those things! All those years later, I still remember leaving this theater, more than a little disturbed by what I saw. My friends were also scared of it somehow. I just saw an ad for it on TV and ALL those nightmares came back. This is a scary, disturbing little Christmas movie that will probably scare off any little kid who sees it. Avoid this - unless you really want to punish your children. This gets a 1.
