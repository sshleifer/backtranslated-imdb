After reading some good reviews about this movie, I thought it was time I looked at it. I do not know why I bothered. Basically, this family is given a clue that leads to a great treasure of ancient treasures hidden during the War of Independence by the Knights Templar. Apparently, it had to be taken out of the hands of the British at all costs. First, why did the knights move the treasure from Europe to America? How did Nic Cages find out that Charlotte was actually a ship? How do you find all hints and riddles in about a minute? And how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded piece of paper in the world? These are just a few of the storylines in this incredible Hollywood action that went awry. Cage has starred in some great action movies - Face-Off and The Rock. Why did he limit himself to that? Is he getting too old ?! His character is really quite annoying - somehow this "ordinary" guy steals the Declaration of Independence, outwits thieves with weapons, flees the FBI and seems generally invincible. The whole movie does not make any sense and, all in all, it was a disappointment.
