I find it sad that Christians (and I am one) feel that we have to make films like "Left Behind". We have much better stories to tell that do not have to be preached. I was very disappointed in this movie. As an aspiring filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see this film as a perfect example of what I'm not going to do with my career in the film.
