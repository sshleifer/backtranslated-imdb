The acting was remarkably well done despite other reviews. Brad Pitt has the role of an annoying, abominable Austrian climber quite well. Other drama is ok. The story may have been intriguing, but somehow it lacks - you never really understand or care about the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, can not attract that audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful landscapes and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic, true story, important events that shaped the world we live in - but I could not deal with this story so much. An unwavering Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected to love this movie * and still be cold. <br /> <br /> It could be a me failing in myself, but I tend to point out the creative end of this movie - direction, script writing, production, editing - somehow they've lost me. It's a shame, because it could have been wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been great. It was not likely to be worth a look, just to see for yourself - but do not expect too much, and maybe you will not be as disappointed as me. Mostly it bored me.
