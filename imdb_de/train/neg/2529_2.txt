Bobby is a stupid kid who smiles way too much and wants sex. So he buys a van to help with this search. Acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic, and the script is nothing more than a loose chain of clich√©s and cheap thrills. The creators of the film obviously wanted to capture the craziness of other films of the time, but they stayed far behind. They even resort to Bobby slipping on a banana skin, because this is supposed to add a comedic value. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito role - but he's just a supporting actor and cliche value for it.
