I did not like the idea of ​​the female turtle at all, since 1987 we knew that TMNT were four brothers with their teacher Splinter and their enemies. Each of the four brothers was named after the great stage names Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel and ... Donatello, so Venus has no meaning or importance here, and I think the old TMNT series was much better than the new one, containing Venus. As a female turtle, no action is added to the story we like. From the TMNT, of which we knew in 1987 there were new enemies in each area, this is a good point to do something, but a female turtle is one very weak point to do something. We want to see more about the TMNT series the same characters we knew in 1987 without this female turtle.
