They can give JMS and the boys a passport for this copy, as they had a small budget at the beginning of their series, but the film is still below average. Do not get me wrong, B5, the series is by far the best TV series ever, but if I saw this movie, I would not have ordered the show. I do not like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are stupid and there are tons of stereotypes. The same goes for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors). Bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it became an incredible spectacle. If you're a B5 fan and have not seen this movie yet, look at it. If you are not a B5 fan, you do not want to see the show.
