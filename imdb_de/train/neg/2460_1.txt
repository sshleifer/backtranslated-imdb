I really wanted to have this movie, but it never gave me a chance. Basically it's Spinal Tap with a hip-hop theme, but it fails miserably. It feels consistently as though it had been written and played by schoolchildren for a school project, and that is also the level at which the humor seems to be aimed. There is no subtlety and more scary for a mockumentary, it never feels like a documentary. And although the lines are not funny at all, an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped - surely everything would be better than the shrill exaggeration we're exposed to. I would recommend this to people who like "comedies" like "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit". People who think words like "butts" are hysterically funny by nature. Other people should stay away and not waste their time.
