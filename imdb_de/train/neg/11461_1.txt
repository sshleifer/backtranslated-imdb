Do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just do not do it. Especially if someone has the luck to slumber by your side. Damn cheek, if you ask me. I was waiting for something to happen - it never did. I'm not one of the people to stop watching a movie in the meantime. I always have to go through it to the end. What a huge mistake. Do yourself a favor and paint a wall and watch it dry - much more entertaining. Do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just do not do it.
