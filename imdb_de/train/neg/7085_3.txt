I really tried to like this movie. It is an important problem in every society: sex addiction. <br /> <br /> In this story we learn that you can lose everything if you are addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and hero endangers because he has endless sex with all kinds of women (crazy, confused, neurotic), his marriage, his job and even his life in danger production values ​​are terrible; mainly acting. Oh, you will NOT enjoy the sex scenes, most of them have a very bad taste and you may think that you are seeing a homemade movie sense. How could such a clever and beautiful woman endure all the unpleasant things of the husband? How could she believe him? The threesome situation is priceless and will make you giggle for a while. <br /> <br /> Also, the scene with the black movie theater staff is simply meaningless and leaves you "wtf?" Think. <br /> <br /> Scenes like these are plentiful. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please avoid it; It's not a soft core, it's not documentation, it's not a dramatic feature. It is a presumptuous effort by a so-called documentary director or whatever. <br /> <br /> Only Mrs. Kinski's flared legs are worth the watch. I caught HBO and am glad I did not spend my money on it. But these 90 minutes of my life will not come back.
