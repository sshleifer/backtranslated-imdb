Oh my ... bad clothes, worse synth music and the worst: David Hasselhoff. The 1980s return to Witchery, an American-Italian co-production directed by Joe 'D'Amato on the production side and a short-run director (Thank You Heaven for Little Wonders), Fabrizio Laurenti. Witchery is being marketed as a follow-up to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (referred to as "La Casa"), providing some modest grocery stores and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A mixture of ghost story, obsession and witchcraft, the movie hops from scene to scene, without slowing down some serious wooden actors and funny day and night mix-ups, whose progress is slowing to an anticipated end , (I love the expression on her face ...) Surprisingly, Laurenti manages to gather some tension and malice in a few - very few - scenes; Unfortunately, these few glimpses of mild film magic are lost quickly and effectively. <br /> <br /> The positive side is experienced when the Gore hits the fan. This section is very effective and entertaining in this classic latex and red 80's style Italo-Gore, when everything was made 100% by hand and is as shocking and vibrant as a modest budget allows. I could only watch with sadistic joy and few laughter all the exaggerated possibilities that indiscriminate characters (and actors) were mutilated and abused one by one. I just felt sorry for Linda Blair, who seems to have had no other role than this good old obsessed girl / woman role ever tried in his career, or it looks like she's looking at his filmography. <br /> <br Well, people - not much more to tell and even less to talk about at home. Do not expect too much if you spend a rainy afternoon with it, and you will probably experience at least a little fun. It also helps if your little lazy heart beats to the beat of the Euro Gore horror of the 80s. Speaking of heart - every film in which David Hasselhoff is impaled by a handsome metal object and bleeding heavily in the room and in the corridors MUST have him in the right place. <br /> <br /> That's my truth - what's yours?
