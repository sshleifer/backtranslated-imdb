Music that gets on its nerves like fingernails on a blackboard and looks so zombo-like that it was a shame to waste the cast by not making a second film; All of them act as real zombies - with the actress of Sabrina the Teenaged Witch as heroes ... a movie that is so terrible that "Stoner" could be considered a cult, but - oh so amateur, the scripts might as well have been carried around by the actors. Their lines were read as they walked slowly through the film - trivial, illogical sets modeled after LA parts, props directly from ToysRus! Has a film ever been made that is so completely and completely incompetent? The logic flies in this jerk against the wind, meaningless, pointless and with a "monster" that is so stupid and uncoordinated that it could not catch a turtle in a refrigerator - lowcut, leggy --- and amazon! It kept my attention all the way through; The way a terrible chain accident with several vehicles in the fog, involving several vehicles, keeps an eye on it ... like a ridiculous Ray Gun fight in a jail on another planet, a pneumatically disadvantaged one , sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter chases down a backward alien refugee --- TO EARTH! Do not let anyone pop on your popcorn, you really enjoy watching this popcorn. It is so bad!
