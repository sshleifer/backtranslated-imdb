This could be a strong candidate for The Worst Flick Ever. Maybe without the presence of John Hurt, it could be tolerated as a children's film. The TRAGEDY of this whole endeavor, however, is that John Hurt, one of the biggest actors on the screen, is weakening. because he did not run away fast enough. As for the rest of the cast, they are just terrible. Janine Turner, fair as she may be, can not act to save her soul. And the lead actor is AWFUL in every way. If you can spare yourself this embarrassment, please do so. It's so bad that it almost hurts.
