I'll probably always see a Woody Alleb movie because you never know when he might return to his former size. Only one or two great moments or lines can be worthwhile. Unfortunately, this movie does not succeed on every score. Saying Thar really makes me sad and even a bit guilty. I'm sure my reaction is similar to many other Woody fans, but what can you say? It's probably time for him to focus on his clarinet, which I think is pretty good. If I say all this, I'll probably go to every new movie Woody will release in the future. There is always hope and I will continue to love and respect The WOODY !!
