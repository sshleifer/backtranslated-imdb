I had to endure teenage, high school, and family conflicts for almost every show. I'm really not interested in high school girls worrying about their relationships. I've spent my time in hell dealing with such issues, and I do not care that fictitious teenagers go through the "lite" versions of the horrors I've endured. I want science fiction. That's the only reason why I'm here. Late in the show, there were a few seconds of science fiction. Finally we see a Proto-Cylon. It was good, but with a problem. Her red eye point would refer to an object of interest. We all know that Cylon Eyedots always scan back and forth and give the machine a world map. The red eye point does not stop to move back and forth. <br /> <br /> I really hope the authors fix this abuse before the second episode.
