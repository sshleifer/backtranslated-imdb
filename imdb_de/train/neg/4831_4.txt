I rented this movie on Netflix after winning all the Oscars to see if it was really that good. <br /> <br /> The Hurt Locker is a very realistic depiction (for the most part) of a group of soldiers rotating in Iraq. The film revolves around Will James, a ruthless soldier who gets his adrenalin problem by taking risks and defusing bombs. <br /> <br /> Where this movie seems to be missing in my opinion is the plot and the direction of the movie. Unlike other films like Black Hawk Down, this film has no clear plot. What this movie is trying to do is focus more on the characters and their different attitude to the war. Bigelow can focus on the characters well, but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to be moving. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, but it feels like a 3-hour movie. One scene in the film that was particularly dreadful and ruined the credibility of the films was the scene that appeared in the middle of the film. It was both unrealistic and very long. Overall, I thought this movie was OK, but the reason why I gave it a 6 instead of a 7 was that it was a big disappointment for winning Best Picture at the Oscars. I felt like this movie could have been so much better, considering that Saving Private had lost Ryan Best Picture, but he was way better than this movie. Another notable mention is Black Hawk Down, who won only 2 Oscars. I honestly do not know how this picture was won. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an action-packed war movie, hire Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten in a year or two.
