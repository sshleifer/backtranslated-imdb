After watching the previews, I felt that this movie would be a great improvement on this fast and furious series. So I had already expected a missing action, but this time it is not loaded with a lot of powerless citizens with fart boxes. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you can only imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a worse plot than definitely, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> This is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen (I'm nice - no, I would not bring a baseball bat to my nuts, as others say.) The action was not just not there, it was I suppose the director thought they could just throw a lot of women and exotic cars and then call it a movie, for example, there's a point in the movie where the guy presses the NOS button and his Lamborghini in and then flies over an SLR-McLaren to win, and after the moment Eddy Griffin got into a fight with one of his "girls" (an imus commentary would work in this case), the girl asks after passing this wonderful scene I could not take it anymore, so I only saw half of this monstrosity, this is the first movie I have ever seen p aar drinks stop to kill all my corrupt brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 1 because 0 is not an option. You'd better go to the local auto showroom and stop at a strip joint on your way home. I will keep all the audience in my prayers.
