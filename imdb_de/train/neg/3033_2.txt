I'm a VERY big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie is awful. By the time Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong, he was the director of that movie, and Jenna was the hottest porn star of all time. Of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could by producing that big budget porn movie. Now I know why they do not make big porn movies anymore. In a fantasy world, porn stars could act, but this is the real world, and they can not act. That's why there are porn stars, if a woman as pretty as Jenna could act, she would have tried to go into porn instead of mainstream movies. Just because your beautiful does not make you a movie star. A good example of this is Traci Lords. When she was 20, she was one of the most beautiful sexy women in the world. She made her way into low budget mainstream movies and could not act. Where is she now? I gave him a 2 instead of 1 just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she made than "Dream Quest." Come on, Jenna, we do not want to hear you talking, as much as we want to have sex. Besides, you, Jenna, would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you had anal on film.
