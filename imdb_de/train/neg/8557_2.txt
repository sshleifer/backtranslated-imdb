I admire 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its openness? Pubic hair and masturbation, especially from boss / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show the truth to everyday "private" events. Unfortunately, the film falls into the area "The Brown Bunny", but with a more pronounced jealousy. Yes, it reflects 'Bunny', with a whole lot of nothing, or too many cinematographic recordings focused on absolutely nothing (or truly blurred)? Feet, hands or genitals. Unfortunately, I can see again why this movie was released and why people rent: real sex-sex scenes and full frontal nudity (equally male and female). Besides, it was a complete waste of time. We quickly learn from a male / female roommate couple after college, where the man has obvious feelings for the woman who sees him as a friend while constantly having sex with her ex-boyfriend. Otherwise we are exposed to the everyday events of her boring life: she works for her parents; He is working on an extremely uninteresting sexual perception project on his computer. For this to work, dialogue must be interesting and action must be real. No work, and it's as boring as someone who drives for an hour, eg. Eg "The Brown Bunny". The only actor who stands out is Kate Winterich, and even she does some questionable acting. (The DVD extra with her in front of a microphone is actually worth it.) Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, because they have bared everything and are not afraid to expose themselves or showering habits, but overall the movie falls flat It has stories that do not fit the scenes, too many boring everyday events, and unconvincing spectacles that you wonder, other than the soft porn factor, why you've rented this.
