I saw this movie recently at a film festival. It is the romance of a former alcoholic unemployed person who has just emerged from a major depression and a single middle-aged woman working in an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clich√©s, took the social theme of the film and turned it into a romantic comedy. The lead actor has done a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic, but Ana Belen is not credible as a woman of the working class, she looks, acts and speaks very much like a "high standing" woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it anyway in all her films. The whole production of the film was very bad. The photography is ugly and does not use the panoramic aspect ratio at all. The dialogue usually sounds completely scripted and boring. The funny situations are typical for Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are poorly resolved. In my opinion, this movie is not worth seeing. Only if you really love Pereira's previous films, you might like to enjoy them a bit. Anyway, I went out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The filmmaker was at the door. I wonder how a director feels when he sees someone leaving one of his films, especially one that everyone should like.
