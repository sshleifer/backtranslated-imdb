... by the like-minded antics of Eric Stanze. A not-so-talented director has staged a not-so-good film, though I still prevailed to the end of the credits, if not in vain to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> A rapist escapes from prison and calls his old flame. After capturing her (though she had come voluntarily) and threatening her with sex (another event she was willing to do), he reveals he has kidnapped three guys who have wronged her in the past. He decides to kill her (huh?), But is defeated and dies instead. The girl's thoughts snap (or something like that) and she takes her anger over the unfortunate guys in the basement under him. <br /> <br /> Okay, the writing is shit: It's lengthy, full of ten-hundredweight words, and there's too much WAY. <br /> <br /> Acting is shit: What a minute, what acting? <br /> <br /> Shooting is shitty: home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of cemetery stuff is just a damn insult. <br /> <br /> And the budget is a joke: ... "Budget", that was the punchline. <br /> <br /> And yet the thing had a charm. In the 70s, these types of films came to the cinemas, with actual budgets and talents, but not today. If you want to watch this kind of violent, sexually exploitative rubbish (do not lie, some of us do), then you'll get it all today. <br /> <br /> Some short hardcore shots in a sex scene, torture with feces, fun with axes, anal rape by broomstick and a long shot of the crazy chick masturbating with the same broom are some of the better elements on the Menu. <br /> <br /> It's not good and it will not be remembered, but not since Joe D'amato's heyday did people make such films. <br /> <br /> 4/10
