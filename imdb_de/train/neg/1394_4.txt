"The Brain Machine" will at least overdrive your own brain to find out what it's about. For an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of humans and the environment, four topics with different backgrounds and different levels of intelligence were selected. Since the only common denominator among them is the fact that every family should have no known family, no hint will come from them. <br /> <br /> The whole affair is overseen by a mysterious, well-known creep as a general, but it seems he is taking a direction from a senator who wishes to remain anonymous. Good call there from the senator. There is also a shadow guard the camera is constantly enlarging, which later claims that he does not take his instructions from the general or the "project". Too bad that he was not effective, he was pretty easily overwhelmed before the whole thing went kablooey. <br /> <br /> The film is a veritable treasure trove of 70s technology with repeated recordings of dial telephones. Computer in room size and a teletypewriter that is not finished. Perhaps this was the basis of the alternative title of the film - "Time Warp"; nothing else would make sense. I myself would like to consider a title written by the murdered Dr. Krisner's experiment entitled "Group Stress Project" was proposed. It applies to actors and viewers alike. Keep an eye on the general's head by the pool when he asks an agent about his gun, a boom microphone is visible above his head seconds. <br /> <br /> You might want to watch this movie if you're a heavy fan of Gerald McRaney. Could he have ever been so young? James Best also appears in a slightly uncharacteristic role as a cryptic Reverend, but does not call him father. To be more in the alley, try to get hold of The Killer Shrews of 1959. At least he does not pretend to take himself seriously.
