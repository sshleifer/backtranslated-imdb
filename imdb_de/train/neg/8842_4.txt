It's quite telling that most of the great reviews for the movie on IMDb are all from people who have rated just one movie during their entire IMDb career, and yes, you guessed it, this movie is "Parasomnia". I've often suspected suspiciously good reviews on IMDb for something other than good movies as underhand marketing, but it seems to be quite transparent in this case. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that Parasomnia is awful, But it does not stop being the good or great movie for which it had the potential. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Patrick Kilpatrick has a great evil doing a brilliant job of projecting menacing and evil. I could easily see that he had what it takes to play a truly memorable evil on a par with Hannibal Lecter. There are some nice pictures in the dream sequences. If the movie had decided to explore this terrain more, it might have been a little better. The very concept of the abominable abuse of hypnosis is also great. <br /> <br /> Although I consider the suspension of disbelief necessary for immersion in a good story, the hallmark of a good story is that you succeed in doing so. If you are angry that you are illogical or just stupid, then you lose the story and that's what happens to me over and over again with this movie. Other reviewers have mentioned this, and I do not want to get into the sphere of spoilers, but I would say that the setup ended up being particularly ridiculous and disappointing, not forgetting the different mental age of a character who was only supposed to have experienced one few years of life. <br /> <br /> All in all, there is the germ of a great idea in diabolically abused hypnotism that unfortunately is not translated into anything special.
