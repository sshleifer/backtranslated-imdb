There was a great movie about Steve Biko. Unfortunately it was not like that. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible actor - absolutely can not convey the great charisma Biko had. Attenborough's big audiences are ridiculous. The Soweto massacre was not like that: Three neat rows of children (some made wagon wheels!) Marched happily into the soldiers' weapons. With Biko dead, the movie quickly becomes a farce. If the fight against apartheid was everything, it was a black people fight, but somehow we should all be caught up in the flight of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important, even though he was not. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire and she does not seem to realize she's in South Africa at all. at all. The forest's family dog ​​gets more lines than the black maid. When the family fled, the woman with whom I saw the movie - by the way one of only about a dozen blacks in a big, full movie theater - fled "This is like the sound of music". She had a point. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is a film by a well-intentioned, if somewhat inappropriate, White Liberal about the struggle of a radical black people. And really, South Africa needs well-meaning white liberals who need a hole in their heads.
