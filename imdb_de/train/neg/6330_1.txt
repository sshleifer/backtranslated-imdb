If you enjoy the original SNL performers, you should avoid this movie at all costs. When this first came out, my friends and I waited more than an hour in line to get to a sold out movie house. Halfway through the movie, the theater was 3/4 empty. We refused to leave and thought it would get better. When the movie was over, we were the only ones left in the theater. The movie lasted only one day in all the theaters and did not disappear anymore. In interviews with "Mr. Mike" he did not want to comment on this film. The film was an inside joke about the SNL episodes that came out right after the movie's release and ended one day. We all tried to contact Mr. Mike by phone and email to get a refund, but were completely ignored.
