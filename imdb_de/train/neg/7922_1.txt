In a distant galaxy is a planet called Ceta. They are native people who worship cats. But the dog people are at war with these cat lovers, and they have no choice but to go to earth and grind people for food. This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie I've ever seen. Leave Ted Mikels to make a movie more ineffective than the low standard already set in previous films. It's like he wants to play limbo in a celluloid game. How deep can he go? The only losers in this scenario are the US viewers. Mr. Mikels and his stupid little little mustache actually have people who STILL buy this crap. <br /> <br /> My Note: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Comment by Ted Mikels; the story behind the making of (9 Â½ minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds Material recorded behind the scenes; Ted Mikel's filmography; and followers for "The Worm Eaters" "Girls in Golden Boots", "The Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Women" (with nudity), "Blood Orgy of the She Devils" & "Die Leichenschleifer"
