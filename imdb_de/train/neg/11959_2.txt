This film is a twisted nonsense of a film that is playing in Japan about a dysfunctional family that comes to a strange violent guest who is just sitting back and watching the four family members in the worst case. Nothing is sacred in this movie, with sex drugs and violence to such a limit. I am surprised that it has exceeded the censors. <br /> <br /> All in all, I believe it will only appeal to those we should not Be encouraging and not as the supposed underlying message that the rest of us should consider. A film that contributes to the worst element of society and is in an already complete wound ... A disappointment from a man who made the sublime Dead or Alive and Audition films.
