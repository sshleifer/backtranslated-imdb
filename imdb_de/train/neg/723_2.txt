I just did not get this movie ... Was it a musical? no..but there were choreographed songs and danced in it ... <br /> <br /> Was it a serious drama ... no, the drama was not good enough for that. <br /> <br /> Is Whoopi Goldberg a serious serious actor? Definitely not. <br /> <br /> I had difficulty staying awake through this disconnected movie. The message about apartheid and the homage to students who died during a student crash are noted. But as entertainment this was very bad and as a documentary film it was worse. <br /> <br /> See for yourself, but in fairness I hated it
