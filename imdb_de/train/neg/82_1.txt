This movie is shit. It was really a waste of my life. The acting was cruel, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people are "terrorized" by this pathetic "crazy murderer", but can not defend themselves in any way. And this is after taking a raft on a camping excursion without equipment and having turned up at a campsite that has already been assembled and fully stocked with food and clothing and the daughters' headphones. After their boat disappears, they panic that they are stuck in the forest, but then the daughters' boyfriend just shows up and they never seem to think they could just walk out of the woods like he did. As I said, this movie is shit. A complete joke. Do not let your girlfriend persuade you to look at her.
