METAMORPHOSIS I work my way through the Movie Pack Collection of Chilling Classics 50, and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film in the set. METAMORPHOSIS was released in 1990 and appears to be a remake of "The Atom Age Vampire," which included a scientist with similar results. METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie in my modern form. A university researcher is working to crack the human genome to create a serum that prevents aging. Under pressure from the administration to publish its papers; and, to get results (or risk losing funding), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! At first thought that he had no adverse side effects, he finally discovers that the serum has changed him in an unexpected way! <br /> <br /> The acting is stilted; and the performances left much to my interest in the film. The score stunned. And the science behind the experiments and their results is not just wrong. it is absurd; it is ridiculous ?? at best. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the ending turns into a gag of over 30 minutes, which seems to be endless. Without betraying too much, I would call this: "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the creature from the Black Lagoon meeting alone at home."
