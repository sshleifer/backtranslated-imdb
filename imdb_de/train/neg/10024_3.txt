First lesson that some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - only "style" does not sell. I think Tashan, if translated, means style. Second, if you're damn focused on selling style, that does not save you a decent story. <br /> <br /> Tashan has a story that would have been enough with a better director. It is not smooth though. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at various points in the story. But this setup is not used properly. There could have been a better mix and match of her stories. Action sequences date from the seventies. The choreography of the movie is terrible. I think Vaibhavi Merchant has just slept through this movie. Vishal-Shekhar has achieved a good result, but it is not part of this film. Why is there a Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is not the cool Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) on Anil Kapoor when he's the one who is English crazy? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is saving the movie. But he is in his stereotype self. You will not mind missing this movie.
