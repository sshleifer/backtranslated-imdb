I would have given this film a zero of ten, but I'll give it a two. Reason one is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the movie, which is not really a reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this movie and makes a smooch with Kamal. I love Rani very much and have the respect that she is a great actress. That's why I did not enjoy kissing Kamal in this movie, but that's no big deal. However, enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film felt, we are actually talking about this movie. Is it good or bad? I think it's a totally stupid movie that made me yawn. I am a fantastic critic. You can see my other 250+ reviews by clicking on my name. I have a good taste. The movie is not entertaining, it's one thing, and if it's supposed to hit the cinema hard, why is there no moral in this movie? It is a biased film that is not a true story and stinks. As I watched Kamal kissing these actresses, I became ill. You can not kiss properly anyway.
