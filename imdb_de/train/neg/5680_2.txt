If at least the cruelty and the vast deaths had a purpose for the story to justify their recording, but the script was simply incomprehensible and just stupid. It was just a few lengthy, pointless snuffing scenes and a really stupid end, as if to say, "The end of it * beep you, my haters, and my few defenders guarding my garbage." <br /> <br / I do not understand, a masked killer whose mask has never been removed in prison, a rape scene in prison that is believed to have raped and killed an ugly, deformed serial killer, and nothing other? No explanation, no punishment, a really weak chief policeman who was a waste of an actor like Pare who had not tried to kill the guy who killed his cops, tortured a baby, a woman and a dog and sent them to you Watch video. <br /> <br /> Cops who, for unknown reasons, all wandered off alone in the dark in his farmhouse at night, like a bunch of poorly written teenage characters being killed in an assassination, time like a bunch of idiots, and no one else Policeman hears them die one after the other in the dark and simply wanders on for no reason, until each one is killed in turn. <br /> <br /> A bunch of horrible real animal snuff scenes at the beginning for no reason or explanation, he remembered, watching him masturbate, it was a comedy for him ... what was that? No, Boll just thought about throwing it to bother animal lovers ... whatever. <br /> <br /> Then Pare believes in the word of a psychological path to let his family go when he kills himself ... a gullible, stupid policeman you've never seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I try not to hate his works completely. I'm trying to find a reason to explain a horror author's art, but that stuff ... just crap. <br /> <br /> Boll, what are you doing more? I hope you find out because I know a lot of meritorious people who can not dream of keeping the budget you get over and over again to make their films. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see Boll On his best check "Postal" it was actually okay.
