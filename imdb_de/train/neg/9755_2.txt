This 1974 Naschy Tour is led by Leon Klimovsky, and a glimpse of the promotional photos and packaging may lead you to believe that this medieval move lies between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania." Unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> This is a strict PG affair with tame torture sequences, no nudity and little edge. Naschy (of whom I'm a fan) shows up as Gilles de Lancre, "Antiguo Mariscal de la nacion". Unfortunately, he is more pantomime villain than anything else. With this movie you have the feeling that we have seen him (and it) before. Strictly therefore only for Naschy.
