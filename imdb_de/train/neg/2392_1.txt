We actually looked at it twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time. Maybe we had missed something ... No, what was missing was missed from the beginning of pre-production. I actually went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and discovered that what I found funny and exciting at the time was just so much disjointed and blurry garbage. > So the initial problem with the movie was the decision to do it at all, and the rest of the move evolved from there. It works absolutely nothing - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful outdoor shots are muted by random camera positioning indoors. At least, all actors look uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson is positively humbled except for Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression that she is too ignorant to realize just how horrible her performance really is. Dialogue is a long, unwavering fear. Scenes do not make sense from second to second and the connections between them are not there. And yet the film stumbles blindly and is convinced that he says something profound. <br /> <br /> That's too bad to be funny at all; it is just painful. Gus Van Zant has made other good to great films that I'd like to recommend to you, and I'm happy that he survived this mess (and it seems he learned it).
