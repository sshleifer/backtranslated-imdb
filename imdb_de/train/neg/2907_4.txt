Often China's biggest film has been chosen by Chinese critics and Chinese film lovers from the outside, and frankly, I do not understand it at all. What I saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable, with a bold director and acting. Wei Wei (do not laugh) is this shrew, a young married woman who has been suffering from her tubercular husband (Yu Shi) in recent years. It is after World War II, and they live with the man's teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a rundown house with not much money (the man was wealthy when they got married). One of them is the man's old best friend (Wei Li), who as a teenager was also the woman's friend. She wonders if she could escape from her husband with this man while the husband knows next to nothing and thinks that he might betroth his little sister to his boyfriend. That's the setup, and it's not going anywhere you would not expect. I actually saw the remake, led by Blue Kite director Zhuangzhuang Tian. It runs half an hour longer and is actually boring, but at least it was pretty. This supposed classic is pretty unbearable.
