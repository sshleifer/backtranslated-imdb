Yes, I rated this movie as horrible. However, it will be in my rotation of Christmas movies from now on. This is really so bad that it is good. This is another production by K. Gordon Murray (read: buys a really cheap / bad Mexican movie, spends zero money syncing it in English and publishes it to Kiddie Matinees in the mid-1960s.) It's a shame that I stumbled here so late I am sure that some "mood enhancers" would make this an even better experience. I will not repeat what so many of the other reviewers have already said: a Merlin Christmas movie, The Devil, Mechanical Reindeer, and some of the most pathetic child actor I've ever seen. I plan to go back and forth over the holidays with Kelsey Grammar's "A Christmas Carol." Really a holiday experience in hell. If I can only find "To All A Goodnight (aka Slayride)" on DVD, I have a triple feature that is unbeatable. You have to see this movie. It moves so slowly that I challenge you not to touch the fast-forward button - especially with the two dance routines! This thing stinks like an expensive bleu cheese tip, you have to pass the stench to enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad Amigos!
