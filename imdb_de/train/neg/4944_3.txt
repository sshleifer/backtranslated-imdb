Why is this show shit? Unfortunately, that's really the only question, because there is no doubt. <br /> <br /> For those who are unfamiliar with the premise of the show, the doomed series Cavemen focuses on a series of Neanderthals and their effort to exist in modern-day America, and is based on the characters which can be seen in a series of television commercials for Geico Insurance. The concept is solid and there is every reason to believe that it could be executed successfully. <br /> <br /> I had to think about it for a while, but then came the slogan from the commercials - something to the effect of "We are not so different from you", gave me the key to the sucking drama. Although Cavemen / Neanderthals are actually a different species than humanity, the title characters of this show, like those of us, are the boring idiots. <br /> <br /> Maybe my background is a game writer - not a soulless, hacking committee writer from California - but this show had so much potential and none of it was realized. In the beginning, the producers should have focused on the funny things that would differentiate cavemen from us. <br /> <br /> What could be weird, for example, if you gave them jobs like eternal students and furniture merchants, if you were more interested in things like underground utility workers and guides in cave parks? Why should they play prosaic games like squash, if an entire episode could be devoted to them by looking for hunting licenses for a game with spears? A show like this could write for itself, and it takes some wanton bad lyrics to make it so crappy and boring. <br /> <br /> Another annoying aspect of this show is the attempt to portray the cave dwellers as a victim in the number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities. Yawning! It has been done so many times and never more desolate than this. And as mentioned earlier, Neanderthals are actually a different species, so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is both unresolved and wrong. <br /> <br /> Answers are welcome, even those of anyone who wants to say something to me why I'm wrong I would like to enjoy this show and I'm just sorry that I have not made it yet.
