After counting the use of the f-word, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the movie, we heard some really bad actors going about a woman and a horse, much like 12-year-old boys Naughty together, well, we turned it off. Relying on unfounded profanity and overcrowded humor is a sure sign of a Hollywood loser, a product of uninspired and non-talented writers. <br /> <br /> We gave him a second chance because we were sure it would get better. No dice. Later, my friend skipped the rest of the movie in case the movie would improve, still no dice. <br /> <br /> The main character had a cool bike. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it This is for everyone, except for really immature teens or for boys.
