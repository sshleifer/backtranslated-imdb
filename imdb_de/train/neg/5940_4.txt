Look, I read and read these comments and there are a lot of them I want to say but I will try to make it short but clean. <br /> <br /> First of all, we forget all about how bad this movie was made ... As it showed nothing of Notorious and I agree with most of the people who said it was "Hollywood", I mean, what do you expect a real life story? When will people wake up and see that you will never find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie ... Everything is covered up and deeply hidden. Second, I'm not against 2pac or Biggie either. I love them both, but 2pac and Lil Kim have certainly embarrassed themselves in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Well , for those who say that the film is fantastic and can not see the truth, you are too blind to see it too, because you think you know something about BIG, or you do not know anything about him and love this Hollywood teen films. Use your mind and see through the clouds ... There are a lot of them that you could say when it comes to this topic. I did not say 60% of what I have to say because it is a very broad topic, but for the movie I can only say that it could have been a bit, I mean much better. But still, I'm just a person who gives their opinion ... No hard feelings ... <br /> <br /> Look, I love Hip Hop and I live for it, but after watching this movie, that is every human being a little The intelligence could realize that someone should not live like this. With all due respect to 2pac and BIG, like all other artists who earn a living, you should call the other side because you ruin the youth ... to bring the children the wrong message and that is: do not go to school, but live off the streets, get fed up and just grab the paper ... <br /> <br /> The true hip-hop should be love and intelligence, be smart and everything. <br /> <OK, I know that many of you think I'm crazy, but that's just my point of view. Look, maybe I'm wrong about something and I'm not saying that this is a totally bad movie, because even if I'm 17, 18 years in Hip Hop, I still do not know about 2pac or Biggie, no matter how many articles I have Read or How much do I support them and listen to their music ... Like most of you out there. Only people who are really close to them and the killers know the truth behind it. <br /> <br /> And finally, I just want to Biggie- and Tupac fans and her family say these two men have been and will be the greatest of all time, no matter how they have lived their lives, but PLEASE NOTE IN THE FUTURE BETTER TO BE LEARN AND LOVE TO EACH OTHER, THINK EVEN FOR EACH THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO BECAUSE AT THE END .. .its NOT ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY OR FAME U COULD BE ACHIEVED AND HOW FAST U WATCH UP MAY COULD THAT yOUR OWN FULLY ACHIEVED aND yOUR SOUL, yOUR BODY aND UNDERSTANDING FILL ... you will live a life after death !!!! Peace and love for you all !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, AALIYAH, LINKSAUGE, JAM MASTER JAY AND THE OTHERS WHO CHANGE IN THIS WORLD !!!!
