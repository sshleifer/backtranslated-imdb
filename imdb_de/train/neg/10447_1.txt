I chose this movie because it has achieved a good score here on IMDb. But many people either have a really bad taste or someone has corrected the score. In any case, it was a real disappointment. The film is just as stupid and far-fetched, as the title suggests. There is really no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here it is: It felt like someone was thinking, "Would not it be cool to make a movie with snakes in the plane?" Reason would go crazy and start biting and so?!? "And that's it! The plot is thin and unoriginal. The snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners in a movie that no one in the world will recommend to anyone!). Acting is bad and all people are incredible stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!
