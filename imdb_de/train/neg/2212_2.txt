This low-budget B-horror plot offers all the amenities - crazy scientists including miners, vicious corporate greed in the pharmaceutical industry, eccentric and extreme genetic engineering, and information technology ... can not help it. <br /> <Begin with a strange succession of hot-looking, nameless boat runners foolishly deciding to take a bath near an unknown island, and end up with a swarm of swarming hammerhead sharks ..... <br /> <br /> Too weak backstory suggesting the share price of a generics company causing its evil Shakespeare boss to entertain a relentless offer from a former employee / scientist who has been deprived of his job as a research leader and who also happens to have a nutshell. Of course (totally Herbert West wannabe). He offers a new stem cell technology that could earn money ... or so it seems ... This attracts several employees to his Moreau Ish Island (this was probably an impressive exit package from the company He was fired to become one Island) to validate its scientific findings, including the CEO and the ex-fianc√©e of the son of the mad scientist who has now transformed Sharkuman (how practical) ... <br /> <The plan is, in a sense, to rekindle the lost love between the former wedding while at the same time avenging the former colleagues for its termination. (Sheez, how can this guy be bitter, he has his own friggenian island ...). Soon all are on the run (from the endless supply of security guards carrying heavy weapons, can there be an unknown island without man-eating plants ?, the Sharky son's appetite for slaughter, Quack Daddy's breeding plans, and the lack of a cell phone signal ) ... and everyone has to learn to work to come from the island! <br /> <br /> Will someone escape? Will a new species be created? Look at it and find out. <br /> <br /> There is some entertainment in this movie, but do not expect much ... for the true Combs fan, this is obvious. <br /> <br /> Do not say I did not warn you.
