The idea of ​​In the Name of People is good, a murderer does not want his only daughter to end up in an asylum, and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter. And you might expect the actors, especially Scott Bakula, to do good acting, unfortunately not! In the name of the people, it turns out that this is the regular tear-hunter. The flashbacks with the girl killed are pretty pathetic and at some point you can easily predict what the actors are going to say ... If you want to watch a good movie on this subject, check out Dean Man Walking!
