Hey look, mess with it, there are far better portrayals of the plight of black America than these. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism focuses on the bad execution of the story that I mentioned beating. <br /> <br /> This was done in the mid-80's and is terrible in the music / music department. It's fun to see Oprah regarded as a crack-whore guy of the last few days. <br /> <br /> The scene where Bigger stuffs Elizabeth McGovern in the incinerator. Pure classical cinema. First of all, I do not care how drunk you are, you'll respond to a 1200F degree flame (no matter how bad your actions are). But they really milked that scene ... it was weird. I'll tell you something, I had great satisfaction when Elizabeth McGovern burned in a false death. She is getting on my nerves.
