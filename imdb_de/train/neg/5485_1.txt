Without repeating what was said above about this movie, I would like to add that I was looking forward to watching this movie ... the cast / the location and the work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom etc. It had a vague shade of vision Do not look at history from the beginning. A stay in another environment (again in Italy) to relieve the heartbreak of loss ... or did I perhaps see it that way? So I sat there waiting for the story to evolve and turn what we expect with this family in a foreign European country upside down ... and I sat there and sat there ... and you know what ? nothing really happens and I mean nothing !! They do not even have the chance to dive into the characters because they are so one-dimensional and empty. They are convinced by the speed of the movie that something would happen that would turn the entire movie upside down. The eldest daughters who flirted with the local Vespa boys had plenty of room to move the film in a different direction, the recent daughters' visions of their deceased mother were a futile and pointless exercise, the father's attempts to seduce one of his students he felt ridiculous about his age. It felt as if the script had made a last call, deciding at the last minute to gut the story and keep it to a minimum. When the credits start to roll (unexpectedly), you can not help but feel deprived of your time spent watching this pile of rubbish.
