The original Lensman novel series is a classic of the genre. It's a pure SF adventure with some substance (here and there), and I've always wondered why Hollywood did not filmed it literally because that's exactly what they love: massive explosions, super-weapons, over-exploits, the hero girl, aliens (big CGI potential), good against evil in the purest form, etc. etc. Instead (and remember, I'm a Japan-O-Phile and anime lover), we get those terrible kiddies Starring Wars (ironically when the latter occasionally rips off the books) Pastiches mumbles the story to "Thundercats" level. Kimball Kinnison, the epitome of the Galactic Patrol Officer and the second level that Lensman portrayed as a young boy, is pathetic (etc). I just can not understand why the creators did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and could earn a lot more money (FAR!) By saying it directly. That makes no sense.
