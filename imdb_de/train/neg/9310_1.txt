OK - I love this movie ... I'll credit this movie - alone - for turning me into a die-hard horror fanatic. I could never watch this movie alone. I have also heard many stories about the impact of its original release in theaters and over its viewers. Incredible masterpiece .... Terrible, psychological stuff makes my pants off. Oh, bless her heart, whoever made this great movie. I love it. I found the whole movie decent and interesting. This movie is so scary - that's the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life! Not that what's going on in the movie and the idea of ​​the movie are not scary enough, but what has always intrigued me - was Brendan's great acting. Best horror movie ever. Nothing can ever be so scary. Halloween viewing at its finest.
