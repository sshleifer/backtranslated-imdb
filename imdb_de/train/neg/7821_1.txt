Did the filmmakers even preview them before they were released? The script jumps from place to place without much explanation. The beginning does not clarify if it is a prequel or not. It starts with Superman's beginnings on earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie - which does not really make the viewer aware of it. Very confusing! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential house robber, as a stalker and as someone who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character rarely makes an interesting hero. The end is absolutely ridiculous. Superman, who ended up in a hospital, got me killed. I'm seriously waiting for a SNL sketch in which Superman appears on Maury Povich and Maury says, "The results are in - in the case of the child, Superman, you are the father." In summary, OK, if you're dealing with Superman and Kevin Spacey, but a BAD screenplay. The movie is basically not customizable.
