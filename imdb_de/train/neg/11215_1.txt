Okay, at first the movie seemed pretty good, although it moved pretty fast and although it only had a budget of $ 60,000, it was fine, but if you found your sister dead in a lake and figured out who might have killed her Why should you chase him around and pull a weapon with just a bullet on him, waste them and land in front of him all retarded and killed? And after finding your sister dead in the lake and finding a clue and figuring out who the killer was, why not give this clue to the police, who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie, when she behaves like her sister who was a waitress, and she talks to the villain she was supposed to be meeting him from, she met him somewhere and realized that she was dead and what her "proof" happened. I do not know that I was not satisfied with the end. This movie could have been so much better if it had taken longer and the drama was better and the end was not so bad! Do not waste your money on this movie, because if you do so, you can also post a review here and you will not be happy.
