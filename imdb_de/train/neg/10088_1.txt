I'm an actor, producer, director and my facts are facts. This project was the worst movie in film history. From producer to director and editing this so-called movie is a joke and I mean a BIG joke. Why should blockbuster release such crap? I take my work very seriously and this film is an insult to my job. Did the director try to make a bad movie? I do not think I have seen bad zombie movies, but you need the coffie and everything on the damn table. THIS MOVIE SUCKS !!! I hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because I'm one myself, but consider another job. I respect the fact that you have finished a movie, but I have to ask you "WOULD YOU SMOKE", I mean the make-up for your girls, the scary zombies, what did you think? For the whole nation, if I could have chosen zero, I would have. The worst movie in the movie makes history !!!
