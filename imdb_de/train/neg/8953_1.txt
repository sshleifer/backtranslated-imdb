I literally saw this movie right after the book ended, and that was perhaps a neutral or a very stupid idea. I think it was the last one. At first, it was inaccurate in many small but important details. One of the first things I noticed was that Winston was commonplace in his work, his conversations, eating in the cafeteria, and so on. He feels free to be unhappy and to give people fearful looks without being immensely afraid. One of the most important parts of the book was that even with small activities, it was virtually impossible to even point to his true emotions on his face AT EVERY MOMENT. This is also evident in the scenes on the streets of the proletarians. In the book, Winston knew it was a big risk to walk around and was skeptical and scared on every ride. As he goes through the movie so often and without fear, one loses the important sense of strong surveillance and risks instantly. <br /> <br /> Other minor inaccuracies included Winston hiding his diary in the wall. yes a very small change, but it raises the question, what is the point? It was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, and these are changed characters. <br /> <br /> But the big inaccuracies were far more disturbing. First of all, one of the book's key elements is that Big Brother is a government based on a smart but crude philosophy. In the film they skip that and immediately give the impression that Hitler's government is being led by technology. What is true in a sense, if you address it with its facism, but if you no longer have Big Brother, you have really missed the meaning of the book. The scary thing about Big Brother is that in a sense it has some points behind its philosophy. When O'Brien picks on Winston's mind at the Ministry of Love, he hears everything Winston says about Big Brother. The fact that he listens and advances in his philosophy is, indeed, the most scary and intriguing. In the end (careful SPOILER ahead), when Winston says he loves Big Brother, the scary thing is that you're not sure if it was the beatings and tortures that caused it, or the real power behind the philosophy. I'm not saying that the Big Brother's philosophy addresses a few issues that appeal to me, but its intelligence and depth make this book incredibly disturbing. <br /> <br /> How can anyone connect Julia and Winston in the movie? It was terrible, no connection. <br /> <br /> And where was O'Brien before giving his address to Winston? One of the things that carried the book was Winston's thoughts about O'Brien BEFORE he got in touch with him. In the movie, they just jump the gun. <br /> <br /> But that sums up why this movie was a terrible adaptation: because it's impossible not to blow up the weapon and turn figures into less than two hours. How could anyone think that this movie would be seen if it lasted less than two hours? At the very least, the movie requires 3 hours to capture some important moods and connections. Everything else is just meaningless. <br /> <br /> If you loved the book and I think it's really revered, you will not approve of this movie, and chances are you already knew it. Because the book is not filmable and this film only proves how impossible it is to put something decent in a small film role. Two stars out of ten
