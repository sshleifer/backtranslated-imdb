Although, unfortunately, thinking has to be (a) intelligent, (b) important, and (c) interesting, fortunately, this movie is mercifully over quickly. The script makes little sense, the whole idea of ​​the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely banal, and John Lydon shows us all in a movie why he should never let the music out. His performance is monotonous and irritating. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is that Harvey Keitel manages to make a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant showed how poorly good actors can behave, but luckily his performance here is restrained.
