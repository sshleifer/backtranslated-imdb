Ridiculous horror movie about a wealthy man (John Carradine) who died and left everything to his four children, and his servants to be distributed equally. One condition - they have to spend a week in their estate to get the money. And when one of them dies, the others get more. Guess what happens next .... <br /> <br /> I saw a brand new print of this movie on cable. The colors were bright and vibrant and the house itself looks beautiful. That's about all the good things I can say. <br /> <br /> Let's just list a few of the problems this film has: The killer is screaming obvious; The servants are called Igor and Elga - come on! Some sound recordings were so bad that I could not recognize the dialogue (no big loss, I'm sure); The blood was sparse and very poorly made; The other murders were just boring, stupid or impossible and this movie contains some really vile drama - so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief. Even Pro Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only pretty good show was the trouper Faith Domergue (who deserved better) and John Carradine (who seems painfully old and frail here). I have to admit though - the final line in this movie is a gem! <br /> <br /> Why was this game renamed "Legacy of Blood" is a mystery to me br /> <br /> Whatever the name is, it's a bad movie. To avoid at all costs.
