<br /> <br /> The main question I ask about this film is: How do you film a Coleporter musical and use only 3 of its 15 songs! merman and lahr played the main roles on Broadway, where they are replaced by the weaker red skelton and the luzille ball. Plot changes abound and the fun is lost. <br /> <br /> SKIP IT.
