A strangely serious coincidence about a cosmetics saleswoman with strange connections to Elvis Presley, who came across a sea of ​​Elvis impersonators when they spoke at conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killed each of them by their own fault. Kim Basinger, a still attractive actress with considerable merit, likes to choose bizarre movies, but this terrible screenplay (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have good humor. The clichés and low-ball gags are not the stuff of classic comedy, but even on a shameless, shameful level, the picture is rude and sloppy. If you watch, you can see if you can see how much foreign matter Basinger has behind the wheel of her pink Cadillac, her hands always in the same position, and a not celebrated look on her face. Hopefully both she and Elvis were well paid. NO STARS of ****
