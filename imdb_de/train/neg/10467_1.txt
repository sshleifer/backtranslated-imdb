If ever there was an appeal to make a bad movie that reflected how stupid humanity might become, it would take the prize. The plot focuses on prophecies of the Bible that lie in hidden messages from the scriptures that cause a group of rulers to seek total control of the world. How stupid does this author actually think that people are real? <br /> <br /> The spectacle was bad at best. Casper Van Dien has wasted his talent on this film. Michael York's work fitted in well with this role as he was at the center of the film and did a good job. <br /> <br /> This action was sick and very disturbing. No delicate or immature mind should see this movie. In this way, a fundamental deterioration of good and evil can be misleading. <br /> <br /> There must be a lot of mental illness in the movie circles looking for ways to market this kind of garbage. There must have been some censoring to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still terrible.
