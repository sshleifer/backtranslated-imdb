My grandmother took me and my sister to watch this movie when it hit the cinemas in 1998. So we happily bought the tickets, popcorn and soda, went to the theater and watched the movie. When it was over, the audience did not applaud strongly, I remember hearing some people say that they did not like it at all, I did not like it, I thought it was pretty stupid and not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical, but apart from him, the whole movie was bad. I seldom laughed that the other people in the theater had hardly laughed. And what I really thought was bad was to make the animals talk, because talking animals exist only in cartoons, in live action movies they are a total mutt! I said that apart from Eddie Murphy's hysterical twist that he brings in, this movie is not worth watching, he's pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> I saw Eddie Murphy in several movies and thought that he was funny. I just said that he was the only funny part of this movie. I did not even see Eddie Murphy in the really "great" movie The Adventures of Pluto Nash. This movie is not a movie I would really recommend because, aside from Eddie Murphy, you probably will not be thrilled, especially because of the many talking animals! <br /> <br /> I give this movie a rating of 3 stars out of a possible 10 stars.
