This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He portrays whites and other races that are not black, as the evil that exists in our educational system. How quickly he forgets that it is the same education system that has made him what he is and failed. The figure of Ice Cube is the epitome of a spiky black who was responsible for much of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched the relationship between the white and black characters who wanted to reach each other. When Omar Epps says, "I have to be with my people," said this racist remark. And John, do not think for a minute that the picture of Thomas Jefferson in the staircase of the tower did not catch my attention. Nice touch!
