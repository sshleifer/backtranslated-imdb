I only played it through at GenCon, because it was quiet and I could take a nap. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? Was the lady who played Flo and Abe Vigoda busy or something? Really a piece of garbage. The characters were stereotypically meaningless (I think ...) and made of wood, most of them seemed to be the autopilot. The so-called "funny" situations described in some other so-called reviews were so hateful that I cried for the writers. <br /> <br /> I am puzzled how worthy someone is for his time seriously I only give him 3 out of 10 points, because to be a 2 or 1, he would either have to be five hours or more Kelly LeBrock contain.
