Weak action, improbable car malfunction and helpless, fumbling characters. At first I thought that this movie was shot in the seventies because the image quality as well as the storyline and the drama came from an old Kojac episode. When I checked and found out that it was really only made in -97, I was amazed. This is by far one of the worst and least thriller movies I have ever seen. If you are reading this, be careful when you see it, wasting time if you could have done something more exciting than seeing the paint dry.
