This is just the worst movie I have ever seen. It's more than 2 hours and boxing was totally misleading. My friends and I hired it because we thought it was a poor man's 300th birthday. They know that you have to laugh about it and make fun of it. No, this movie is not funny, just pain. Then the movie starts and they speak a different language. We think, 'Oh, it's only the beginning.' But no, from then on, the film crashes and becomes more like a boring book that you had to read in elementary school, where for hours nothing happens and the fight scenes rival those of 2 children in a playground. Dispense with the cinematography, and this movie belongs in the garbage press. Movies like this will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which by the way was a good movie.
