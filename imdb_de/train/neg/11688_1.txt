My wife and I found this movie extremely unsatisfactory. While the plot interests you and keeps wondering what's going on, there are too many loose ends leaving the theater that make no sense at all. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Christopher Plummer, the hugely wealthy boss of a New York bank, has a terrible hidden secret. He benefited from the negotiations of World War II with the Nazis and hidden loot stolen by Jews. He keeps the evidence (including diamonds and documents with the swastika of the Nazis) in a safe in his bank. Why? If he wants this never to be revealed, why did not he burn and destroy the documents years ago? And the diamonds? Obviously he does not need them - why keep them instead of eliminating them? How did the bank robbers find out his secret? How did you know they were in good shape in this # 232 safe? Ace Detective Denzel Washington also discovers bank records showing SD boxes # 231 and # 233 but no number 232. Curious. He meticulously found time to make an exhausting search for bank records to uncover this strange fact. All this time there has been a recent hostage-taking, and bank robbers threaten to execute them for a moment. Impressive! Talk about superpowers for a detective. <br /> <br /> Bank robbers are leaving millions of dollars in loose currency in the vault they have opened. They only take the contents of the SD box # 232, allegedly to blackmail the bank president. This defies any rational attempt at a logical explanation of what film portrays as a criminal thinker or for his followers with a lesser mind. Jodie Foster, who uses her political relationships with the mayor of NYC, gets permission to join the bank, which is controlled by the bank robbers and holds many hostages. She offers the chief bank robber a deal to buy back the documents he now holds, but he is not interested. So, what's his point (if any?). <br /> <br /> My wife was insulted by the arrogance of all players. Christopher Plummer (Bank President), Denzel Washington (Ace Detective) and Jodie Foster had problems shooters for high-power issues. <br /> <br /> The last Jodie Foster movie "Flight Plan" I saw was also riddled with holes that made no sense at all. I thought I liked Jodie Foster, but I'll probably avoid her future movies. <br /> <br /> Now my problem is that I can rarely convince my wife to go to the movies. I can not argue with her on this question ... "A WASTE MONEY AND A WASTE OF TIME." Be forewarned. A well-made film, good actors, lousy scriptwriting.
