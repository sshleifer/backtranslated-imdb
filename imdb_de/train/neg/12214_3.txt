Well, I can say to this movie, it's great to see so many Asian faces. What I did not like about the movie was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role. The Asian girl, with no confidence that someone else has to play to progress, the white man falls in love with Asian culture and decides to leave his white world for the yellow country and the "real" black taxi driver. Also, the placement of Coke, Shanghai Tang and Dunkin Donuts was a bit too obvious. The story plot was fun in itself, but I pretty much thought the story would be solved. If you look at romantic comedies, you can not expect much, but I would have at least once wanted to be surprised. The parents are the best part of the strip.
