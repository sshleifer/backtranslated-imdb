I gave him a 2 instead of a 1 because "the wild women of Wongo" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There is no conspiracy. There is no logic. There is certainly no drama (though the shark has good dialogues). We are not surprised about anything. We do not know how the people got where they came from. For me, it's always amazing how such things are even published. I agree with the previous author that it's not even funny. I know. It takes about 90 minutes and that will take up about as much space in a DVD collection. It's like a paperweight. Or a bad painting you bought while selling starving artists. It covers the crack in the wall.
