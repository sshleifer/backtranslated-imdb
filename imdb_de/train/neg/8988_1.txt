So far, the worst movie I've ever seen was Ben & Arthur. You really should check the reviews for this movie instead of this one. The rating statistics for this film were positively evaluated by a relentless and unscrupulous initiation by some of the people involved in the film. Evidence that makes it easy to find them online. At least the people who brought Ben & Arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs instead of unscrupulously promoting it, so that jerks like me would buy it. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, the casting, the acting, the directing, the photography, the editing, the music ... what else is in a movie? Whatever it is, it's as bad as it gets. If it were not so uncomfortable, it would be ridiculous. I've always looked at it and thought it must get better because I had not figured out that none of the positive reviews is reliable. <br /> <br /> It does not take much money to make a great movie. A low budget does not mean that a movie has to be bad. My favorite example of a low budget masterpiece is the amazing Mala Noche by Gus Van Sant, but there are many others. Sideline Secrets - Director's Cut or Original - is not bad, because the people who made it did not have any money, but because they had gigantic egos and no talent for anything but self-promotion.
