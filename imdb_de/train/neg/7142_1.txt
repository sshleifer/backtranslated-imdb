This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I expected a cheesy movie, but at least some cool car scenes / races. What I got was nothing. The racing scene is so low that they are so fast that the cars run "fast". In one scene, a Mercedes SLR drives in just 4 seconds from over 200 to 0 by turning only in a circle. It's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about cars, you will see the fast and the furious series. They may be a bit cheesy, but 100x better than this movie could hope for. Better only Mischief 3000, the best car film I've ever done.
