I'm a big Michael Madsen fan. I do not need to say that I bought this movie without renting it or anything else. To be exposed to this human poison, I just threw it in the bin, the money does not matter, it was worth the price, throw it away to be able to. The acting was not so bad, it was not good or something. The story was terrible and the end was something I despise. He was a broken man, alcoholic. His life was a pile of garbage. I thought his horse, peanuts, was a terrible way to show the innocence of his childhood, a dog would have been much better. I also hate the religion, so this end undoubtedly annoyed me. Jesus heals everything ... I hate that I know people like these who are big Christians and Catholics, and time will tell that God does not heal all or nothing. It was a horrible movie when you got the chance to see it, pass it, or better buy it or rent it and throw it in the bin and leave it in the morning
