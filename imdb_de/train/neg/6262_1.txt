I agree with these reviews that I have read here, and I have no words to define such a turkey like that, but nevertheless I can still find a reason why such films exist. Remember the happy days when video was a successful business and many films were made for the sole reason of filling the shelves of video stores? This film dates back to that time and I can imagine that this was the only reason it was made, and the same thing happened to many, many, many other stinkers. Do you remember "Rambo" -Imitations? and so many slashers from Z grade ?, I still have nostalgia for that time. About this movie, I can say that I did not waste my time because I pressed the fast-forward button after the first fifteen minutes, just to find a very good one. A funny scene in which a guy squeezed an ax against his head. they exploded because, as you are realizing, they were made of plastic. And in the end, it was so badly filmed that I could not understand what happened. That's the same, I had not followed the nonexistent conspiracy at all. But boy, video age was a big age despite such films.
