I had the privilege of attending a horror conference in Ohio on a special screening of The Absence of Light. <br /> <br /> First of all, you know that you are in trouble when the director is presenting a movie. I say, "Well, remember, we did not have much money ..." Not that no-budget movies are bad, but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse, the results are always bad. And there is no better example than this unsurpassed sleep test. <br /> <br /> Indeed, "Absence of Light" is a premiere in the underground movie world: It's the only time I've seen a dream of talented genre veterinarians that really bores me. Charismatic actors like David Hess, Tony Todd, and Reggie Banister happen to be in and out of the movie proving as uninteresting as the amateur no-names. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? It's all so boring that you do not have to worry about anything or anyone anymore. After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and left the theater. It was not surprising that most cast members were present. <br /> <br /> All curious genre fans are wise to stay away from it. With luck, this movie will never see the "light" of the day.
