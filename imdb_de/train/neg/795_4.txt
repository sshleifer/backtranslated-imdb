If you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect a well-made horror movie that is quite different, as it represents what I would call an early effort in science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi play both scientists (Rukh and Benet) competitors until Rukh Benet wins with a demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was - to put it mildly - a bit rough (ie science-fiction with emphasis on fiction), but somehow Rukh uses a kind of Andromeda beam that allows him to look at Earth "several thousand millions years ago." In this prehistoric era, a huge meteorite hit Africa, leaving deposits of a substance that the scientists call "Radium X" - which can heal and destroy. Much of the film is rather laborious in Africa, looking for the meteorite deposits that Rukh finally finds to create a great weapon. Unfortunately, it infects with a kind of disease that makes it a great weapon. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here. Lugosi plays a role in which he is pretty good, although I honestly did not find him convincing - especially during the scenes in Africa. The story also fluctuated a bit, and although she caught my attention, she did not intrigue me. Considering that this is really a sci-fi movie and not a horror movie, and that the sci-fi material was still at a very early stage, the movie must be a bit shorter. It was fine - nothing more, nothing less. 4.10
