OK, I did not have high expectations, but I could not imagine this film going down in depths. <br /> <br /> The plot was a priest of an obscure 2-member order who examined the death of the founder of the order of a Sin Eater. The Sin Eater enables Catholics to attain salvation beyond the authority of the Church, and is yet another boring, immortal film. Bear in mind, however, that this does not make sense since a Baptist could bring you salvation ... We keep going. <br /> <br /> I will plan the plot without much betrayal: The priest goes to Rome to investigate with his buddy. He brings with him a mental patient who shot him during an exorism and loves him (not a single treat is explained), a drunken Irish priest and Peter Weller as cardinal. They come to Rome, find some creepy children who do nothing in the film, meet with a Bondage S & M anti-pope the drunken Irishman knows (unexplained), and delivers information by killing people ( oh, by the way, he's bad so he has an industrial / techno soundtrack) and then ... um, seriously, I'm not sure. The plot meanders. Heath chills with the Sin Eater, flies with the Sin Eater to New York for a night's sleep and then something else happens and then the anti-pope (all out of the camera) falls and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> About After 1 hour you really ask yourself if something happened. Something has happened in the end, but you can not be sure it's important, and since most of the drama is either pre-film or off-scren, you really feel cheated.
