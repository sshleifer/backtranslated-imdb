I'm not sure what I just could not laugh about it. I was open minded. I did not want to be short of it. But I just could not laugh about this movie. It just was not funny for me. In some places, Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too hard. Just because you bring together two very funny men does not mean that this will be an excellent comedy. Some movies just should not be made. This is one of them. Because it makes a lot of old jokes and acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. At least somehow. But I was just not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can not give anything lower than two. And that's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
