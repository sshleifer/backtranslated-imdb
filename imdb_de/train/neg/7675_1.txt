Can you ever say that there are some films that have no salvation functions? Answer: Yes, and that's one of them. Director Uwe Boll, who led the terrible House of the Dead, has now turned his less talented eye on another adaptation of video games. Do not these guys understand? For anyone who can not understand it, it's written in capital letters: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT DO FOR GOOD FILMS! The action is at best inferior here. The set design and the special effects are bad. Unlike the video game (which had its scary moments), the film has no atmosphere of impending demise, no sense of danger or threat. Pacemakers and plotting are confused, and the paper on which the script is printed would have been better used than toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey with a brush. Crazy zooms, falls and pans are spun in unpredictable moments into the whole drab affair, leaving the audience disoriented and bored. Why this guy was even brought close to a movie must be considered one of the biggest secrets of modern cinema. Avoid at all costs.
