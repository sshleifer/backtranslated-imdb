This third Darkman was definitely better than the second, but still much worse than the original movie. What made this better than D2 was the fact that The Bad Guy had been changed and Durant was not returned. There was also some evidence of the characters' development when it came to the evil man's family and Darkman himself. This softened my heart and I gave this strip as much as 4/10, d. H. ** / *****.
