Why, oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it? After reading the book on which this movie was supposedly based a few years ago, I can say that there is little or nothing in the original book. I went into this movie with low expectations - I knew there would be a crappy telemovie feeling - but he did not even fulfill them. <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the film is the original name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a completely different character who has received the same name. They just spit on every Carlito's Way fan out there; The injury is added to the cast by Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial role in the original film, in a different role. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing is that, since this film was made, no other film is being made I was preoccupied with the original, untouched material of the book Carlito's Way - something I really wanted to see. Chopper was the same: they had four books and interviews with fantastic, non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia's most feared underworld figure, instead making a Hummelfilm about a confused but weird film of pathetic little time crooks ( although Eric Banas performance was accurate). Now we will never be able to see Carlito's initial rise and fall. <br /> <br /> The three stars are that if you just look at it as a stand-alone movie, it's not that bad - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is not a Carlito, but he could be in other roles are good) and the story is not so bad. Even Puffy Combs fits his role. But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at the time (I'm a bit of a criminal and a fanatic) - something the original movie and books did right (after the lawyer and now Judge Edwin Torres wrote it). <br /> <br /> The fact is that this is not a standalone stand-it may be the most disappointing prequel ever filmed.
