SEX WISH was actually released in the UK in the early days of the video boom (minus ten minutes more, um, "extreme" footage) and caused a tabloid in a teacup allegedly murdering in imitation. Strangely enough, the papers brushed this ultra-disturbing strip under the carpet to get the relatively harmless tastes of FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF THE DEMON out of the can, and the movie was almost forgotten. I took the chance to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the movie with my jaw on the floor. It's not as much politically incorrect as totally crazy, a triple X shot on DEATH WISH by Michael Winner (did the title give away the game in terms of inspiration?) With hardcore sex and really evil violence already thrown in one became bubbly brew of the seventies. If you do not think you're squeamish, it can make you think. When SEX WISH is over, you should cleanse your eyeballs with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to cleanse yourself. If a movie really deserves, "it's just a movie, just a movie, just a movie" lettering, it's this one. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or Lowlights) - a rapist who uses a victim victim while wiggling over her, Harry Reems' sniffing snout, the helpless young black couple forced to kill the sword killer To screw up (they would have won Oscars for their absolutely credible performance if the Academy had gone crazy) Man is neutered for his problems, and some nasty, nimble directions that threaten to lift the proceedings beyond their obvious backgrounds to bad houses. Do not say I did not warn you. If you thought the world was an innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH will prove you very, very wrong.
