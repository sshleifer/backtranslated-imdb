Steve Martin should stop making remakes of classic comedy. He absolutely does not fit this part. Like the sad remake of the Out Of Towners, this film falls completely in the face. As everyone has thought Steve Martin might even come close to Jack Lemmon's wonderful performance, I'm puzzled and the same goes for this movie. Dan Ackroyd could have played the Bilko game better. Martin is great at playing his own original characters, but he does not try to recreate other people's classic work. It's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is included in the first line of the end credits when the movie is over. The line "The Producers gratefully acknowledge the US Army's total lack of cooperation" was about the only line that really made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, get the original episodes of the Phil Silvers Show. These are guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake that should never have happened. I placed this movie in the same category as the aforementioned Lemmon classic and the remake of Psycho. None of them should have ever happened.
