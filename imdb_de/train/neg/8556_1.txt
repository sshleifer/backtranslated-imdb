OK, I like the idea of ​​this movie. I'm in demographic age and somehow identify myself with some stories. Even the sometimes melancholy and meaningless dialogue seems to be half-realistic and would have been forgivable in another movie not so easy if the filmmakers did not even try. <br /> <br /> The editing in this movie is terrible! Maybe the worst cut I've ever seen in a movie! There are things you do not have to go to film school to learn. Good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is. <br /> <br /> Also taking ... oh my god god the shots, just terrible! I can not even go into detail, but sometimes we just see random things, and in connection with editing, you get the most painful movie experience. <br /> <br /> This movie is made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is no excuse. I've seen on youtube short films with a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what the hell you thought, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both egoists. You should be ashamed! In summary, this movie is like a really lazy amateur porn movie when filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by boring conversations and a disgusting masturbation scene. If this is not your thing, avoid it at all costs!
