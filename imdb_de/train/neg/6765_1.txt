* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is a brilliant critique of the media's obsession with violence. However, this conflict ignores the actual content of the movie. Oliver Stone could have portrayed his serial killers as malicious, inhumane murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination. Instead, he gives them justification. The film represents just about every victim as someone who deserves to be hurt. Stone describes the victims as unpleasant cartoons - stupid rednecks, broken English-speaking immigrants, and lazy fat people. The one person who is the murderous lovebirds is also a clich√©. Of course they make friends with the old, hallucinogenic Americans - because they're trendy, dude? Let's make it an admirable character. Thick, Chinese employees and "hicks" are uncool, so let's make them deserve to die. Instead of twisted, hateful people corrupted by their misdeeds, their anger makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are sexy and cool and surreal images will inevitably attract more impressive people. Justice is mocked. The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and sinister compared to the GQ killers. Again, this is not in the media reports of the film, but in the "reality" of the film. There are no nuances or subtleties in the film - only exaggerated performances and visuals. The film says nothing new or concrete about the obsession of violence. The evidence that the film fails in its message lies in real, real reactions to it. Some impressive young people watching the movie cited him as inspiration for their murders. The "message" of the film is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with gruesome real-life outcomes. The clever message is nowhere to be seen.
