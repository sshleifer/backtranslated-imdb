Rosie wasted a lot of time on television to talk about the Tainos as if they had influenced the dynamics of modern Puerto Rican. They were not. The truth is that the Africans and Spaniards were and they know it. What kills me is that she stands on the screen and looks like an average bright black chick (with an obvious black daddy, cousins ​​and aunt) pretending to be the true essence of what makes her today's Puerto Ricans to really acknowledge, but barely mentioned how Africans influenced the way of Spanish, the food and the music. She is so typical and I have lost much respect for her and will not support anything but her. Since she wants to dance around her African woman, she does not need to take on any other roles associated with blackness (ie, Lackawanna Blues). Next time we find a proud Black Latina (thanks Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa). <br /> <br /> In order to come here to Puerto Rico, it was said that they were African and not "black". ...Thank you. We "blacks" certainly have nothing in common with "you" so that no love is lost. But since you are probably in the States and have benefited from the Civil Rights Movement, we want you to reject any decent human treatment that you have received with blood, sweat, and tears from the backs of "blacks" with whom you share nothing. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, Puerto Ricans have a terrible image in the media, but we blacks do not spend our time respecting them because we know the media loves it, the low ones Points and behaviors of all minority exploit to maintain meaningless generalizations. However, they obviously fed the hype that you are somehow white or superior ... they are not. Besides, you feel somehow forced to believe that black culture is BET ... again you are wrong and have to take a vacation out of the hood. Try visiting Atlanta, Georgia, Houston, Texas, Charlotte, New York. Trust me, that none of these black people wants to claim their "culture".
