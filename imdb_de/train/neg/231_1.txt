This starts off badly with the three women who are like simple junior high school wussies chuckling with their gin, endless cigarettes and caramel chocolate for those who tell the best "men" story - spoiler alert = - = What if Andie's character falls on the young female organist who was her student at the age of 14 (she is the headmaster of an English school, believe it or not), only to have him destroyed by hell, out of hell "Girlfriend". ..and then from there it is basically unsurpassed swatter: she forgives her "friend" and lets the love player of the organ player and the three women end when they start drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes, blah blah blah. Andie's figure throws the caramel pralines into the street in a pitiful attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
