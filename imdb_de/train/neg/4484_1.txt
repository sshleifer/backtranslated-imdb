As soon as I saw posters and heard talk of this movie, I was immediately excited. The Matrix was an incredible sight and I could not wait to see the second one, especially after I started watching the trailers for other films. When I saw it, I left the theater extremely disappointed, as did many other moviegoers in the theater. While the action scenes in the movie were always amazing, there were just too few. In the first movie, there seemed to be constant fighting, but the second brought a much more (and much unfortunate) standpoint of the sermon. To summarize the story, there was not much that was not expected. The machines dug in the direction of Zion with the intention of destroying them (this is not a spoiler, everyone has seen it in the commercials). The dialogue of the film was absolutely horrible. If you're not a psychology student, you probably will not understand most of what's said in the movie, so you do not care. It became a romantic film, showing events that took place in the life and relationship of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, as evil as in the first movie, seemed to have all the religious and preaching features. Personally, I do not have to hear about it or pay money for it. The movie was a waste of time and I do not think I can watch the first movie anymore. The dialogue and the constant boring and dry monologues of virtually every character quickly made me lose interest in the film, and the few good fighting scenes pushed me to the edge, and the end of the film struck me immediately. Which film ends with "completed"? How original are these people. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to find this oil. Finally, the movie was bad and that's the end.
