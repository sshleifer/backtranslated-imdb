While William Shater always makes me smile at everything he performs (and I especially love him as Denny Crane at Boston Legal), this show is all about glitter and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down. > <br /> It has nothing of the intelligence of Millionaire, none of the flair of deal or no deal. <br /> <br /> This show is all about dancing and stupid things to complete in time. <br /> <br /> Of course I only looked at it. I've seen it for over 45 minutes, then I had to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The best was when William Shatner danced on stage. He is a scream !!! Unfortunately, this show does not do it. <br /> <br /> That's a matter of course
