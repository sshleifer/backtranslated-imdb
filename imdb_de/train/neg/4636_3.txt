The "confidential" part was intended to highlight the popular charm of the magazine of the same name, while the topic of "work-driving" was associated with the investigation of the congress of the time. Despite the A-grade B movie cast and some good script ideas, the movie stays with it for 73 minutes. It's a cheap jacket production. To compensate for the bad production values, it requires some imagination, especially the uninspired director Sidney Salkow. A few daylight shots, for example, would have helped to facilitate the sequence of dreary studio sets. A stylish helmsman like Anthony Mann might have done something with the thick-eared material, but Salkow treats it only as a kind of payday exercise. Too bad that Brian Kay's typical, restrained style does not work here. He just seems wooden and lethargic, at the same time goes the cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. as a wild drunk on the pile. Salkow is obviously not an actor's director. But you have to hand it over to that cheeky little guy, Beverly Garland, who treats her role with characteristic momentum and devotion. A pity, she was not responsible. My advice - skip it if you're not into ridiculous bartenders who do nothing but fight back whiskeys in a typical '50s forced-coat style.
