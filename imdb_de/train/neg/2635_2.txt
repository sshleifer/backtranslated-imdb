I've been willing to endure a lot of late-summer action-fluff movies, but in general this is because most of them have reasonable profits (like cool special effects, interesting turns of action, comic value , Steve Buscemi, etc.). However, this movie did not have any of this. All we got was the cheap thrill of Eva Longoria's cleavage (an issue of Maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of conspiracy, excitement, background story, character development, continuity, etc. I would go into details, but frankly, I've forgotten most - maybe even deliberately - film. <br /> <br /> The whole time I was in the theater, I stepped myself because not only did I spend the afternoon watching a 24-season DVD. Save your money, people. Unless you really, really, really like Eva Longoria's decollete.
