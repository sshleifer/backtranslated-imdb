The reasons why you should watch this movie, uh ... tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It's active while your channel is surfing and nothing else. - Someone pays you to look at him. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and take a look at the DVD for Se7en, lend it, download it to iTunes, or put it in your Netflix queue and skip The Flock completely , The Flock the same story with a few changes. In addition, editing Se7en only causes confusion and leads you out of history several times. The worst part is probably the escape from desert helicopter raids, with the sounds of people chatting on the radio, unless there are no police helicopters knocking over them in this flight. If you want to be nice, you can call it a tribute movie. Go on, but look at Se7en.
