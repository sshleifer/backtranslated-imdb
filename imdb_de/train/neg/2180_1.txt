Where should I start? There is so much wrong and terrible about this film. Okay, the two jerks who wrote this crapper. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, at first they could not decide on a name. I suspect they split the difference, so the main title is BRAIN THAT IF NOT THAT WILL DIE, BUT HEAD THAT THE WANTED CAN NOT BE DISPLAYED on the final screen. Nobody knows anything about the medical profession. After all, the doctors have oaths to "cause no harm". Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered "harm." In addition, a little thing called blood and tissue matching. Rejection would mean death for Jan. And who holds a patch monster? At which medical faculty did Bill attend the FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster had no name that makes me hell. And the brilliant surgeon Doctor Bill Cortner does not know how to keep a patient calm? All in all a catastrophe of a movie, it is incredibly stupid and unsurpassed except on MST3K. I give it THE THANKSGIVING OF TURKEY.
