I do not know what else to say about this horrible movie that has not yet been said. Honestly, I'm just mad at myself. I should have known better when I saw the title of this movie, that it would be a terrible crap, but I loved War Games, so I let myself go as I pleased. I will regret this decision for the rest of my life. From the beginning, when the government officials said that their supercomputer could determine who was a terrorist just because they were playing a video game that I knew was on a trip, even though the country had forgotten - good writing , The list of very, very, very bad plotlines, dialogue, and acting is so long that I would crash IMDb if I tried to post it. To the people who said they saw the worst movies, please tell me. Actually, I'm curious about something that could exceed this steaming pile of horse manure.
