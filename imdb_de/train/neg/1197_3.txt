You really will not be more stupid than this film, which deals with 3 losers trying to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break at many of our higher schools of learning. The problem is that these losers are trying to do this 15 years after graduating, if they are to be assigned to watch over the daughter of a senator who is being prepared as the next vice president. Daughter is anything but popular, but of course she out of it all. The girls go through drunken tantrums, exotic dances and other absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> It really can not get much worse than this horrible movie.
