This movie is now my benchmark compared to all other movies ... as in "Was it as stupid as Revolver?" Also, I was in the audience of the Toronto International Film Festival last night when a room with over 2000 people went out in a weird silence after being completely stunned by a 2-hour nonsense. Jason Stratham would have been amazing if he had had only one purpose. Within the first 10 minutes he received an offer from Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (from Sopran's fame), which makes NO REASON ON ALL! Then there's some shooting and then there's Ray Liotta, who wears embarrassing bikini briefs, then there are some animations, Ray Liotta's bare bottom, lots of shooting, teeth grinding, art house wanting pretensions and more from Liotta's embarrassing body every show laughs. , I'm not sure which reaction he was looking for ... not five times anyway. Everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear, and Guy Ritchie thinks he's the incarnated yogi bear. The storylines could not have gone anywhere, but the attitude was out of sight! The only way this movie could have been worse would be if Madonna herself was there.
