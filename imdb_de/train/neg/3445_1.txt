When young Kevin gets his dead uncle's boat as a present, he invites five friends of his to a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend. During the trip, they drink alcohol, have sex and play games, each of them expressing their greatest fear. Later, Kevin drowns on the open sea, the engine stops, and they are chased and murdered by their greatest innermost fear. Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter, and three other friends came to "Haunted Boat" on DVD, and with less than 30 minutes playing time, the group gave up watching this messy and boring amateur bitch, and we decided to do another movie Later, I decided to see the rest of this movie to see how bad it could be, and it would have been better if I went to bed to go to sleep, the messy story has terrible cinematography and Camerawork, with a cast that is likely to become actors and actresses, and in the end this movie seems to be a bad Cinema project, and the terrible and overbearing script ends up with a ridiculous twist, a complete mess that did not make me understand What the story is about, was the girl crazy, traveling alone by boat and imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends? If that's true, is her friend in the end the fruit of her madness? My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagem Para a Morte" ("Journey to Death")
