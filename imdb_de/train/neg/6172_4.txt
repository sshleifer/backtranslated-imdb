I'm coming to the movie right now. First, someone wanted "proof" of Clinton's comments in Georgetown, where he claimed that the US had "earned" the September 11 attacks. Well, Clinton said: <br /> <br /> "When the Christian soldiers captured Jerusalem in the First Crusade, they first burned a synagogue of 300 Jews and killed every woman and every child that was Muslim on the Temple Mount They tell you that the story in the Middle East is still being told and we are still paying for it. "<br /> <br /> WE still pay for it? What does "we" mean, palm? The Marines did not storm the Temple Mount. <br /> <br /> But in truth, Clinton never really came out and flatly said we "deserved" 9/11. Like all his remarks during his presidency, he EVALUATED that we deserved 9/11. Just point to "fact" A, B, C, and maybe D, and let the listener deduce that they must add up to conclusion X. In truth, the "Facts" from Clinton to guacamole br /> But that's not the point. We're here to talk about movies, not politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone makes a movie, you can not escape his twisted politics. It was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and bitterness on the Reagan era, and what would be better than if Stone's dreams had almost come true on the day Reagan had almost bought the farm. In Hinckley's assassination attempt, he could find no nefarious plans or plans. He invents one with Al Haig. From a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authority, Haig became a public servant who was supposed to refresh his sanitation caretakers to a raging megalomaniac. They almost expect Haig to rub his hands like Montgomery Burns and ask Cap Weinberger to "free the hounds." Stone even recruits the most sloppy person in Hollywood to play former Secretary of State Richard Dreyfuss. A guy you hate at first sight. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is fine. Average, hovering below average. Do not bother renting or buying. Try to catch the cable. 4 out of 10.
