From acting, directing, scripting and art direction, this movie is just poorly conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for landmine victims. When did we become so sad that they had to fill a children's film with sexual references in order to keep the parents' attention. Dr. Suess is in his grave right now, what about the "dirty" crap "and wrong erection scenes, etc., etc. It's shameful how they use the name Suess to get the parents to bring their kids, the profanities for the Teenagers and some sad parents who are not watching a movie, trying their kid if there is no T & A. Greed greed and more greed. <br /> <br /> Compare this to the classic children's movies and we can get a disturbing look at the world these guys should make MTV videos how in the world this movie got> 400 votes to me is a dream (unless it's the family of the directors)
