I found the pace was icy and the original story out of all proportion to the content. My wife slept most of the time and I did not try to wake her because I felt she did not miss anything. <br /> <br /> If Holmes and Watson enter the house and then possibly get caught, it's unclear how they could do so quickly hiding all boarding and burglary tools. It is also unclear how the door to the study is locked to prevent the servants from entering. <br /> <br /> The thing that puzzled me was over when the broken statute had a glimmer in my eye. I have no idea what this should be.
