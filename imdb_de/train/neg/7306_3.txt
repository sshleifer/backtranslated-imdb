Truly one of the worst movies I've ever eaten. I've never actually taken the time to write one, but I felt compelled to do so after seeing this insult to filmmaking, and felt a little annoyed at wasting my time with such a bastard, to be honest his. There were so many parts that irritated me with their utter randomness and futility (for example, when would the police ever kill people with infectious diseases, when would hospitals ever cross such people for lack of healing, why was the guy discovered?) spied on his wife, who was walking around in his dressing gown, carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed?). Also the characterization was - as we almost expected in such films - terrible (eg the way the blond guy - I can not remember his damn name and give a litter anyway - totally against his Girlfriend and ran away to leave her) and in the end I wanted to meet all the cruel ends! The production was horribly incoherent and the cinematography was nothing to write about.
