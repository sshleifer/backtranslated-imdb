Contains Spoiler The film presentation can be summarized in a few sentences: Three boys hunt in the woods. Two of them are shot in the head together with other people without explanation. The last man can stand in the open, scream and do anything without being shot. He can walk through an old factory and let the bad people walk straight into his area without any trouble. The rogues are comfortably dressed in black and look like rogues. <br /> <br /> This is the whole story, not summarized, but in detail. Everything is with a man who rings a doorbell. We wait with him. Long shot of guys getting bored and sleeping in the woods. We can take a nap with them. One shot of a female jogger could be a relief if we could see her butt or her breasts. <br /> <br /> There is less Terminator than Terminator and not because there is so much action. The characters just do not speak. And then they do not even have to say something imbecile, like "I'll be back". If my buddy had shot this weekend, I would cheer him on, because it's a breeze finding out the camera control. It is totally inappropriate to pay money for renting a DVD. <br /> <br /> A bit strange is the extra the director tells how the local police did not know they were shooting treated them like a random guy walking around with a gun. If they had filmed that, it would be more fun than watching the movie.
