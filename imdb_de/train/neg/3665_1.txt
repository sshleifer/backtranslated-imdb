Obviously, this happens when a director allows his 14-year-old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set, while in the meantime he gives himself alcoholic; As I said, although I always wanted to look at one of Paul Naschy's werewolf images, I served as the scary of this incident, and however awful it may be, I plan to pursue other entries in the series, albeit very gradually <br /> <br /> Despite some high-profile disappointments like Joe Dante's THE HOWLING (1981), I generally love werewolf pictures, but to be honest, I quickly lost interest in the "plot" of that movie and just stood there counting his absurdities on my TV screen, so to speak. There were far too many to mention here, but I have to say that two were especially joking than schizophrenic characters of the werewolf persona (ie to go from a mad animal in one shot to a dazed, zombie-like state as a whole next one - as if he were on an informal midnight walk in the country and wearing a completely different wardrobe ... and yes, I knew the reasons for that before) as well as the "Phantom Of The Opera". Look of the Wolfstein figure! But what do I know - maybe the elusive version of this full-length chaos would have been a real horror classic!
