The big actors in particular need the money ... The surgery scenes were ridiculous ... and you must know that people who have some medical knowledge would find this absolutely absurd ... Anesthetists Do not leave the room during one Heart transplantation ... and do not do the operation in a tiny room without instruments, heart-lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... could not focus on the plot because of all the stupid surgery scenes ... no blood, no staff and then the hero Doc comes in and takes over ... it's not a movie for thinking adults .... Also the budget must have been limited ... The street scenes were fine, but who was the technical advisor ? Apparently it was a total idiot. Save your money and wait for it to come out on DVD.
