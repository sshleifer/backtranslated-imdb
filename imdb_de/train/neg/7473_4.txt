My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - a strong-minded South lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the LAPD. The first season was a must for us. Unfortunately, the stories from her personal life in season two became so boring and unworthy of the strong character we stopped. <br /> <br /> My husband and I were worried about the episode in which she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is locked up. But the Deal Breaker was the episode in which she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend, but informs her boss about it. Why should a strong middle-aged woman do these things? The answer is that she would not. Besides, my husband and I choose evil with almost perfect accuracy. It is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the crime scene or in an idealized family. Can not the scriptwriters do something original from time to time? As I said, we are no longer viewers. We prefer shows that do not betray the characters and insult our intelligence.
