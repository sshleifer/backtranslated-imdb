We expected something big when we saw this bomb. It's basically a Broadway play that gets put on film. The music is just awful. There is not a single memorable song in the movie - did you hear hits from this movie? You will not do it because there are none. Some of the music numbers run so long that I got up to go to the bathroom and get popcorn. When I came back, it was still running! If they were good songs - but they are shit. The tempo is slow, a terrible character development. The lead role was praised for her vocals, but sounded as if she were screaming at each song - it was almost impossible to endure. This movie has NOTHING, but only hard-core Broadway enthusiasts. This is without a doubt the most overrated film I have ever seen in my life. A complete waist of time and money. Nothing about this film except Danny Glover, who was not enough on the screen and whose character was not developed enough. Borrow the video and you agree - this movie was an expensive, overproduced, polished dog.
