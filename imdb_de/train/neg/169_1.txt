I saw this movie recently because a friend brought it from New York. After 30 minutes, I said to him, "You must be kidding, is that a joke?" He liked it. I told him that I thought it was probably one of the dumbest movies ever made. "What should it be?" I asked. "A propaganda film for children?" The plot is stupid. Acting is the worst thing for most principals, and frankly, people who look at this kind of tripe and think it has something to do with life, love, or even life, that gives them an incredibly idiotic view. .. they need some psychiatry help. If someone tries to get you to put this into your DVD or video player, think of it as introducing a virus into your computer ... the player will not be destroyed, but the evening will be destroyed. If they had raided in the 1940s, it would have won in every category. (PS) It is also under the dubious emphasis of "Stairway to Heaven").
