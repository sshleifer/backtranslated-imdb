After seeing and loving Postal (yes, I really loved Postal), I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie. I picked Seed because I happened to stumble over it in a local DVD store and he was supposed to be one of his better movies. <br /> <br /> While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film were promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too mainstream psycho thriller, it soon went downhill and eventually became one of the biggest generic Slasher movies I have seen so far, including a huge amount of action holes, unrealistic emotional reactions, and below-average acting. It seems Boll did his best to find a reasonable action, but after a while he just gave it up. Maybe he should stick to the comedy ?! The good thing about this movie is that it manages to create an overall spooky atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected, and the soundtrack fits well with the overall atmosphere. Its generic nature makes it boring to watch for half an hour, which is good Ruined experience overall. There are pretty well done shocking scenes, but they seem to be just for the shock. And let's not forget the camera work, which at times was quite disgusting. <br /> <br /> I hope Uwe Boll will one day find out what makes a good movie, because between many terrible movies he seems to be decent movie now and then. Seed is just not one of them.
