For those who have little time left, I'll summarize it briefly, in a word ... pathetic. There are many good examples of why this film fits exactly under this description. So much so that you can barely walk two minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and meaningless. Do you want a completely naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You have it! The reason she appears is so pointless that she really sets the tone for the rest of this juvenile crap. You can almost look into the deceived heads of the 12-year-old boys who wrote this dump by looking at this crap that they expect the public to actually pay for !! ?? !!! <br /> <br /> I've seen many movie franchise films over the years, but American Pie; Beta House must be one of the worst offenders, considering that, despite the average character of the original movie, it is still a thousand times more fun than this filth. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable, and sometimes you actually feel like you're playing a school. The things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that you can only expose the whole movie unhindered (it's called Star Wars suspension levels, as you would have to believe in Jar Jar). <Br /> <br /> The story is paper-thin, and most of the events are just to show off another pair of breasts or make another miserable joke. There is no acting talent to talk about, all you get is some pretty guys trying to make us laugh. And ohhh how they fail !!!! Every gag falls flat and the only thing I laughed about was how socially ignorant the scriptwriters seem to be. How else can you explain the cops if they try to end up as history? <br /> <br /> You take every opportunity to do something valuable and entertaining for poorly written, lowest common denominator nonsense. The characters must complete a number of tasks before being accepted as members of Beta House. However, this is usually done through a series of very brief montages that show they are doing the work, but there is little to no evidence to actually happen. It's a very lazy way to tell a story. It also lacks the opportunity to be funny. (Imagine, the Wizard of Oz, where all the important events took place off the screen instead of on screen, and all we see is Dorothy, who occasionally dances the scarecrow and says "Gee That," Sure Lazy lazy LAZY !!!! <br /> <br /> The female characters have little or nothing to say, and everything they do is naked for no apparent reason They will be used as visual props throughout the movie and you Braindeads who are just looking for T & A will not be disappointed, but that's why they're ashamed of themselves Congratulations.
