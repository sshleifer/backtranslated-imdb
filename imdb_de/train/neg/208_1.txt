Terrible movie with pieces of Ramones lying around. Their worse than the average of the 70s / 80s is the comedy format of the cool kids who take over the school with a whimsical plan. This movie is awful. The plot consists of a girl who likes the Ramones and a school that wants to fight against her oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero with Guitar Wolf if you want a fun B-movie. Terrible spectacle, terrible writing, terrible action stamped with the approval of the Ramones, who probably needed some money quickly, so they said yes to this movie. That's the only logical thing that comes to my mind because this movie is blowing.
