Another colorful apology for men fighting in rubber suits. This time, time travelers from the future arrive in 1992 and recruit a few people to return with them until 1944 and prevent the founding of Godzilla, thereby saving a future Japan from destruction. But once they have accomplished this task, the time travelers become a bunch of double crosses whose own creature sets out, and without Godzilla who can stop them. Eek! It all sounds very silly and probably is, but the storyline is surprisingly decent and the last fight looks pretty good as well. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are more trash than fun, and the movie proves to be just as boring as its predecessors. Watch out for the shaky Spielberg joke.
