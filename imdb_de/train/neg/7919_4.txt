I found myself very caught up in this movie, at least in the beginning, and every credit I give to this movie is Lacey Chabert, she was awesome !! But it ends there. I seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is, and I like it when a movie baffles me completely, but I felt lopsided, they took you all the way in one direction and then suddenly In the end, you decided to go in a completely different direction, they did not hit, that was not misleading for the very bad writing and planning, somebody did not think at all! <br /> <br /> I felt the movie It would have been much better if they had stuck to the conspiracy they are leading, and they did not seem to answer, why did Jane (maria) burn down the professor's house? Da I felt like it started with a relatively good movie.
