Why make a show that millions of us have seen and loved as children and make a complete joke about it? They ask why Hollywood does not earn the money it used to do. Because they spend garbage and pay big sums to actors to be garbage collectors, and ask us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage. The TV show was just what she was, good people in bad situations where the good IL guys come to the top. It was not gone by the wind, but it was fun. This movie is garbage! Hollywood can not come up with anything original, so take something that's good and ruin it for a few $$$$. I just hope that this movie makes 10x less than it costs. The only ones who enjoy this crap are the guys who were allowed to drive General Lee. The audience is the victim. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it, watch the reruns of the TV show instead. They still hold 20 years later.
