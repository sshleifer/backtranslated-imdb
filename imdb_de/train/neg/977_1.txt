"Fever Pitch" is not a bad movie; It's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible that American filmmakers and critics are so stupefied and lobotomized by the excrement that Hollywood is outraged that they praise even a mediocre movie with barely a laugh in the sky? That's the only reason why I can imagine why this horrible romantic comedy (and I use that term casually because there's nothing funny in this movie) gets good reviews. <br /> <br /> I stunned screenwriter Lowell with this movie Ganz and Babaloo Almond would even think for a moment that her screenplay was funny. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well to the movie. He adapted "Fever Pitch" for a British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for "About a Boy" (2002) and Americanized as "High Fidelity" in 2000 for a film, the authors wrote D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did not do anything wrong because they kept the essence of Hornby's wit and humor. They made one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> So why is the American version of "Fever Pitch" so painfully wrong? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, witty and unexpected and gave us two characters we could like, respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel have exaggerated everything that's funny in Hornby's work. In the Americanization of history, they slaughtered them, eliminated everything that was good and unique in Hornby's work, and replaced it with conventional play. <br /> <br /> They have turned a funny story into a romantic comedy, never deviating from the miserable formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three friends, each with a specific function. One is overweight, the second cynical and ambitious, and the third is romantic. Would you like to guess how many male friends Ben (Jimmy Fallon) has? <br /> <br /> What made "High Fidelity" so interesting was not just a good leader and a good lady, but moving side characters. In this "fever pitch", the six side-friends do not say or say anything particularly funny. They are so insignificant that they are not even decorative. The only reason they are in the movie is that the formula demands it. Poor Ione Skye becomes Lindsey's friend in an ungrateful role. Lovable Skye must have wished that Lloyd Dobler would storm in and take her. If you think about it, Cusack would have made a superb Ben. Of course, Cusack is too smart to stick to such a boring script. <br /> <br /> There is not a single, lonely moment in this film that seems original or informal. Every plot is predictable, every lame joke telegraphed. Ganz and Almond work for laughter. The first 45 minutes are so agonizingly slow that you wonder if these guys find they're writing a comedy. You can mark the action in this movie by your watch. It's almost as if Ganz and Mandel had written this and pasted the formula of a screenwriting turner on the wall. When they came to a particular page, they looked up at the formula and said, "Okay, the guru says this has to happen now." And, presto! <br /> <br /> The directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly do not help the movie. They have no idea how to present their story and characters (they do not pass the story of V. O. to the protagonist but to another man sitting behind Ben in Fenway Park). Thanks to extremely chunky writing, we have to watch Barrymore and Fallon stumble through their most unpleasant first meetings. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is cute and adorable better than most. She is as good as Goldie Hawn in her heyday. But even her cuteness can not save this extraordinarily terrible movie. She strives to elicit some energy and humor from the story. About 30 minutes after the movie, Lindsey Ben says, "You're funny." The only explanation for her comment is that it was in the script. For Fallon's Ben never says anything that is funny even from a distance. Fallon is neither funny nor funny. When he does a comedy, he has played too much. Fallon was never good on Saturday Night Live. He was probably the least funny person on this show. Do you remember this lame sketch about a radio DJ who played all the voices? The only reason why "Weekend Update" worked occasionally was that Fallon's cohort Tina Fey understood a thing or two about the comedy. Actors who think they are funny and rarely, if ever, funny. That applies to Fallon. He thinks he's hysterically funny when he barely giggles. His stuttering, unsure impression did not work on the small screen. It is quieter on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Fallon his role in this image is also a few dramatic moments. If you thought his comedy was bad, wait until you get a load of dramatic stuff. Especially two scenes - the first in a park, the second in front of Ben's school - are painful to look at. The scenes require an actor with a touch of dramatic ability, but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to get it up and running. His range of emotions does not range from A to B. Ben has neither personality nor depth. He often looks like a jerk. And not a lovable one. It baffles the mind, which Lindsey would find attractive to him. Compare the performance of Fallon with that of Firth in the British version, and you will understand how terribly flat, unfunn and forced Fallon Ben is and how wrong he is for this role. If you look at Fallon in "Fever Pitch," the long and dramatic depth of Ashton Kutcher will be as long as never before! It just needed better writers, more competent directors, and above all a stronger, funnier, smarter, leading man. Do yourself a big favor: avoid this lazy movie; rent the British version of 1997 and read instead the book by Hornby.
