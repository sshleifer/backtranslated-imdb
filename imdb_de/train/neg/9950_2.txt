If the original casting idea had been preserved (chasing Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie might have worked. Unfortunately, racism (literally) had to come into the picture and mess it up. The predominantly black production staff could not allow the antagonist to be black and swapped the roles of Rutger and Ice-T. This was just the beginning of the downward spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson's "directing" approach to the newsroom just confirmed that this was another job for an affirmative action. Champion shot, close up, close up. Gads, "Who's Line Is It Anyway" even uses more creative camerawork. Eric's recast of "The Dangerous Game" is at least an attempt to modernize classic history, but there is no motivation for why the characters do so. We never get the reasons, except "Nobody will miss these people," why the leader (rewritten as Rutger) does these things. Apart from a heartfelt performance from John McGinley and a fair job from Charles Dutton, do not worry. A little something. During the shooting that hurt F. Murray Abraham, there was a real drunk driving and the death of the intoxicated young driver who caused the accident.
