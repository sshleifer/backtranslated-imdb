I did not think that was possible, but I found the movie worse than 'Body Melt'. This movie is really bad! And what makes it worse is that it's another Australian movie ... <br /> <br /> The VHS recording looks and with a terrible 80's rock soundtrack it's getting worse and worse and that's hard to believe how bad the beginning is (skinned male turned upside down in a room sprayed with white tomato sauce?). <br /> <br /> And why are their accents changing? From bad New York drawl to prissy English, then pure Aussie! And that happens with the whole cast! <br /> <br /> This film also claims to have won a film festival on the cover (I think it was the Utah Film Festival). It must be a lie because no one who is wise would nominate it for anything (maybe for the Golden Raspberries, but I think it's too bad it is). This movie must be number 1 among the 100 !!! It must be ten times as bad as the films that are already there. <br /> <br /> Well done to the "movie" makers of this garbage to prove that there is a reason not to watch movies ..... 0/10
