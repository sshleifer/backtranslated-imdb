I have not seen it for over twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was the tour guide, Lorenzo was the hijacker. Yes, Lorenzo looked very native as a villain, a natural. I think I saw it most for OJ back then, seeing Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also to see Arte Johnson. <br /> <br /> I was a bit bored that Johnson was so serious. <Br /> <br /> And yes, it has postponed the actions. Reading other posts, I remember that this was a conspiracy to kidnap a rich girl, but then this priceless stamp business came out of the blue. <br /> <br /> I wanted a stamp? If it was a late movie, I would probably record it to check it again, but I would not be nostalgic about it. Not yet anyway. <br /> <br /> There are better movies from the seventies like this for checking out.
