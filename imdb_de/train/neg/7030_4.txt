One of the cornerstones of low-budget cinema is to do a well-known, classic plot and make a complete bastardization of it. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. The scriptwriter takes the lingering phantom of the Opera storyline into a late 1980s mall. The "phantom" goal, however, is simply to avenge the perpetrators responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family. The special effects make for a good giggle, especially when body parts appear in dishes from the yogurt stall. Pauly Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be as rude as one would expect, mainly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of MTV celebrity had not come yet. If you're looking for some good laughs at the expense of the actors and the special effects crew, watch this movie. Otherwise, look for something else.
