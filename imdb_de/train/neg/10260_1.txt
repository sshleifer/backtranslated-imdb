This movie was terrible! I rented it without knowing what to expect. I looked at the first 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb. The acting was bad and there was no action The mouth does not move. Why should they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster? Just bad, do not even waste your time. (1 out of 10)
