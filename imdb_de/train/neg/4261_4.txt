Pathetic. This happens when the director comes to work just because someone pays him for it. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, great locations and backdrops for a movie of epic proportions. But the performance, damn it! I swear, in some shots you can see extras in the background staring at the camera or watching the actors, because nobody told them what to do when they called "Action!" Hear. The fight scenes are so bad that you ask yourself - are these people real? They would have done more harm if they just hugged each other. In the slow scenes you see people on the battlefield walking around or just standing and waving their hands. <br /> <br /> Only action in the foreground is somehow emphasized. But for what? History is so illogical and discontinuous, it seems to be random situations in chronological order, sometimes not even. The dialogues are stupid, the love story is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong action movies. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million euros you can see every dollar invested on the screen. At best, the end result of all this tremendous effort is a shiny round laser disk in the thin cover on the shelf in the video library.
