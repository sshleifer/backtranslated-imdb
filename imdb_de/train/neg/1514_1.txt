I saw this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend just wanted to see him for Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel like I wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it was the last time we saw a movie just because there was a certain actor in it. I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her place. Since I already paid, I wanted to at least see the end, just in the hope that something good would turn up, but I did not hold my breath, and luckily I was a victim of the movie just that. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white movie, but a black and white movie. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all sex offenders are portrayed as unreachable hardcore criminals, and the bad ones were really bad. Talk about a clich√© and the exploitation of a typical American phobia. Richard Gere acts as usual, but the blonde girl who is supposed to replace him was at best picky. Totally unconvincing for the job. <br /> <br /> The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic and sensational twist that is simply unreal. They simply use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap acts of violence such as murder, suicide, rape, and torture-something that seems almost unfounded. You even have a wolf attacking people in the movie - how low can you be? <br /> <br /> I assume that the film does not appear in the US and goes directly to the DVD. It should have stayed in other countries, but since it's Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the movie is not even worth a B series movie.
