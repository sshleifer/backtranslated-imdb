Around the time Europe began to fight World War II until the end of the war, Hollywood (with considerable government pride) produced a plethora of films designed to get young men into the army Convene by making the life of a warrior soldier appear "cool." This is by far the most sloppy, meaning that a soldier's life is out of work, you get the best food, and you're lying around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I am far too young to attend World War II, but I think there was more. There is the crispest cathead of an action and a series of musical numbers that contain some of the main action of the day. <br /> <br /> I think that in 1943 even the most naive civvies knew there was more overseas than the crazy hijinks depicted in this movie. While I'm sure it should be considered as a casual conversation, I wonder if the family and members of the warring men were amused or repelled by this trivialization of the victims of their loved ones.
