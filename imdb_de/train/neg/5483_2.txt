I just blew four dollars to rent this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis would advocate such a bad apology for a movie is not mine. Even more surprising, however, were the fairly good reviews that some Canadian newspaper critics gave to this film. I'm tired of our media justifying a movie simply because it's Canadian and has a low budget. It's as if they assume that Canadian movies are miserable, so they still give a good rating. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie: Acting was below average (with the exception of the main male character that was actually.) Pretty good). The film quality was poor, which I could expect from the extremely low budget. The script was absolutely horrible. One example is the story revolving around one of the main characters, a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so she can recruit him to repair and steal bicycles for their gang whose sole purpose is to accidentally SUV to destroy. Allegedly, many of her gang members' bikes are destroyed in these activities (I do not know how she can not afford to just buy new ones as she's supposed to be this big drug trafficking connection from Vancouver to Toronto) /> <br /> Anyway, the point of the story (revealed after more than half of the film) is that the drug dealer plans to bomb bomb buildings in the Toronto area to try to make houses more affordable - as no Want to live in the area. <br /> <br /> - Do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> Be ashamed of the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a film, for the support of Telefilm and for the Globe and Mail and Georgia Just newspapers for such biased reviews. <br /> <br /> A movie should not be specially treated just because it is Canadian !!!!
