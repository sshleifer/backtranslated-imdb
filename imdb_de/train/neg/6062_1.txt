Impressive. The only people who rate this positively are the Carpenter apologists. I know many of them. The guys who will watch John Carpenter sit on celluloid, take out a movie, and declare him a masterpiece of horror. This "movie" is totally crap. It looks and sounds like porn (good sir, the soundtrack is awful ...) and has a subordinate pornography, which is shocking because usually Ron Perlman is a very good actor. I honestly have no idea what Carpenter was thinking when he did that. Most likely, "beans, beans, beans ..." until someone fed him and rolled him into a blanket for the day ... They say nothing at all about the abortion debate, if they had a very interesting central theme, religious zealots could feel abortion opponents if it's the devil's baby?), but instead they decided that Ron Perlman and his terribly named kids were killing a group of people and the terribly busy doctors were trying to calm the hysterically angry, pregnant girl. Not a single person from this episode or what you should get away with. It's just awful. Like Plan 9 from space terrible. For example, good god, someone would turn it off before I got so badly polluted. Look at that and that thing the same day, and your mind will implode.
