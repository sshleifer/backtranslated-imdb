Someone owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, many people do it. And I start. The Ang Lee movie Hulk never interested me because of the almost unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels rarely seemed to show it. I finally decided to check it out yesterday in the US network and, wow .... <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK <br /> <br /> It was boring! I almost did not come through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was terrible, Sam Elliott was unlikely (and that's no fun, he's usually a cool character). I honestly believe that they chose Eric Bana because his blank face was easiest to imitate with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk should in fact resemble Bruce Banner in his not-so-annoying state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle, I was ready to give Hulk the worst superhero movie of all time. <br /> <br /> But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this boring movie, there was a really exciting and - I can say - reasonably convincing - advanced action scene that begins with the outbreak of Hulk from a containment chamber in a military base, against M1 tanks and Comanche Helicopters in the desert, then ridden into the stratosphere with an F22 Raptor, only to be caught on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was pretty good. That does not mean that the Hulk was absolutely convinced. However, it did not require much more lifting of disbelief than in many action movies that are not superheroes. And that's quite a feat. <br /> <br /> Of course, the end was really stupid when Bruce Banner's father turned into a shapeshifter, but the earlier long action sequence shamed Iron Man's short exploits. Apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really seemed like the CGI in Hulk was doing everything to convince you that it was real and really interacting with its environment. It was definitely better than I expected. <br /> <br /> OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Do you know what ... It's boring, too! It only has a few appearances by Hulk and here is the thing - the CGI in this movie is awful. Maybe the Hulk looked a bit spotty and cartoonish in Ang Lee's version - but also had his convincing moments. The Incredible Hulk looked ridiculous. It had a skin and muscle tone that did not even look like a living creature, just a kind of computer-generated texture. It was really absurd. The lighting, the environment, and the facial effects did not look five years older than Ang Lee's, they looked ten years older. And there is really no excuse for that. We're actually living in a time when computer programmers can ruin a movie as thoroughly as any director, actor, or cameraman ever could. Worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing about Ang Lee's "failure". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is virtually emotionless. The general is so adamant, implausible one-dimensional, that he appears faker than the hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to pay tribute to Liv Tyler for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are eye-friendly). Tim Blake Nelson is almost the same as Nick Nolte, although he is only a few minutes in the film. The Hulk really does not do much in this movie, much less in Ang Lee's version. The incredible Hulk was a bit faster, but since nothing happened, that's not worth much. Oh yes, the villain is as fake as the hulk. He is actually much more interesting than a monster. <br /> <br /> So I can definitely say that Ang Lee's version was better: If I ever had a chance to see Ang Lee's version again, maybe I could prevail to see the good action sequences or otherwise try to value the dialogue a bit more (I would probably go to the good parts quickly). But there is absolutely no single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is seen once or twice. It really is the end of the pile of superhero films. The cartoon-like CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lee's version, it seems they want to make it realistic (apart from the giant poodle of course). <br /> <br /> Unclear how the filmmakers intended to wipe out the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by making almost the same movie. <br /> <br /> It is Edward Norton's merit that he seems to distance himself from this film.
