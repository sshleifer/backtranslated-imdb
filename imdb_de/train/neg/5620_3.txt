Really no reason to investigate this much more precisely because of some very blatant and biased misleading statements. A perfect example is when the filmmaker claims "Saul" or Paul of Tarus (the author of the book of Hebrews). He claims he has no idea that Jesus is or was a man, this claim is either deliberately wrong when he accuses others to present, or he does not know what "The Bible" says. First, we can test his misleading statement about Hebrews 8.4; He shows a quote "If Jesus were on earth, he would not be a priest," so he uses the ignorant and unskilled spectator here to accept his false premise. Why? He does what most of the so-called Bible-believing people he is accusing do the same. That means taking things out of context. Verse is one of Hebrews 8; 1. "Of the things that we have spoken, this is the sum: we have such a high priest standing on the right hand of the throne of majesty in heaven." The above context speaks CLEARLY of a Jesus who ascended to heaven on earth and after his supposed resurrection. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out-of-context scripture. Here he offers the basis that "Paul did not notice any human Jesus, but only one in heaven" <br /> <br /> follows? <br /> <br /> see if the filmmaker is honest Hebrews 7 14. "For it is evident that our Lord jumped out of Judah; from which tribe Moses did not speak about the priesthood. "Hey, did not the filmmaker just quote from the Hebrew writer who tries to show that the author of this book has no knowledge of a 'human Jesus?' It is likely that Paul did not write Hebrews, but I will not The filmmaker claims that Paul did, and that's the premise of the point given here. <br /> <br /> It's not like This filmmaker does not make decent points in certain areas, but he does the same blind inclination of religion on which he relies: as soon as he deals with this tactic, he loses credibility as a religion, he believes, and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion and a prejudice of Filmmaker, nothing more, nothing less.
