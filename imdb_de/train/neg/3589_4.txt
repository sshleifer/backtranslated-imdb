I was attracted to this movie when I looked at the cast list, but after seeing it I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed. The main problem of this movie is that actors can not keep the movie on their backs. Why? Because of bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones make a great effort to take this movie to another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too common. For Matt Dillon fans, this is a movie, just like for lovers of beautiful Diane Lane. The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but this is not a movie for him. far below its level. So, if you're excited about this great cast, look at them, but do not expect anything big or out of the ordinary. The only thing you'll remember about this movie are Diane Lane scenes; The rest is very forgotten.
