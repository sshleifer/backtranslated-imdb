Although I rated this film 2 because he was hard pressed to create a high quality horror movie, he was a 10 on the unwanted funny scale. I could not figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were, but I did not care because I knew every scene would have something that would make me cry with laughter. The dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie, but I think that's because they started without a script. The fact that there is no plot line makes the film extremely versatile. It does not matter if you watch the movie from start to finish, or if you watch it in the rewind, you are mistaken for enjoyment. I especially like the scene where the inmates take turns running around each other and beating each other with sticks. I think the doctor calls this treatment. Genius!
