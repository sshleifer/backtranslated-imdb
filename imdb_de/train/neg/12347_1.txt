This is probably the worst movie by Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director. But this movie is a black mark of his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both totally crazy in a hypergressive movie about a girl who goes to the army. Very dumb. And there is never a scene that convinces in any way. It's really not difficult to make such a movie. Everything the crew does could have been an idea of ​​everyone. The authors did not have much inspiration; many stupid dialogues that made no sense at all; and some mindless action. I strongly recommend keeping away from this garbage. I hope the many talented people involved in this project realize that this kind of movie does not merit their attention, and that they will be working on more honorable and smarter movies in the future than this useless mess.
