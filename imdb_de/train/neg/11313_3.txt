and it does not help rohrer's case that a few years later Syberberg did an amazing job on the subject (with a little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie did not work. When it came out, it looked so lousy, without comparing the Syberberg movie, which was probably filmed on an even smaller soundstage with fewer resources. I can not really remember at the moment if there are any horses in the Syberberg film. All I know is that the German version is pure magic, while it looks like a college production documented on film for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> The music ... la musique ... is not even credited here on IMDb ... but someone who based it on "12th-14th century airs" or something ... well, it's not much help for the movie. It comes as fake and cheesy from the picture magazine mon cher !!! <br /> <br /> rohmer is one of those French auteurs who usually find his guides unattractive, and that does not help. syberberg's Parsifal was enchanting and on German TV today I sold some special bike he invented ... <br /> <br /> I shudder to imagine what it's like to watch the Syberberg on video so bad that the experience was a whopping 5-hour travesty, but even then, what this version has to offer should be surpassed, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Serious, for Chuzpe, but ... this movie just needed more money. it does not look like a medieval manuscript, it looks like CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! Oh, and yes, it ends very arbitrarily when Parsifal goes to church and this cheesy passion play is thrown in ... blah!
