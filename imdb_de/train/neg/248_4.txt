When does the pain stop? I never want to see a version of a Christmas song again. They keep shooting movies with the same story and rushing to try to make the movie better than the rest, but unfortunately they do not, as this is not a good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative, happy thinking. As if people are learning. The many different versions of this film prove that we do not.
