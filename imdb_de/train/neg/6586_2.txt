If you appreciate the renaissance in Asian horror, do not worry with Gawi. The film hardly deserves mention alongside a-list works such as Ringu, A Story of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or even such good material as The Eye or Inner Senses). These films are full of intricacies, unexpected imagery, rich characters, and a decidedly western attitude that frightens what frightens them. Gawi is tense with the left limbs and organs of everything that has mauled American horror for twenty-five years. <br /> <br /> The film tries to mix an Asian ghost story and a Hollywood Slasher movie to fit badly One aesthetics must suffocate the other. guess what? Without telling their own story that the filmmakers plunder Ringu for a bad kid, the situation is hopeless. Clich√©s, crap figures, witless conspiracy, a boring mind, ho hum.
