Disappointing, predictable film in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from state to state because she can not maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre "Anywhere But Here" with Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman, there was a much better insight into a mother-daughter relationship. With better action too.
