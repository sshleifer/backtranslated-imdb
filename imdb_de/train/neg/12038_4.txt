Anything happens in this movie. There are only the bizarre short scenes in which I did not know what the hell was going on, and that does not count. This movie is so boring that it hurts, and that comes from a person who likes watching movies about movies. Confused? Well, after seeing this crap. What was Donald Sutherland because he completely missed it with this. And what about the "pedofile" scene at the beginning of the film? Can make anyone sleep! 4.10
