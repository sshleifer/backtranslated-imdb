I feel like I just saw a snuff movie ... a beautiful looking, tight, captivating and terrible thing! A two-hour litany of perversion in the most basic and comprehensive sense of the word: sexual violence and torture, rape, beheading, incest, corruption, burial and abuse, abuse, abuse. No salvation. And I was entertained. I could not stop watching. What does that say about me, about the people who do and act that way, and a world so desensitized that real snuff movies will eventually become the norm. I am neither Puritan nor humorless, I am not trying to hide from the existence of darkness, and I have definitely not lived a sheltered life, but I am ashamed of myself. And I am sorry that my British cousins ​​are pulling the sewers as my own tribe does. It does not have to be cozy, but does it have to hang around in deputy sadism?
