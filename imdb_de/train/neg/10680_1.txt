SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever made - it's that simple. There is not a single quality of resolution in this movie. The first 10 minutes are pretty tricky - they actually make you believe that this movie will be shocking and you'll be sitting on the edge of the seat. Instead, you'll spend 83 minutes beating yourself while watching stolen and mauled scenes without organization. The lake was ridiculous, looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake floor. Characters display their advanced teleportation powers, such as Alex Thomas, who falls drunk into the lake and then lands in an impossible position on his boat. Angie Harmon made a miserable performance as Kate, interrupted by the dialogue of the space-time continuum, apparently written at the last minute by a fifth student. An example would be if she said, "Flashlight!" so stupid that the threshold shows how much a human body can contract before it snaps in half. After all, editing this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrible thing I've ever seen. It was as if the cameramen were a bunch of chimpanzees who had received camcorders from scientists. An example of this would be when we suddenly see a close-up of the headlight of Alex's car. I bet there was little or no time to edit this movie. The end was absolutely pathetic. The authors were obviously trying to create a kind of mysterious storyline that made the viewer "oh yeah!" Instead, let's look at some stupid paintings of a spider that somehow fit into the plot. Unfortunately, there is not a million-dollar perspective that could save this movie from an icy bitch. <br /> <br /> I give this a .5 out of 10, where the .5 is the fact that this movie was shot on film instead of becoming a picture book.
