I rented this movie because of the merits of the trailer and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make a movie, this would be the end result. I do not think I saw a movie like this, where an LSD trip looked like an episode of Sesame Street. or different realities, and the movie does not end in anything in the last 5 minutes where it suddenly makes sense. I've written a scathing review in my movie review blog that basically betrays everything, and I will not do that here. It's a well-rehearsed piece of cinema, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Let me say this: if there is one single redeeming feature for this film, it is the music. It fits perfectly. Some of the dialogues are unbelievably good and incredibly bad at the same time. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed parts of this movie, I've really done it, and once you're done, you'll really find out what's really going on. It is unfortunate that you have had to go crazy for 2 hours to reach a distinctive point that minimizes the effect of the entire movie. The real problem with this movie is not the acting but everything.
