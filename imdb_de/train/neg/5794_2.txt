The Germans are all standing outdoors and are mowed down with a machine gun. The good guys never die unless it's for dramatic reasons. The "plot" has so many holes that it is ridiculous. (Where did the German soldiers go when they rolled the tank towards the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea of ​​kidnapping a train? How stupid is that! The Germans know where you're going, it's not like you can leave the track and drive away! What a waste. I'd rather hit my head 10 times with a bullet hammer, then I'll have to go through that again. I mean, seriously, it felt like the 60s, but it was produced in 88 !! 1988 !! The A team is more credible than this terrible apology for a movie. Just look at it, if you need a good laugh. This movie is for Tele Sevalas, which was Green Beret for John Wayne.
