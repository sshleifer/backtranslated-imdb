I watch hundreds of films every year, including many amateurish, straightforward, low-budget DVD outrages that no one would expect. I've watched thousands of films in my time, many have won, many have forgotten. Zombie Nation I'll forever remember one of the most hopelessly ridiculous "horror" movies I've ever seen? In fact, I still have not recovered from the experience of watching. <br /> <br /> The day after, it seems like a strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why is the police working in a warehouse? Did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the "zombies" eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /> <br /> I would not recommend Zombie Nation if you want to watch a "good" movie, and I would not recommend it as "so bad, it's good". But if you enjoy the prospect of seeing the most infallible suspicious movie of all time? This is for you. Whenever someone asks me what the worst movie I've ever seen, I'll say Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Seriously? I think it's a bigger crime to shoot a boring movie than a bad one. Ulli Lommel deserves to have produced a movie that stuns you with his inability. He's really the Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age, and I can not wait to see if he's doing another movie that's just as ridiculous as this one.
