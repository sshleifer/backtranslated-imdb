This movie is deeply idiotic. A man wants revenge for a crime - but when he makes his revenge, there's a video camera focused on him all the time. Which man with a brain cell in his head would sit there in front of a video camera for so long? <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this script can never happen unless someone could not dress it destroyed it for me - but it got dumber !!! <br /> <br /> I think screenwriters have some serious habits that cook their brain cells and make them overlook plot holes, and you can drive a battalion of armored tanks through. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A man seeks revenge for the death of loved ones, but in the middle of the plot something goes awry and then the unexpected unfolds. <br /> <br /> If only these people who wrote this story had not been stupid enough to write completely unrealistic phrases that would never be possible in this way. I tell the writers, I'm looking for help for your serious mental problem.
