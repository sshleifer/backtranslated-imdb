What a horrible movie! The idea that robots fight each other is cool, but the plot is ridiculous, real human actions ridiculous, non-existent, and special effects (which this movie has to depend on) are archaic. I thought it must have been made around 80-84 and was amazed to see that it was 1990. That's 5 years after aliens! OK, many people said it was good considering the low budget, but I just think, "what's the point?". it looks totally incredible. I would like to see a remake with modern special effects and a completely rewritten story, because I still like the idea that huge robots are beating up manure.
