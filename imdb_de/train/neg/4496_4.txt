This film is a Cringe festival of bad drama and bad set design as well as crisp lines and a lame plot. But it's so much fun to watch. Everything about it is hilarious. The basic plot consists of a group of scientists from the future who travel back in time to catch their evil colleague who wants to destroy them all. They meet with him in 1146. The 2033's' futuristic 'laboratory of scientists is a' 80s-style room with a series of 'futuristic' flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a turf. The performers express their lines with uncomplicated enthusiasm, which is not difficult to understand, considering that there are usually earth movements like "I checked everything twice!" He checked everything twice? He checked it four times? Not only that, but they provide you with the full premise of the movie for the first five minutes and continue at a rapid pace until they reach the medieval part. When Roger Corman runs out of money. And had to stop traveling through time and consequently different sets. The medieval set is a comic mix from the late 10th century to the 16th century. Every costume they could find used them. I think Hauberk was out of budget because the boys are all wearing sequin shirts that dress up as armor. The battle scenes are ridiculous, and men casually throw themselves on cardboard swords without giving up and dying in death, no more throws. That sounds really awful, but I enjoy it every time I see it. The lines alone are enough to get you going, and everything else gets together to create a fabulous B-movie that, if you're a connoisseur of nonsense, I'd suggest you see. And as soon as you have read the review on Unknown Movies. I love hearing them show off all the funny, really horrible parts of the movie.
