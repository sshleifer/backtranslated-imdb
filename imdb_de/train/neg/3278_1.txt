I have to say, many people have argued that some of us have to deal with the times, as the new "Dukes" movie is a modernized version. OH PLEASE. If you think that modernized, Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site have also said (and I quote) "their old fog has to get over it and save it as it is." Well, let me tell you something, I'm 24, so I'm far from being OLD FOGIE, and I will not get over it. The only correct thing in the movie title was "HAZZARD". Was all the obscenity, smoking and drinking really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica has been to several morning shows to discuss the movie, and frankly, I believe everything has gone to her head. She's NOT Daisy Duke, maybe a coincidence, but definitely not a duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as Bo. They should at least contain the original cast as cameos, but even Hollywood knew they would not approve of the script. I mean, people, even today's actors and actresses express a negative opinion. Why do some of you make positive comments?
