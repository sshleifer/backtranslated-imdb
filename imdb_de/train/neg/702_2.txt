Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher, and the light fades quickly. If not her, what other reason to see this. Five college kids are enrolled to prepare an old dorm for the demolition date. Problems arise automatically when a strange homeless man applies and the group has few people. Then a murderer is going on. I wanted to honestly say that I would enjoy this. It had a fair construction, or maybe it was just Daphne Zuniga. The movie is too slow and almost as quiet as a library. Most of the drama is below average and the point-of-view moments are so old news. The acclaimed composer Christopher Young of such films as "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" achieved this in a repetitive cue line that was more suitable for a television movie. Still, it seems to be higher than the movie deserves. Unlike Young and Zuniga, this guy scratches the bottom of the barrel.
