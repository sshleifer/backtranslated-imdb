I expected a combination of scifi and epoch film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of the computer, etc., and was disappointed with these nonsensical pseudosciences and a mix of real and fabulous story. It gives the impression that his author (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding of math, technology, or history that make up the subject of the film, but works in a kind of blurry artistic sense of it. This hits a sore spot with me as I have long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to misuse scientific concepts and ideas to the point of confusion and terribly abuse them, eg: Emmy Coer: "Information waves have a half-life", Ada: "I am not sure that half a life is better than no life at all ". <br /> <br /> This film is worse than he does not talk - he is misinformed. The only redeeming value I can imagine is that it might make the viewer learn something about the subject that he so strongly distorts. I think it's more likely that a superstitious perception of science and technology will be differentiated from any progress than magic.
