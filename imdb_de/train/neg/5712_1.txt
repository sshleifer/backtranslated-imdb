After that bastard, my husband and I wondered if it was actually the result of an experiment, if a computer program could make a movie. It was so listless and formulaic. But the US propaganda that has been cast into your face throughout the movie proves disappointingly that it is the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like "We Must Steal the Declaration of Independence To Protect It" Seem A Chance To Justify Actions Like The Invasion Of Iraq Use the Declaration Of Independence As A Negotiation Chip "Having a straight face made me and asked my husband if the entire cast had killed Valium before she shot each scene.The "reasoning" behind each turn and the new "hint" is really ridiculous and impossible to prosecute, and there is also a bonus subplot of Misogyny, whereby Dr. Whatever-Her-Name was punished by "never shut down" by anyone involved, she is clearly in the movie just for the looks, but they felt the need to beat a "Dr." title on her Character to give her some gravity ... At one point, Cage's character says, "Do not shut up?" And the camera swings over to her as if she were to be a child. Really grotesque. The only advantage of this movie was that it is so amazingly bad that you get a few laughs from it. The really scary thing is that the majority of people who watched the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Creepy....
