"This Malcom show on FOX is really killing ... can not we make our own version?" I speculate and formulate, of course, but in our hearts we all know it's true, and the only thing NBC added to the "Malcom" metric was sex. And, boy, they added sex ... <br /> <br /> Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets a boner and covers him with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally enters his aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching her and knocking her away. He spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window and she knows he wants to see her topless, but she teases him by smiling and closing the window. And that's all in the pilot project. <br /> <br /> Take it from an adult male - the puberty of a boy is so crazy and driven by testicles that it's impossible to make fun of it for a mainstream audience. The only time someone ever approached was in movies, and you can count them on one hand. No wonder that "Tucker" has the warmth and charm of a strip club bath. Did the network really have the impression that we would like to fight children with puberty? Is not that the stuff people are going to jail for? If you doubt the show is bad, consider the following: 13 episodes were shot, but NBC canceled them after only 4 episodes aired. They then made the unprecedented step of "burning off" the remaining episodes by broadcasting AFTERNOON so that no children could see them. Ironically, as children were originally the target audience. <br /> <br /> Aside from its general quirkiness, Tucker has a voice that plays the main role in emphasizing the simple writing. Even in 2000, it was terribly outdated, with ska music and super sarcasm. I could not have had enough of the characters to laugh at the jokes, and the jokes did not come a mile a minute ... too bad for NBC for this dirty rip-off ... they're better than that. <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
