I realize that the US Army was demoralized in 1971, but this movie was incredible. It was supposed to be a training camp, not the SS punitive battalion in a novel by Sven Hassell. The writer must be a true hater of the army. The psycho-sergeant, who was constantly beating people's crap, was a prison cell, and the useless black top sergeant should have been fired as well. These men were going overseas, the receptionists would have wondered where the uselessly damaged recruits came from, and an investigation would have taken place. The scene that completely burned it out was that of an electric shock. Farrell, the alleged lawyer for barracks, would have instructed the instructor about a barrel for issuing an illegal order (to torture POWs in violation of the Geneva Convention), actual assaults on a man, sexual assault and behavior that an officer would not have liked , given. Intead he just goes away. Thereafter, discipline slows down to a madhouse level and the film is unsurpassed. I do not know how it ended, I went to bed.
