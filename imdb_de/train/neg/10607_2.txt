Jean Claude Van Damme is trying to save his career by making the sequel to Universal Soldier. But did this movie save him? I think he goes to hell after he dies. <br /> <br /> The first minute we see the inside of a facility where you can see the evil of the movie. Scary, right? But not as scary as the drama (details follow). <br /> <br /> Then we see Van Damme with a black girl (I do not remember the name ... well, it does not matter) and tries to escape some soreness. Of course it's the new universal soldiers. More muscle, less brain (just like in the movie). After a while, Van Damme fights Goldberg, but then the "mission" is canceled. It was just a test (is this film a test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme is working for the government on the new Universal Soldier project (anyone who has seen the first film might think that this is the most illogical thing Van Damme's character might be able to do). But it is a sequel. And a "story" has to come up. Ah, I forgot. He has a daughter. Very important for the "story". After about 20 minutes, a supercomputer hears a conversation about shutting down and ending the project. Of course, the cube gets angry and activates all the soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme flees from the facility BUT the computer sends some soldiers to hunt (he wants Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best (really?)). And you know, Goldberg is one of the hunters who was always stupid to the crowd before he left the game. Funny? Yes, just like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After some "stories" Van Damme tries to save his daughter (his wife - the reporter in the first film). There is a final show in which Van Damme fights Bad Guy, and you can see the most expensive scene in the entire movie (see for yourself. It's just too funny to say). <br /> <br /> You will see that this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> So do not watch. If you do, keep a six-pack with you!
