I saw this movie on Sci-Fi before I went to work. If you're interested in seeing Dean Cain diving and not being flamed at least a dozen times, this movie is for you. If that does not increase your interest, well, I'm afraid you wish you were the one who was going to burn, because this movie is pretty bad. The drama is terrible at first, terrible, terrible. The characters are all completely disgusting and the dialogue is worse than with a typical Z-grade sci-fi movie. In the end, the movie reminded me of 'Hollow Man' (complete with escaping from elevator shaft) except a dragon, not a naked, invisible man. Unlike other similar films, this one was not even unbelievably bad ... it was just bad.
