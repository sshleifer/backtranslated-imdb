Can I rate this with a minus? No? Well, let me say that this is the cruelest movie I have ever seen. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. The plot (?) Is well hidden in several levels of nebulosity. I rented this movie from a friend and after we had hoped for about thirty minutes that it would get better, we decided to go "a little bit forward" to see if things got better. It never gets better. This movie about a guy kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting, but in reality it's just boring. Nothing happens that is interesting even remotely. If you ever have the opportunity to see this, do yourself a favor and try "PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE" instead.
