If there's a movie that's the worst this year, it's TASHAN. The first promo movie suggests that the movie will be a boring Dhoom 2 movie. Well, at first I knew it could only be a bad movie. It's a Yashraj movie. Or maybe you can see the cheesy promo. But this movie shook me. It was even worse than Dhoom 2 and what I expected. First introduction of Saif, which is boring Oh God, what is he doing in such a funny movie? What role does it play? What acting does he do? His first scene is fine, but then his act is repeated and he looks overly. Then came Akshay, who provided some beautiful scenes, but then the film became boring and with all the outdated stuff of childhood, an overdose of Rajnikant-style childlike action scenes and all the boring scenes. The end is yet another joke. <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya should have directed 3 movies more if this movie worked, that's Yashraj's strategy, just money. So Vijay is another addition to her list Crap-filmmaker Vishal Shekhar is usually <br /> <br /> Performances Akshay Kumar comes in the movie like a breath of fresh air, he actually delivers some engaging moments. Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is just as bad. Anil Kapoor hams outrageously and pampers the show even more rest are okay
