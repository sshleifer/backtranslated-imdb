I liked this show! I think there was nothing wrong with that! Except that Spidey does not beat anyone, but that does not suck the show! Some people just think that this show is bad for that reason. The story was great and fun when other heroes like X-Men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man showed up! Too bad that Sandman never shows up, but I kind of like it! Best Spidey Show ever !! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. The Hobgoblin 4. The Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> <br /> But there are some episodes that were really bad: Rocket Racer and The Spot who was embarrassing to see. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. First, Morbius suck blood instead of blood and I do not like vampires. And it irritates me that in Season 2 he was almost the main villain. Of course I have to mention Hydro Man! He was terrible! I rather see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I do not like Spidey as the man-spider! <br /> <br /> But I think everything was bad!
