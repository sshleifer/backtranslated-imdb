Someone compared this movie in a way with High Noon. That's a right track! I'm a big fan of Sinatra with some of his roles, but maybe Don Knotts would have been the only person who could have played that role. First of all, somebody said, Sinatra just does not have the right body for a western, bad man who might like it. He is simply too weak in his life at this time. Maybe he was about the size of Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a pretty solid physique. Sinatra appears as the big talking little kid that nobody should take seriously. <br /> <br /> The story is unimaginative and really unbelievable. I do not want to spoil it, but I think that the end and behavior of citizens in this story makes no sense. Another thing, these people are constantly dominated by a 'bad guy'. This is just a small town so I do not get the attractiveness nor do I understand why people dominate in this way. <br /> <br /> There is a "love interest" in the story and if I followed him correctly, she was upset when the main character refused to admit who he was so another villain would not kill him. Now there is true love for you. 'Get up for you! Tell him your name so he will kill you! LOL. Stop, you kill me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic requirement of the film is not good enough and no matter how they tried this story, there was no logical way except to go into the trash. Would you like to know why it is not shown on video and never on TV? The critics apparently pushed it in 1956, and they were right - this movie is pretty bad. I would almost bet Sinatra paid as much as possible for a deep six. <br /> <br /> You want to see a good western in which a city opposes a villain? Try Tension at Table Rock or At Gunpoint - two really good westerns with this theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the greatest singer of all time - but you're not in a movie like this.
