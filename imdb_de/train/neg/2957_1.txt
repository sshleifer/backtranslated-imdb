What a mess!! Why was this movie made? This and other movies of his "caliber" should be a teaching tool not to do a movie. Children like it, but anyone over the age of 10 may or will reject it. The worse was the fact that such a great talent as Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl was wasted in a movie worthy of no announcement.
