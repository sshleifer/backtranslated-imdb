BEGIN SPOILER: Just funny and memorable for Mr. Chong's literal roach smoke scene: Chong crushes a stray cockroach into the bowl bowl, lights up, coughs and hacks for an apparent eternity, then with perfect aplomb and without a beat, the bowl loads properly again , lights again, starts again. END SPOILER. Unfortunately, I lost faith less than half the process. I noticed that the lying duo is abominable and unrelated. I have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of the contemporary Stoner Harold and Kumar. I prefer a brighter company. Still, the movie is probably perfectly suited for baked brothers or those spectators who are so moronic that they are outwitted by a stoner when they are - the former sober. Remarkable guest appearance of Paul Reuben's spitting obscenities in pre-Pee-wee form.
