First of all, I want to say that I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other movies, but this movie is just like my summary. The biggest bag of dung. At the beginning, Chris Rock plays an up and coming comedian, who gets stage fright in a comedy building called Apollo. On the way home from a gig while riding his bike, he sees this woman he likes and gets hit by a truck. A little later he chooses the body of an old, white and selfish millionaire. Then he disguises himself like the music group Outkast, while he tries to play the scene from the original, where he appears as a jockey. Second, he returns to Apollo and tries to be the comedian he tried to be in his previous body. He begins to disguise the white population and tries to be black. Do you get my drift? This movie is awful, he tries too hard to be like the original and seems like a bag of crap. Just take my advice, do not even watch this movie.
