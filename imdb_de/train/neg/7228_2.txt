The good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good costumes First class production. Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> An awesome mix of actors with all CGI actors blends Fifth Element with Final Fantasy. The CGI actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago. Bad logic. A huge pyramid appears and no one explores it, no one even asks. And there is no explanation why the god Horus was driven out at all, and was there no reason why he had to do something as trivial as Impregnat Jill? <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> Terrible script. So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully implemented. The dialogue was almost ridiculous in some places. Random characters and events that are not needed. Boring characters. Jill is supposed to be this riddle, but apparently it was just a mystery to the author. It's not for her She is uninteresting and boring to look at. It has no substance, no texture. Her character has no redeeming qualities. In fact, throughout the movie, not a single character with a purpose has goals (other than the obvious one of Horus), no motivation. They are weak and poorly designed. There are no missions - the key to screen writing. Horus does not become immortal, but he is a bad guy. You can not even decipher if Horus or Jill are the main character. That's the problem: dedicating half of the movie to each character means that the writer never fully explores a character, never succeeds. There are cardboard cutouts that run around and talk. They do nothing but explore the fine set pieces. For the first time Director Pacing. Slow, slow, slow. I'm still watching the movie as I write this. I can not watch because it is boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is short-lived and sometimes unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Overall: <br /> <br /> No clock worth. Worn story, subordinate character development, hackneyed CGI does not save the beautiful set production.
