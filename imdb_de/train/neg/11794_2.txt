A mediocre original image of the sci-fi channel. A little wind, but not much. The Atomic Submarine, U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep under the thick, cold ice near the North Pole as he is attacked by huge, supercharged electric eels. A crew member (Simmone Jade Mackinnon) believes he has found a way to communicate with the monsters, but for vague reasons he has no big chance. The crew also includes David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie could have been a little better if the eels / monsters were not so cartoonish.
