I did not know about this movie before I was convinced to see it from a friend who had heard that it was an "endless epic battle scene from beginning to end". That could not be further from the truth. This was one of the most boring, badly written, amateur-staged, horrible-looking movies I've ever had. I would put it first with the movie I consider the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Earth. There is basically no story, it is hard to believe that the creators of this film have thought that this kitschy soap opera bag would be taken seriously as a historical fact. It also contains some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... The guy tells the girl, "They smell like the moon." Girl answers "How does the moon smell?" OH MY GOD! You want to kid me! The scene in which the guy was drawn and quartered brought some good laughs from the audience as it looked so ridiculously cheap and the guy's sound effect that was torn apart reminded me that someone made a fart sound with his mouth. If this happens in a theater near you, you should definitely avoid it. This movie is so bad that I actually made the decision after 45 minutes that I had to catch up on my sleep ... and I did. Dreadful.
