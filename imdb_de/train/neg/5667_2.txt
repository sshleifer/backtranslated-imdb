Had I checked the IMDb before borrowing this DVD at Netflix, I would have a few hours of my life back. To be honest, I'm suspicious when I see that even the director of a film wrote it. In this case, the same guy, according to the credits "Writer and Director" - unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production. There were some interesting moments (for example, Judy Tenuta's scene recalled her early comedy routines in which she referred to Judy-ism), which caused me to rate those two stars. These moments, however, were very rare ... and I almost did not see them, because the opening sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to mention the reprehensibility of their violence. I admit that I looked at this part again to see if I had missed something that would help me find out as soon as I saw the whole thing. No, although I've at least realized who the characters were that would later turn out to be important. The technique of the "spinning camera" was overused and essentially meaningless. I talked to the TV screen: "What?!?" or "For God's sake, join us!" Not recommended.
