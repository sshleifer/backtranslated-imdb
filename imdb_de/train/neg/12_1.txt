All I could think about watching this movie was a B class sloop. Many have spoken of their redeeming quality as this film presents such a realistic account of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self-sustaining state of unfortunate events. However, the applied techniques (as many have already mentioned) were overwhelmed and therefore unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it was a little dull, unimaginative and implausible and tortuous. You can read most of the other reviews about this movie and they will say pretty much the same thing as me. <br /> <br /> Granted, some of the actors and actresses are attractive, but when faced with such a boring action ... that looks like you've only ever had a movie. The plot is bad and intermittent: a few strikes here and there and a final shot at the end. Nothing to write home about. <br /> <br /> As others have said, 'BAD' movies are great because they are 'bad', so you enjoy that fact. This film, however, is a void. There is nothing. <br /> <br /> If you really need an educational film to chase people away from drug use, then I would seriously recommend a number of other films that bring such issues in much more effective way. "Requiem For A Dream", "Trainspotting", "Fear and Terror in Las Vegas" and "Candy" are just a few examples. However, one should also look at some other lighthearted films on the same theme as "Go" (overall serious and funny) and "Halfbaked". <br /> <br /> Finally, the potentially redeeming line This film, delivered by Vinnie Jones, was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels'. To think that a bit of this great movie was polluted by "Loaded" is abominable. <br /> <br /> Overall, I strongly recommend that you save money and time by NOT watching this movie.
