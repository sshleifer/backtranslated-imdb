I walked into this movie after watching the 82-minute "Borat" tonight and was quite disappointed. I was a big fan of Wallace and Gromit and regularly go to animation films. That being said, I nodded and at one point I almost went out, but I waited until this movie got better. It never happened. <br /> <br /> The visuals are stunning and the language work is first class, especially in my opinion those of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remember a few times that the bulbous lizard was Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie for me is one of those animated features for the ADD set. It registers itself after the deed as a crazy slapstick routine after another, burdened by a syrup-filled plot that triggers every stop to convey an "important message". The animated category looks very much like a broken Oscar bait, and considering how critics score, I would not be surprised if the academy misunderstands and offers their hardware. However, if you are looking for a fun animated feature about rats, you should follow my advice and wait for ratatouille.
