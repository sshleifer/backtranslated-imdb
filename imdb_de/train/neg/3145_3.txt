I'm not sure how related they are, but I'm almost certain that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie (or the story it's based on). Very similar plot, and even some scenes and sets seem very, very similar. Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie. Instead, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie moves very slowly, but is a late-60s French movie that is expected by the style. Looking back from the perspective of one of the girls attending school. Editing the flashbacks with the current scenes is a bit confusing at first, especially as the audio overlaps between them (ie listening to flashbacks when seeing the present and vice versa). Even the "girls" are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school. After all, there is not much character development to even tie you to the movie.
