As other reviewers have noted, the movie dies in the last 1/2 hour. Previously, however, it suffers from predictability and an astonishingly blurry performance from Kate Capshaw, who has clearly not found her character and ruined any scene in which she finds herself. Connery is fine, as is Fishbourne, but most of the scenes are layered on the impact rather than on the whole, with a sense of unreality. And the end is just bizarre. The filmmakers apparently knew, when they created this mess, that they only needed sweet potato and pumpkin pie to eat the Thanksgiving dinner. Therefore, in return they added an exaggerated "dramatic" score. Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes laughable. If you want to see an example of a bad movie in the premier league, you can watch this movie, otherwise skip it.
