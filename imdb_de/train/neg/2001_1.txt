Why did so many people crowd into an evening show of Roberto Moreira's "Up Against Them All" ("Contra Todos") at the San Francisco Film Festival? "It's about a hit man," my friend said. "Well ... and it's Brazilian," I added. Beautiful colorful people, tropical weather, lush rhythms and a hip gangster plot? Undoubtedly many occasions. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell a little detail: This is a very bad movie, really pretty awful and so unpleasant to see how it is done badly. <br /> <br /> How on earth did "Contra Todos" make the rounds of Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, numerous smaller local festivals and now San Francisco? Apparently because of the way the advertising process and the film festival cycle work. <br /> <br /> First, he won first prize at the Rio Film Festival, where he was named the best Brazilian film of the year. It must have been a bad year; They had much, much better. Next, snappy reviews in catalogs and an imaginary buzz lead to overcrowded auditoriums, and as the movie is nowhere to be shown, and so a scrutiny by critics is avoided, he spins the round. <br /> <br/> Festival Blurbs aim for it Sometimes it gets really high during the promotion. A Chicago festival called "Contra Todos" was a speedball cocktail shot directly from Brazil. He named Claudia's friend as the "stud of the slum-like neighborhood". Soninha is "Nodel-like daughter of Teodoro with burgeoning sexuality". The film is shot "with the urgency of an often hand-held camera," and the director "works a real and tangible sense of frustration with domestic desperation and decay." The effect is "unbearably raw and honest", and the film is "racing toward a conclusion that is as dead as the life on display." Not the best font, but it increases the excitement for a certain type of potential viewer. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" actually concerns a hitman, two hitmen, a wife, a daughter and a reborn Christian girlfriend. It is filmed - in hideously ugly digital video with no talent behind the camera - mostly in a barren suburb and not in one of the fabulous "favelas" or village-like Brazilian city slums featuring such wonderful films as "Black Orpheus", "Pixote" and "City of God" were produced and this time not in Rio, but in São Paulo. <br /> <br /> The man with family problems is Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and his partner in a drug problem is Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça). Both actors have a bit of TV experience, as does the actress, who plays Teodo's sloppy blonde wife Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and Silvia Lorenço, who plays his pouting, rebellious daughter Soninha. These actors could make it through the back corners of some telenovelas. Who knows? - In a better directed movie, they might even be good. Aside from them, there are some young men plagued by Teordoro or, when he's busy, thugs. The principals do not work much, although the camera enlarges their pores. <br /> <br /> A few observers, one at the Berlin Festival and one in London, saw the film's mistake, but unfortunately buried back in the Web hinterland. Henry Sheehan said from Berlin that the "film" (his quotes) was "the worst of the video works shown". "The filmmaker seems to have opted for the video just because it was a cheap alternative to film," wrote Sheehan, "and did not use the new medium creatively" - and adds something creative. <BR /> <br /> Sheehan pointed to the film's first major flaw: It begins with a domestic drama that is to be stopped when Moreira reveals in the action half an hour later that the father and one of his friends are invading A professional hit are men: the wait of the thirty minutes does not add anything to the film, it seems like a completely arbitrary decision and is at least a waste of time. But all that Moreira has ever to do is like a little kid who has been given a tool on his birthday and goes around hitting everything in sight with no rhyme, reason or skill. "Devastating, but true." Metin Alsanjak wrote about the 2004 London Festival for Kamera.com and tried to look at the positive side, but gave away the lack of redeeming features when performing the performances "easily Movie referred to "best feature." Yes, very easy, because everything else is so bad. Alsanjak acknowledged that "this violent and shady account of the outlaws in Sao Paulo is devoid of loveable characters and as a result of hope, too dark and cynical to give a meaningful account of the human condition, so the film is badly subtitled not helped ... "Alsanjak's connection between Contra Todos and" Dogme "and Mike Leigh did not help. It was not a meaningful first half-hour otherwise, in which nothing solves the boredom of waiting for the first acts of violence When they come, they simply beat "everything in sight without rhyme, reason or skill" - Moreira awkwardly tries to redeem his abrupt finale by he apparently adds outtakes immediately The characters marry. Undoubtedly, the director wanted to show the "banality of the evil" of dejected men close to the worker, but he can not bring to life the characters he sees generically. And the structure of the film shows that he also can not edit his material. <br /> <br /> (Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28, 2005.)
