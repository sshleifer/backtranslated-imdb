If it had not been the bad dialogues and the script. I mean, the direction was really in touch with the topic. The actors were good at bringing their characters to life. But in the end, there really was not a sound script to keep all the pieces together. I would strongly suggest that you do not see this. Unless you are an Al Pacino enthusiast like me and watch everything he plays in. Even if the result lately is rather bad. This is after S1m0ne a second, very bad movie for this actor who once knew how to choose roles.
