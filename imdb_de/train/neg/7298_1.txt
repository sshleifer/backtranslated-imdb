No redeeming qualities can be expressed. I wish I could get my time back. beautiful skull face wide smiles really, brightly into the camera, when the disease has already done enough havoc about the ill-informed script. I was glad to see all the characters dead (or spoilers), or to be severely immobilized in the end, especially the party-crazies drinking the spoiled juice on the way to the supposed sunset. Maybe Eli Roth shines for a few moments and brings up the theory of how well weeds smoke in the forest while others indulge in beer consumption. All in all, I found most of it pointless, if not without unnecessary violence and not enough nudity. I'm glad to see the end of the cast. I wish this trip had never happened (probably you would have had to hang up instead of watching TBS night, ugh).
