"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the many '50s films about hot teenagers who meet the supernatural. In this case, the teens can not pay the rent for their hangout and will be evicted. Since they can not go anywhere else, they opt for a seemingly rushed house. As you may have guessed, some strange things start as soon as they arrive. And in the end there is a turn. <br /> <br /> There's nothing in this movie that you have not seen in other films, but it's still a nice conversation. My favorite character was the stinking parrot. Well, let me put it another way: in a Quentin Tarantino movie, he did not talk like a character, but said things we do not expect from a bird. The movie is a pure hokum, but harmless.
