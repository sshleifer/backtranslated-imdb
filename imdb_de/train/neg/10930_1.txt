This movie is a total dog. I tried to find something to laugh about, just not to feel like I was wasting my money - and my time. The writing in this movie is absolutely terrible. It's a shame that it does not meet the standards of other Hale Storm movies. <br /> <br /> They should have saved the money to get D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, and the money spent on editing the script was right. Even Gary Coleman was not properly used for his role. <br /> <br /> In this movie you will wonder what the main part of the plot was - including the subplots. After watching this movie, I had the impression that the producers were hoping to capture a kind of Napolean dynamite-like humor that was less about the lines than the character and the delivery. Unfortunately, this movie does not deliver the lines, characters, delivery, or humor. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
