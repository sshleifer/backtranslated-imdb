I simply could not finish this movie. I chose what I wanted to call my nomination for the most miserable attempt at sexual suggestion: a scene where Pia Zadora is having a picnic between two boys who want her. One (the good boy) asks her to see the error of her ways. The other (the bad boy) just asks if she wants a hot dog he thinks is her. At walking height. I hope I do not spoil anything to say that she turns around and takes the hot dog with a smile. Just pathetic.
