This movie has to be one of the worst I have ever seen on DVD !!! The plot could be clicked if the movie had more money and writers cutting the nonsense and the sickly scenes that I'm very attentive to my parents ... But the plot is like a loose cannon. If there was something like a drive-through movie maker, it would have come out of it. It reminded me of the many quickie movies that came out in the 1960s, bad writing and filming. <br /> <br /> The only reasonable characters in the entire movie were the bartender and the beaver. The rest of the movie could easily have been made by schoolchildren. I rate this film as 1, because it is really horrible and my whole family has the feeling of being cheated. My advice - do not look !!!
