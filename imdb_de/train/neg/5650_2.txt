William Shatner is bearable in small doses. Instead of leaving his character as a small irritation and looking at it in this moderately amusing way, it was considered appropriate to broaden and exaggerate its role. Just like in the original Star Trek series. I think I'll never understand the American humor, which often works exaggeratedly to convey the message. I vote with my feet. I'm not watching the show anymore, which is a pity, because the rest of the cast was good. It is a pity that Shatner's exaggerated role also influenced the performance of James Spader. But the majority shows how society is evolving, I think. I do not ride the same routes. Frank
