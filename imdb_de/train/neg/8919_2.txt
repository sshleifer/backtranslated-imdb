I saw this for the first time when it was selected as a suggestion by my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting. Plus, I'm a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and that started with the look and feel of his' 30s cartoon. With both I thought it would spark my interest. I was wrong. Only a few minutes and I had pressed the fast forward button. I played it in about 15 minutes and thought that was it. Afterwards I read some of the other reviews here and thought that I would not give him enough chance. I picked it up again and looked through it. There are 75 minutes of my life that I can not get back. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that there are no worse reviews. Personally, I think that's because it's hard to reach the minimum of 10 lines. How many options are there to say that this is a waste of time? <br /> <br /> The film looks like a couple of young kids who are ready to fret the world and think they could, with breasts, obscenities and puking jokes. The characters are flat. The parody of "Swinging the Alphabet" is lame, essentially messing up the melody, going from A to E, blasting the obvious profanity with an "F" and then having no idea where to go. The journey through the intestine to the expected landing does not work the first time, let alone the next. <br /> <br /> Down the line, the whole movie is what you would expect from someone trying to get Stone and Parker out of the "South Park" without knowing what's and is not , This can be amusing when you are tall. Otherwise it is not like that.
