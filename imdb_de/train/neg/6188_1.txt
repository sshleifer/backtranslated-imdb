This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre I've seen. It is not certain that the author of the script ever read Bronte's book or not. George C Scott is ridiculous and limps like Rochester - unless he's just upset. Susannah York has the most dated hairstyle of the 1970s I've ever seen in a Victorian movie. The characters hardly talk to each other, so the rich joke in the book, which is the foundation of their deep intellectual and lasting love, has disappeared. The end is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please rent the Timothy Dalton version instead. It's so faithful to the book, it's like reading the novel to you. Dalton is excellent as a Rochester. G.C. Scott is ridiculous.
