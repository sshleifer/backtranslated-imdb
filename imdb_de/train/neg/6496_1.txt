This movie was a disappointment. I was looking forward to a good movie. I'm the guy who starts a movie and does not turn it off until the end, but I'm forced not to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not turn it off was because I'm a big fan of Christian Slater and I wanted him to do it. I was really speechless after finishing the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen in my life. Thank you, Christian Slater, for adding a sense of humor. If you had not been in this movie, I would be bored out of my mind. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins has to stay at the acting. When the movie was over, I did not even get the plot. I was both confused and annoyed.
