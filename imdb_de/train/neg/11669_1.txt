I think it's nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of such a movie. With the sometimes pointless excesses of many Hollywood movies, we can relax and enjoy a scene that contains no explosions, bad language and hackneyed one-liners. Minimalism has its place and can be very effective if used properly. However, this movie is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Record the long scenes without dialogue and bleak, sparse scenery. I am sure that they must have great meaning and insight because the implied message is wrapped in confusion. Acting is bad ... boring and pedestrian ... and shows one of the worst scenes of the story (at the end of the movie, if you can go right to the end). The landscape is monotonous, and the ridiculously long final sequence of the girl walking through the bare park is as comfortable as pulling a tooth. I would call that anti-climatic, but since the film had no climax, even in the "erotic" scenes ..., that would be untrue. I'm sure a script was used during the filming, but with the amount of dialogue I think it might be on a cocktail napkin. Basically, this movie does not interest or amaze ... no great story, no impressive insights, no visual drama, no excitement. Apart from two or three amusing moments, this movie is a waste of two hours. A tragically boring and bleak movie.
