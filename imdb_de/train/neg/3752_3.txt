I grew up with TNG and loved it. I recently watched the entire ST Voyager series on DVD, which may have reinforced my disgust with this episode, as the difference in style and approach between the two shows could not be greater. The idea might have been good if you were to further expand Riker's character, as it would probably have been treated on VOY. They could have had memories that were "new" to the audience instead of just irritating old show clips. The transitions between the "memories" and the "present" in this episode begin as a clich√© in the beginning and quickly become unbearable as the tired pattern continues to evolve. Bar no worst episode ever.
