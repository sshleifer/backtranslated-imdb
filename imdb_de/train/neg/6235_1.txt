Well done, Al Gore! You became the first person to turn $ 1 billion of global warming into a lie! Like all the other people who made fables around the world, this one with the best lies is up there to suck in so many people. Sure, pollution is not a good thing, and I would love it if the tree continues to grow, but global warming is a business! It employs thousands of people, all of whom are very misguided. <br /> <br /> Google it! There are just too many things that just do not match, but well done Al, you have failed as a politician, but then sucked a lot of money in the world. <br /> <br /> What's next? Santa is real?
