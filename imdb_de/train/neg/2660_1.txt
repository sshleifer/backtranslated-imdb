Despite the theme, this is an amateur or exhibitionist film - or a single attempt - that is about as interesting and daring as a melancholy composition book by a high school student full of death "poetry." Certainly it will disturb viewers who desperately want to be disturbed, but the success will be due to themselves and not to the director. To get under somebody's skin requires sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent as well as eye and ear. The film contains an evocative image that is shown as a still image (and is also used on the video box), but with no development leading to that result. If the director had had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie - a movie.
