The rural family drama - perhaps with an indication of "Ordinary People" - concerns a small boy who has retreated after he had fatally injured his older brother in a shooting fire. Despite the awkward theme (which is treated mercilessly by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story to explore. Unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of adult characters to get a grip on the situation make film a troublesome experience. With Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is almost a small reunion of "The Natural." Too bad that this project did not have the necessary talent behind the camera to really get out a gripping, memorable image. * 1/2 of ****
