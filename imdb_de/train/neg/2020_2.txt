This seems to be two films: one is a boring, boring saga about an actor being taken over by the parts he plays; the other a brilliant social commentary on a middle-aged divorce being picked up by a waitress. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side. She gives strong hints about the need for connections, her certificate in massage and her desire to enter the modeling game. I love the view of her dingy apartment with a kitchen behind a curtain and her awesome, seductive outfit with a piping, puffed-up crochet top. <br /> <br /> Do actors get Oscar for Shakespeare? We know that they are Oscars because they pose as people with disabilities, wear a lot of dentures, or pretend they're crazy. The Shakespearean scenes (going ON and ON) are embarrassing and dated. And so are the "crazy" scenes in which Tony seems distracted while hearing his own voice. By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. In an early scene he makes it clear that he used to be a choir boy. When he quotes his father's advice, he gets into a cockney accent.
