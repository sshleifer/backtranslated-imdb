That's pretty ridiculous, I hope that many people come into contact with Muslims living everywhere in the US, the UK and around the world. The religion has over a billion followers. I myself was born in America and have bread, and through my religious teaching and teachings, I have been taught to value my country and to work for society. I dedicate myself very much to the successors, and the teachings of my religion have been emphasized throughout life to educate and prepare for success through education, to make a contribution to the world. I know many Muslims from all over the world and have traveled to countries like Pakistan. I have never met a person who thinks that we should hurt someone or accept any other religion except from the people in the media ... I wonder Why ... It is also sad that these extremists are the ones who are the only ones who Media are to represent a whole religion. It is a religion of a billion people, and this is less than one percent. I am sure that the other members of other religions do not like to be represented by the KKK, the IRA and many others who are just a small percentage of extremists who are outdated and not literal passages from the respected books to their own To pursue revenge, personal or business affairs through their so-called religion
