I have to pat myself on the back to watch this movie all the way, because it was really painful. An incompetent painter becomes a full-fledged batsman? This movie was full of absurdities, and if I mentioned them all, I would pass the movie on. Norm Peterson aka George Wendt really has to be at a dead end to have agreed to film this movie. The acting was unfortunate and the story was even worse. As a rational and reasonable person, I could not understand where the author came from and where he went with this movie. Every main character was incapable, there were a number of unfortunate and ridiculous events, and then the movie ended. An absurd action after another with dialogue does not make a movie, but only a talkative move.
