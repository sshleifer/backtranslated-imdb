Sure, we all like bad movies at one point or another and we really enjoy them. However, this was not even a bad treat, it was just crap. Some guy, vince offer, who's so conceited to make himself the main character, though he was probably drunk / high-probably both-and thought it would be a good idea to make a movie. He then went on to show his script to equally high / drunk persons. Overall, the film was so bad, predictable and unoriginal that I could not survive the 20 minutes before shutting it down. It looks like you are being served like Citizen Kane. Batman? WTF ... A guy who walks around with a bat, real original. Almost as good as calling him Fat Man and letting a fat guy run around in a superhero outfit.
