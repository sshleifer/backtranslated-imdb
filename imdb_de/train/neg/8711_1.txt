OK ..... This is the third in the carnosaur series. Let's play with the dinosaur puppets! At the beginning of the movie, you can not see what the Dino is causing when the body count begins. You can only see the Dino eyesight, quite clever to hide the evil dolls! and maybe in 16 minutes forward in the movie a special team with Scott Valentine as leader Rance, the team enters the storehouse and starts looking for body parts and corpses after the Dino raid for failure in the team and you can hear a Velociraptor screaming, pretty scary! !! and then a black girl moves on and now a blooper is found! It shows a bird of prey and cuts its face, but if you take a break when the raptor hand comes, you can see that it is only a man with a hand puppet! WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorist attacks from a truck cause them to wash some weapons in it. 2. You were absolutely wrong and it seems like ten tons of bird of prey and a huge T-Rex are inside! How did the t-rex fit in ??? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! Unfortunately, a stupid blond girl said he should capture one of them = (4th Jesuits, the Raptors have wheels on their talents!) 5. The Dino's are now sitting on a boat in the Pacific t-Rex had a strange thing on his neck ? 7. THE END: The movie is good if you want a good laugh. 5.10
