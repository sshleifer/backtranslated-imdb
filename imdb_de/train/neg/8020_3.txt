It had a few beautiful poetic pieces, but it's really just an artistic fart-like throw together with no direction or resolution. How do these people get through the film school? Who gives them money to do this crap? It could have been so much more, a good lead actor, and I always like Fairuza Balk, but come on, the old-rock metaphor of sheer staring, who can not find anything, is just so tired, and it does not bode well. The director has to go away and live his life for a long time and only return to the camera when he really has something to say. This is like the spaghetti school on the wall, just to juxtapose a series of serious images and hopes that hell can hope to create poetry. This can work if the director actually has some kind of vision or has a brain that knows when there is potential, but here it is just space filler, without consequence. I felt the lazy end close to impact, and I called "you Lazy Bastard" on the screen as the credits popped up.
