As you all know, JIGSAW did not come to Blackbuster because of a Full Moon employee, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells to all video chains. He recently released a movie, BLEED, which he sold to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to take JIGSAW and double the number of BLEEDs. The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop and BLEED looks like a hit. The main problem is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever, and as we all know, JIGSAW is gold. I ask you all to go to the BLEED site on the Internet and vote for the film that has violated JIGSAW and all your talents. Likewise, you should go to the JIGSAW site and cast high votes (if you have not done so already). We have to bring JIGSAW to at least an 8 or 8.5 and BLEED to about a 2 (that's the 100 worst movie list on the internet). Also try to convince friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> I hope you are all well, - Matt
