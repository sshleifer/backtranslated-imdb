I like watching western movies, but this movie needs the biscuit. The script and the dialogue are ridiculous. The acting was terrible, where did you get it from? Music was OK, I have to say. Luckily I did not buy or rent the movie, but now it's discarded. <br /> <br /> I was initially upgraded when the stranger (Martin Sheen) started telling his story. I must admit that I enjoyed the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex when Hopalong Tex rebuked his finger and told him to practice for 40 years to reach his league. But that was where everything went afterwards in pear shape. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it would get better.
