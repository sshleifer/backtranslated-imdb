If this film was a fictional character, the film could stand alone and be judged objectively. Unfortunately, for the viewer, the film is based on "facts" that are very unfairly shaded to Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller facts were ignored (Carter was NOT Number One at the time of the murders, there is no evidence at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the bigger facts, apparently The Decision Being robbed of "racist" judges by Joey Giardello is unforgivable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape and completely disrespectful to Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make someone a hero who would be in trouble at best and had many more problems than any ordinary person should (which has been arrested on several occasions for beating women) is foreign to me. Ruben Carter never was when he saw his actions in the 1960s, and even now, when he refuses to talk to his son, he's a person people can look up to. Everyone knows that Jewison can direct, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is not mine. Does Hollywood need a black hero so much that they have to bend the truth in all their bio images to make them credible? (Here's a suggestion, how about Denzel making a movie about himself? Well, that's inspiring.) Because of all the inaccuracies in the movie, I'd suggest sharing this movie.
