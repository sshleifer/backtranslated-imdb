Seemingly as a thriller of a movie thought that is almost ridiculous. It made me cry, "Oh my god!" more than once with the confused furnishings that were just stupid. <br /> <br /> Imaginative or absurd venues just because of the novelty or dramatic situation and unlikely, almost impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too much you understand why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have time and want to find out how bad a picture can be, you should see this picture. Otherwise, devote some time to dry some paint to get a more productive investment of the time! <br /> <br /> (The fact that a film released in 2003 will be shown on television in July 2003 may give some indication of the quality of the film.)
