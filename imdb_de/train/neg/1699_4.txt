I'm a fan of Lynch's work, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It's a series of short cartoons trying to show a disturbing and disgusting sense of humor. The animation is very rough, no doubt with Macromedia. Every cartoon has a big, fat guy who beats up his family and generally behaves like an idiot for everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> For people unfamiliar with this animation, they will probably be impressed. However, if you've spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, like me, these cartoons will not be different from the other things you've seen before. Many of the most popular amateur artists on Newgrounds do much better work than what was shown on this DVD. When Lynch submits this work on the website, he fits in perfectly with some of the best Newgrounds artists. But since I saw this on DVD instead of on Newgrounds, I give it a 4/10 instead of a 7/10 as I would otherwise. These cartoons are suitable for the internet, but with a name like David Lynch I expected better quality both in the story and in the animation.
