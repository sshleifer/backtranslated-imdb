As an engineer, I have to say that the first season of this show was very promising. Most of the applied mathematics was reasonably plausible, and the relationships between the brothers and Eppes' father gave the show an interesting edge. <br /> <br /> But after the first season the show started to degrade a lot. Most of the mathematics and technology used in the fight against crime is now completely indescribable and very laughable to anyone involved in science and technology. <br /> <br /> The involvement of the actors still feels good and I can imagine a fair performance. There is still a lot of money put into the production of each episode, but in the end this has become a very unpleasant tasting Court developed, which is a mix of a level C action thriller and a CSI style poli show. <br /> <br /> If you'll see it, you're only going for the first season and possibly for parts of the second. After that, I would not waste my time. I gave up the show half way through Season 3 myself. Season 1 - 8 Stars Season 2 - 5 Stars Season 3 - 3 Stars <br /> <br /> Let's summarize the sum of up to 4 stars. Since Charlie no longer knows his math, I do not care about the correctness of mine.
