This was the worst Christmas movie I have ever seen. I took my two small children to see this. It was the darkest, darkest conspiracy - family has no money, mother loses her job, father is killed in the bank, bank robber steals family car with both children behind and after a chase, drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mom is all alone. No wonder your Christmas spirit has disappeared. Christmas angels do not save drowned children and Santa Claus does not bring back dead fathers! I thought this would be the BADest message to send kids. Better to tell them that there is no Santa Claus than to show them a movie like this !!
