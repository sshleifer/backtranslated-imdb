Based on the personal experiences of John Singleton's time at the University of Southern California, comes Higher Learning. A film focused on the racial politics that is taking place today at colleges today. <br /> <br /> There are three main characters on which the film bases its foundation: Malik Williams, a carefree lowbrow athlete and African American man Kristin Conner, a soft, soft girl, and Remy, a straightforward white man without connection. All three are overwhelmed by the sudden reality that college life is not as good as it is advertised, as all three experience disappointment by being unprepared (Malik), naive (Kristin) and unwanted (Remy). <BR /> <br /> One good thing about the movie is that modern American colleges are just colleges that are capitalized. Colleges are not places where one can develop character, develop potential or promote personal development, but institutions that bring together all sorts of students in an atmosphere suitable for all ages. It's an experience that is usually doomed to failure for most students. It would have been good if the film had made the story about this travesty and not the race policy. <br /> <br /> But it did not, and that's where the movies fall apart. Singleton apparently had a pretty bad experience in Southern California. Through this movie he lets everything hang. Here you do not have to worry about the bush. Singleton makes it easy to spot the heroes and villains of this piece. <br /> <br /> The black characters in the movie are pretty much considered heroes, while all the whites in the movie are seen as the bad guys, except for Kristin, who was raped by a white colleague. Who can understand the inconsistencies of this film? Black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after pointing out who she allegedly raped? The lightness of the black gang members at the university, while a few skinheads meet in a dark, small dormitory planning violence? <br /> <br /> The performances of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They seem to be the third choice for the roles they played in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play Malik and Kristin but were not available). O'Shea Jackson, aka Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King were all irritating in their respective roles. And Laurence Fishburne was furiously ignored here as a history professor. Only Michael Rappaport did well in this film and he thought that his character, the three main characters, has changed the most in the movie. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to deal with race and inequality American college life with this movie. And he did that very badly. It was like killing a fly with a shotgun. Life is much more complex than it seems and people are the same everywhere, and he should know that. Higher learning is the proof that he did not understand that at all. If you saw the film then and now, it would only confuse, disappoint and enrage the same audience that it wants to talk to. Not to mention it would not entertain them in the least.
