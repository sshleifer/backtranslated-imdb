I think Micheal Ironside's acting career has to be over when he has to play in this kind of low buddy. Surely he could do better than waste his time with this garbage. <br /> <br /> This movie could be a lot better if it had a good budget, but it shows the whole movie over and over again. There's a scene in an outpost that looks like the outside of a train station, and I bet that was it. <br /> <br /> There's a scene that caused this movie to have a 3, and that shows The spaceship lands and starts over a lake surrounded by forests. That was well done, but the rest of the movie forgets it. <br /> <br /> There's another scene that looks like a machine shop that I bet on, and does not look like a space outpost character says it is. <br /> <br /> This film is stupid, has a serious low budget, does not make sense and God Help Micheal Ironsides.
