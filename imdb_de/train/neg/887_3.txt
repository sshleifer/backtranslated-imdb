Following the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to shoot a similar anthology film based in New York. In contrast to the original film, the stories in this film sometimes seem to come and go too fast - if you think they're going into a story, it's over in too many cases. And often they start and stop and then start again - with the stories that are interwoven. As a result, there is no title that indicates a story is complete, and it has a less formal structure. Unfortunately, "Paris, Je T'Aime" (mostly hit) hit, most of "New York, I Love You" were missing. The stories tended to be much more sexual, but also less sweet - and often pretty awful. It was an amazingly boring and uninteresting movie with only a few extraordinary stories - and perhaps the often depressing music seemed more like that. Now understand, it was good quality music, but its somber tone really made me feel like cutting my wrists! Among the better ones were the story of the young man who had brought a girl in a wheelchair to the prom, the couple who knew about cheating outside a restaurant (though this was also the first movie) and the old couple. This is all so sad because I loved the first movie so much - and really wanted to have that movie. I respected what they tried, but I just did not like it. By the way, and that's NOT really a complaint, but I was amazed how many people smoked in the movie. For a recent movie, this was unusual in our anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> When you get the DVD, there are two segments that are included as extras and were not included in the movie. One is Kevin Bacon (wearing a cool fedora) eating a hotdog ... and absolutely NOTHING for almost ten minutes. On the other hand, there is a teenager who spends the movie filming the world - including a very unlucky couple.
