I loved the first "Azumi" movie. I've seen Ms. Ueto on various television appearances, and I've seen a ton of samurai and ninja stripes. I have to say that this movie was much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Given the cast and installation of the movie in "Azumi," they should be able to do much better work with this film, but instead, it was slow, trotting in parts and spraying it with very poor, unconvincing, and wooden performances. <br /> <br /> When they bothered to refer to the first movie, they did so in a relaxed and weak way. In "Azumi" the title character is the best of a group of superior killers. In "Azumi 2" it seems somehow less impressive. <br /> <br /> That does not mean that it was a total loss. There were some decent fighting scenes and some exaggerated characters. Unfortunately, the film as a whole suffers from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The last two have really captured the "manga" experience in their script, whereas the former never fully understood it.
