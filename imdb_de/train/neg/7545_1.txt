It is unfortunate that you can not be lower than a star. Before I saw The Wicker Man, I had considered Aliens 3 as the only movie that deserved negative stars. To be fair, The Wicker Man does not hurt the enjoyment of a previous movie, but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by reputation. <br /> <br /> There is also a cheap trick In Hollywood often used when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers, or too hurry to bring a plot to a satisfying result: hit it Shock ending and hope that the public considers it to be something artistic or erroneous. It's a gambit that rarely succeeds, and in this case, he just manages to embarrass a good actor and mock the producers. All the more so as the conclusion "carefully crafted" (or whatever she puts it) apparently did not follow logically from the plot (which of course I can not introduce without a spoiler), but instead denies what the plot deserves up to that point , <br /> <br /> It's a film that could logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly die-hard Nicholas Cage fans, but only to a few mainstream audiences. If you really want something in that direction, I recommend M. Night Shyamalan's The Village instead. Since I lack a kind of memory pill, I have to pay attention to something better to displace it out of my head, such as attack the killer tomatoes or Pee-wee's Big Adventure?
