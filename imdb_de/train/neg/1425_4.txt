I am not sure which HK movies the other reviewers have looked at, but Enter the Eagles is far from high on HK action. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be glad that he can get acting jobs in HK, because he can not get out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (even better with the leg fight than her dad), but her acting skills are also below average. In fact, the entire English dialogue (90% of the movie - even more than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switched to Mandarin Audio just to save myself the misery of poor dialogue delivery and the redundancy of the English language subs , Sure, there are some decent shootings (but nothing we have not seen yet) and good cinematography, but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action. <br /> <br /> That is, it's worth the entrance to see Shannon and Benny "The Jet" Urquidez. Spectacular and almost worth seeing for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, you will notice some scenes that seem "familiar" to you, in particular a shootout on an outdoor market (think of Matrix) and Fitz diving out of a helicopter with black rigors (think to MI: 2). Probably someone thought that at least a few things in this movie would be worth it.
