What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to be copying "top comedy," but the director and script were careless, sick, and sentimental in the worst movie tradition. Jack Black's acting / role was selfish and selfish ... and the other characters were both unmasking and uninteresting. The soundtrack was boring. We are (WERE) Fans of Black, but none of us has made more than one forced Titter for the duration. Why did he feel that he had to make that mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not see another one of his films without reading the reviews! <br /> <br /> Was he drunk when he read that? Script before logging in for this drive?
