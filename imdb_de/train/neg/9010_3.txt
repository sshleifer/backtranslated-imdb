If you want the dragon to eat every actor, you know you're going through a rough ride. <br /> <br /> I came in with very, very low expectations, after reading some of the other comments I was not disappointed Unlike other cheap and outlandish films, this movie does not really remain funny (and unintentionally) funny. <br /> <br /> -SOLILERS FOLLOW- <br /> <br /> First of all plot it is very inconsistent. When you look beyond the "small" mistakes, such as the dragon growing up in three hours, the whole idea on which it's based gets mixed up. You see, the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from outer space in the form of meteorites that were really dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show some farmers pushing their pitchfork for one and the dragon leaps out. Later, the compulsory "crazy scientist" babbles about how dragons have survived the dinosaurs. Apparently humans were present when they were dinosaurs, or we only have a small hole here. The other important thing is that the laboratory is blown up with a force "half as strong" that was used for Hiroshima. Later, two men come in to check everything, and it's almost intact! There is even another dragon who knows who from whom. All in all, it is very predictable. As soon as the guy mentioned the cloning, I guessed that they had cloned a dragon. This means that the security officer for Mr. Smarty-Pants is not as intuitive and intelligent as the movie would have you believe if you ignore that I knew this movie was about dragons. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the "special effects" are the second worst. Others mentioned the initially fake stones, the CG helicopter and the dragon. It looks a little bit better than a blob, but it destroyed everything it wanted when it went back and forth in the same way. In their opinion, the flying dragons looked good in the beginning (although the one in the cave is probably the worst in the movie). These things are weird to look at. The scenes in which a million different shots of the same person are shown in different ways are not shown. There are also no "introductory screens" with the most important statistics. <br /> <br /> They came to the actors, they were not the best, but at least they tried? They seemed more enthusiastic about what they were doing than many of the actors who participated in the last BloodRayne, for example, and you have to give them points. However, I noticed that the woman Meredith plays often covered her face with make-up that was many times lighter than the rest of her. She looked as if she had done badly with some white faces. <br /> <br /> The script is bad and cheesy. You do not really notice the music, but it's usually not that bad. <br /> <br /> In the end, you should not watch the music unless you want to see it because you hear it's bad (like I did, even though the only funny things are the bad CG). Effects are not wasting your time and money.
