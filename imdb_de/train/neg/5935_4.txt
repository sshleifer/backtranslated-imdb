The saddest thing about this "tribute" is that almost all singers (including the otherwise incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to have overlooked the entire point of Cohen's intensity: Cohen transmits his lines in an almost toneless posture, Cohen transmits the full extent of his poetry, his irony, his all-round humanity, his laughter and his tears in one. <br /> <br /> In order to see how some of these singers make devious, suffering faces, they join the patent effort "I'm a singer!" with a miserable cry. Is a real pain. It's the same feeling that many of you have probably heard some horrible opera versions of simple songs like Lennon's "Imagine". Nothing, nothing comes close to the simplicity and directness of the original. If there's an art form that does not need adornments, it's Cohen's art. Ornaments throw it on the street and look like the tasteless make-up of sex for sale. <br /> <br /> In this Cohen tribute, I suffered from miserable tributes and terrible reinterpretations, all of which were without original irony of Master and, if the truth is told, some of these singers sounded as if they were in asylum Talent show has been recruited. It is Cohen who pays tribute to them by letting them sing his material, and not the other way around: they may have been friends or those of his daughter. He could have become very tender and in the mood for a present. Too bad it did not stay in the family. Fortunately, but only at the very end, Cohen himself performed his majestic "Tower of Song," but even this flower was spoiled by the totally uneven background. All of them bear the expression that bored children have when they see their poor grandfather in the nursing home visit. <br /> <br /> A sad show, real and sad, if you love Cohen as much as I do.
