I wondered why John Wood did not Dr. Hawk played until I saw the movie. Bad plot, bad science, bad acting and a bad movie overall. Please do not watch this movie. Rent the original "war games" if you feel nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I did not like the bend in the conspiracy against the terrorist threat idea. In the first film W.O.P.R was built because Russia had directed thousands of warheads at the USA. In this film, the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorists in training before they pose a threat. Aside from politics, the good thing about the first film was that even a stupid computer could finally grasp the idea of ​​the futility of war. Such insight is not offered in this film.
