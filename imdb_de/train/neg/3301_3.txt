The standard procedure for Swedish films seems to be today by throwing plausibility out the window and continuing this path for the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna is another great example of a movie that makes little sense. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm are being robbed by a highly efficient military-style armaments group. Two police officers are beginning to investigate the case, which will soon become more complicated than it would appear at first glance. <br /> <br /> As usual in Swedish film, the cast consists mainly of the same people you have seen again and again. Mikael Persbrandt has to be in every Swedish movie of the last years! But that's alright, I think, since Persbrandt is one of the few who works solidly here (as he usually does). The problems with this film are mainly about the story itself. First and foremost, the raids usually feel like a background. It's more like a movie about a young policewoman who's struggling to prove herself in a man's world (as it was not done with a decent actress a thousand years ago, instead of Sofia Helin). There is also a totally unbelievable turnaround at the end that seems as plausible as the landing of aliens. But still, I thought it was a pretty nice touch, considering I'd been half asleep then. It has upgraded things a bit (and saved the rating before dropping another step). <br /> <br /> In the end, the main problem is the same as most other Swedish films of this kind. Simply that action and tension do not meet the standards we are used to from other films of this kind (mainly Hollywood). It feels cheap and rather weak in comparison. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on action and acting, forgetting to do "Hollywood Action Light" the way they are doing now. Because this will be another unforgettable effort of the Swedish film industry. I rate it at 3/10.
