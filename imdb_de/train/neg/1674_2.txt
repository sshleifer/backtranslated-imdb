The premise was fascinating, but unfortunately this movie does not do it justice. The casting was pretty good and shot beautifully - but stylistically, much of the direction was inconsistent (overly fast styling was over stylized, with no effect). I waited for Steven Bochco to be in the credits, followed by a commercial), characters were identified solely by the use of coke on the screen (and just about everything else that was left for character development by Boogie Nights), and there were none sympathetic characters that involve the viewer in the story. A very memorable movie.
