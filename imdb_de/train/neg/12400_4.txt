Matt Cordell has returned from the dead for a third go-round. I'm not sure if it means anything to anyone except the rabid MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last film, is revived by Voodoo and is now following in the footsteps of several villains involved in the shooting of a fellow officer Cordell loves very much. I missed part of this low-budget quickie in the early '90s, but it was gratifying to see Cordell catching up with the body count in various, cruel ways. The problem is, the whole movie is pretty static and Cordell just is not Jason or Freddy. The interest decreases pretty quickly, even with this great B-movie master Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with a crazy mind. Stay with the first movie in the series, which is funny and scary and exciting at the same time.
