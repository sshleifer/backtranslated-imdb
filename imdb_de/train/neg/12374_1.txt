I can not remember seeing such a different murder / mystery movie. This film about a medical examiner investigating the mysterious death of his friend in a car accident has all the evidence of a bad movie: bad acting, boring story, lack of excitement, bad humor and no drama. I remember watching this movie on PAX, a TV station that's characterized by cheap and Campy Made for TV movies like this one. TV movies, of course, do not have the edge factor or the tension like movies on the big screen. But this movie met every sour taste. The creators of this film have missed the opportunity to turn "Receipe for Murder" into a great TV movie; The title offers some tension. <br /> <br /> So if you want a good recipe, do not look at this movie. This movie alone can kill your TV appetite. <br /> <br /> Note F
