I chose this film to replace the dark choice of daytime television and go with my thirst for Femme Fatales. Well, for the previous one it's better than watching TV during the day .... although I'm not sure how much. <br /> <br /> It has its points, but after about the first 20 to 30 minutes, that's good. The points swing out and it's concluded that they're watching a movie made for television, along with little time has been put together to create something that holds together. In short, a terrible sci-fi channel type. <br /> <br /> It has its dots on how the future is dirty, as "Blade Runner" has shown ..... of course this is not a "Blade Runner". "The captain looks, somehow feels like that Actor Robert Forster, the kind of person you would like to have. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately, it feels more like a bad "Andromeda" hashash, where the muscle of the crew is made up of poor specimens the intelligent gunnery of "Aliens," the mystic vampire Willow is sexually intensified, and the new captain might as well be Jan-Michael Vincent walking around "Danger Island" in the "Banana Splits," only bringing his uniform He has very little right, all running around with their version of power lances in a ship that looks very much like the 'Eureka Maru' as they battle a class of 'people' who occupy the universe and into different races different tribes or sects of different her evolutionary qualities are split ....... like the Nietzsche in "Andromeda". <br /> <br /> With Michael Ironside there might be something redeeming, but after a while you get the feeling that he has taken over the role like a scream! He probably had fun, but it does not help much with the movie. <br /> <br /> It's ... okay. Okay, so you can watch the DVD once without turning it off; If they see it with advertisements, they will probably change the channel. You could take a look .......... but a few hours later I wonder what it was that made her see everything. <br /> <br /> For me that was the Femme Fatale. ............ when she was fighting.
