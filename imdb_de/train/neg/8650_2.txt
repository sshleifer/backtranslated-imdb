If there were no immature, gullible idiots, I know that I look at this "documentation". I would never have seen this comedy! This movie is full of bad scripts and ridiculous moments. One is where the Afghan police / soldiers arrested Don Larson for shooting in the street while allowing the cameraman to continue filming his arrest and then driving on, probably to his hotel. Then there is the scene where a car crashes into another car that has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road with no evidence of an accident or explosion. <br /> <br /> I'm currently surprised the rating he has (5.8 / 10). I thought IMDb users had more meaning.
