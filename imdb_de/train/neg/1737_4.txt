The last film for Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's early death during production, is a juggling act of sophistication and stupidity, romance and music, fantasy and costume drama. In a 19th-century castle in southeastern Europe, a countess falls for her sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian uprising; She is supported by her ancestor, whose painted picture is magically brought to life. Betty Grable, in a long blond wig adorned with flowers, has never been so beautiful and her songs are very pleasant. Unfortunately, this script (by Samson Raphaelson, taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is flooded with various ideas that do not connect - or entertain. The results look good but are not absorbent. * 1/2 of ****
