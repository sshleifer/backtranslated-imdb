Doc Savage: The man of bronze is a terrible movie. Badly written, exaggerated and just stupid. That being said ... it's kind of an entertaining movie. This movie wants to be seen in a group with a large supply of cheap beer. It's one of those movies like "Santa Claus conquers Martians" or "Yor, the hunter from the future" ... it's almost as bad as that. If you have the right group of people, this movie is just great to watch. It's campy. It is fun. It has a theme of Sousa. But if you are looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 10.3. By the way, I've heard rumors that some studio is investigating the possibility of a remake ...
