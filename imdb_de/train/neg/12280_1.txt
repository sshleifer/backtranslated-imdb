I've seen one of the stage performances in Denver and have never been so impressed. The word "vagina" says it all. A body part. Nothing shocking here. I could tell my doctor, "My left arm hurt a bit after tennis" or "My vagina hurts after cycling" with the same or more social comment. It could be the "triceps monologues" for all entertainment or radical comments I've heard. The monologues were boring, but delivered with drama, the themes were outdated and I was alternately bored and annoyed. I think I once laughed, but apparently it was not the time I was supposed to. Surely that's not really a hit. Oh and spoilers: there was a LESBIAN! - oh, maybe do not wait, get over it. And inappropriate cuddling! And a crack mom! That roughly covers it.
