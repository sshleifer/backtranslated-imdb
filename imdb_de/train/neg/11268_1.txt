I was hoping that this movie could at least be seen. The conspiracy was weak to say the least. I was expecting much more from the occupation (I'm wondering if any of them will include it in their resume?) At least I did not pay to rent it. The best part of the movie is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the movie is complete and absolutely PANTS.
