While I call myself a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original film that introduced the series was a poor start. Although many of the elements that will mature later and become much more convincing in the series are present, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the build-up a bit inadequate, and the plot confusing. Worse, the characterization in the premiere is bad. Although the ratings show that many fans are willing to overlook these issues, I recalled that The Gathering almost scared me off the series, which soon became a spectacular series.
