This movie was fantastic !! (Not quite as good as the Leif Garrett masterpiece Longshot), but still great !! I thought that Ashley looked crazy in this movie compared to Mary-Kate. I wonder why. Who would have thought that they could change places and almost get away with it? Dad was kind of an idiot and Mom was a bit too chummy with Helmit Head. I give it to 4. Who likes this movie, should look at Longshot.
