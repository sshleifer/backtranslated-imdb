The December Christmas holidays, like the original Frosty, should be richly produced with quality music and a healthy yet carefree plot. You should have a touch of the mystic magic of the holidays. Basically they should look, sound and feel good ... well, "especially" and they should have a decent and fitting December holiday subtext. <br /> <br /> When I saw Legend of Frosty, the snowman, on television I pumped up my kids (6 and 8) by telling them the story of the original Frosty and passionately telling them how much I like it Child enjoyed. When my wife and kids made themselves comfortable on the couch to watch the movie, the expectations were high, but after 10 minutes my children yawned and my wife and I "gazed" and rolled our eyes. After 35 minutes, my children actually asked that they should go to bed - I guess they were fed up with insensitive language and pointless, separate segments. I was actually embarrassed that she had (and my) disappointment with this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Legend of Frosty the Snowman is rather a bad episode of Fairly Odd Parents, which is crossed with a worse than normal episode Sponge Bob as a classic vacation movie. Do not get me wrong ... these shows are alright and I like them the same way as the next guy, but when I look at Fairly Odd Parents or Sponge Bob, my low expectations (for mediocre, off-color, zero subtext, mind Mind.) (Numbing episodes) are always satisfied. <br /> <br /> We picked some good books and read the rest of the evening together. A much better choice than the embarrassingly bad legend of Frosty the Snowman.
