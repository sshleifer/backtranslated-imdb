Scary Movie 2 was a deep disappointment. Simply referencing movies like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. The movie starts well enough with a fun white rap scene and an outstanding effort by James Woods and Andy Richter. The movie crashes from there unfortunately. The spectacle is terrible. Tori Spelling looks completely wrong. The movie looks hiccup and is surprisingly slow. Some of the longer gags at this snail's pace, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, were fun for everyone in my theater. Fortunately, the film comes to a halt after 83 minutes in a shockingly unpleasant end. (I say shockingly, because the end does not even try to end with humor) I do not know what else to say, unless it's a sloppy, lousy sequel that puts Miramax more money on the backs of dumb ones Teenagers do. Overall a very bad movie.
