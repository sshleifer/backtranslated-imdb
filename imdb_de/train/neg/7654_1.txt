I remember that I read all the horrible, horrible reviews for this movie when it came out. I wanted to see how awful it was, but in three weeks it was not in the cinemas anymore. The only other film that can do that is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie was released on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it was. I could not think of the terrible attention this film got. After seeing it, I can understand it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that this movie is not without cool shots. There is a nice shot in the beginning that shows how a bullet is fired from within the weapon, which I thought was neat. And how the monsters die in this movie is kinda cool to look at. but it gets old when you see it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad action was a sin, Hell would have thrown Reid out because she's so incredibly terrible in this movie that it's unthinkable. And of all roles, she plays a curator. Now, if she played a stupid, empty sex toy, maybe I could forgive her for treating her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll did not know that even though he seemed to believe that if the people in the movie took off their shirts, people would see it. He just did not know that in the middle of the movie, at the very wrong moment, he got her to make the movie even more funny. And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping? I could not say <br /> <br /> This brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the worst directing skills you'll ever see in a movie. I mean, I would give House of the Dead an F (and I only do that for very few movies), but HotD would get at least a B compared to that spoiled piece of garbage. The film begins with a very, very long story that immediately leads to confusion (and is read by a terrible narrator), and from there the cuts are really very stupid. There is one point where Slater and Reid look around a ruined building and the screen turns black. When it comes back, Slater and Reid shoot everywhere and suddenly an army has arrived. Huh <br /> <br /> And somebody did not bother to check the mistakes in this movie. At one point, a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks before it touches it. Tara Reid's earrings change colors in the middle of a scene, and after Slater moves away from a dead comrade, you can see her getting up. <br /> <br /> As for the story ... I was really lost. Something about an old tribe that releases the darkness, and someone "opens the way" or something, and all the evil monsters appear. It's just an excuse to have many weapon scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character has to reload in this movie) that just gets boring. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I did not laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
