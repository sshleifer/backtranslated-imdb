A little boy makes a lot of money and immediately starts to live it. Unfortunately, the man whose money it really is is very bad. He wants his prey back. When he finds out who has the money, he tries to get it back. He is repeatedly thwarted by this little child, who only has the good fortune not to fall into the hands of the evil man. Sound familiar, I bet. Very predictable, not interesting at all. Are you coming with something else, ok guys?
