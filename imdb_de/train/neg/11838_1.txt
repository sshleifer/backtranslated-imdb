If you're into entertainment, look at graphic shots of people being hit by cars (you see a woman driving past the front wheel, being twisted when the car passes over her before she gets under the rear wheel - and they show it twice, if you missed it the first time), then this is the documentation for you. Granted, I did not look at this very disturbing voyeurism, but that was enough for me. Maybe the rest is even better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it will take TV broadcasters to show slush movies. Maybe gameshows that are based on self-mutilation may be nice. <br /> <br /> I already know that there are disturbed people in the world and terrible things happen. I do not have to see the evidence on TV disguised as entertainment.
