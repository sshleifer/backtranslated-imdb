This series is getting worse. Badly written and just not funny! The premise is excellent, but the inexperience of the writer shines through. By trying so hard not to offend anyone, they offend everyone. Now, in season two, the desperate performers have not been waving their arms around and acting on this condescending, smug, "oh, goofy" design that comes with a laughing script. They roll their eyes and shake each other's heads as if to say, are not we crazy? Is not that funny? Well, no, not really. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians generally shun the Canadian television. Come on, CBC, you should be our leading channel showing the best of Canadian talent. Pull the plug on this amateurish mess.
