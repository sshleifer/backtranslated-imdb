This movie was so disappointing. From the blurb, from which I decided to see Phantom Love (why does that mean?), I had expected something artistic and thoughtful with beautiful pictures. There were some interesting pictures, but these were often random and made no sense. In fact, it seemed as if they were inserted to fill the time. In the end, the effect was listless. <br /> <br /> I think the movie should be atmospheric, but it was not. The absence of a coherent conspiracy did not help. You could say that it was mysterious, but I think it was just incoherent without atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed to be disturbed, but the plot did not attract me enough to take care of her situation. Without looking at the cast list, I would not have known that you saw the main character as a child. The film has very little context for time, place or character. I'm not a dupe, but the sex scenes (there were several) were useless and confused me. I recognized Lulu, but I was not sure if it was the same man, different men, a lover, her husband, or she was a prostitute. It was not until I saw the credits that I discovered that the hairy back should belong to her lover. This movie has managed to make what seemed shocking (dream sequences with Lulu's mom) a bit boring. <br /> <br /> The nail deposition actually made more sense as it provided an indication of Lulu's emotional state. I will not blame the actors because I did not work much. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the movie was due to inability or presumption. But the end result was boring. <br /> <br /> I can not help talking about it anymore.
