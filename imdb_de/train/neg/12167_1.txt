Although it is a continuation of the stronger original, it is more of a comic remake of Friday, the 13th, regarding the further antics of the psychopathic Angela killing nubile teens in a camp for their "immorality". <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (sister of Bruce) looks great. There are a couple of damn funny sex scenes with pretty attractive girls, but the movie is (unintentionally) funny rather than intrusive, he's a stinker. <br /> <br /> * out of ****. <Br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated with R for violence and violence, nudity and sexuality, language and drug use.
