I agree that this Melville story may not be filmable, but this is not even a credible attempt. To shift history to the 20th century, the intent and nature of the original story are only exaggerated. You may have been able to relocate it to England, but it must be a historic piece. Even our storyteller - the owner - tells it in a flashback dating back to 1800. By the end of the nineteenth century, a strangely disobedient worker would be thrown away without thought. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me an explicit deleted break !!! Even in the 1800s, such behavior did not work very well in light of the end. And the movie ends? I do not know what it was because I did not see all the travesty - I had to stop. It was like setting "Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan England.
