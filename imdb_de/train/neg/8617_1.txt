After watching 10 minutes of this movie, I was confused. I had seen 30 minutes when my toes rippled. I just could not believe it: the movie is really horrible. In fact, it's so horrible that I had to watch everything to be convinced (!). It became clear to me that it reminded me of a series of Danish comedies from the 60s and 70s. The pattern is as follows: Take a hugely popular comedian, create a script that puts the comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible, add a few jokes (especially a one-liner) and spice it up with a few beautiful boys Girl on - film that and you succeed! I would not know if this movie was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition that has quietly passed away (with some great comedians), it seems that there is a market for this type of movie in the US.
