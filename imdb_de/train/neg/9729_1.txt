Seriously, what is that? Hooper made such classic films as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then he made this god terrible movie. What happened? Did he dive into the gap a bit too much? This movie is about a guy named Sam who has the ability to set things on fire (Firestarter, anyone?). The acting was God-fearing, the plot was garbage and the special effects were extremely garbage, they looked like in the 70's. Van Damme should be happy that Derailed is not the worst movie anymore, and what about the end? He began to glow blue, turned into a glowing bruise, sucked his girlfriend's fire out, and the movie ended. WHAT WAS THAT? HUH? When the movie was over, I hoped the DVD would burn spontaneously to save me from my pain. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. <br /> <br /> DO NOT THINK OBEY, YOU'LL DO IT Thanks to me later.
