This must be one of the worst fillings I've ever seen, and I've seen a few of them. It's slow, boring, amateurish - not even consistent in its own simple reading of the plot. The actors are not acting. I can not blame them - they have received a script of such utmost banality. They can only pierce through them with a pain behind their eyes that has nothing to do with the evil processes in SummersIsle. </ Br> /> There's no moment in this movie that sounds true - no honest line or moment to be moved. The Nicholas Cage figure is so poorly drawn that one does not feel any sympathy for him through all his distress. I have no doubt that I saw a suffering man there, but Nicholas Cage was fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career.
