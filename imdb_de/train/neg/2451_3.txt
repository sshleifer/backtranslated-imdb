This movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything else I've ever seen. Really, if you're a Tolkien fan, just rent it to laugh with your friends about it. I will not be the millionth to break his weaknesses ... all I'm going to say is that the movie (for me anyway) has lost significant points because it made my favorite character Sam a clumsy idiot. Pity, shame ... 3/10
