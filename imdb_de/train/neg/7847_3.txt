Recently, I have obsessed with this movie so much and expected that I almost had to see it. Well, after seeing it today, the 5.8 rating is completely understandable. I think that if you anticipate something so much that it becomes an urgent need, it turns out that it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Sure, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its moments. It has a very cool and well-developed storyline that is well connected to the actual product itself, but the whole thing is so self dependent that it's so hard to follow. And if Wes Craven's production was not in this movie, it would have nothing to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But the whole thing lets you go "Is that horror or COMEDY?" because there are a lot of ridiculous, accidentally placed jump moments and stupid deposits (IE "There's a hand in the shit!") or "You mother-bird! I'll kill you, damn sons." ! ") and the drama (god does not even remind me how bad it was.) STORYLINE: (This part contains spoilers, watch out!) The movie starts with a woman who's a mutated baby World brings (ooh la la!) And then the screen goes black with the title of the movie appearing and a monologue, then we go to this office where randomly placed war veteran mannequins are set up We realize that this is a scientist Keeping track of people looking for mutants: The box to track the audio feeds is gone, and everyone is dying! After this opening, you'll expect more. <br /> <br /> Then let's go Military Recruits While the captain is demonstrating "A good job at stupidity", the last day of training in New Mexico, the desert where the family had stayed in the last THHE, was bogged down Exercises are the last things finally wrong, people die and ... do i have to tell you something else? Because right now I have the attention span of a goldfish forcing me to sit here and type that in. <br /> <br /> The thing that's wrong with THHE2 is that it just does not work. No flashbacks here and the end is pretty sure ... but with a twist! A stupid, that is. I'm pretty sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to The Hills Have Eyes 3 will show all of its alternate ends, but I'm not sure I'm interested in that at the time. <br /> <br /> So if you loved the first THTH so much, it's almost a sin not to see it, then you'll definitely see it. If so, then avoid it at all costs. It is for your good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
