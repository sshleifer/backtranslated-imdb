Oh Sam Samovich, we know that you have tried so hard. This is your great work, a shining example for the rest of us, that you are worthy of being accepted into the Academy of Arts and Sciences of the Academy of the Arts. Unfortunately, it is better to be silent and to be considered stupid than to speak and dispel any doubts. With Ben & Arthur doing just that. <br /> <br /> The film's script, which seems to have been put together with a lack of training or education, takes us with each new scene towards the real bizarre. It is this crazy excuse of a story that may well be the best ally of the film. Quietly, the gay titular characters Ben and Arthur begin to marry, going so far as to fly over land, in the shadow of Vermont's most beautiful palm trees. However, this attitude is only an introduction to BLOOD. Then more BLOOD and MORE AND MORE BLOOD. I mean, in the last third of this movie at least $ 20 must be fake. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole is a technical mistake. From the sound to the editing to the music, which consists of a single fuzzy bass note held on a keyboard, it's a miracle that the movie even sticks together on all the media you see it on. It is a shame that some decent amateur performances are wasted here. <br /> <br /> No matter, Sam. I'm sure you made five characters with this movie or whatever compels other poor souls (like me) to watch this movie. Unfortunately we do not laugh with you.
