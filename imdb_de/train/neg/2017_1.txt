The conspiracy is plausible, but banal, d. H., The beautiful and neglected wife of a wealthy and powerful man has a crush on a psychotic guy and then tries to cover it up while the psycho-stalks kill and blackmail her. But what develops from this is amazingly illogical. Despite the resources available to the ordinary couple, who have money and influence, our privileged hero and our preferred heroine only seem to have a domestic worker, their lawyer, and the local police (who say they can do nothing) while they are dealing with tension and violence terror. They do not have private security staff (just a fancy security system they abuse), household or property staff, chauffeurs etc. Not even the means, apparently private nurses to rent around the clock to look after the hero if he suffers life-threatening Injuries, husband and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion. Our heroine is portrayed as the brain of a doorknob and our hero, a tycoon, behaves in the most unlikely and irrational way. The staging is an insult to viewers who have wasted their time with this jerk, and a crime wasted on the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what did they think). And shame Lifetime TV for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this bland offer.
