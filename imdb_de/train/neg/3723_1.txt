The cults capitalized in this film are known to embrace the "message" of the Bible without change or extra-biblical influence. The existence of this film is solely due to the fact that such a thing does not exist. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what the reincarnated branch of Christianity was about in the seventies? Word "Rapture" in a dictionary of cults and sects. It's faster than sitting by this waste of celluloid. Bad acting, uneven sound quality and a script that would have been just as well written by Jack T Chick (paranoid Christian conspiracy theorist for those who are not familiar with the Protestant scene). You could not really classify it into the category "so bad that it's good" so that the only audience is either those who have a pamphlet collection and are desperate or extremely paranoid.
