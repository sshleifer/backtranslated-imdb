Although it is after playing at the Toronto Intl. Film Festival there were a number of reasons not to expect too much. One - it's a Canadian movie with an extremely low budget. Two - it's written, staged, and starring with the same person (usually a bad sign, except Woody Allen, George Clooney, or one or two other respected filmmakers). But though I watched it with lowered expectations, it turned out to be a far greater disappointment than I thought possible. <br /> <br /> In short - bad script, bad drama, terrible director! Do not waste time or money on this turkey. It claims to be a comedy, but I only laughed twice. Besides, the music is terrible. How the attention has aroused, I will never know.
