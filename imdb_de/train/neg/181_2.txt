Ah, Channel 5 of the local Mexican television. Every day at 02:00, horror movies from the 70s to early 2000 are broadcast. It was "Return To Cabin By The Lake," the movie that aired yesterday. I'm sorry I saw it. <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a regularly popular budget and it was well received. The problem is that this sequel is awful, not even unintentionally funny, and tries to imitate the original. Pooh. The plot is really stupid in the truest sense of the word. <br /> <br /> Due to the absurd dialogues, the cinematography and the direction, the film seems in some places like a soap opera. > My advice is: Avoid this at all costs. It is a movie that nobody should see. Not even for lovers of mediocre cinematic art. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
