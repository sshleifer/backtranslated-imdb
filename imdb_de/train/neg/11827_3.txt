I have just returned from a free show and I am very glad that I did not pay to see this film of lesser importance. The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of children and adults. It seemed like it was just the kids laughing at the slap stick and fart jokes (good god, they loved beating these poor mice very often!). The film is quite youthful, unintelligent, predictable and usually annoying. The characters just seem to be thrown together to fill the empty space, and the relationships between them seem very forced, without any charm. They have mimicked the tone look of Wallace and Gromit, but otherwise they are very forgotten pictures. <br /> <br /> Although I was bored with the whole movie, I giggled a few times. It is not an absolute failure, but I definitely do not want to look at it again. If you're a parent with kids (and you do not care about your kids seeing mindless cheap jokes) then you're welcome to join them, but everyone else should not waste their money.
