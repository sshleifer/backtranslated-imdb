This streak reminded me of those lame "erotic thrillers" I had at Cinemax when I was 13 years old. I would call this movie a softer core because there simply is not a simulated beat and grinder. However, there is a lot of nudity - the opening scene is in a strip club, we see Kane Hodders Keester (or at least a stunt butt) and then an inexplicable 10-minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the movie and an act female werewolf who Looks like they attacked the Munster for a costume. 13-year-old boys are happy. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I've seen in years. The footage looks like the FMV from the video game Resident Evil in terms of quality. The wolf is too bad to be explained, and despite the poor quality of the suit, is shown far too often. <br /> <br /> The plot and the drama make no sense. There's a strange backstory about werewolves and hybrid werewolves - the Darkwolf is the last, but of all that I can say, hybrids do the same thing, as all wolves look human, turn themselves into a wolf, and kill people. The Darkwolf tries to find a partner, but can not find him, but can smell anyone she touches. Again, these skills prove less useful as the Darkwolf has killed some people who have never touched, hit, or even seen as well as I have seen. The buddy does not know she's a werewolf, and she's fighting the Transfiguration or something. <br /> <br /> You'd think it would be hard to mess up a simple monster movie, but he did. Do you want high quality werewolf isms? Dogmen want a ton of T & A.
