I have an idea, we found this egg-shaped thing from space, why do not we open it and open it? " "Yes, I know, that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do, and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses that are unknown to Earth and could wipe out humanity, but hey, I want to know what's inside . " "And nobody tells NASA they can take it away from us." "Wow this thing gives out vibes!" "Yeah, really strong, if you touch her, do not touch her, but it's okay to cut her." "Hello there, look at my nips". (Later that day); "DO NOT OPEN"!!!!! Oh, we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we do not have phones or radios or intercoms, even though we have millions of dollars worth of other equipment here. "I've never seen such organic technology!" "Yes, let me take this stick and stab it." "I'm going out here, I do not care if I kill the other 6 billion people on earth, I'm not a Nukkin!" They are the friendly aliens from The Abyss, they want us to come. " THE END
