Boy oh boy! What a bad filmmaking! But that is a guilty joy from my childhood, even if I do not want to admit it. They showed this movie constantly on my basic cable system. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the Cupertino border), we had this G-channel in our cable system. And basically, they showed the same movie over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those films. I loved and loved the young Brooke Shields and loved their stupid adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script makes almost no sense, the direction is poor, the few highlights are that Henry Fonda shows up, many dialogues that are so bad that they are good, and a beautiful Carole King song played over the credits. Maybe you have to be pitted to really enjoy this movie. And hey, everyone knows there is no gold in the Grand Canyon!
