None of the better Pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> Two legendary Pokemon come into the story. You can see how strong Celebi can be, even though he gets angry first. Suicune also appears, he did not seem so powerful. <br /> <br /> The Marauder did not do it there are not many strong Pokemon, aside from this Taranitar? Some fight scenes with his Pokemon might have done better. <br /> <br /> Ash and Pikachu meet the much younger Professor Oak, though they do not notice. Misty, I thought, had it in the end, but she did not get any closer. I saw that in the credits. <br /> <br /> Do not expect much, the worst of the series so far.
