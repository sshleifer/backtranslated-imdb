Five minutes after I looked at it, I logged in to IMDb to warn all of you not to go into this movie ... Genre: Horror? It had moments of mild tension and throughout the movie I thought "Something must happen soon", but it did not happen ... When the movie came to an end, I felt so embarrassed for the writer / director that I was never the one patrick rea was the biggest fan of this guy just does not know how to make films, and after I have looked at this apology excuse a horror movie, I'm no longer the biggest fan, but I will not look at any of his other works. <br /> <br /> I was taken away from the action summary. Please do not make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2 for the actors. They were not bad and it was not a mistake that they got a bad direction ...
