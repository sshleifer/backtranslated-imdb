Considering that I felt like visiting a new Jet Li movie to see some, but hard and mindless hand fights, I took that title but not nearly as good) as Jet Li and the acrobatic battles of the Company. So it was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> The faucet fight was interesting and even fun, considering that in a Jet Li movie it was something completely unexpected for me, rather in the line of Jackie Chan. <Br /> <br /> But I would recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master or even the Executor because of this disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for the total movie value
