I liked the first half hour of this movie. The obvious, up-and-coming romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was sweet and I wanted to see the inevitable between them. However, when the action changed to Ingrid's fianc√©, everything fell apart completely. Instead of romance and charm, we see some weird parallel characters ruining the movie. The betrothed's boorish son and the military attache's battle for the maid's attention looked stupid - like a subplot from an old Love Boat episode. How the charm and elegance of the first part of the movie Dopiness can be, is unclear to me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to regain the success he had with THE RULES OF THE GAME, since the film is very similar as soon as the action changes to the estate (as in the other film). I was not a big fan of THE RULES OF THE GAME, but ELENA AND HER MEN made me appreciate the artistry and nuance of the original movie.
