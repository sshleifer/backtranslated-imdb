It was interesting to see how exactly the words were written in the geek words, but very naive in the corporate world. The Ministry of Justice would catch more of the big corporate giants if they did naive things to win. The real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting, but equally scary. I seriously doubt that EVERY group would actually kill someone directly. Even the mod is more indirect nowadays. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. This film must, I think, have been developed by some garage freaks, and the studios did not know the difference. They just wanted to make something out of the Microsoft antitrust laws in the news.
