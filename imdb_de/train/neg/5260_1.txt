Normally, I have no problem with a movie or a story with an end that makes you wonder what really happened when it was intentionally made ... <br /> <br /> But this movie really feels that way But as if they all had But the last 15 minutes were done and then they realized that they still had $ 5 left. <br /> <br /> I saw it on TBS ... I recommend that you do not spend any money on it. If you watch it on TV, look at all but the last 15 minutes, then go away and put your own end in your head. <br /> <br /> Really, the movie would have been better if it had just gotten away. and come back with the State Poice of Feds, only to find out that the city and the cemetery of the car have disappeared, and it seems like I've never been there before ... <br /> <br /> could this Film 4 thumbs down!
