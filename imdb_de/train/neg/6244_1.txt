Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute has written a final, 120-page point-by-point refutation of this hypocritical movie, which should be 120 seconds long. The website address, which states his report on the disclosure with the title "SKEPTIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR AN IMPRESSIVE TRUTH", can be found at www.cei.org. A shorter 10-page version can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf If you've read these demos, you'll find that alleged "global warming" is no more real or dangerous than 1999's Y2K fear which Gore also advocated when shooting the pseudoscientific film THE DAY AFTER MOMORROW based on a book by alleged UFO abductee Whitley Strieber. Just as James "The Amazing" makes Randi with clairvoyants and Philip Klass with UFOs and Gerald Posner with JFK conspiracy theories, so does Mario Lewis Al Gore's film and the whole "global warming" scam.
