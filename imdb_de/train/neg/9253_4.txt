If I had not read his name on the DVD cover, I never would have thought that this rather lively and old-fashioned musical was made by a man so closely connected to the French New Wave. In fact, the movie is so far off that I'm wondering if New Wave writers in the 50s and 60s absolutely hated that kind of movie - it's so ... so unreal. And with so many of his previous films, it seems to have little to do. This is not necessarily a bad thing - just a very surprising thing. <br /> <br /> What I also found a little surprising was the amount of praise that some of the reviewers have given this film - especially if there are so many better French musicals out there. The songs in this movie were just not that interesting and the characters all looked so bland and stereotypical. If I had to see another rich person worrying about how hard it would be to be rich or get a good sale price for a designer outfit, I would puke. <br /> <br /> The end result is like musicals in America, not every French musical is gold. This film is not another film "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or "Huit Femmes" (EIGHT WOMEN)). Despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can not find a reason to recommend it as anything but a boring curiosity.
