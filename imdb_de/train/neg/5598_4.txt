I saw it at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Fest. What can I say about that? I liked my better judgment, but it seemed to me that the acting was a bit ... weak (most of the time I noticed that from the teenager's family). I mean, the script was not great at first, but the actors did not let me believe the relationship. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Nonethelss, I liked it. The characters are sympathetic and the plot is neither challenging nor disturbing. It's cute, the characters take care of each other, and I do not count it as fifty minutes, which does not take that long. <br /> <br /> But I can not recommend it.
