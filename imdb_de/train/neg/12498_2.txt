This movie has the core of a really good story. The work of Coast Guard men and women, especially in the North Pacific, is the stuff of heroes and legends. This film tells a good story with three endings (not satisfying), a few unnecessary and pointless battles in the bar, and two alleged "romantic" relationships that have as much sparks as dead campfire. Rescue scenes are great - though the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal - but the backstory is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially if he plays his hand (pay attention). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female characters are one-dimensional. The best woman is one of the Coast Guard sailors at the Rescue Center, and she's in front of the camera for about two minutes throughout the movie. It could have been an excellent movie - and Costner needs one!
