I can not explain for the life of me what the popularity of the kids tv show is, Power Rangers is all about. <br /> <br /> I never understood why unsuspecting kids really liked the show, because the characters seem so idiotic and it's not worth taking care of. <br /> <br /> The costumes look completely disgusting, like colorful spandex that people wear to go to the gym. What exactly is the purpose of showing it anyway, but learning for children how they struggle to solve their problems? What's up with the awful haircuts and clothes on this show? Not to mention that this show is still being played on cable TV, just to make money to teach kids how to fight if they disagree about a particular problem. <br /> <br /> There is much better entertainment for today's kids, hopefully not so gullible as 1990's kids who saw this show. <br /> <br /> Oh, and what about the homoerotic tension between the red and green rangers?
