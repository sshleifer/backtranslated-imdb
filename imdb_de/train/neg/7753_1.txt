Everything about this movie is pig-washing. Compassionate acting, terrible dialogue, ugly native girls. This film is forgotten !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must have been a weekend bender. Robert C. is totally lost and has no idea what's going on. The college kids are the worst. No acting talent, very stupid thinking and just the right dumbbells. Special effects are for the birds. The so-called security forces in this park belong to the toy land: with stupid weapons, walkie-talkies that are useless; and a computer system that counts to a roll of toilet paper. when the park is under construction and nothing works; Why should you care to invite potential customers until everything is complete. The authors, along with the producers and the crew, should be the first victims of chaos. The whole movie belongs in a septic tank to another planet to watch. What a gem. Detainees should watch this so they can commit suicide.
