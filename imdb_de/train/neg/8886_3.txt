Not very impressed. It is difficult to offer this film any spoilers, as there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes, and from then on it's like drying the paint. The acting also looks very bad and reminds me of the old black and white films of the Maoist era, which are occasionally shown on Chinese television. Although this is difficult to say with the female role, Yuwen, it seems she just walks around like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of the fading star Gong Li, who somehow got the reputation of being a good actress in the West because of his scowl on his face. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's movie The Blue Kite was a much better movie. But do not be fooled that spring was set in a small town in the late 1940s. In contrast to the Blue Dragon, the fact that this film plays in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the city seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop. I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeals to a foreign audience that can not tell the difference between a "beautiful" "profound" or "hypnotic" and a simply boring movie immaterial. <br /> <br /> If any movie matches the description of "overrated", that is the case. I see no reason not to worry about the state of the Chinese film industry.
