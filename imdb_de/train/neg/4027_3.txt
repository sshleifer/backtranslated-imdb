This must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. His lack of subtlety and complexity and his complete political correction make it really childish, with only good / bad characters. The world just is not like that, and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. What I hate most about this movie, however, is the father of Bolas friend. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: Shaved-head tattoo artists are not always evil, they can even be better than the average-looking father (wow, that's ... philosophy or something). Thanks, Achero. I will propose you for the Nobel Prize for Literature.
