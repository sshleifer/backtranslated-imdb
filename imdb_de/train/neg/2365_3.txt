This movie is just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I've got that out of the way, I feel better. This movie is bad from beginning to end. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is the worst at his cartoon character. Thank God they killed him. And who would like to have seen Roseanne and Tom Arnold? <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is the little story we get on Freddy. We see that he once had a family, and we see his abusive, alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Apart from that, everything is bad. There are some good actors here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do their best, but the end result is just so bad. The one and a half hours I've spent with the movie is one and a half hours. I can never go back.
