Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the ingredients for a cop, which is his life's dream. His luck changes, however, if he has a car breakdown (very bad) and is found by a doctor. The doctor must use animal organs to rebuild it. After that moment, he unconsciously starts to get wild and becomes the best cop you can ever find. At the time, he recognizes the changes and his animal instincts begin to take over his human side. In the meantime, he finds a pretty girl and tries to be a perfect gentleman, ie he has to control himself and be civilized. I do not enjoy Rob Schneider much. In fact, this is the first movie I've seen. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser (see his role in Ally Mcbeal, quite funny). In such films, the biggest problem is that the script makes the viewer less intelligent. I am sure that this movie is alright, as long as it is not taken too seriously. But it is very sad to see such films at the box office very well. The beast is not the worst movie I've seen yet, but it can not get more than *.
