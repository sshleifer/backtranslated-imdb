How hard is it to write a movie with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Seems VERY difficult for the authors here. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the big brother). I must have missed that part of the story, but in reality it did not matter. Many scenes seemed out of place; the kind of "funny show," scenes that are too far out of drugs where some sense of comedy is lost. <br /> <br /> The director / producer has tried to "tear down" at the end would have been appropriate if EVERYTHING that led to this point was worth following. <br /> <br /> Ugh, big disappointment. I can see some people like this OK, because many people will take the garbage they feed, but I would strongly encourage them to wait for this DVD. NOT worth the $ 23,978 it takes these days to bring your family to the movies.
