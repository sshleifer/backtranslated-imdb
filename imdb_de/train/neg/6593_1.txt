Even if it were funny from afar, this moldy waxwork of a movie would still be sobering disrespectful. Stop short of digging the bodies of the boys and reenact 'Weekend At Bernie's'? but only just? Producer Larry Harmon and the director of frickin '' Ernest 'films use copyright as a pretext to ruin the legacy of Stan and Ollie. Gailard Sartain makes a good Ollie impersonation, but Bronson Pinchot would not finish tenth in a Stan Lookalike contest. Even if both were present in the film, that would not be less disgusting. The less said about the surrounding disaster, the better. Make 'Utopia' like a worthy swan song.
