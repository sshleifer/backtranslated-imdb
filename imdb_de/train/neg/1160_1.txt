This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is (I believe) the story of a rebellious college basketball player, his hard but fair coach, his girlfriend and a fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who is constantly suffering from nervous breakdowns. The story goes nowhere, there is no character development, there is no one to take care of it, and the performances, with the exception of Bruce Dern as a coach, are terrible. It's hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could make such a horrible movie. Make sure you avoid this turkey.
