I loved Dewaere in the series Noir. His talent is trivialized in "The Waltzers" aka "Going Places". Okay, there are a few people who show conventions in the most absurd and irrevocable way; Many people find this behavior amusing. This was a boring, pointless exercise designed to shock. I find the grin on Bliers face, the face behind the camera annoying. The series Noir was an expression of personal freedom and unbridled behavior. From the moment we see Patric Dewaere dancing on the abandoned property, we get an idea of ​​the confusing antihero we'll be spending the next few hours with. When we see him in "Going Places" chasing the unfortunate middle-aged woman with his buddy Depardieu, we have the warning that two hours spent with these guys will mean a relief of the soul. I'm having trouble finding even a "3" for this annoying distraction.
