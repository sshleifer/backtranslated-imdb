The dialogue was pretty awful. The plot did not really inspire the obvious twist it offers. Not visually stunning. Actually visually annoying. In any case, it's easier to end one of these movies by keeping your finger on the fast-forward button. If you could watch it for free, at the moment you have absolutely no other options and you are really looking for the little poltergeist lady ... maybe I would recommend it to you but not to anyone I could think of right now.
