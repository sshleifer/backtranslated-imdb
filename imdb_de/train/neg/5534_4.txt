I work my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack collection and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the films in the set. I watch her with my soon-to-be-seven-year-old daughter, which makes most of these films laugh. <br /> <br /> I had great hope for REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES after watching White Zombie. This is really the forerunner for so much that the mainstay of zombies is in the cinema (think of Clive Barker's Snake and the Rainbow and James Bond's Live and Let The Funeral scene, NOT Night of the Living Dead). <br /> <br /> Even though the title contains the word "Zombies", it is hardly a love triangle involving the anthropologist Armand Louque, who is in love with Claire Duval. which in turn is recorded with his companion Clifford Grayson. What a yawning party, my daughter fell asleep halfway. <br /> <br /> It was really hard for me to understand who these people worked for - the Allies or the Axis; But I think that does not matter. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in the credits for this movie. But of course those were his eyes (by White Zombie), which serve as a mind control tool for the zombies.
