Good movies can not just be based on a beautiful garden and a hill. Surprised it has won two awards. Extremely overrated. For the first time, I've seen such films from China that are visually stunning, BUT also with something really amazing, more than 10 years ago, and I'm sure there's more. I'm afraid that's not one of them.
