Oh come, people give this movie a break. The only thing I liked was ......... Sorry, I'm still thinking. Oh yeah!!!! When John Wayne came and shot the bad guys. Oh, sorry, wrong movie, I thought of a better movie. Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend it. Oh yes, the chick from Clueless was in it. Do not take Stacy Dash down. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you did a dooooooo. Hey, one thing that's never been done in a western, even in an all-female cast, was actually hanging a woman to the gallows. That could be a western premiere. Although her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal, you still need to work with the director for a Western attempt. I've never seen a woman lynched in a western by a horse, even though that was not the case in this movie. I just thought I would give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be done right after Ed Woods Bride of the Monster # 2. Maybe the creators of this movie wanted to do this. Orginality, especially with an exclusively African women cast and an oriental cowgirl. Heeey, if the creators of Gang Of Roses want to make a sequel to this mess, you could have such a slang as, "Hey, do not take my homegirls" and "talk to the hand, baby, talk by the hand." could also have a surfer-type deputy marshal who says the following: "This shootout was absolutely RAD man, totally." They know such things.
