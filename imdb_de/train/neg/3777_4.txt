Flat, soulless computer images on less than amazing backgrounds animate a terribly predictable story in this movie. Absolutely nothing surprises you, you can even tell when the Bryan Adams vocals will come in, which are always at the wrong time. <br /> <br /> The main character, the horse's horse, becomes annoying voice when he tells what's going on. However, the narration is not needed because everything is really obvious. You can even say what the horses say, even though they are just neighbors. Which would be good, but all horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for suffering, one for laughing, etc. There is no variation between the horses' voices like this movie. It is slack enough for a family to sit down and watch, and there is little danger of anyone being afraid. If you have nothing else to do and want to watch a movie with your kids, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> But otherwise this is not recommended.
