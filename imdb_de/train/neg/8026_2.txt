One wonders how this show is still running. There is a couple who stayed together, is married and has children, but everyone else has separated. What's the point of continuing this? The show can be entertaining in the beginning. You see all the girls swaying over a man that almost everyone immediately likes. It's like in real life! The girls start to take sides, cheat each other and show their true self (or so we think). But this one man still has to decide whom to choose, whom he believes can marry and live happily. <br /> <br /> What is true love exactly? How can you fall in love with someone when you are forced to choose him? This show is incredible. You thought online dating would be bad, but people have to go to TV to find love? That is not realistic. How could a girl be with a man when dating and working with several others? None of these questions are answered, and when the show ends, you know that there will not be a happy ending in the future. Everything we know is scripted.
