1. watched 11/7/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): Pretty lame gangster movie about a godfather-like family in Brooklyn who likes to say four-letter words and kill people. The only thing of interest here was their attempt to show that the government agencies are very similar to the gang. This is the only attempt of good filmmaking. The rest of the movie was predictable and cheap. The quality of photography in some scenes in bars and cable cars made you almost believe that your DVD player had a problem due to the poor contrasts, and some of the actors were sometimes hard to hear due to the bad sound. Acting was a pretty characteristic character of all your favorite gangsters from better movies with hackneyed names like Vinnie `Knuckles' and Jimmie`s Tattoos, and the plot pretty much followed those patterns as well. So watch a better gangster movie before spending your money on it.
