I liked "American Movie" a lot, so I rented Chris Smith's first movie, which I also found as a documentary. In the first minute, I saw that it was not like that, but I tried. <br /> <br /> What a dead end movie. Being close to life hardly helps you if you only want to study boredom. Boredom, with which we are already familiar. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it will be of concern for EVERYONE that 1) suck many jobs and 2) most of them are crappy, minimum wage jobs in the service sector? I knew that before I saw the movie. It was not really worth exploring, because while the film tries to feel "real" (handheld camera, no music, etc.), what's going on is unlikely to be as it is in the "real world." Would an employer be so happy to Randy when he picks up his check after Randy quit after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months? Or the day after he quits his job (and the machine he worked on) that everyone would be so easy for him? <br /> <br /> A big problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. This guy is a loser. Not because he's in those jobs or has a seedy apartment or looks like one. He is a jerk. He does not pay attention to these jobs or does not try them. He has no staff. If I had to hire someone, he would not make it after the interview. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to what Chris Smith does next, but the guys are doing important movie stuff. "American Job" is not working.
