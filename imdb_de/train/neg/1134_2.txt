As a Dane, I am proud of the handful of good Danish films that have been produced in recent years. It is a terrible shame that this leap in quality has led the majority of Danish film critics to lose the sense of criticism. In fact, it has gotten so bad that I no longer trust ratings from Danish films, and that's why I stopped seeing them in the cinemas. <br /> <br /> I know it's wrong to hold this unfortunate development against everyone A movie, so let me emphasize that "Villa Paranoia" would be a terrible movie at all costs. The fact that it was hyped up by critics only added more fuel to my campfire of disillusionment with Danish film. Waiting for it to come out on DVD was unhelpful to the unwavering sense of wasting time and money. <br /> <br /> Erik Clausen is an accomplished director with a sense of social realism in Copenhagen. I especially liked "De Frigjorte" (1993). As an actor, he is usually funny, though he plays the same role in all of his films in general, namely, a working-class man who does not have his luck, in part because he is a slob, but mostly from a social point of view and redeem himself by him does something good for his community. <br /> <br /> This is the number one issue in "Villa Paranoia"; Clausen throws himself off as a chicken farmer, which is such a departure from the norm that he never manages to make him credible. <br /> <br /> However, it is far worse that the film has to be twists and turns and break all the rules of telling a story so that the audience understands what is going on. For example, the film begins with a very sad attempt to visualize the main character's near-death experience using low-budget effects and poor camera work. Then the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to jump off a bridge. This is symptomatic of the entire movie. There is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters, and Clausen resorts to the lowest form of communication of the motives: narrative instead of pointing. So at some point in time, you have a character who talks aloud to an alleged catatonic man about how he feels because the script would not allow him to play his emotions. Later, the voice-over is abruptly introduced, possibly retroactively, to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director's inability. Fortunately, at this time, you are about an hour after caring for one of the characters, let alone the so-called story. <br /> <br /> The acting, which was often a problem in Clausen's films, can be summarized in a sad statement: SÃ¸ren Westerberg Bentsen, whose only claim to Big Brother is considered a star, is no worse than some of the announced actors in the cast. <br /> <br /> I give this a 2 out of 10 points.
