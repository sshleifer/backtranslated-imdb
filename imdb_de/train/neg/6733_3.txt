The exclamation mark in the title is appropriate, albeit an understatement. Not only does this movie cry - it screams loud enough to smash the glass. Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made shrill, humorless suspense thrillers seeking a semi-documentary feel. Here they shot with real acoustics in real places in New York to increase the truthfulness. However, the naturalism of the sound recording only serves to reinforce the Maladroit dialogue of the Stones and the frisky histrionics of the tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. In a completely unmodulated performance, Stevens plays the wife of electronics Whiz James Mason (hopeless and bored); Both are being held captive by extortionist Rod Steiger (bloated and bored) and his slimy cohorts aiming to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason unintentionally helped build An example of a criminal mastermind who was so brilliant at every detail is respected, but still enough to hire a drug-addicted degenerate as a subordinate. The idea of ​​the Stones at a crisp suspense is to catch the hysterical Stevens alone with the amphetamine rapist Neville Brand, who fills the frame with his sweaty, drooling kisser. But the camera work is so lead and fire so (atypical) restrained, that the effect is hardly garish, let alone exciting. The Stones, a square pair in the heart, do not even have the courage to escape their own convictions. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with the lanky Steiger pursuing the fleet-footed Stevens in a subway track as awkward as his lumbering weight. With Angie Dickinson as Steiger's Amoral friend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
