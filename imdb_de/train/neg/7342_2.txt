"The Man In The Attic" is a movie from the 1910s. It is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, it's a story that did not really have to be told. <br /> <br /> If you look at the box, those responsible for packing the film did their best to make this film steamy and erotic. They use terms like "illicit passion," "forbidden affair," and "unlimited pleasures." They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.) holding a gun in his hand! <br /> <br /> The story is about Krista, played by Anne Archer. Unfortunately, she is married to a gentleman who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Krista and Edward fall in love with each other in the end. <br /> <br /> The supposedly "shocking" part of the movie is this: Kristas husband learns about it and forbids them to ever see each other again. So, what do you decide to do? Krista ends with Edward living in her attic. Impressive! Krista sees someone else in the end and Edward gets extremely jealous. So on and so on and so on. <br /> <br /> "The man in the attic" does not cover new territory. It's an original Showtime image that explains why the stars are a few B-list actors and both appear in the buff for a moment. <br /> <br />
