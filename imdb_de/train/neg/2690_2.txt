Hey, if you have a little more than an hour to kill and find color too exciting, I would suggest. If you like cheap B-movies like me, it's good for a giggle! Other than that, I would not suggest you rent it. I would wait until the subway arrives, say at 4am on the free access channel of your cable / satellite provider. By the way, the band that made this soundtrack was on the road for about two years after that movie, and no, they sounded as bad live as the two reviews of the small towns I could find there. Well, once again, if you find that grass is too much fun, but good to see if you do NOT want to shoot a low budget movie.
