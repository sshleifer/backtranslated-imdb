Disappointing movie. The performance of the actors is weak. Sets are fine, could have been better. The story is also weak. Battle sequences are terrible. Sounds and quality of the movie are trashy. The history of the Kazakh population was told very badly. This film should include more Kazakh actors in leading roles. And should have been in Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are of Hispanic origin. I do not understand it Since then Hispanic Turkmen-Mongolians play. This film is a shame of Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov has disappointed me. He is one of the best filmmakers in the world. The Czech director is excused because he is not of nomadic origin, he can not know the true spirit and the history of nomads.
