Thank you, Hollywood. Another movie classic that has been completely ruined by a cheap, flat, effective and redundant remake. The original "Planet of the Apes" was an intelligent and thought provoking film with a very clear message. It was a film that focused almost exclusively on dialogue, which sounds very boring, but was actually very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film seems to have abolished almost all dialogues. Instead of a great movie, we get an incredibly silly, two-hour-long chase movie. The dialogue has been kept to a minimum, there is no character interaction and development, and most of the time it's extremely difficult to figure out what's going on. Instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some fun one-liners, and some very hollow, quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The make-up of the monkeys is great and the scenery and backgrounds are beautiful too. However, this does not detract from the fact that "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very flat and simple film filled with wafer-thin characters, stupid dialogue and an almost nonexistent plot. Please Hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into pointless blockbusters. Oh yes, the end made NO SENSE, WHAT SOEVER. <br /> <br /> * from **** stars, mainly for the visuals <br /> <br />
