This step is about as bad as it comes. However, I was forced to give a 2 to the landscape. There are many great shots of the Southwest, including many in Monument Valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the US. It's also one of the most filmed movies, starting with John Ford. In fact, a scene with Kris and the girl was filmed at a place called John Ford Point.
