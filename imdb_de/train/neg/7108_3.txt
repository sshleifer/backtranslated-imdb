After seeing the credits with just one name that I know and who was the preacher in this movie (Russ Conway), I did not expect much from this movie and was not disappointed. A man plans to kill his new wife by convincing other people that she is crazy and that she will kill herself. The man is not aware that the sculpted-looking skull he uses, in contrast, the mind of a woman who appears to be his first dead wife has revenge in his head and uses a real skull. A simple story with a hint of irony in the end. If you are tired until late at night and need sleep, sleep will help.
