Only for diehard Judy Garland fans. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one in which she makes a number with an older cleaning lady (you've all seen the pictures) and at the very end a pretty good number. There are a few scenes where the lines are funny. But basically, the script is so bad and the movie is so outdated that it's not hard to move through fearlessness. But it pays to rent the movie at 2.50 - just be prepared to roll it forward.
