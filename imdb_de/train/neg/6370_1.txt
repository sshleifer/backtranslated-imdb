For some reason, TV Guide gave this two and a half stars, plus Faye Dunaway is in it, so it definitely looked like something to see. Mine, oh my, that could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. From his terrible acting (every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him, I called to the TV, "I can not act!") When she asks what he needs, I scream, "I need Acting Lesson! ", To the incredibly bad dialogue (" Give me back my organs! "). <br /> <br /> And the Brian DePalma wannabe ends as well, it was all just awful. I wanted to like it. Dunaway is one of the best actors of all time And the production values ​​were pretty good. <br /> <br /> But Wowzers, that made me laugh, LAUGH! Most of the time. <br /> <br /> Do not even curious, That was my first mistake, and it was definitely my second and third and fourth.
