Given the potential of this step, the reality was disappointing. It's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, even that could not change that. Most of the action was predictable. The jokes were flat to mildly amusing. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was funny in "Crazy for Mary". Here it looks like he's just going through the motions. If they had to make plot points from Friends, they should have known something was wrong. The toilet humor should have stayed in the closet :-). Instead, watch "50 First Dates".
