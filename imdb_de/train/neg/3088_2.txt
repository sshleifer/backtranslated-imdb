1. Aliens are like plush toys and hand puppets, with arms that do not work. <br /> <br /> 2. Aliens dominated intergalactic space travel, but do not know how to postpone an unlocked vault door, but can push open a door closed by five people. <br /> <br /> 3. Old security officers know how to get C4 and are just waiting for the right time to use it, say, when they are suddenly fired for no good reason. <br /> <br /> 4. Apparently, in the 1980s, the US Army Boot Camp carried out several "gardening tool fights," including the Pirouette of Death. <br /> <br /> 5. In order to impress your prudish friend, you must protect "the world ... um ... neighborhood" from extraterrestrials. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are sluts, either open or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. Scummy nightclubs look like bad guests. <br /> <br /> 8. "Scummy" waitresses serve as dancers for The Fontanelles (how were they talked to?), who can only make bad 60s dance moves. <br /> <br /> 9. Army comrades secretly dream of being Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. Garnets seem to have a setting for "Flash Bang". <br /> <br /> 11. Apparently, when you burn it, you only leave a few burns on your arms. <br /> <br /> 12th US Army Staff Sargeants are apparently always in the area and do nothing against foreigners in the area. <br /> <br /> 13. Aliens seem to always "go home", which means they have been locked back in the vault. <br /> <br /> 14. Aliens are attracted by bright lights, which seems to mean that in the Los Angeles area, the protagonist's home is the brightest light in the area. <br /> <br /> 15. If you show 16 park scenes in a movie, the audience will be asked for more. <br /> <br /> 16th Transporter from the 80s have apparently terrible suspension systems. <br /> <br /> 17. Comedy is supposed to happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 18. Horror is supposed to happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 19. Spoofs and homages are supposed to happen in this film. <br /> <br /> 20. This film heals insomnia. <br /> <br /> 21. Obviously, whenever garden tools are used, they make electronic keyboard sounds, not just in brawls (tell me, I'm not the only one who's noticed). Period. There is not much meat on the bone and not really good. Even average. It's just bad. However, I have seen far worse, and the rake fight scene is pure comedy gold, intentionally or otherwise. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Jaws 4 was worse than this. At least the movie never took it seriously.
