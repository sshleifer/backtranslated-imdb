This movie is by far the worst in the series. Although New Line may be focused on selling, everyone knows that the only reason it has made more money than the previous one is because of the 3D finish. It was also not good that the 3D was good, because it was 50s 3D with the red and blue lenses (anaglyph). It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like. In addition, this movie was done so badly! Bad script, bad characters, bad acting, worse directing. This movie tries to get the camp factor almost to the point that it looks like a "Looney Tunes" episode. Seriously, not for the horror crowd, because it's dumb and scary and not funny or amusing for comedy crowds. Just a total mess with some really bad cameos still trying to play this whole thing as a warehouse, staying far behind what they probably wanted. <br /> <br /> I remember most of us who were fans This series only prayed that it would end at this point because it had gotten so bad. This is one of the films that has helped to take the horror out of popularity, and believe that the audience really wanted to laugh with a stupid comedy, rather than see a good and scary horror movie.
