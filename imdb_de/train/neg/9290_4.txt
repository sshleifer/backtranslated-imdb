STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> For a long time, prisoner Twitch (Kurupt) is being moved to a harder prison than the reopened Alcatraz. He claims it's closer to his lady, but his real motives are a little more grandiose. There he crosses with Burke (Bill Goldberg) a bulky inmate who can take care of himself. Twitching, although less muscular, is just as mauling and pretty much the same. But between the black and the Hispanic inmates seething a group war, which explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison, as the gang leader of the black gang is shot and points to Burke. But the fan gets on really well when the real killer and leader of Hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid), takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage. Steven Seagal does not do sequels (supposedly very) rejected the idea of ​​Under Siege 2 and only agreed, on the condition that the film company with which he made his own film at that time came to do so.) Though is a DVD sequel, this time starring Bill Golberg (Steve is not even seen in the footage of the first movie coming towards the end). But there's a reason he has not worked much since Universal Soldier 2 Not Because He Is A Big Actor Not exactly an action star who manages a character that starts out as very dark and brooding, but inconspicuously turns into a standard action hero, bouncing off clumsy boring one-liners. As far as support is concerned, the veterans of the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, merely took the chance to do extra work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that tries to copy the style of the original well muted light, dark shadow and rap music that plays a lot of it. That makes it very good, unfortunately, it can not compete with an uncomplicated hero, a equally sticky villain and an apathetic story that the makers seemingly invented as they progressed. **
