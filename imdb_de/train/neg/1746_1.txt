Probably the worst Bollywood movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> No plot line. Very little character developments. <br /> <br /> Full of stupid and meaningless humor. The whole movie was chaotic and directionless. There was no real end to the story. The airport was turned in a mall. <br /> <br /> The same story was chewed over and over until you say, "Please, just keep going!" Even the song and the dance were useless and badly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot drinks everywhere ... but then most Bollywood movies have those days anyway. By the way, I'm not from an Indian background. <br /> <br /> 2/10
