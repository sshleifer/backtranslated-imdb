Why on earth would someone do that piece of garbage film? The first two zombie bloodbath movies were stupid enough, but this makes the cake the worst of the trilogy (maybe ever). Todd Sheets is still the director, but not the scriptwriter anymore, which is neither negative nor positive, considering he is as untalented as the guy who wrote it. Writing is too dependent on the f-word used between 200 and 300 times in nausea. Acting is about on par with the last two Bloodbath movies, which of course is one of the worst I've ever seen. The special effects are better than the last 2, but still look godly. The conspiracy has become too complicated, and it was about a failed government experiment and zombies being produced. It also introduces cryogenically frozen mutant zombie and school kids who know how to travel through time, leading to one of the most idiotic endings I've ever seen. After the movie, there are outtakes, which is strange because this whole movie is an outtake. Just look at it to make fun of it, because if you think about it seriously, you might be able to kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 min.
