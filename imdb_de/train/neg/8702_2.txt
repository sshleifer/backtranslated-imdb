This is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. I would have expected it after seeing the first two, but I keep getting sucked into these kinds of movies with the idea "maybe they did it right this time". No - not even close. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? How about the special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what SFX is about in this movie, a soldier sometime shoots a "raptor" as he walks down the hall. Even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that it is only a man with a tail supposedly tied up. Bad bad bad bad. <br /> <br /> How about acting? If you can call it that. There is a character that probably comes from the south. Having lived in the South for six years, I have never heard this way of speaking. Maybe he has a strange disability - the inability to speak normally. I find it intriguing that the character does not do anything that compels him to have that accent - so there was no reason for the actor to try one. <br /> <br /> What about the plot? It's pretty simple - birds of prey are fleeing, people with guns have to follow them. I wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to fall into the nearest tunnel system ... Would not they stay out hunting for prey? Well, at least they have the good sense to appear very little in the film that supposedly revolves around them. Other things - Suppose you are in a building and know that there are people who eat birds of prey running around. Would you choose a dispute as to who is better - army or navy? And then you decide on an arm-wrestling contest to fix it? How about the idiotic idea that they have to find the birds of prey? - split into groups of two. Have not you ever seen horror movies (or at least an episode of Scooby Doo)? In short, this is one of the dumber movies out there. Miss it, if you do not want to moan through a movie.
