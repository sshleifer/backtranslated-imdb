Warning of the spoiler. <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka beside himself to give the impression that she has been drinking. But just before she is killed, she tells her business partner (Teri Garr) over the phone that she has not had a drink for 4 days. The police never mention the results of a toxicology report! And the characters say she was drunk when she fell down the stairs. Huh Really a bad mistake in this movie, which is pretty awful overall. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad considering the great cast. Some mistakes: The writing is not very good, the music is bad for TV, and there is no tension, since we already know the answer to the riddle from the first scene of the film.
