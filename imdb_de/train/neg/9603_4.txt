"A young woman suffers from the illusion that she is a werewolf based on a family legend of an ancestor who was accused and killed of being supposedly one, and because of her earlier treatment by men she travels the country seducing and killing the men When she falls in love with a nice man, her life seems to be a turning point for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a gang of thugs.After being traumatized by these recent events, the woman returns to her violent one Because of back and seeks revenge on the thugs, "said the DVD case. <br /> <br /> "La lupa mannara" by Rino Di Silvestro begins with a full frontal, squirming dance by the shapely blond Annik Borel, who (as Daniella Neseri) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf. The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs. The opening "Flashback" reveals that her hairy ancestor was (probably) a lykanthropic creature.

She is just a very strong maniac. <br /> <br /> As a movie, "Werewolf Woman" would have been better if Borel's character had really been a female werewolf; with their sexual victimization a great characterization. But as far as the skin and blood spikes of the 1970s go, this is hard to beat here. Bouncy Borel is either naked or sexually clothed throughout the movie, which offers a great deal of gratuitous consequences. The dazzling Dagmar Lassander (as Elena) and the handsome Howard Ross (as Luca) are good supporters.
