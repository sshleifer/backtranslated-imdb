I'm only grateful for one thing, that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on a completely different continent. Yay !!! This program summed up perfectly how obsessed Victoria Beckham has become with bringing her and her family to the media in the name of self-promotion and "brand-fucking Beckham." <br /> <br /> Several years ago I used to love 'Posh and Becks' a lot, I still admire David's talent very much, but I have no respect for him anymore. How can you respect someone who has pressed his wife's hand in the butt and works him like a puppet. <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria's hand was everywhere in Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and the same thing happened in Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that, though he may earn a billion pounds, he will sell his soul for the American dollar and finish his days off playing for a team that would be hard to do by division One in England to be promoted (not an insult to America - but in baseball and basketball you reign - football does not matter !!) <br /> <br /> Anyway - I digress It's been years since I was so exaggerated had seen completely wrong performance of 'Posh' - this fact was crowned only during her damn worthy red carpet performances after the Rebecca Loos debacle, instead of throwing all the Cr * p she clung to with David, whom he had earned desperate for his arm, trying to save the million-pound spinner who had gotten out of her marriage. <br /> <br /> This whole PR stunt was pathetic, why can not she just walk over quietly, her husband d support the biggest mistake of his career and keep his head down When was she so full of self-esteem that she thought the move to America should be covered by this huge fan-tariff? <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I saw the David Beckham documentation last night. At least he has preserved a bit of grace and humility. Two things that his wife could do with learning. <br /> <br /> One more thing, Victoria - they complain that they are constantly being followed by the paps. Little tip - stop tapping her whereabouts, you stupid woman. <br /> <br /> Good luck, America !!
