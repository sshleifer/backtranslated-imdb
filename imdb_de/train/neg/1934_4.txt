Following is the usual formula for hiring a new recruit - this time the first African American (Cuba Gooding) after the separation of President Truman by the armed forces - by the US Marine De Niro's Deep Sea Diver Training Program led by a racist zealot (Robert) , If the program is not bad enough, it must be in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the performances. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and calls out gibberish effectively. Cuba Gooding, raised by a strict father as a poor black peasant boy in the south, is the expected example of righteousness. The girls - you could hardly call them women - are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have a subordinate role and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense. Other decent performers - Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook - play even more roles. <br /> <br /> That's it. Almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer. A ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro greets inside, uncovered. After a brutal attack on hospital staff, he was released from his outfit instead of driving him out. In the early fifties somebody shouts "I'm out of here". (Maybe it was a common phrase at the time.) If so, "my bad one".) People call for rank - "Lieutenant," "Boatswain's Mate," "Commander," as they do in the army Marine are simple "mister" (if an officer) or addressed by their surname (if registered). I did not bother to check if there was a rank called "Senior Master Chief" in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding has a tough fight. Apparently, everyone in the Navy hates Negroes except one man from Wisconsin. He stutters and is despised by the others in his class. It's like the scene in "Animal House" where the applicant of a tony fraternal community is asked to wait in a room with a Sikh, a black man, and a blind child. <br/> <br/> Gooding is a member of Mann, a second-class sergeant. He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just completed her medical studies. In one of her arguments, she implores him. She just wants to be a doctor and he should join her, leave the Navy and lead a quiet life. "And just let life pass you by?" He replies. Yes. Yes, just be the spouse of a doctor and let life pass. You can wave to the golf course in Boca Raton. <br /> <br /> This type of flick was common during World War II. "Bombardier", "Airial Gunner", something like that. As cheap as they often were, they had some educational features. You have learned to become a bombardier or a gunman. This skips the technical details, perhaps because the author did not know anything about them (except Boyle's law, which we learned in high school chemistry). I could not trace what happened in some cases from the emergencies without which such a movie would not exist. If I solved the mechanical problems correctly, it was because I guessed right. The direction is also no help. The film is full of close-ups, so many that they lose any dramatic effect they may have. And the emergencies are confusing because they are bad set. <br /> <br /> Why continue? Would you like to see a better example of this kind of movie? Almost anyone can do it - except perhaps "G.I. Jane," where the maltreated hero is a heroin. Try out the training camp scenes in "The Young Lions". There the victim is a Jew. Or try "From Here to Eternity", where no simple sympathy buttons are pressed and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bow and is actively leading the conflict, as well as "Cool Hand Luke". No simple excuses are offered, as simple excuses are too simple. <br /> <br /> Well thought out and not well done.
