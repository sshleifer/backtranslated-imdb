This is just a joke of a movie, they have already lost me in the opening scene (Spoilerwarning). A dangerous creature kills other creatures in its cage. This is watched by a scientist working on a monitor there and guessing what she's doing, so she lets go into the cage to read the stuff, um, how stupid these writers think the humans are coming that's just the same like jumping in an aquarium with a big white shark because he ate your goldfish ... Pretty useless and even more stupid And I will not even talk about the cast because they are not worth the effort. Why she did not immediately fire the guy who wrote that is a mystery to me ..... And that kind of stupidity continues the whole movie. Only good if the cgi is better than the average for this type of low budget movies. <br /> <br /> If this kind of thing does not bother you, see it, but be warned, if your IQ is over 60 it'll probably hate you.
