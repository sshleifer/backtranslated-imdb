Hahaha !!!!!! Funny, that sums up this movie in one word. What a crap the "thing" was, as it might kill me if I use the word "movie"?!?!?! I hope the director, the author and the producer did not want to do that well because it was certainly not the case !!! A scientist turned his son into a hammerhead shark, and the shark killed a lot of people that the scientist had invited to the island Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this movie so much that when I looked at it, I laughed at all the serious parts because they were so hackneyed and unprofessional ... and they did not make the shark look more unrealistically, even though this "thing" is a bit bigger Budget had as most low budget movies. All I have to say is to expect this movie that laughs at the bad drama and the stupid, annoying dialogue, because if you expect a good movie, I'll be very disappointed.
