A friend and I went through a phase of selecting the craziest horror movies in the video library for evening entertainment some (many) years ago. For some reason, I bought this (probably v. V. Cheap). <br /> <br /> The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There are also some very funny scenes. Below is a scene in which a man is attacked and defended with a series of unlikely objects. That made me laugh then (in retrospect, that does not seem so funny, but you can go)> Besides, it's totally crap, mind you. But probably worth a watch if you like movies like "Chopping Mall". Yes, I have seen that too.
