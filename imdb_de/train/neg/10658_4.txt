On the way back from the IMC6 (San Jose, California), all five (three of us hardcore Kamal fans, of course) had reached a unanimous decision; VV was solid crap and thanks to the movie we had a pretty messy Monday. Not to forget, we swore we would not go to the cinemas for the next year. <br /> <br /> I will not blame Kamal here for leaving a clue in an interview with cartoonist Madan (on Vijay TV). , He said something like "Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri Screenplay, Director, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing, but we have hardly improved when it comes to scripting, directing and acting.) While you watch VV, those words sound very right. <br /> <br /> Well, here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie: <br / > 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 3. Harris Jeyaraj I hardly hold back from using explosives here, but the fact is that HJ masters it is a nice talent, every one of his last films (remember 'Anniyan', 'Ghajini') with the raging cacophony, he counts as background music, next time I get a tympanic gland transplant, he pays for it /> <br /> 4 songs The songs also do not help to move the narrative of the movie spatially / temporally, and do you not to attract attention. The movie feels like it's made up of four VERY long songs with a few scenes in between. <br /> <br /> 5. A short film has gone too far. VV is best suited to be a short story, not two hours plus "thriller". To use a clich√© here, it goes on and on like the energizer hare; Only in this case you do not want it. The later part of a movie feels like a big move. <br /> <br /> 6. Kamal-Jothika Pairing Two ice cubes grated together could have produced more sparks than this pairing. There is no reason why you would choose them to do it together. In fact, every time they come together in the second half of the film, they irritate the story. I hate to say that, but Kamalini Mukerjhee's 10-minute romance is more than what Kamal and Jothika achieve in this movie plus 'Thenali'. <br /> <br /> 7. Kamal Haasan's Akzent Kamal has this presumptuous accent that neither in India nor in the US does anyone speak; and it is not new either. He's been doing it since 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae'. It just gets on your nerves. Imagine what a mess it can make when his sense of this strange accent hits on-site shooting in the US. He also does not leave it behind in immigration, he gives advice to his men (Keeranor wheezing TN cops from Keeranor, Sathoor, and beyond) in chaste kamanglish ("What a poor police force we have here!"), Of course with disgusting effects. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are some directors that you expect to grow to a certain extent. Gautam fails us with a crappy performance in the department of common sense. Which D.C.P in his senses would meet his love interest on the street to talk about things that relate to himself and the life after! The scene in the theater was so bad for climax; We could hear people behind us challenging the hero's IQ aloud. "Is he stupid, can not he just use his siren or lights?" (On a busy street in Madras, the policeman on the police jeep pursues a guy on a bike, just like a normal guy!). "Can not he just use his weapon?" ("The guy on the bike" starts walking and we have a fully equipped Kamal in hot pursuit for a long time). I do not vote for later, but I'm just trying to explain the inner mood. <br /> <br / 9. 9. Gore & Violence If I wanted to watch women being raped, their throats crossed, more women raped and thrown into the bushes with tormenting authenticity, I would sit at home and prefer one Watch "police report" or "Kuttram". The use of excessive force should expand the story, not overwhelm it! At some point, Gautum seems to be confused about what the extensions (rape, murders) are and what the mainstay (story) is! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double shot of espresso could not get the pain out of your head.
