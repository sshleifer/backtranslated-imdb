If you are one of those people who find "after Jim" a great television comedy, this will shake your world. And I would like to add, kudos to prove that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on a network other than ABC, which is like Jim Belushi's show year after year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a big, steaming, brown German shepherd thank you for all the geniuses who loved the first movie. It's exactly what the fans of this movie and the smaller Belushi deserve. Jim's comedy strikes and project decisions are never far from his ability to slaughter a blues standard. Look for him to try to show off all his multiple talent deficiencies in any project he flings like a naughty zoo chimpanzee to the public. <br /> <br /> If you like Jim's work, this movie is your reward.
