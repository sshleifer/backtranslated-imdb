The premise is amazing and the acting, especially Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp, is adorable ... but this movie is almost incomparable. The music sounds like it comes from a kind of royalty-free online site and the lyrics as if they were written in your lap with a rhyming dictionary. Most of the vocals are off-key. I think they may have filmed with the singing band and backed the music ... The dialogue is really stupid and banal. The movie works best when it actually talks about the property, but it often gets lost in stupid farce undergrounds. After twenty minutes I saw my clock and after 40 I wondered when it will ever end.
