This movie is such a rip-off of the "demons" of masterpeice, and that's the only thing that makes the movie worth seeing. The drama is terrible, the action scenes are sped up, the script is almost painful and there is no budget. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, then you have not seen a real horror movie and get a copy of the movie demons.
