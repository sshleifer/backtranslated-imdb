I remember that my parents did not understand Saturday Night Live when I was 15. They also did not understand rock n roll and many other things. Now, as I approach their age, I can still remember that I understand many of the things my children love. But that is pathetic. I can not say that I saw something from Sarah except here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see her as something special. But this show is so far below what I expected it to be. The IMDb letter made it sound like potential. So I just watched the first episode. I turned it off halfway. Everything else is better than that. Jokes intended for a 5-year-old are featured in an alleged adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult is deeply moved to shut you down. I just can not believe someone financed this insult for the comedy. All I can say is that there are so many bad jokes left here that save other shows from such embarrassment.
