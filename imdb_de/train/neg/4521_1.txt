The entire biker movie genre must be made up of the worst movies ever made. There are many fights, plenty of blood, bikers battling Indians, and a poor town that gets blown up and demolishes one hut after another. The spectacle is more than terrible. What about Robert Walker jr. Happens? Once he was in some big studio productions, and then he just disappeared. This movie is really great, but if you've not seen a biker movie in a long time, it's a good movie. At the end of the movie you should feel a little trashy because you saw it!
