This is undoubtedly the worst movie by Rajnikanth. The first part is held with a solid comedy by Goundamani, but it is getting worse and utterly illogical. Our hero digs even with saints of the same name (Baba) by a stupid and completely lame Einliner. In the first half, Rajni expresses his usual variety of onliners and style, becoming a saint in the second half, after a beggar has taken him through an interdimensional portal to the Himalayas, where Babaji (not the famous saints he had previously dug) gives him special powers for no apparent reason (except karma). It's really starting to get interesting now, is not it? <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is about wasting his magical powers and powers and fighting politicians and allied black magic. The usual predictable crap with funny implementation. Oh, and the black magic never worked on our hero because he happened to have a Param Vir ... er ... Shakti Chakra with him. The bad guys and the usual politician bad guys are clich√©d, overworked and, in the end, completely insignificant for the plot that goes nowhere. Despite all the shortcomings, however, it was fun to kill time and shout Baba-Einliner at public events. It's also fun to see others cussing about this movie. AR Rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his film over the phone. It was so important to him. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan and he has two characters (one of them is Keiko ... why not Samsung?) of Japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it. But how they are portrayed, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese may stop watching Rajni movies after seeing this. This film was likely promotional material for Rajni, who enters politics, but the film's results would have ruined all of his political dreams. <br /> <br /> Fun when you turn off your brain.
