This movie was so bad! It was terrible! It was awful! I can not stress it enough! The acting, directing, story, characters and everything was bad! It was so hackneyed and cliched. Do not be fooled by the cover, or the tagline "The Texas Massacre is nothing to laugh about." Are you kidding me? It was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the movie are good until they reach the main character Brendan. OK, now turn it off. What I got from the movie was: A bunch of ugly, annoying and immature people go into a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown who sings nursery rhymes kills them in an unoriginal and spurious way. This movie was a waste of my time and my money, And it would be a waste of money and time! I wound up most of the movie because it was so awful, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died, and STILL was not worth it! A look at the cover is a waste of time. This is really the worst movie ever! Rating: does not deserve.
