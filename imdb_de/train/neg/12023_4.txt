Reed Diamond plays a man who suffers from amnesia and has been in a lunatic asylum for more than a decade after wondering with blood on his hands on the back roads. Doctors want to test an experimental new drug that reflects its lost memories when it works. When the drug gives him hallucinations of a demon, he decides to flee instead. While he befriends a little boy out there whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) abuses his mother, does not let her near the darkroom in his basement and generally looks distrustful. <br /> <br /> The film is easy to identify before it has been revealed. I found that Mr. Diamant's spectacle was enough to keep my attention going. (In the interest of complete disclosure, I have been a big fan of him since Homicide and his short but crucial role in The Shield by Journeyman & Dollhouse). Not a good movie or a good movie, but usable enough. Although I liked it better than the previous movies I've seen by director / author Michael Hurst (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansquito). Eye Candy: a fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucination <br /> My Note: C-
