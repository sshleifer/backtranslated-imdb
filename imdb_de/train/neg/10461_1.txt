Interesting to read the viewers' comments on the omega code ... many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were almost literally lifted from TBN transmissions ... the movie looks like it was made to go straight to a video , which is in stock next to the three films -part rapture series that was made in the 70s by another religious group ... do not you remember it? You will not remember it in a year or two. This is the first movie I have ever seen, and it was suggested that it was your religious duty to buy as many tickets as possible to save souls ... very shameful ... this only shows when you As the son of a televangelist, you can also play high-roller Hollywood producer with small ladies tithing money ...
