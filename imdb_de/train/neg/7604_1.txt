Sure, it takes place in the West, but the title makes it seem like it's a conventional Western. Instead, it is a film about a woman sheriff. Make no mistake, though this is a bad movie about a sheriff. She becomes sheriff when her husband is shot down; She is just a little bit upset about it. Their main objective is to track the villain, who is also a woman, but the villain hires a man who kills her. So it happens, the hero falls in love with the murderer and vice versa. Absolutely stupid, because everyone killed in this movie has to thank the new sheriff. She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but I think because she liked him, she would not. The killer is also after the mayor of the city for personal reasons, which are also quite stupid. This movie is very boring and not really worth watching ... it's not one of the better episodes of MST3000 they've done. I can not imagine anyone would see this without them, because that would make it more painful. Corman is a low budget director, but even he should know better than people go to one place and come out in another.
