I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as for her talent as an actress. So I found it odd that she would appear in a movie that distorted those facts so much. The salvation of her character off the South Pole was carried out by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta, who flew on a Canadian Twin Otter aircraft. The trip was rejected by the US Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard as out of their reach. The same company brought in a similar rescue a few years later to fetch a man from the South Pole base. I have the impression that the film is a very gripping subject and documents a very courageous woman who faces a daunting task. I do not understand why the producers find it necessary to ignore the courage of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as USAF Hercules.
