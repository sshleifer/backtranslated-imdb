"Cut" is a movie about some movie students who are making a movie. It's very much in the "scream" form, an ironic, self-referential horror movie that at least falls for me because, despite its irony, it's still a bad horror movie, just like the movies it refers to. <br /> <br /> But it was not without charm. Well, a charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as the spoiled, bitchy American actress hated every minute of working with the Australian amateur film crews. It was so convincing that it was tempting to believe that it was not an act, although everyone who dealt with "Cut" said that she really enjoyed working with her. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of her pouting, pouting or snapping was great. All the others, however, wavered between OK and terribly wooden. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, "Cut" has some laughs, a few buckets of blood (some of them surprisingly cruel) and finally ... just another bad horror movie.
