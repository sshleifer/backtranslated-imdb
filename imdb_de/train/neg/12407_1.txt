Alicia (Laurel Barnett) becomes a live babysitter for the young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole), who has recently lost her mother. Rosalie, however, misses her dead mother a lot and visits her grave (conveniently located in a cemetery directly behind the house) late at night starts well with a really eerie sequence in the cemetery ... then he falls apart. The story is thin and there are tons of padding to make the movie for 85 minutes. Acting is horrible down the line (Cole being the worst). Badly referenced with some of the worst edits I've ever seen in a movie. Scenes (and sound) are simply cut off without reason and rhymes. The movie also has a horrible (and obvious) post-production sound. <br /> <br /> As for blood and violence - forget it! There is very little and what looks like is incredibly unreal. I have never seen so bad blood - looks like ketchup! Boring, pointless - a rightly forgotten drive-in movie. You can skip this.
