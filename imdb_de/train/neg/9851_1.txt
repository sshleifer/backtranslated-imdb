Even worse than the worst David Lynch "Konfusathon" makes "Brain Dead" no sense at all. Shameless wasted talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton) hoping for acidity like in a "Tom and Jerry" cartoon. There is a negligible character development. It simply begins to scale the "strange scale" until it reaches its climax in total chaos. Do not get involved because of the good actors mentioned above. You will not be given anything to work with, and you'll wonder what's going on throughout the unbearable 85 minutes. I urge you to avoid "Brain Dead" at all costs, unless you are scattered in total nonsense. - MERK
