Melissa's sixteenth birthday is just around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with guys. But it turns out that all the guys she spends time getting murdered in this generic 80s Slasher movie. It's up to the city's sheriff, Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying, secretive Goody Two Shoes daughter Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th Part 3) to get to the bottom of these killings , <br /> <br /> This movie focuses more on the film's mystery and melodrama aspects, rather than the killings itself, and can therefore be different from many of its 80s Slasher brothers. It does not hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to emphasize the obvious by saying that the actress is over 18 years old, implying that I am not too perverted). The downside is that the movie is hampered by a few underdeveloped and unnecessary plot points, a grating theme that's used a bit too often, and an ending that's a bit anti-climatic. But the good ones outweigh (hardly). Give me a rent, but I would not buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, her ass and her ass <br /> <br /> My Note: C Code Red DVD Extras: An Intro of Star Aleisa Shirley and Intruder Intruder, Scott Spiegel; Both the film and the theater version of the director; Audio talk with Star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; Interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; still gallery; Trailer for this movie; and followers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals and Balalaika Conspiracy
