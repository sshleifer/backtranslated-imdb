"Mistress of the Craft" Celeste works as an agent for the London office of Interpol's Bureau 17, which specializes in occult criminals (in my opinion). She has the Eye of Fate, good in her hands, dangerous if someone else got it. Bureau 17 has caught a Satanist from California, Hyde (no relation to Dr. Jekyll). Detective Lucy Lutz of LAPD flies to England to bring him back to the US. Lutz is the link to the earlier Witchcraft movies that was previously played by Stephanie Beaton in Witchcraft 9. In part 7 Lutz was played by another woman; in 6 Lutz was a man! <br /> <br /> Lutz 'part in 9 was not very big, but she is one of the main actors in this part. Although she has left behind her high heels and short skirts, she still has showy tops. And this time she has nude and sex scenes. Beaton is pretty appealing in the role. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are a number of sex scenes. An anonymous club visitor has a deadly threesome with two vampires, the satanist and the head vampire joke it off, Lutz finds an English buddy, and Celeste and her boyfriend love each other The Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, does not appear in this one, though Lutz mentioned him in a conversation about vampires versus Bureau 17 agent Dixon. She also calls her partner Detective Garner (Parts 6, 7, and 9), although we do not hear that his conversation is over. Hyde is escaped from jail by a group of vampires, led by Raven, for a Walpurgis ritual that has something to do with a god named Morsheba (I think). Hyde delivers all of his lines in a very flat manner, while Raven overcells a Campy grade. The fight scenes are terribly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The sound in the movie was taken quite badly and poorly edited. In addition, some dialogues are lost under loud music or sirens. The cinematography is not great either. That the movie was shot and shot in the UK was a bit new, at least for this series. Wendy Cooper is very good as a Celeste; certainly attractive, but more importantly: she is undoubtedly the best actress in the film (regardless of the fighting scenes). I am quite surprised that her filmography is so small. If there is ever a Witchcraft XIV, and I bet it will, they should bring it back, even if it means flying to California! <br /> <br /> Witchcraft X is available alone or on the DVD Hotter Than Hell along with Witchcraft XI and two unrelated movies.
