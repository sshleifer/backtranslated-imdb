One of the other commentators mentioned that they had almost gone out. If I had not been with my wife who wanted to stay, I would have left. That's too bad, because I think there could have been a good movie. However, this is one of the worst adapted scripts I have ever seen. It does not start anywhere and goes nowhere (I would say it's nowhere fast, but it's really nowhere slow ... painfully slow). From time to time, there is evidence that something interesting might happen, or that there may be some depth beneath one of the characters, but that's all we get - clues. There is no single payout or revelation throughout the movie. Not that I need a straight action to entertain ... I love a good, snaking character study as well as the next indie buff. But these signs add up to nothing. Throughout the movie, you do not care what happens to one of them. In fact, you almost begin to hope that they will die, because at least one death might be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior that is so strange and unpredictable that you think it would be compulsory in itself, but it is not , Instead of whimsical, noir-squeezing characters acting in a harsh way, you'll spot it right away at what it is: a bunch of talented but wrong-thinking actors who ponder and raise their eyebrows while they bizarre dialogue without a hint read relevant context. All this for two lumbering, painfully slow hours. Dreadful.
