I did not like the movie at all, Joshua. Maybe it's because I saw another, much more similar movie called "Orphan" 2 days ago, but maybe it's just because this movie was not very good. I go with the ladder. Sure, the conspiracy of a bad kid is not exactly original, but that does not mean that the movie could not succeed. It could have been exciting and entertaining and shivering, but instead it was slowly built, boring, uneventful, and really made me think that "it was not very good" when it was all over. <br /> <br /> At the end, the motivations of Joshua are revealed. I'm not going to reveal that, but the reality is that he has not really achieved his goals since Vera Farmiga, when his mother Abby disappeared by 3/4 in the course of the film, shows all the arrows on their speedy return. She was transferred to a psychiatric hospital because she lost her mind, but then Joshua's father / husband was accused of manipulating her medication, telling the audience that the facility realized she was not mentally ill, but medically was treated. Should not she come home soon? Will not Joshua have failed? Will not his mother live with him and his sister and possibly his father soon? I ask the father, because his future is open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, I was not interested in the characters. The evil demon kid Joshua was not really scary. The action moved slowly, and when it came up, it was still boring. The tension sank every time. When it was over, I could not believe that I had eaten the whole thing. <br /> <br /> 4/10, just because the acting was good by the parents, especially Vera Farmiga as a mother, but if you want to see a movie about a nasty "kid" go to Orphan. Well, this is a movie that uses an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie.
