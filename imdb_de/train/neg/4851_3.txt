Watch a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq count down their time before they can go home. <br /> <br /> That sounds boring. Every time this little caption appeared and told us how long they were left, it resulted in the movie being continued without a plot. hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home. <br /> <br /> I have to miss something. I'm a big fan of war movies if they're done well. This one had a "Jarhead" syndrome. A film that has been beautifully filmed at times, but cinematography does not stop it from being completely boring and meaningless. <br /> <br /> And about the slow cartridges that already come out of the gun, shot. They could have saved money and only got footage of another movie with a gun. <br /> <br /> I had no sympathy for the main man, I had always hoped that his recklessness would cause this to happen, that he would die. In fact, the movie would have worked a lot better if he had done it. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews and seemed to feel that those who had been in the armed forces did not like him, and everyone else was excited. I have never been in the armed forces and I am with them. It is pretension. The 3 stars are for the cinematography.
