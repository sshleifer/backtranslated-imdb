This typically melodramatic Bollywood movie has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics. The script is ridiculous, the drama is exaggerated and looks cheesy. The only reasons for the reputation of this soap opera are the wonderful songs that were sung by Mangeshkar, and the curtain of the legendary Meena Kumari. Seeing the actress, who was ill during the shoot and was allowed to drink to death shortly after the movie's release at the age of 40, has the same fascination as a train wreck. Her ex-husband Amrohi wrote and directed, but lacked the ability to perform both tasks well. Bollywood has produced far better films.
