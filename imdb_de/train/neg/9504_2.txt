The only reason I saw this movie was that I recently read Robert Hough's less than perfect but interesting, fictionalized account of the life of Big Cat coach Mabel Stark. Beaty appears as a figure in the book, in a less than flattering light. <br /> <br /> I did not notice when I checked out the movie later on the IMDb that it was originally a series. Anyone who has changed the original running time from 233 minutes to the 68-minute DVD version has done a damned good job. The abridged version plays just as well as any other B-movie of the time, despite the many "duh-what?" Moments Is it really expected of us, for example, that one morning our hero would dig this 20-foot-deep tiger trap without getting his breeches dirty? When I look over the chapter titles, I see that number five is called "Gorilla Warfare" and number eleven is "The Gorilla". There were no gorillas in the movie. I think some of the cuts were made there. <br /> <br /> Historically interesting.
