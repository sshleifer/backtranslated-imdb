My wife and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made. Surely in the top ten of those I have seen all the way. At least "Plan 9" was fun. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie" and some of his other films. "Cujo" did not really interest me (just because the sound on versions I saw was so bad and I often could not say what people were saying) or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". <Br /> <br /> But this mess was a complete mistake in every way. The "creatures" themselves seemed to have been designed by a 9-year-old. (No offense for nine-year-olds.) <br /> <br /> Even the "one-liners" made us moan and were not overly amusing.
