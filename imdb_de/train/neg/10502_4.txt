The film has several storylines that follow different characters. The various storylines do not seem like a complete piece, making this comedy a very incoherent affair and sometimes even annoying. <br /> <br /> It sounds weak and clich√©d, but it's true; You can see the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery Channel with Steve and Terri Irwin much better. It's more fun and even funnier than this movie. I am sure that both cast and crew had a lot of fun making this movie, but the movie is not a big pleasure for the audience. It's just not funny enough for a comedy, and Steve and Terri Irwin are just not good actors, not even when they play themselves. Her antics are just not good enough to make a movie, and her scene feels long, distracting, unnecessary, and sometimes annoying. <br /> <br /> The film has some potential, I mean, Steve Irwin is a character. Strangely, it's fascinating and weird to watch. The first time I heard them film a movie about the crocodile hunter was my first reaction. brilliant! However, the film suffers greatly from its weak history and incoherent storylines with uninteresting and listless characters. The movie has some entertainment value, at least enough to make this movie visible at least once, but still I do not need to recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> If you look at this movie, I felt like a waste of time. This movie may only be seen once when it's on television on a rainy afternoon. It has some good moments, but the plot really totally destroys the movie and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
