A lot of death happens in the wild. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to find out! But does it have to be the focus of a nature documentary? What about this fascination for the cruel death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant being torn apart by a pack of hungry lions? Or a cheetah who grabs a gazelle by the neck in slow motion, no less! I thought that would be a family friendly nature movie! <br /> <br /> And why not have the courage to show the cruel violence in the trailers of the movie? Did the filmmakers fear losing money? <br /> <br /> Then we see, in a typical comic way, how the magnificent Birds of Paradise perform mating rituals to humanize the most annoying and stupid story. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers thought they were just addressing a room full of freshman and second graders on an excursion to school! Impressive! From the mean to the jerk in a heartbeat! <br /> <br /> If there are future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings of this film review, why not focus on: animals that actually copulate; give birth; Lay eggs; To bathe; Sleep; to clean each other; socializing; play; other emotional phenomena than fear and anger; unusual behaviors, such as pondering in the mouth; Migration; problem-solving skills; Culture (yes, many species have what people call culture); Communication skills; Parenting, healing skills, etc. In other words, stop concentrating on violence or toning down the beauty, and why should not you be much more round - and instead focus on joy and inspiration?
