I'm ashamed to write this review. I say that because those of you who read it will know that I've eaten the whole thing and it's embarrassing to even confess strangers. But I only had to warn those who read the viewer comments on IMDb before watching a movie to watch it. It's the least I can do. This is a bad movie! Trust me. The plot is stupid. Acting is amateurish. Director, camera operator, stage sets, costumes, etc. are all secondary. Forget it.
