Man, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller of 'Friends' <br /> <br /> 2) A great cast is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateur script. <br /> <br /> 3) The movie suffers at a terrible pace. It jumps confused and confused. <br /> <br /> 4) History makes no sense at all. Why does he want to break the football series? What about the stupid violin music? Nothing is explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not even funny. It's like a bunch of accountants trying to make improvisation: "Look at me, look at me, I'm funny!" This was a bad attempt to do another "Love At First Bite". <br /> <br /> I like Larry Cohen movies, but man who failed here. I could not wait for the trigger to roll. Terribly disappointed.
