I am definitely in the minority opinion. "The Hurt Locker" has received more "Best Picture" awards from critics than any other movie this year. Not only did not I like it, it was also hard for me to sit through it. <br /> <br /> There is minimal action and little character development. They disarm bombs, fight and destroy more bombs. That's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing was that the camera never stops and shakes all the time. This has recently been a fad in filmmaking, which is supposed to give the impression that it has a cheap documentary. The camera was shaking so much that I was sick of looking at the screen. <br /> <br /> Usually I do not care about war movies. But you do not have to take my word for it because the critics love it.
