Just a regular Jason Lee movie. There were some parts of the movie that were funny. The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge, I think. These are the types of movies 14-year-old girls watch at slumber parties. It was a real movie. It's kind of these movies that you run in the background and look up every now and then when something draws attention. I think that Julia Stile and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and storyline. It's just a kind of boy who meets a girl's movie. This is the perfect movie they would show at Comedy Central. I am glad that I did not see this movie in the theater, I would have been angry. But I think that's why I did not see it in the theater.
