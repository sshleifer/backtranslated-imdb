I probably do not shake the movie well because I could not see everything. If I had seen it in a theater in its original presentation, I might have appreciated it, but it's way too slow for me. I read the book about 25 years ago and the details of the plot have disappeared from memory. This did not help the film as it is a little less than alive and clear in the presentation of the events. <br /> <br /> These are really four linked movies or a four-part movie that I thought was meant to be over four nights in a theatrical performance. I found Part I to be enjoyable enough, but it was all I could do to endure Part II, which tears endlessly. Reading Tolstoy's philosophizing is one thing. If you can get a good translation or read it in the original, the brilliant typeface will weigh all the problems you might have with the pace of the story. In the film, however, it is difficult to reproduce without being cumbersome. <br /> <br /> I have other issues with the parts of the movie that I have seen. It's very sparkling, with a lot of hey-ma-look-at-this-camera work that attracts attention rather than serving to advance the story. <br /> <br /> Sure, I'm missing something but I simply could not muster the enthusiasm to build up parts III and IV.
