Sorry Fulci fans, but I could not make it. The soundtrack was about as annoying as it came, the acting was pueril, the story was done and done, and the direction was not there. <br /> <br /> Massacre honestly looked like a children's movie project. But I've seen some of them and they actually look better than that! It seems to have been so underfunded that they could not afford it ... EVERYTHING! No DoP, no director, no one who had any idea what acting was. It was a very bad cinematic experience. One of my worst. <br /> <br /> This was the worst sucking feast I've ever seen, next to Terror Toons, which is second only to killer klowns from outer space. I have nothing else to say. <br /> <br /> It rates a 0.1 / 10th of ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend.
