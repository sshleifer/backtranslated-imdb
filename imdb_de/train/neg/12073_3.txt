*** SPOILERS *** At a meeting of family members and servants of the late Christopher Dean, John Carradine, to hear his last will and testament, they are somewhat surprised when the deanery fortune costs about $ 140 million. The money should be shared between them, but only after spending a week in the Dean Villa. There seemed to be a mix-up in the story when we later found out that it really is an overnight stay, not a weeks-long vacation in the mansion, where guests can qualify for Dean's money, since almost all are dead by sunrise. <br /> The first victim of the Dean's Curse has nothing at all to do with getting and making money from the late Christopher Dean Estate, the local sheriff Dan Garcia, Rodolfo Acosta. Acosta cooled his head cool and then served it to a shocked group of guests on a plate. Later that evening, the cute little Chin Greg and Laura's, Jeff Morrow & Marry Anders, are found a little pet swimming in the pond outside. <br /> <br /> In the movie, everyone who stays in the Dean Mansion will be picked up One at a time until it turns out who the killer really is. We then have a seemingly twofold twist in history, in which the original killer, along with two of the last remaining guests, is suddenly killed. The true killer not only gets the entire loot, $ 140 million, but does not have to split it up with his accomplice by killing him or her by giving him a poisonous biscuit that kills him on the spot. <br /> The nonsensical who did it, and a haunted house, a movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikely characters that even a mother, let alone the public, would not like. There's everything you can imagine in the move with the selective guests, including incest S & M sadism and, of course, double action and back stabbing, not even murder. It just does not matter who of the guests at the end of the film collects the Dean fortune and hopes against hope that none of them will. <br /> <br /> Even the big surprise in the end is no. It really is not a big surprise, as the identity of the murderer is revealed. The filmmaker forgot to keep his face in the shadows, so you can actually see who he is even before he reveals himself. We then have a plot twist that eliminates the killer along with a number of remaining guests, just to make the movie a little more confusing than it already is. The last turn, seen from up to ten miles away, showed just how clever the obvious killer was who did not deceive anyone watching the movie.
