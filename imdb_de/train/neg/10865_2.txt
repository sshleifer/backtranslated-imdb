I love the Munna Bhai MBBS but "Lagge raho ..." SUX really SUX. I've never seen such a boring movie in my life. And those high ratings have really surprised me that the taste of Indian cinema visitors happened? <br /> <br /> ** CAN BE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> A educated girl needs advice from a Bhai. People discuss their personal problem. On cell phones you come from which part of the world? I agree that movies should be fictional, but these things are really indigestible. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 points. (2 stars are good start for 15 minutes)
