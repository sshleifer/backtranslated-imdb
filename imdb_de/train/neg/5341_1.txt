Loaded with good actors, I expected much more from "Deceiver" than was delivered. The plot is extremely thoughtful and manipulative. The many flashbacks only add to the confusion. Credibility flies out the window and becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous with the end. I would recommend to anyone who wants to base their movie presentations on something that is at least possible to avoid "cheaters" because you are very frustrated. Maybe I'm just not hip enough to get it, but I suspect that many others were completely confused by the storyline and especially by the end. Blurring the line between reality and lies just does not work, because the whole movie does not make sense. - MERK
