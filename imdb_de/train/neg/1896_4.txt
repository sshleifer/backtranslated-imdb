This film does not show us anything original. Every idea or (action) scene can be found in many previously released films. Fabulous Nick is very clear here. Will Patton is calm and angry too. Mr. Duvall is fine, but has a very small part. Angelina, how can we determine her newly celebrated fame? Overall, there are too many characters, so nobody and nothing is particularly detailed. This makes the movie easy to forget. A pity, do not you think?
