Anemic comedy drama, an unfortunate, apparently haunted affair in which Cher is referred to as a housewife-housewife who slowly befriends the hit man hired by her husband. As a talkative weapon, Chazz Palminteri adapted the script from his own play, with amazing settings and a reciprocal dialogue that quickly tired eyes and ears. A touch of darkness hangs over the entire project, and director Paul Mazursky can not get Cher out of her eternal funk (she's listless). Despite all the top talents (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faithful" is fraudulent, with no content and characters that are rarely brought to life. * 1/2 of ****
