3lbs is obviously just a self-indulgent program for Stanley Tucci to become a producer / moody, deep doctor. Unlike House, he has absolutely no personality and unlike Gray's Anatomy, the cases of brain surgery are not even interesting. This program will be located in a leading center for neurological cases - but there is nothing interesting or exciting! Not even the so-called pathetic "feud" between him and a rival adds anything to the show, nor any of those hallucinations. In the pilot, there was a brief glimpse into the social life of the leads as a father - Snooze! boring and meaningless. <br /> <br /> This show is a pair of trousers, there is a flood of medical drama right now and this does not make them special.
