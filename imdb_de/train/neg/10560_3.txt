Many other critics here, including many whose opinions I respect, highly appreciate this piece of European sleaze horror. Personally, I did not like it at all. It is an incoherent attempt at an atmospheric period between sex and violence. Jess Franco at his best makes such films very well. The infamous commercial filmmaker Joe D'Amato does not do it unfortunately. The most famous D'Amato films are famous for their high gross quotient. This early film of his does not have the constant disgusting scenes that his more well-known "Anthropophagous" and "Beyond the Darkness" have made. Ultimately, it is an incoherent film that does not involve the viewer in any way. Without the sleaze factor it gets very boring. As I said, others enjoyed this movie, but I just found it a perfect example of lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are a few pluses to the movie. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") is in and she looks pretty hot and is often naked. However, the iconic cult icon Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main movie. He seems bored with the role and does not have the manic intensity he has at his best. The music score is nice and there are some moments of unintentionally funny Gore. Still, this is an unpretentious and pointless movie that gets incredibly boring. (3/10)
