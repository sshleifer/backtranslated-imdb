I saw this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas day. The short summary of this film is MUST AVOID. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and did none of these jobs. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Pakistan in 1999, conquering part of the disputed Kashmir region of India. Probably based on facts, in this film you get an indication of the difficulty of the Indian army reclaiming the area from the Pakistani troops occupying the highlands. But instead of telling what a captivating and heroic story must have been, this film makes the Indian military just ridiculous and stupid, which I think is not true. <br /> <br /> I almost saw this movie A completely Indian audience that was very patriotic and clearly wanted to like this movie, but also laughed at scenes that should not be funny. <br /> <br /> The script was absolutely miserable. It gave the impression that Mr. Dutta knows nothing about the functioning of an army and uses the films from the war as a reference. The result is a brainless and repetitive script. <br /> <br /> The behavior of most of the principals was not outstanding, but with the script they've received, it's hard for me to criticize them too much. As for the side cast, I can only say that I hope they were amateurs. <br /> <br /> The editing was also pretty bad. It was pretty hard to track what went on most of the time and the music would abruptly end with scene changes. <br /> <br /> Good things: The cinematography was pretty good, although a bit hurt, the fact that the film did not seem to be color corrected (the color balance often varied considerably within scenes). Also, the few songs that appeared in the movie were quite pleasing - at least for the first half-dozen verses. Unfortunately, they were much longer than they should be. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This mess is four hours long. There is enough here that a good editor could almost get a good 1.5 - 2 hour movie out of the box. Unfortunately, a good editor did not work on this film.
