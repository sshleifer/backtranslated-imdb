** Containing spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I had heard from various sources that this movie was controversial and that the end was terrible in particular. What I did not expect was the complete turnaround in about twenty minutes. What begins as a typical cowboy / Indian Western suddenly falls into a very boring romantic "comedy" about Honus (Soldier Blue of the title, played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen), which is an onslaught of the cavalry through the Cheyenne escape. The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched characters, hence the romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance then appears and kidnaps them for no real reason. They then flee and both arrive (separately) on the eve of an attack on Cheyenne Base at the Cavalry Base. Since Cresta used to be married to a Cheyenne boss, she escapes the cavalry base and joins them. So far so ordinary. Then comes the end. After spending more than an hour doing evil with a clich√©, the movie is / is transformed into a towering exploit that shoots a beheading and a child in the back of his head, among other things. At this point in the movie, similarities can be drawn to the Wild Bunch, but the Wild Bunch maintained the same tone and did not use extreme violence. In a way, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's Last Summer, which has also completely changed the direction for a shocking person. I did not hate Soldier Blue and did not find the ending particularly disturbing, but I just found it boring with an unnecessarily violent end. If you want to see a movie with a really disturbing slaughter of the innocent, I would recommend Elem Klimov's Come and See.
