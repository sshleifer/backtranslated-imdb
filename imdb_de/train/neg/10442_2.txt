Everything on the internet was set aside, this movie was awful. I expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything else. Instead, the filmmakers tried to make a serious thriller / horror movie that they completely missed. There were only a few good parts and a few good lines from Samuel Jackson. Besides, it was a pile of blood and some badly animated snakes. All internet jokes were far better than the actual movie. Well, since the movie actually came out, this joke will hopefully die. Do not waste your time or money on this over-hyped garbage. If you're looking for something fun and entertaining, just go to Snakes in a blog.
