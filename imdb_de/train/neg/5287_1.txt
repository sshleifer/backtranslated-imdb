I have no idea why they made this version of "Persuasion" when they already had this fine miniseries with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suspect that they wanted to create a feature-length version, but of course a lot had to be deleted. Unfortunately, everything ended up on the floor of the cutting room with all the nice humor and humor that left a movie that was more of a melodrama than an amusing depiction of English country manners and customs were flat and uninteresting. They had hunted poor Anne for Captain Wentworth, like a stupid modern youth. , A wealthy woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done that, and certainly not this crazy heroine. Some say they found this antic ridiculous; My reaction was not laughter but indignation. The idea of ​​such corruption of an Austenian work is under contempt. <br /> <br /> It was awful.
