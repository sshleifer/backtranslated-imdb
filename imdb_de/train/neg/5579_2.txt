The 60s are an occasionally entertaining movie, most of this conversation comes from laughter about the movie. It is extremely uneven and contains many disturbing elements. Take, for example, the change between black and white and color. If done correctly, this could be quite effective, but because it was done badly, it became a nuisance and only affected the already bad experience; a large part of the film felt strange. Acting was not particularly bad for a TV movie, but on the other hand, it was embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent and confusing in the end. How did it happen that this family was present at many major events in the 1960s? The end was far too sweet for my taste; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to be right in the end. I would advise you not to waste your time with The 60's and do something different with your time. I am glad that I saw this in the classroom and not from my own time. I think I can say for sure that the best part of the movie was incorporating Bob Dylan's music. These are just my thoughts when painting. I hope you accept my advice and stay away from it.
