I read comments that this is the best Chinese movie ever made. If the only Chinese movie you saw contained no dialogue, long, distant glances and silence and hacking, you're in the right place. <br /> <br /> Complicated story? Barely. Try teen and amateur. Exquisite moods and haunting memories? Barely. Try boring and banal. <br /> <br /> That was terrible. I could not wait for it to be over. Especially when the best lines in the movie are "How are you? I'm fine, are you sure?" Impressive! What character depth. I think the constant smoking of cigarettes should speak for them. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was totally disappointed. Even Zhang's sentimentally crappy "The Road Home" was better.
