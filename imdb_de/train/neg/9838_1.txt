This movie is awful. Decent fighting scenes or not, acting is really bad, as one can say they read their lines from a map. With painful line delivery by everyone in the cast. Imagine you're playing a high school game and crawling in the face of the apparent lack of suppleness in the actor's interactions (weird pauses between the lines of different characters, combined with urgent leadership by others). If the movie were all-action, it could be forgivable, but much of the film includes plot setup and Family Guy style, disrespectful cuts (oh, wow, are they done badly). I assume they were trying to be funny with them, but it came back as a lot of high school / college beginners trying to make a fun Youtube clip for the afternoon. <br /> <br /> Now to the fight scenes. They are not bad, considering how high the quality is in the movie. Also, nothing great, certainly not nearly the same level as other posters have stated (nothing like Drunken Master). The fights have an overly staged feel, with LOTS cuts at different angles with totally different positions of those involved. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the man's friends involved in this very, very cheap production. Which type can you ask? Oh, the same guy who wrote, staged, produced and stared into this masterpiece of middle school.
