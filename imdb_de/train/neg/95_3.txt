You must admire Brad Sykes, even if you do not particularly want it, a man who turns budget horror out of budget horror into less than enthusiastic receptions. But do it anyway. Even the half-hearted praise surrounding his Camp Blood films is reluctant, and I'm just as guilty as anyone else. Brad usually manages to bring something interesting into the mix, a nice idea, a crazy character, whatever, but without the means to bring it beyond the base level, he relies on the audience to relieve him a bit and recognize it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and hilarious performance as Ebenezer Jackson and it is thanks to Sykes that he senses that this curious turnaround will work in the film. Come to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.
