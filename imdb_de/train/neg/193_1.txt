The story of Norman Maclean is a masterpiece. Redford's film is a mediocre. He adds mundane scenes in which the Maclean brothers raid a crash and double-date in a run-down bar that was not suggested in the story. The cipher Brad Pitt, who tries to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, an outdoor genius, turns out to be either vulnerable or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly-casting scenes are beautiful. Also Tom Skerritt as a father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as one had expected of men. None of the women make an impression in the film, which is unfortunate, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.
