This great James Arness Western is the worst Alamo movie ever made. The story was terrible, inaccuracy in the whole and just untruths! Continuity was thrown on the four winds. Someone catches the cannon order? The Mexicans were dumb enough to fire guns that obviously had mud and stick out of the pipes. Come on! Then there's Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! The customer must have been gone or something. Or just crazy!
