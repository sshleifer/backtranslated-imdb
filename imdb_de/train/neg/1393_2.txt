I found it boring to see employment videos for compliance with company standards. This movie did not go fast anywhere. What could have been a bit cheesy half-hour episode of the twilight zone became a seemingly endless waste of film when people park their car, a picture of a guy-pool (by the way, he has to answer his phone) a dot-matrix printer It's his job, and Heuy and Louey sit in a yellow-lit control room and repeat "T minus 10 and count" as if something exciting is happening. It does not make your hopes that way. The best thing about this movie is to see James Best and Gerald McC in something other than the famous TV personalities, and that stretches to finding something good. And do NOT let me start with the music, which consisted entirely of a tympani, some big marine mammals and a microphone feedback. This movie is as close as I gave it to one, but it gets the 2 because I could actually finish this insomnia cure and not have to go in the middle. AVOID ALL COSTS.
