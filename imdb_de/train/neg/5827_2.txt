Do not make the impression of other reviewers that this film stinks because the Japanese whaling industry is ambivalent (which is morally no worse than the US meat trade or the Scottish haggis schnapps) from Up-its-Own-Behind-Guff, which gives a bad reputation to modern art. While there are some stunning pictures, the average bus ride offers amazing pictures as you use your imagination. So that's no reason to see this nonsense. What happens in the movie happens very slowly, often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat is being eaten out, and then, when you think it's done, it starts again. I saw it in a porn cinema in Rome that had been hired for the weekend to show Barney's film work. This is an admirable and clever way to reclaim an old fleapit from the dirty old men in Mac's brigade, but if the trendy young stuff and the slightly older beard-to-be Bj√∂rk fans were honest, everyone would have had much more fun if they had only one showed the porn!
