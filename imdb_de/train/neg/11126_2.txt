Of all the movies I've seen, this movie is almost at the bottom (Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble, and a few others keep it from the bottom). Of course, we have to put some of it at the book author's door. The book the film was filmed upon is incredibly cumbersome and illogical. Oprah makes a tasty appearance as a "Biggers" mom, but is far from having her potential. Other famous artists also seem to be the worst. The action revolving around an African American who has decided to take a job as a chauffeur. When he drives the family daughter to a communist dinner, he gets to know him. One thing leads to the other and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he works for is not against black people, but he believes that they are. When he gets home, he puts her to bed, but she starts robbing. The blind mother (yes) hears that, so Bigger tries to silence her but stifles her. Now he's afraid he's really having trouble killing a white girl, he does what any thinking thinker would do - he pushes her into the coal stove. Investigators are doing a case of a missing person, and they're checking the stove (the idiot did not have the foresight to get rid of the ashes.) He's then arrested and the last hour are horrible sections of the courtroom. Desperate for a bad movie, this one could be here do the job, but if you're serious about dealing with cultural issues in the 40s and 50s or want to see a good drama, there are much better options.
