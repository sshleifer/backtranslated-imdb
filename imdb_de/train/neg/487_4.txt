What did the director think? Anyone who has read the biography of Artemisia is impressed by their courage to undergo a public rape trial in the Renaissance, and even suffered torture to show that Tassi is guilty. This fact shows the true independence and liberation - in her most terrible hour, she stands by her MAN. Why do films that depict the Renaissance need to be so clinically beautiful and romantic, are we scared to see the grim side of life, or have the Hollywood Happy-Happy vibe? While I would always defend the freedom of a director to create his own reality in a movie, I can not make sense to turn Artimisia's life story upside down. Very disappointing choice of the makers of this movie.
