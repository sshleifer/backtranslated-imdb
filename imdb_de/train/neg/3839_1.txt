Some movies are so bad that they are good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was about as faithful as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The spectacle was terrible, the direction was bad and it traveled way too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to get it over and go home. <br /> <br /> Melissa Joan Hart has never struck me as a talented actress, but then every movie she made was pretty low. Budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she lowers her characters by overburdening them and talking too fast, as if accelerating her words made her more dramatic. It really gives the impression that a crew is in front of her and she talks to a camera if she should include the viewer in her character. It pretty much shuts down the whole movie, and every leg he could stand on is ruined. <br /> <br /> Probably the only good thing about the movie is if it gets nailed in the end. But even that was not satisfying enough to suppress my disgust for such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Take a look, if your movie taste is milder than a piece of dry toast.
