I could hardly stop myself from either nodding or just stopping this crap, but I decided to say it, if only for the reason that * something * would happen. This is the work of a writer / producer / director / special, Kenneth Herts, who wants to express environmental damage while shooting a monster movie. He wanted that anyway. What turns out to be a lot of acting, either slightly hammy or just banal and without much merit, and scenes that seemingly repeat themselves as monster ATTACKS in the river water (oh, and what a luck, a woman is happening right now.) Be naked ... even though DISAPPEARANCES already existed!) <br /> <br /> This is just nonsensical stuff, but I suppose it's not too damaging. It is not very offensive, and once or twice we get a semi-interesting insight into the Brazilian "culture" (this is the father who goes with his flock through the city or other parts of a sight of "Hey, that's NOT America! "). Whatever the director's hope for the cast of Mitchum or Carradine is, at best, a pedestrian and, at worst, a torturous and dull dialogue. It does not help, if we finally see the monster properly and the "action" happens, it is staged stupid and has only a gloomy impression. Normally, I would apologize for a filmmaker who had a lot of trouble completing a particular image - in this case, it took most of the mid '70s, but with monstroid or monster or whatever it says ... close. <Br /> <br /> If you get the Elvira DVD dual function (poor print with poor transmission quality) with Blue Sunshine, you should skip it. Unless you are an Elvira hard-core and can not help but hear her lavish comment. Personally, I would rather get Joel or Mike Nelson with the robots of the Mystery Science Theater for this roast turkey.
