There is a lot to appreciate here: spectacular locations and flying sequences; historical costumes, props and sets; and competent writing and acting. However, to enjoy a drama, we need at least one principal who has some qualities we like or admire. In this bunch of cranky snobs we only found one character who is likable at all? an unhappy man who finds himself helpless in a fleeting marginal role. From the reviews here it is clear that we are completely out of control, but we did not find the malicious schoolgirl amusing or entertaining. Even the dog is abominable. We threw in the towel after two of the six episodes, so you should devalue those observations accordingly, but what I could find about this mini series gave us no reason to expect character transformation or salvation.
