... although there was a marked lack of blood for a movie that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror. <br /> <br /> There was also a marked lack of capable direction, drama, editing and script writing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London performed one of the most terrifying performances I've ever seen - his "descent into the Maelstrom" of madness is painfully self-conscious and awkward. Oh look, twitch! Oh, look to him, drink strong spirits! Oh, watch him raise his forehead and tilt his head at a brisk angle! Oh, look at his unwashed, greasy dark hair! Oh, listen to his affected rough voice! He must be a tortured artist / writer / genius! Oh yes, the Poet shirt is coming out - it's another boy who thinks he's Byron. (Or Poe.) Oh, for the love of ... has been a guide to "How To Act Good" or simply pulled him somewhere in a cardboard box someone this man, the little plastic toys Price is no longer available brand of bargain basket cereal. Okay, that was a stupid line - but that's just because London's performance has melted my brain with its fearlessness. Katherine Heigl is sweet and very angry rose, but has not been in her acting shoes grown into this film - she delivered her lines as if they had been stopped, indeed their entire performance was wooden, their poses were as stiff as their lines - who knows, maybe she just reacted to Jeremy London's impact and tried to neutralize her excesses, but if that's the case, she goes too far. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy is Arie Verveen as Poe - while his character's role is confused, he delivers the best performance of the piece. It just looks right, but it's more than that - it has a certain depth, I believe that it had a life beyond the bleak two-dimensional quality of the rest of the characters. Huh, maybe it's just because I like Poe and so I could just wander and invent my thoughts while he was on the screen - whatever, he had an interest factor that's otherwise missing. <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are a faceless blur - there are all the usual cartoons: the cheeky blond best friend who is a bit quick; the in love local policeman, who is a bit of a dork; the protective older man, who perhaps has too much un-fatherly interest in our heroine; the old fashioned witch, etc. yawn, yawn. <br /> <br /> As with the question of "clear lack of blood for a horror movie" none of the topics they mention (and the London figure in his attack on Poe's writing so daunting mentioned) pulled up. As another reviewer said - here there was potential: murder, incest, - really shocking stuff, but instead, they shy away from the problems and cut by the violence from (a raised candle holder swings through the air - then his victim joins ) This is good in a traditional noirish horror, indeed expected and received loving, if it happens - it is a loving convention, especially if it is accompanied by fake lightning and intense Siouxie-eye make-up - but in 'Descendant 'it just seems awkward, or as if the editor felt uncomfortable at the last minute and cuts it) This could have been either a very tense psychological thriller -. the horror of palingenesis / Fraud / madness - or simply (and funny) slasher Movie: It's trying to be both, or both (something new and exciting!), But it's definitely a bleak one. The only horror element of this entire movie is its epic stupidity. <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if any one was) must have been drunk when he / she chopped up this thing - it's inconveniently shortened scenes; Scenes that were apparently out of order (but that could have been the poor script). Likewise, the director and cameraman - there were some very strange shots and frames that I thought were meant to be a tribute to Hitchcock or Browning, but they just looked stupid (again good in Noir, but this was trying to be something else) br /> <br /> The whole thing may have been funny (that's what previous critics have mentioned - "OMG, how was that done?!?") if I was in the mood for garbage. Wrapping up, unfortunately for me I had sat down on the couch, the lights were low, with the express intention of frightening me - this is a very bad movie, and I'm afraid I can not recommend it to people, not even laughing , <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time and money - either borrow a real horror film / thriller movie or get a copy of Poe's fantastic stories. I'll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever achieve with this garbage.
