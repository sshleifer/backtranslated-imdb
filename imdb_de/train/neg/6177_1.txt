The real irony is this: Joe Besser was a first-rate comedian, in other situations off the Stooges. He had a clear track record because he was very funny and smart. Moe, Larry and Shemp had actually known him for many years and liked his work. So what the hell was going on when he joined the "third henchman"? Of course nothing. In most of these shorts from the "late Stooge" era, the boys are mostly hired against each other, or Joe against the other two, and this is no exact Stooge etiquette. "One for all, all for one, each one for themselves", to quote Curly from "Restless Knights". One about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Marx Brothers, no matter how much they all try to use each other or beat each other, if the chips have actually failed, they stay together to help. In this case, nothing happens. It's almost like watching a dog fight while trying to trick the others or being mean and evil, not comedic. One could suspect that something was going on behind the scenes, art imitates life. So maybe there really was why Better did not stay with Moe and Larry for very long. Just look at the story of the other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
