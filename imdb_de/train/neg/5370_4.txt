Råzone is a horrible movie! It is so easy. It seems they have been trying to make a movie to show the role life. Just like Zappa many years ago. Unfortunately, Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon is still the little girl in the "crooked Jul," and Laura just is not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays without a soul and that destroys the movie! <br /> <br /> Even if I think it's a movie to watch. I do not agree that the adolescents behave this way, but I think it can show how it can end if you abandon your child. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies like "Film Folket". <br /> <br /> All in all, I think people should see Råzone. Not because it's a great movie, but because it's a film that deals with important topics. I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and indeed it is in these scenes that Laura presents herself best. - like the end where she holds the gun!
