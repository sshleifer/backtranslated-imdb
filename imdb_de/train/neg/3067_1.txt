That's just bad. Sometimes remakes, even if they differ from the original, are good for themselves. They can bring a different point of view and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. This has been thought out and done as badly as possible. That was not good, even if you stand alone. Viggo Mortenson is a first-class actor, but some of his role and project choices leave much to be desired. The original "Vanishing Point" was an exciting psychological adventure. This is not an adventure at all and is neither enjoyable nor entertaining. This came from an approach based on the number of filmmakers, filling plots that someone in Hollywood believes will appeal to what they see as the cinematic audience of today. Basically they see us as a lot of idiots. It is offensive that someone is releasing this as a feature film and even trying to make a cult classic so sloppy. The manipulative action devices, the aspects "make-it-obvious-so-you-do-not-miss-the-point", ridiculous dialogues, stereotype characters, amateurish direction ... that's just bad ....
