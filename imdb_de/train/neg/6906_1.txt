Not only does this film have a bad plot, a bad direction and terrible acting, it also adds a whole new meaning to racism. <br /> <br /> In this movie, "white" chicks are the sluts, "white" guys are the wana-be gangsters, and successful (yes, again) "white" businessmen are disgusting toilet shaker script, only I have it made over caucasian. "He buddy, it's good to see that you've finally stopped being with these black girls." Zealand "white boys". Suddenly it's the whites who are the main cause of the gangs' aggression and endure a quick bang. Only Samoans have a heart, there is no such slippery white girl. <br /> <br /> It shocks me that they can not shoot this film without giving the Caucasian community in New Zealand a repellent profile. If you think I'm going to generalize, then watch this movie and see what you make of the "white boys". Just because Samoans call us "white boys" in real life does not mean it's funny. If I said, hey black boy, I'll lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie. Do not waste your money. Do not be racist.
