When 'My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu' aired last season, I was very satisfied. I thought Scrubs did something clever and unique about the clip show concept. Instead of playing footage, jokes are played in a confident way, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I really regretted that I was wrong. A season later, she succumbed to what almost all sitcoms inevitably do, the clip show ... and it looked as though she'd been put together by the Work Experience kid. Dr. Cox's shaved head shows how lazy the editors were at putting it together, as he only appears 4 episodes later, as "My Long Goodbye". I can not imagine that a wig is too much trouble in maintaining the continuity of a once-well-established sitcom. Who knows why it was unplugged there, it just seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (largely) of episodes airing last year DVD Extra for a (very) rainy day, not episode of Prime -Time television.
