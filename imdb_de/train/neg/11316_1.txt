Knights was just the beginning of a series, a pilot, you could say. The plot (I really should not call it, there was no plot) was not logical at all and there were many mistakes, such as [Warning, I summarize the plot]: <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie someone said that there were only a few of these cyborgs (the bad guys), but after the climax, Nea realized that there were many more of them. And it was said that cyborgs were hard to kill, but after a month of training Nea could kill them in one shot. <br /> <br /> The movie was just a kick. I was not at all surprised when I found out that the main star was a kickboxer. <br /> <br /> There was ONE positive point in the whole movie: It really laughed a lot when you saw it and talked to my friends about it. I recommend looking at it when you need laughter.
