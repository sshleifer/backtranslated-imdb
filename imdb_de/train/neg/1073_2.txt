I can not believe that so much talent can be wasted in a movie! The gingerbread man starts on the right foot and creates great expectations for the end. But eventually the movie turns into one of the worst stories I've wasted my time on. It's just amazing how the enchanted Mallory Doss manages to pull Kenneth Branagh's character by the nose. The climax of the films is as uninteresting and flat as a beer that was too long in the sun. The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham movie of all time, and this is not changed by the fact that talented stars bring the film together. Do not waste your time here!
