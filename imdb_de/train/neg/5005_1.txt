A cheesy, horribly awful (and NOT funny) C-grade movie. Everything calls "amateurs", the disheveled script (bizarre premises, limited cohesion and predictable end), the dim lighting, the sound and shaky camera perspectives, the coy and pass sex inneundo and references, the spotty and unbelievable dialgoue the Z I saw it on DVD and always hoped Edward Wood would jump out. Everything is forgiven - your worst films are works of art and more coherent than this dichotomy. <br /> <br /> But still preferable "Every night in my dreams I hear you" - are you sure the Titanic crew was not there by the way?
