Where should I start? How about the wrong synopsis: <br /> <br /> "X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's epically violent and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed and the ominous Weapon X program." /> <br /> His epically violent past turns out to be non-violent for once. <br /> <br /> His relationship with Creed is so pronounced that it's hard to understand how they even have a connection. We are thrown from a point in the opening scene, which shows them as children on the run, to a montage of war scenes that they have fought through during their long lives, and finally to the present, where they are part of a hardened government team of assassins. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to portray their relationship as brothers at all. There is nothing complex for us to believe that it is authentic or even loving. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the film between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt. We've got into a romance that's so fast that it's over before you can turn a blind eye. Silverfox was just introduced when he was killed fifteen minutes later. We wonder why we should take care of it. Who was she anyway? <br /> <br /> The romance is surprisingly unexplored for a key element of this weak, revenge-driven story. It just fell in because it was needed. When Wolverine finds out that his love is dead, he leaves her in the forest to rot as he goes to Sabertooth. To be the romantic he is, was not characteristic of him, but nevertheless necessary to serve the conspiracy to fend off a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> As for the Weapon X program, let's say that after the painful crippling process Wolverine is in operation. Finally he arrives in the house of a practically old but overwhelmingly loving couple. Surprisingly, Ma and Pa Kent are not alarmed when they find a naked sweaty man in their barn. Is it any wonder what destiny awaits you? <br /> <br /> In previous films and comic books, the main reason why Wolverines' amnesia plagued him was in part dependent on being vicious and vicious cold-blooded. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this was the case ... did he really want to remember or hide such horrors and continue his currently more positive lifestyle of fighting the world's villains alongside his teammates? <br /> <br /> As X2: X-men United suggests, when Stryker abandons some of his secrets, it is said Wolverine would be disturbed to know of the evil works they had committed together. This movie makes the team pretty good, only they do not really do much. No disturbing violence, no reckless deeds, they only bother a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not a bad man under Stryker at all. Instead, he was constantly trying to leash his brother Sabertooth, which was the violent agent we all considered Wolverine to be. At some point he just leaves everything together. <br /> <br /> No conflict of duality here. <br /> <br /> Idiotic Removing this character conflict between good and evil has stopped the story immensely. They could have given him rubbery claws too. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of other bugs in this movie that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the lame Deus ex machinas who ever got hit with a script. <br /> <br /> Magic Memory Dustballs. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> Apparently, they are the only thing that brings Wolverine down. However, this was apparently forgotten when Agent was shot down by agents with bullets and bombs that certainly would not work. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that it tries to focus on Wolverine while throwing a ton of other mutants that did little or nothing. Interesting characters were just shop windows and did not do anything for the story. Most were in the movie for a maximum of 5-10 minutes and yet you wish we saw more of them and less of Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (the blob but not the comic version) can hit a launch tank rocket with little to no physical damage, but a simple head-thrust from Wolverines Metal-Noggin is enough to stun him ? Cyclops optic rays (which no longer act as a repulsive force) Lasers can burn through buildings, but if fired directly at Sabertooth, they are simply thrown into the ground without damaging clothing. The Adamantium Trenchcoat does not disguise anyone? <br /> <br /> The (gravity-defying) mutant Gambit turns into some kind of crazy acrobat instead of using its signature cards. In a poorly edited scene, he is knocked unconscious by Wolverine. A few minutes later, he is surprisingly on a roof running TOWARDS Wolverine. How he came to himself, ran a few blocks, climbed up a building, and then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the midst of a scratching fight, is a mystery that can still be explained. Some apologize for film weakness by claiming to have been made from a comic book and should therefore have a weak character and strong flash. The idea that this film is a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of this fact. <br /> <br /> The comic source material, the REAL Origin of Wolverine ... is a story worth bringing to the screen. It does not pollute its past and does not treat the reader as mindless CGI junkies. It's a well-made story, and though she retells and hires over time, she started with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith. A much more intense and exciting story. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie should be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have this magic weapon? <br /> <br /> 4/10
