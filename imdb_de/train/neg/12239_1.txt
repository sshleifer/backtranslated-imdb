I am a big wrestling fan since I was eight. It did not matter which federation I watched. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me, the action is everything I've looked at. <br /> <br /> 23 May 1999. This was my 19th birthday. I ordered over the edge and just expected another pay per view. But this time. I was wrong. Instead, this was the night when one of Canada's best wrestlers came out. A true man fell to his death due to a failure. You can not do much to change the situation. But what happened after Owen's death made me crazy. <br /> <br /> Instead of ending the pay-per-view and doing the right thing as people, the WWE decided to protect what comes first, and that was the money by keeping that pay per view as if Owen's death had never happened. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decisions in his life, but this was by far the stupidest decision he ever made. <br /> <br /> And that crap saying Owen wanted the Pay-Pew view to go on. Give me a break. If someone dies on a payroll, you should know what he wants. It's like a policeman shooting a robber or a robber with a barrel and then just let the man die so he can go home and call a day as if the man's life never mattered. <br /> <br /> But no matter what happens Owen will be missed and many thanks for the memories you gave us.
