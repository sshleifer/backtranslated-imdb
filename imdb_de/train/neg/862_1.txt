'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon Dreamed Sins', is a tough get-together even in just under 76 minutes; more of that dreadfully boring and overbearing Euro horror triple and maybe I've gotten into a coma. Jess Franco once again delivers a really terrible piece of '60s garbage that apparently was made by a cast and crew. The crew robs Class A hallucinogenics of Class A, because no second of this mess made any sense at all. Apparently this is one of the better of his over 180 films? It is hard to believe that there are worse efforts. <br /> <br /> The unfathomable conspiracy deals with Franco's usual topics like sex, violence and lesbianism and casts a little S & M for a reason, and yet manages to stay anesthetically boring. <br /> <br /> I can wait a while before he enters the world of dodgy euro horror again? Life is too short to observe the bilges like this.
