I have not finished the movie yet. You can say that in this case I have no right to check it, especially negatively. But I only do it because I could not see it anymore because of me ... I was halfway over and I just came there, promising myself that something good was just around the corner. This movie is so tiring, so dull, that I was actually insulted. I have not read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teenagers who suffered from it, but I'm gay and have "similar" revelations, daydreams, problems, etc. There were maybe two moments where I actually thought that this film could go somewhere where I felt it could have meaning or relativity, but those hopes failed when the next set of clichéd narratives began. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you can not hear the scratchy rendition or the echo-eye disappears, if you only read the quotes because they are just too painful / ridiculous / stupid to overlook. I've given the film three stars, and all three of these stars go to the movie cameraman who did a fantastic job trying to turn Archer's tired "concepts" into something observable. Mind you, I pray he was not the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV close-ups ... another unnecessary cliché that's been made in movies like Korines Gummo ... I think it's extreme fitting that this film had its premiere at Sundance (just because Archer was in contact through volunteer work at the festival, by the way ...), because Sundance seems to be the only festival where such a cliché as this is still called "Arthouse" is accepted. No, it's not an art house, I'm afraid it's just a house. Do not look.
