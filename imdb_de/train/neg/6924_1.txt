If this movie were even worse, Uwe Boll would have directed. This nonsensical chaos makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It has been a while since I saw this steaming pile, but I remember that I wanted to inflict severe bodily harm on all involved. As everyone can give this movie more than a star, I am amazed at the mercy of all who have looked at this threesome. I give a star because there is no lower rating. All copies of this film should be incinerated on the salted ground and kept as a landfill for the most toxic waste. No, a copy should be kept with the utmost security and shown only to the filmmakers as an example of how this is not possible.
