Bought this movie in the bargain market at Rogers Video Store for $ 2. I enjoy a good B-movie from time to time and thought that looked like a good movie. <br /> <br /> The film is pretty clich√©d "1970's" and pretty groovy. Unfortunately, the plot is difficult to track and the movie does not do much. In fact, I switched it off after watching it for 45 minutes, and a week later, I thought I should watch it all, no matter how slow it was. <br /> <br /> The film has good spots but you have to wait and wait and wait ....... for you. <br /> <br /> If you're into B-movies, this may just be for you, but be warned that the movie is slow and not much is really happening, and have not I said much? <br /> <br />
