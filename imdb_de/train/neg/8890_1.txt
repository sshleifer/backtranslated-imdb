For my first impression of Shakespeare on stage, I can not believe what made these people to an absolutely good piece. <br /> <br /> -Let's start with the good part, shall we? - Alan Rickman is fine, although some of his dialogues were delivered with more feeling. The rest of the actors had to pull it together. Romeo, Romeo, why are not you dead, Romeo? The actor, though he was not only made of wood and wood, could not read his lines with all enthusiasm. He was completely out of focus, had difficulty even looking Juliet in the face, and absolutely no mercy on the lines that were given to him. Whoever throws it deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost passable, but she does not give depth to her character and seems completely out of touch with the game. Mercutio was incredibly scary and totally uncharacteristic of the entire dialogue. Benvolio was unfeeling and ruthlessly chopped off with his lines. <br /> <br /> I had to endure this half-baked production of Romeo and Juliet. The acting was stilted and the costumes were downright distracting. I have seen kindergarten puppetry games with more effort. I just wish I could rate this movie with zero.
