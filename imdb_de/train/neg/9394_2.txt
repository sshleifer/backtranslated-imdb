Oh man, how many series had fallen until 1952! This boring thing is exactly the kind of series Annie Wilkes (by Misery) has annoyed. Not only do the heroes avoid the traps by adding scenes that were not there in the previous chapter (and that may NOT be there) - tell me if the bad guys blow up the plane in the years 7 to 8, would not they see the characters jump), but I think this series has the world record of stock footage. I mean, most of it is stock footage! And not just from other series (apparently all the flying sequences of King of the Rocket Men, and the cool "Molten" scenes of Episode 2 to 3 come from Adventures of Captain Marvel), but of themselves! The entire "Journey to the Moon" (probably the shortest of all time, it's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave the Earth's atmosphere) from Episode 1 is repeated in Episode 8! And episode 10 contains ALL scenes from earlier episodes! (Ever wondered why MST3K never did episodes 10, 11 and 12. Well, they had to stop after 9 so they did not have to do anything!). <br /> <br /> Do not get me started on the science factor. Prepare to see the sunniest moon of all time! And moon people who can not breathe on their own world? What did they smoke? <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough, it's too talkative and the stunts (usually the best thing in series) are few. Am I the only one who thinks that the spherical helmet of Commando Cody (or is it a lemon shape) is completely ridiculous? The Rocketeer was a lot cooler, no matter how bad this movie was (and the man, it was awful). The tank-like vehicle is not much better, it looks like a few kids made it to Halloween. The only positive thing I can think about is that the actor who plays the hero is at home instead of the usual muscular guy (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But then he is so unappealing ... <br /> <br /> Not worth seeing, for the sake of nostalgia. See Captain Marvel instead. 10.2. <br /> <br /> (By the way, in the section "Memorable Quotes" you will find information on a real women's lib bead).
