No? Did not think so! Well, in that case, you just have to stay a long way from "Do You Want to Know A Secret," since it's just the umpteenth, pointless post-"scream" slasher that has absolutely no redeeming value. The plot is extremely ridiculous; The characters are unbearably stupid, the gore factor is negligible and the whole thing is just boring! As you can already deduce from the title, this movie is mainly inspired by "I still remember what you did last summer," as the events take place in a similar environment and the murderer's motivation is equally stupid. Why someone would like to steal ideas like "IKWYDLS" from garbage is a mystery to me anyway. At the very least, this film may depend on the precious rack of Jennifer Love Hewitt, while the girls in this trash are next to brainless and terribly unattractive. A year after the still unresolved murder of her friend Beth Morgan, her new adulterer, and four other ordinary college students, Florida is heading to Spring Break for a chic beach house. The killer has not moved the whole year, but now he follows the posse to Florida and begins to slaughter her while leaving the title message as a kind of business card. You really do not have to be a horror expert to quickly figure out which face is hidden behind the unspeakably ridiculous mask, and the authors' attempts to put you on the wrong track are downright embarrassing. Since the plot is so thin, the film is largely irrelevant, including the subplots regarding the incompetent police of Floridian and the "mysterious" FBI inspector, who appears to have a personal score. The murder happens inexplicably outside the screen (do not you hate it when that happens?), There are not even any unsatisfactory T & A that you can enjoy, and you'd better not bring me into the quality of the dialogues. If you suffer so much stupidity, you realize that the adorable spirit of the 80s hacker has disappeared forever.
