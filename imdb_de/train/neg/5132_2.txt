I learned about this movie because the Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On was there. Game On is a funny British sitcom that he apparently left because he wanted to get into Hollywood in this movie. He failed, thank goodness. <br /> <br /> The film is a very simple romantic comedy. Janeane Garofalo plays an ugly woman who discovers Ben Chaplin with her neighbor Uma Thurman ugly. The movie is just bad for many reasons. The storyline is incredibly predictable, from the slapstick bits open to the serious, muddy bits: this montage, where all three have fun, and then the photo bit. These two scenes made me flinch! Janeane's character is disgustingly arrogant (and her role as a stand-up comedienne and arch-feminist is also in real life). She claims the film is "anti-feminist," though it's actually only realistic. Men often look for personality. It is also interesting to notice her hypocrisy. She had been a feminist and comedian for years before assuming that role, and then suddenly decided that the movie was bad. I can imagine that she hated the idea and script of this movie before it was released, but she made sure she kept quiet so she could be paid for this travesty of a movie. I mean, come on! It was for heaven's sake! What this movie really was was anti-men, if that. It portrays men as dumb animals whose brains are in the groin while the men do stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman's character Noelle the British man every American girl finds sweet and Jamie Foxx is the one Chaplin's best black friend, and of course Foxx had to try to simulate his accent a few times. Is that the best the scriptwriters could develop? Damn, they've never done that before, except for every movie Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore made. There is also a really terrible telephone sex scene that is simply grotesque and proves how cheap the movie is. The other comments here all say that Janeane Garofalo is not ugly, but really beautiful. Um, did I watch the same movie as they were? She is certainly no eye-catcher and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightfully cast as ugly. Nevertheless, I can not see the charm of Uma Thurman: she looks boring and haggard. <br /> <br /> I guarantee three things to this movie, if you have never seen it before: <br /> <br /> You will know what the end will be; <br /> <br /> You will find that the sex scene of the phone is painfully embarrassing and; <br /> <br /> You will be bored after ten minutes /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
