Do not make bones about it. Much is wrong with this movie. It's all the way clich√©d, not funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start at the beginning: Characters. There's the boring, unfortunate guy - who gives Stiller another step in his boring, hapless type belt - the supposedly wild, but in fact just plain normal love interest - the Aniston plays well, but really did not need any effort to do that Jovial friend, and then the selection of stereotypes: an annoying daredevil from Australia, a self-assured Spaniard, etc. The plot: The beginning is a little unusual, but then it goes into the standard Any-movie style, with every action so predictable like your average knocking joke. The biggest problem was that Stiller's "development" of character really came from nothing - like an average school game, the authors knew where it started and where it ended, but did not have enough material to properly handle the middle bit to tell. After all, the alleged "jokes" were nothing more than heavily diluted versions of common sense of humor. There was a regular Chunder scene, sweaty fat men, etc. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the simple fact in this film is that learning the meaning of the word "shart" was the only good thing. Hamburg has really made a dog dinner here, and the sugar coating of Stiller and Aniston may have attracted the spectators, but the taste that remained at the end was just as rancid. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This movie may be terrible, but Aniston still chose a better movie between the Friends seasons than Kudrov's disgusting "Marci X".
