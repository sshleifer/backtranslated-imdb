SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you bring together a group of untalented people to make an "extreme" horror movie. Any kind of drama, production, story, FX etc. go out the window to create a "shock". Do not get me wrong now - I consider myself a connoisseur of "shock" movies, and the sloppier / greedy / vicious the better - but it's still nice to see some SOMEONE talent in the film. <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC tells the story of Harry Russo - a drug addict freak show commissioned to kill Rubberneck from his ventriloquist dummy. He makes a few screams, kills Hookers and other random people and screams how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (that's "whores" for those of you who do not speak New York-ese ...) and how he likes rape her in the ass. There are a few faint necrophilia scenes, little gore and some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing you have not seen in a better movie ... <br /> <br /> The only redeeming thing about it I can find the often (unintentionally?) Funny screams of our Captain Harry in this backward movie. He's always trying to kill everyone and screw them in the ass, and after a while it gets really weird. In fact, I'm almost tempted to believe that there should be a kind of homo-erotic undertone in this film, with all the ass talk and constant shots of Harry as he walks around with his dong. To be honest, this joker is more icky in this movie than the few chicks that show some T-and-A (and some full-frontal models). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is a bit amusing as a one-time clock, but I can only really recommend this to those who want to say that they've seen a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER. To be honest - the title is by far the best thing about this garbage ... A generous 3.5 / 10
