I can just understand why some people would like to emphasize the connection of this movie with the eighties, but I would not say that this is an accurate portrayal of most people's lives during this time - even in the poorest Bradford homes. However, it is typical of the blunt agitprop trash that the old Royal Court Theater had stirred up back then. There are many "correct" art skills for small and small audiences, but sufficiently well networked setbacks to ensure future commissions for frolicsome playing rights. The simple fact is that if you want to think about the more true experience, you will find millions of other people who know that you agree to love and live, as depicted in 'Gregory's Girl'. <br /> <br /> I would be tempted to call this a "kitchen sink" drama, but that would do great harm to the plumbing industry. As for a decent script, this movie is indeed all washed up. For some reason, Guardian has a strange following when it reads movie-goers - I can only assume that they get a visual mess when they pretend they're in the slums. Control my friends. It's a bad movie with a bad script that likes to think that it crosses borders by adding humorous insights into the dismal life of the booths. it is not .. but it is grim. Wipe instead.
