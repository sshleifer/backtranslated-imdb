He pulled the guys out of his butt! That's a parody, right ?! Nobody really writes that it's just as if improvisation went terribly wrong. I think somehow. This movie has to be a parody, because who else would say that he wrote the script? Can anyone imagine the entire cast standing around as the director and writers go over the storyboard? <br /> <br /> The director says, "Next, our inbred rogue uses his 24-inch machete to undress our weird neighbor, pulling the guts out of his bunghole" <br /> <br /> "Brilliant! "proclaimed the whole cast. <br /> <br /> This can not happen, nobody writes so stupid! I have to be a parody. <br /> <br /> I loved the part in which the meager introspective beats down the inbred freak with the cast-iron pan she finds on the floor of the cave. I was not sure if the Inbred cannibal types wanted to cook a lot. Perhaps this explains why the pan lay on the ground at just the right moment to kill the deformed hull. It seems ironic that after the crazy guy outbid martial arts experts with a porno queen and a few door knockers, he falls so easily into the frying pan of a slender defenseless girl next door. <br /> <br /> What the hell is the Richard Greco guy doing here? Did he fire his agent or something? <br /> <br /> Can someone please explain the end to me, because I did not get it either? I can not quite understand why the cute hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who made her tea. Anyway, I do not want to know.
