I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I have ever seen. I would recommend this animation to people younger than 5 years old. I liked this show at the age of 4 and 5 years. I only saw her when there was nothing to see. Now I'm the other 5 and would rather do my homework than look at me. The cartoon used to be a bit funny, but they were not enough to make me laugh. Now I am older and interested in the show that does not rate us. I started seeing Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in things I have to do with Doctor Who, so I'm not interested in 5-year cartoons. This cartoon did not last long, he had only 6 squadrons, he was canceled because he had only a few spectators. However, some people say that the authors run out of ideas, but for most other shows there are at least 8 seasons.
