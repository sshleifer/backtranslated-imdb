What the audience will remember the most is the strong headache caused by the too flashy, shaky camera work and the quick, confusing cut. I am not against such stylistic devices when, like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh, they are done right with most of their films, but in that case there was way too much. It seems that the jumps and flashes of light that accompanied every flight over Mexico City and every important scene, lead you to distract you from the fact that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing will end. For a movie that claims to be violent, ruthless, and morally corrupt, it's inexcusable that its story was told so often and with much more depth and character development. That's another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to see an over-the-action movie, I do not need a justification, but this film tried to justify the murder of Denzel Washington's character, and he barely managed to perform credibly. Not much happens in the first half hour, except that stupid archetypes and clich√©s are depicted. When the action machine starts to roll it gets cut so fast that you do not know what's really going on. The film does not work on the level of a credible drama / thriller nor as a pure action movie. Of course, the movie is not as bad as some of the blockbuster blockbusters of the last few years, but I can not understand why so many people claim that this movie is something new and cool. It's way too long for a video clip, and it's not enough substance for a movie.
