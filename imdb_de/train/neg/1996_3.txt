This sad little movie bears little resemblance to the 1971 Broadway revival, which was such a nostalgic hit. Remember that Burt Shevelove detailed the book as he led the revival. I have the feeling that this screenwriter has changed just as much from the original version of 1925. I played the "innocent philanderer" Jimmy Smith on stage in 1974 and thought this $ 1 DVD would bring back memories. No chance. Even the anticipated joy of seeing "topper" Roland Young as "my" character was a big disappointment. Three songs from the piece are preserved and played very badly. Even the classic duet "Tea For Two" is a virtual solo. The many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco do not make one proud, and the star Anna Neagle is simply embarrassed. If I feel corrupted by spending a dollar, I know the movie must be bad. Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version, which is actually called "Tea For Two" and is about the stage play (of course the original), so those who are looking for the true "No No Nanette" may find a more recognizable version there.
