I totally and confidently agree with the user who calls this "parody". Crispin Glover is very serious with his movie. He personally introduced the film to the show in Chicago. He worked on the film for years and it's the first in a planned trilogy. "What is it?" It's Crispin Glover's attempt to make an art film in the style of those he idolized by Herzog, Lynch, etc. crispy Glover. "When it finally came out, I watched the trailer online, read the summary, and foamed with anticipation to Chicago to see it, and it was a big disappointment, if he takes out the bastard like the smoking granny and the dancing dolls, he'll have something better left, but only for about 10 minutes, in other words just look at the trailer There are some remarkable pictures and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases whose lack of focus is disappointing.
