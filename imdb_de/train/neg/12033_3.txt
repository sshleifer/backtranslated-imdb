Film about a small town with the same number of Mormons and Baptists. New family moves in, leading the over-scripted dialogue, mediocre acting, green jello salad with shredded carrots, and every other "Mormon joke" you know. Anyone outside of the Mormon culture will find it hard to endure this film. Everyone in the Mormon culture is slightly amused here and there with a giggle. It is much better if you look at the other films by Hess (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.), rather than prevail. Acting is mediocre. Jared Hess already had a lot more quality films like "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite" in his hands. I would recommend both movies about this groaning.
