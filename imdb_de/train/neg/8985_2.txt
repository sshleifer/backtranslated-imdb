Earlier comments encouraged me to review this when it came to TCM, but it was a deep disappointment. Magnifying glass Valdez is great, but does not get enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play familiar but promising characters, but the script leaves them stranded. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the ego of Lee Tracy, who is at best selfish, physically and verbally abusive. The reactions of the "audience" are poorly thought out and unbelievable, so that the "Shenanigans" seem like an invention of a bad writer. And it hurts that the character of Lupe Velez could lapse into him. <br /> <br /> The "piercing monliners" mentioned in another review have to be observer dependent, as I did not even notice this attempt was made.
