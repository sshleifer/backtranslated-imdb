Not the best movies you see today. I read a lot of reviews about Shining and expected it to be very good. But this movie has disappointed me. The sound and surroundings were good, but there was no history here. There was not a single moment of horror. I was expecting a horror thriller movie, but there was no horror, no thriller. The only scene I got scared of was "Wednesday" during the chapter change scene. There are many fragments in the movie. Most things are not explained and there is nothing that connects them to anything. The story does not tell us about the women or other scenes being shown. A good movie in the 80s, but not for the 21st century.
