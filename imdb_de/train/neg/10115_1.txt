I have made it my personal mission to find those responsible for this film. I even got the rental company to give me back my money because I argued that they had done false advertising. <br /> <br /> It's not enough that the movie itself is a movie, but the cover picture sold me. I made better make-up effects for my kids on Halloween than in the movie and not in the cover. Can you say "raccoon eyes"? <br /> <br /> I will not waste any more time with the detail, but come on, the main character of the film is an LA policeman who was born growing up in Alabama - but has a German accent!?! It is more than offensive.
