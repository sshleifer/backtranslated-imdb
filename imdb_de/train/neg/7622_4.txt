One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually bound to enjoy the least responsive films in the TCM library, as this would praise the "virtues" of this "charming" film during its launch, as I did saw in cable TV. Since every old movie on IMDb is considered "classic" by a number of moody amateur reviewers, I thought it was imperative to review that movie more honestly. <br /> <br /> This is not your father's. "Shop around the corner." For all my problems with "You've Got Mail," this remake is outshone in almost every possible way, and for those who have seen the original, the flaws will only be more obvious /> <br /> One of the lankest Meet Cute sequences I can remember (a sad slapstick attempt at "humor"), this movie is on the wrong foot and never really gets back into the game. This "musical" is only one in the strictest sense of the word, with a plethora of instantly forgotten musical numbers, and then Judy sings "I Do not Care" as she beats her arms like in a fit Miss Garland has been wonderful in a number of music films, but here she seems to be terribly wrong, the role was originally occupied by June Allyson, and Judy is definitely notable to fill the shoes of Margaret Sullavan's old part. Van Johnson also appears as a second-rate Jimmy Stewart guy. The leads never reach the chemistry of Stewart / Sullavan or even Hanks / Ryan. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that knows (some) the notes, but not the music. It does not seem to really understand why the original works, and even feels the need to add another possible love interest in Van Johnson's character to complicate matters unnecessarily. The remake replaces the infidelity of the infidelity of the original with a plotter device containing a priceless violin. It is almost embarrassing to look and feel as if it might have been picked up by someone with a DeLorean and a flow capacitor from an episode of Three's Company. It's really just an excuse for a Keaton Pratfall. Even the big dissolution scene between the romantic leads is maltreated. After watching both movies you will understand why they called "Lubitsch Touch" and NOT "Robert Z. Leonard Touch". <br /> <br /> Avoid this and watch either the original film or one of Judy Garland's earlier films, unless you are an iconoclastic who enjoys dropping a once-great star on earth see.
