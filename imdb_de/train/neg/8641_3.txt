Grand Central Murder (1942) Director: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This mediocre "B" riddle was one of only five films made in 1942 with Simon as the Director were published. Surely he could have added one or two more Red Skelton movies to his program! In any case, Grand Central Murder is a shameless rip-off of Thin Man films without the wit, charm and chemistry of the leads. We are treated by a paper-thin plot that can hardly stand its 73 minutes, bad acting and tired gags. Van Heflin and Virginia Gray play Nick and Nora Charer, Rocky and Butch Custer. He is a PI and she is his wife and partner. They get involved in "humorous" skirmishes. See? It is very different. Heflin is the only one here who points to bigger and better things, even though he's almost an idiot. Virginia Gray was in another thin man, but let me emphasize again: THIS MOVIE IS NEVER LIKE THIS, no, sir. And in the event that we think this movie has absolutely nothing to do with another movie (like THE THIN MAN) that we actually like, Sam Levene appears as a senior detective who is somehow weak and forced by Van Heflin to guide him subtly to him all the important clues. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Quick is the "murder" of the kids Mida King, who likes to trade rich men until she finds an even richer one. It is played by Patricia Dane, which is like a C version of Hedy Lamarr, until she opens her mouth and turns into an F. There are quite a few crazy suspects who all have their own motivation to see Mida dead. There's the social type, the hard-talking ladies, the thug, the ex-lover and a dodgy theater impresario (Tom Conway, saddled here with the unusual character name "Frankie Ciro"). Roman Bohnen plays a nervous, nervous guy, which I think he may have done before. Millard Mitchell plays an idiot cop who can not stop thinking of the ass he's waiting for him in an on-going gag that never stops (once that's the case, Millard Mitchell, swordsman). In a completely groundbreaking method of storytelling that we've never seen before, all the suspects are gathered in one place where they tell the detective their stories (as flashbacks) while Rocky makes mental notes until finally the one guilty person is forced to blow a confession dramatically. <br /> <br /> In addition to the actual picture, which is a dud, I naively thought that there are a few site shots of the actual Grand of 1942 Central, but unfortunately not. There is only a very short shot at the beginning. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder. To sum it up, a bit formulaic, but Heflin was okay. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of 4
