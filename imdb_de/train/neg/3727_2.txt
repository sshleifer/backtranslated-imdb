Written and played by sincere amateurs produced by some exploiters, this is boring and hard to see. <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie ever, but at least Schlock like _Plan 9 From Outer Space usually had a real actor or two. I would recommend _A Thief In The Night only hardcore ironists and hardcore dispensationalists. I am not one. <br /> <br /> Do not believe me? Watch the video for free (though it comes from a poor VHS): http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night <br /> <br /> Relevant links, mainly added to reach the 10-line of IMDb Minimum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se- a /
