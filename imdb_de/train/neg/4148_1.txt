I took this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. But I had no idea what I was getting into. <br /> <br /> I started the movie and soon found myself in a world of pain and visual torture. <br /> <br /> I finally know How the hell is? It is this movie. For eternity. This movie has no value. It did not even have an act. There was something going on in every scene, but there was no general explanation for why something happened. Instead of watching this movie, I suggest you oil the next blender and stuff as many balls as you can. You will find that the result is far more pleasant than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even watch the movie. Not even to see how bad it is. I beg you. If you see it, it means they win.
