Pretty horrible but worth seeing and entertaining. It's the same old story (if you lived through the 80s). Vietnamese veterinarians fight together as a mate against injustice in the States. A-Team meets Death Wish, my favorite! <br /> <br /> Time goes on, the soldiers go home and years later a friend is in trouble. No, wait - the friend is actually dead and his father is in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is killed by an extremely cruel (super-sharp) meat-thumper as he tries to defend his father's small shop from the local "guards", even though he's wheelchair-bound from the war. Desperate for help, the father talks to Sarge, the leader of Joey's old unit from Vietnam, when Sarge shows up for the funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, the squeaky wheel gets fat and the old group saddles up for the city. You can imagine the rest of the movie pretty well. <br /> <br /> The one thing that drives me crazy is that Sarge is busy planning his men and how they are really good at what they do when they plan ahead. But Joey would not have been wheeled by a shot in Vietnam if the unit had not messed up! When things get really good in the city, when they fight the gangs, they do it again. For no reason they bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present. Phh !!!! I raise my hands in disgust. Stupidity! <br /> <br /> There is also a suspicious moment in which all members of the unit present are keen to try the heroin, which they snatch from the gang to make sure it's real. Every single one of them. Hmm .... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? Look on, I think. The movie is not too horrible to watch, but he is curious. There are all those climatic moments when nothing really happens. The most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the film - the explosives in Vietnam, Joey's death fight and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear out (poor teddy!). <br /> <br /> I guess my main meat in this movie is that I feel disappointed. Even the confusing subplots of "Mystery Helpers" and their bizarre basic motives were not enough to save it. But eventually everything will be fine and they will do a sequel. Ha ha ha ha !!!
