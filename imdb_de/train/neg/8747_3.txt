AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut out her best scenes. In the scenes she plays in, she is just a zombie. She is involved in a negotiation similar to a negotiation in "Get Carter," but she treats the negotiation in "Get Carter" better. (I blame the director) The director's tribute to Hitchcock was trite. (It's the scene where Ryan Philippe's character realizes that he may not trust Tim Robbins character, at least I think that this is a tribute to Hitchcock.) The DVD shows the scenes cut out, I think the director should use his instincts and trust his trust Do not listen to the test audience.
