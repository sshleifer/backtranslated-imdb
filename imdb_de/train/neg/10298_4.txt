Lynne Ramsey makes arresting pictures and Samantha Morton can make a gesture with a gesture. What an urge to discover their talents was wasting them on that kind, overbearing lark. <br /> <br /> Ramsey can not bring Callar to life. Her attempts are too artistic and oblique. Time and again, her camera lingers in long, silent settings of the agonizing actress, as if Morton's extinguished gaze alone could give character. We are in an empty, selfless Warhol hell: for a movie that only lasts minutes, when bugs crawl across the floor, you might think he could work out his protagonists. But how is it supposed to work when she rarely speaks? Without the inner monologue of the novel, the celluloid Morvern Callar is nobody. No wonder Ramsey has often undressed Morton. <br /> <br /> So, the first ten minutes were so impressively played, filmed and edited that my hopes skyrocketed. Give the movie so much: He can make promises, if not, how he holds them.
