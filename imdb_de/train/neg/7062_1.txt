OK, impossible, frankly, the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> That made absolutely no sense, there was no plot, no characterization, no acting, just nothing. <br /> <br /> Here's what I thought when I saw it for the first time on May 28, 2003 ** Careful, this is a spoiler alert. I also complain about how bad the movie is :: <br /> <br /> Ok, so the movie starts and the characters are introduced, but there is no explanation for the characters. As far as I knew, the main character in this school was new, but apparently not. it also seemed that he lived alone ... then he was a foster child ... then his mother was a raging alcoholic who still lived with him. Also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived alone. <br /> <br /> Now we come to a main point, this insane guy has leaked out of the madhouse and runs away rampant. Now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focuses on him for the eventuality of the movie. I think I've missed a major element of the plot here, there was no reason why the main character should become addicted. Even when it comes to having no reason why follow all his friends, who are skeptical like 5 minutes ago, suddenly and do what he wants. <br /> <br /> So the movie goes on and he gets it well. They make mess in school, blah blah blah. But wait ... suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the show here. Wait a second. Did not the madman of the main character say explicitly that she should NOT do that? It should be something. <br /> <br /> ah, another important element was skipped ... the madman should not be crazy ... everyone said he was not crazy. But as the story goes on, he is very clear from his mind. But I thought the news people said he was not ... hm ... <br /> <br /> Now the movie is coming to an end. THAT WAS NEAR? WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? Not only the end answered no questions about the main character, it also answered no questions about the mentally ill. Are these people in the same situation? If so, then there are some basic stories that do not tend to. If not, what's the point of saying "this is you in two weeks"? <br /> <br /> * End of story ... * <br /> <br /> that's what I thought then. that's pretty much what I think now. It's 6 months later, and if I can get it for free, maybe I would give it a try, but I doubt it. I strongly doubt it.
