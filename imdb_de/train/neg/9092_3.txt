Friz Freleng's "Speedy Gonzalez" was the second animated cartoon to feature the title character after Robert McKimson's "Cat-tails for Two". In this cartoon, Speedy was an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth, but on his second appearance, the famous design was already taken over. Although he looked much nicer, Speedy never became a great character. A big hat, tremendous speed, and a bad Mexican accent do not make a classic character, and that's about all Speedy has ever had for him. Even so, the cocky little mouse proved extremely popular and starred in many short films, including some really lousy late-day movies from the studio. While these early Speedy shorts are better than the later atrocities that he's often (oddly) paired with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired and rely on predictable gags, usually on a similar Chase formula based. In this self-titled episode, Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheeses from the local factory, which happens to be guarded by Sylvester the cat. Though adding weight to the cartoon, Sylvester's role here might as well be filled by every other generic cartoon cat. His personality is undermined by the penetration into the foreseeable. undemanding role of the pursuer. This has always been a problem in the Tweety cartoons as well, but Speedy is still a grim opponent, thanks to his vile arrogance and the apparent impossibility of capturing him. Poor old Sylvester would have to appear next to Speedy for many years. 'Speedy Gonzalez' won an Oscar and an absolutely undeserved star was born.
