Certainly, no TV show was made so bad on Saturday morning. These producers had to rely on the audience coming back. Well, in this terrible offer they could at least count the money they had saved on sets. The script could have been a rejection of a long forgotten space opera series, with a few smarmy lines for the cool guy Gerald Mohr mumbling to Naura Hayden. No director could have done something decent with such a crazy plot, so the action is boring. The spaceship props are absurd - for example, a Bulova wall clock and a portable typewriter - but the planetary gear sets are among the worst in film history. Most are rough drawings, and everything is dipped in an often false red light. Even Mohr's bare hairy chest serves as a prop. And it's bad - as thin as the plot. Any viewer who makes it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians - and will probably agree completely!
