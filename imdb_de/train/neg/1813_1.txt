If someone wants to make a really REALLY bad movie, "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" really sets a standard by which to measure the depth of badness Main character ... A poor guy in a white "furry" costume who looks as if it were sewn together from discarded pieces of carpet. Work slowly, painfully, through not-so-special effects that thoroughly discourage the observer from the attitude of unbelief. Add a garden gnome (just to hell). <br /> <br /> Skip the movie completely at the second thought and find something else for an hour and a half.
