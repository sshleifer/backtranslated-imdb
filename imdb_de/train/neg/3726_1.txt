I was forced to watch this whole series of movies as a kid, and I was told that they are REAL! Talk about child abuse. I would have been less afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculousness and want to make their children believe the same. In addition to the obvious problems of brainwashing and indoctrination, there is also bad acting, bad writing and bad "special effects". It's just horrible, horrible movies. Yes, believable (and horrible) for a child, but I can not imagine an adult buying into that crap. However, I have to say that I would like to see her as an adult today. You may have some midnight / cult movie feeling.
