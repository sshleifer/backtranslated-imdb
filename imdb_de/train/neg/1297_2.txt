Basically, I picked up this movie because I saw Kitano Takashi's brilliant remake of Zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai story that included Asano Tadanobu. These two films are worlds. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his characters, infiltrating traditional samurai clich√©s. Gojoe goes from the deep end in the other direction. <br /> <br /> First, I hate movies that have other characters that tell the audience what the main character looks like instead of the character developing as the movie progresses. "You can not decide whether you're a monk or a warrior," says almost every character in Benkei's presence, but this inner turmoil is rarely conveyed within the character itself. Instead of character development, we get bloated, boring, bloody fight scenes. Asano's character is undeveloped and even he looks like he's bored and does not know what he's doing. I know he usually looks distant and cool and that's part of Asano's charm, but this movie does not serve him. <br /> <br /> Many of the camera moves are disgusting. There is a scene that goes on forever, with the camera spinning around the main characters until my wife and I vomit. The end is ridiculous and rather anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that in Japan today, not really good Samurai films are made on this budget. The colors, the scenery and the costumes were great, but the rest is just a long waste of time. I'd rather see one of the Kabuki versions of this myth.
