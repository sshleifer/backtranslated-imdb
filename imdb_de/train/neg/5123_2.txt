Interestingly enough, 90% of the highly rated ratings from "* random username *" consist of "United States" (no state pride ??), all more or less the same with the same grammatical style, all with the same lack of taste in movies , I would further deepen this suspicious trend, but unfortunately this is a review of the movie and not the reviews itself. <br /> <br /> Let me first say that I am both a Christian and a true enthusiastic Movie is fan. This means that I've seen a lot of movies, from good to bad. I can say with all my heart that Facing The Giants is not really a good movie. It has good intentions, but does not meet many (if any) basic standards that I associate with a high-quality film-making experience. <br /> <br /> The Acting: Mostly terrible, tasty. To hear that most of them seemed to be volunteers does not surprise me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue: awkward, cheesy, the script appears as a long version of kitschy sketch that you would see in Sunday school or in youth group function. The rave review robots indulge in the absence of "meaningless words," but the cold, hard truth is that such words are part of the real world and the total absence of these words is tangible. Let's just say that the mean old head coach of a team has a lot more to say in a state championship game than "OH NO!" When things do not go to his taste. <br /> <br /> The Plot: Mindbogglingly predictable. It has been commented that this film is "not a Hollywood clich√©", and yet it is as if it had been pulled directly from Making An Underdog Sports Movie for Dummies (including the obligatory quasi-romantic subplot for the ladies) and just had a Christian theme coat of paint struck on it. I do not lie or boast when I say that I have defined almost every important detail in the plot and subplot immediately after its introduction. Only someone who has never seen a respectable sports movie in his life would be emotionally moved by the story presented here. <br /> <br /> The Directing / Editing: Also this was almost exactly patterned after the generic Underdog Sports movie template Besides that, there were not many noticeable blunders, so at least Facing The Giants was technically competent. <br /> <br /> The message: Ask Jesus and He will fulfill all your wishes. Part of me hoped that this film would end with the possible defeat of the team to highlight the entire "If We Lose, We Praise You" section, because in the real world you will fail at one point or another and it is good to prepare for it. But in the world of Facing The Giants, if you fail, obviously someone has made a mistake or is cheating. Another interesting question was: what if the Eagles found another team that had gotten religion? Would they be in an endless loop of miracles and last minute savings, or would the universe simply explode? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: For the conservative hardcore fans of Christian Parents, who complain about the evils of Hollywood, Facing The Giants is another mediocre best Christian movie that makes a podium as a preferred model of modernity film , For everyone else, the effects of boredom extend to the burning desire to see something different. And a warning: Any attempt to show this to non-Christians does not lead to conversion, but to ridicule. I give two stars, one for the one scene where I did not roll my eyes, and another for low-budget technical skills.
