Somewhere between the food court and Zip's, the mall has an explosives store in this movie. This is the only place the title character <br /> <br /> can buy the bomb he plants in the mall in a boring finale. <br /> <br /> A fictional city has a new shopping center that was built on a land that was <br /> <br /> convicted. Cute Girl (I did not understand her name) gets a job there as a <br /> waitress. She has lost her boyfriend by a fire in the place where the mall is <br /> <br />. The rogue owner hires the fire-fighter responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first guard is dead <br /> <br />. Rob Estes, eons of "Silk Stalkings", is a <br /> <br /> photog / reporter trying to find a story. He teamed up with Cute Girl, <br /> <br /> and her friendly "funny" friend Pauly Shore, to find out if Eric <br /> <br /> is still alive. He lives in the basement of the mall (?) And travels through the air ducts, addressing other people who annoy his ex-girlfriend, including the arsonists. At some point he abducts her <br /> <br /> and the finale includes the bomb and all those running from the <br /> <br /> scene in front of the big Kablooey. Morgan Fairchild is a mayor for the <br /> <br /> ride ... yes, she is mayor. <br /> <br /> Of course you did not need a plot sketch since the whole story. <br /> History is in the title. Someone named Eric takes revenge on <br /> <br /> people as a phantom of a shopping mall. This also means that there is no <br /> <br /> tension. We know that Eric is behind it, but we still have to see that Estes and Cute Girl go through the motions of a stupid investigation. See how Fairchild, who we know, has been captive with the <br /> mall owner all the time, pulling a gun at our heroic duo in the middle of a crowded party, but nobody says so Word, while she leads her to her <br /> <br /> office and to her later death. The fictitious city is huge and yet there is hardly a policeman in the office, everyone relies on the security of the mall to bring order. Eric is hiding since the construction of the mall, but I'm not sure <br /> <br /> where. He seems to live in a basement area, but you'd think a construction worker would have found him. He set up his love pad pretty well and found a few outlets because he has electricity. It could be more beautiful than your own apartment! <br /> <br /> Pauly Shore fans, both of you, take note. He tows a security guard out of his cabin by shading the camera. Yeah, stop scanning <br /> <br /> Celebrity Skin and Playgirl, here's a grainy black and white shot of Pauly's South Shore, though not a joker. <Br /> <br /> This is just garbage and a positive proof that I am only renting something from the video library to stay in the horror department. This <br /> <br /> movie is not Eric's revenge, it's the filmmaker's revenge for me to <br /> be so stupid as to look at him. Here is my revenge: I do not recommend it. That will show you! <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, for some violence, for Gore, for some profanity, for some female nudity, for short male nudity. and some <br /> <br /> sexual content.
