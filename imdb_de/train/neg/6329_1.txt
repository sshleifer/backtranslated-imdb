I saw this cinematic misery in 1979 with a friend in a dollar theater (back in the days when the tickets were actually sold for $ 1). This is the only movie I've ever seen (with my friend while the idiocy was the "Laser Bra 2000" sketch on the canvas). Obviously, the reaction of my friend and friend to the movie was common. It was not that I found the movie offensive (either 18 years old or now), but rather that he is stupidly stupid and seemingly insatiable, even without the unintended humor that makes an Ed Wood movie observable. This is the real reason why NBC declined to air it instead of understanding Mr. Mike's "vision" (unless, of course, his vision was to bankrupt the film's financiers). <br /> <br /> I'm still surprised that this movie did not seem to have a list of the "10 Worst Films Ever". It certainly makes mine. You were warned.
