Feeding The Masses was just another movie trying to make some money from the zombie craze, mainly because of the popularity of Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts with a television station guarded by the military and reports that the Lazarus virus (zombies) is nearing curbs and the city can soon return to business. The problem is, that's completely wrong. Zombies are running wild and only a small minority of people are aware of it. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), the cameraman, Sherry (Rachael Morris), the main anchor woman (who for some reason plays Shelly on this site) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), her military escort. Torch and Sherry do not reject people, but the station is run by a secret service (or other government agency) and they are heavily censored. <br /> <br /> This film slaps itself on its back. The cover page states: "We hold MASSES FEEDING at a higher level than all three" The Dead "films by George A. Rombero." The source of this quote has lost ALL credibility with me. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that this movie is bad. I mean not bad, as if I expected more (I was, of course), but I mean bad, because I could find no redeeming qualities in the film, anyway. Those acting in all parts are either over or too wooden. Has anyone remembered their lines or did they read cue cards? I can not imagine what the best part of the movie or the best actor / actress was. There really was not one. If I had to nod somebody, I'd say, Roger, the Military Escort was probably the most interesting character, but that does not really say much. <br /> <br /> I would recommend sharing this movie, although the boxing cover looks pretty good (that's what attracted me to the movie originally). 3.10
