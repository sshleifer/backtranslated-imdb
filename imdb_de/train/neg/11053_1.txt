This is one of those "so bad that it's good" movies you always hear about, but never see! Unlike Troma movies, which are deliberately bad and pugnacious (and I'm not amused), this movie is 100% serious. <br /> <br /> However, with features like a supposedly super-lethal killer robot that expresses like one the Solid Gold Dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate who calls the lightning and turns into the good witch of the East the fact that he takes himself seriously, so far beyond the edge of evil that he is back in the circle entertaining. <br /> <br /> That's enough to see.
