My wife and I started watching this movie with anticipation. It looked warm and touching. It started well; but soon became boring and frankly idiotic. It got so bad that we turned it off. The film was poorly played and honesty, we could not really understand or want to understand why exactly or why they could endure this woman! You have lost the compassion for her after she was rude and was crazy singer and cleaner. I would have committed it. And of course, like most movies and TV shows made in Hollywood, we have to cast a gay gay character! This movie was boring. I expected more from Diane Keaton!
