There's only one use for a movie like Bulletproof: It reminds you how bad can be bad. We often see films we call "pretty dreadful" or "not very good," but then you come across a movie like this and you can see that, although all the other films are not "good," they are not Smelly are bad as bulletproof. This was a birthday present from someone who had spent less than two seconds browsing through the DVD collection box at our local grocery store to make a commitment (ie to make a gift to Me). It may have been a coincidental discovery, but it was not so: it's so cliched, so poorly written, so badly directed, so bad that I'm surprised that all those involved have not been arrested and imprisoned for ten years. God, it's terrible. I suspected it would take about 30 seconds, but it kept going because sometimes - sometimes - bad movies are so bad that they can be fun. This is not one of them. It's just bad. After 45 minutes I stopped watching and tomorrow I will throw it in the bin.
