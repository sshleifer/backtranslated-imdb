Great Western I hear you all say! Brilliant first attempt! I'm not sure which movie you all saw, but it must have been different from the one I saw. Big Western or really good movies of all genres have characters you can believe in, and this movie had none! The acting was to say the least bad and I could not care for one of the characters, which made the whole movie pointless. The story was too big for the makers, and maybe they should try their hand at making low-budget garbage right in front of the TV, as you can see in the "FACT OR FICTION" programs on science fiction looking for a good one Movie, a great western or just an hour and a half. Please look elsewhere.
