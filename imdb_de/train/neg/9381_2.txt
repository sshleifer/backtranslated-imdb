Mona the vagabond lives on the edge of French society in a life without meaning, purpose and direction. <br /> <br /> I saw this for all the excellent reviews, but I'm afraid I missed something. The character of Mona has little or no personality as he drifts through life, being rude to people, becoming high and contributing nothing to another's life. She is not interesting or exciting. It is just useless. <br /> <br /> I've seen and known enough people: There's no secret meaning to what they do. You are just lazy bum. I do not want Mona to be around, stealing everything that is not nailed down, and abandoning her friends. Sure, she's puzzling - because nothing happens to her. Many junkies, winos and bums that I've ever seen are puzzling. I do not want to see a movie about her either. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is something that I totally missed. Otherwise, I assume all the reviews come from people who assume everything that is done by a French director is art.
