I saw this movie in an early preview and I can not stress enough how badly I thought this movie was. From the beginning, the audience groaned over Pacino's terrible southern accent. Poor Al looked very, really lean, and I can not decide if this was intentionally part of his role as a drug addict publicist or if he just did not sleep before he got to the set. Much worse than Pacino's close-ups, however, is the miserable apology for a plot. At the beginning of the movie, we get hints that Pacino's character is gay, and I suspect that the script writer originally intended it. Later, however, we should lift our incredulity and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both sleepy by lazy roles) crave this older, half-dead-looking man with the ridiculous accent. The worst part of it all was the mainstream thread that had to do with corporate espionage that is never fully explained and never cared for us at all. Since this was a preview, I will reserve my final judgment as it is possible to re-shoot and edit the recordings, but you can bet I will not pay a dime to see it in theaters.
