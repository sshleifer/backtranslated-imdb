I just made it through an episode ("Crouch End"). The dialogue was stilted and stretched to the right. The spectacle was tragic. Eion Bailey remains largely flat despite his best attempts to be dramatic. His eyebrows indicate a recent Botox treatment. Claire Forlani could as well have played the girl in distress in a silent movie. The characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotypical tooth in the storyline, mostly a random, meandering plot. Cheesy special effects can be excused in view of the budget of the TV miniseries. But attempts to create excitement and surprise through distracting cinematography contributed to its unsurpassability. I feel that the end should be funny and surprising, but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare the overall quality with something else, I would equate this episode of "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" with the Hercules of the NBC.
