This movie looked good - good cast, evergreen theme and explosive opening. From there it went downhill. Why was it taken with a handheld camera? It shakes, shakes, captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer. A bad choice. As if that were not enough, the worst editing in memory requires an observer - obligatory if you even want to enjoy it. And then it commits the worst sin of all. After the viewer has shut down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to exhaustion, they roll loans without showing the demarcation - the end - of the payout. How can you succeed with thrillers without end? Doh! This movie had great promise and ended up making a face plant in the mud. What a waste of effort. Low effort by writer and director.
