I'm not going to spend a lot of time doing that, because in my opinion it's not really a movie, just an imprudent mish-mash of borrowed material and embarrassing amateur new material made exclusively for the movie's purpose to put all the mess together and call it one "Boogeyman" episode. Literally, 80% of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor, "The Boogeyman," a movie that the authors of this trash apparently did not even look at because they could not even get the name of actress Suzanna Love (Lacy). Law. And to make the injury even worse, the killer is not visible in the original material and visible in the new material. Apparently they think the audience is just as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10, and I wish IMDb's rating system would be so low, the callous and most blatant attempt to rip off the money from people I've ever seen. YOU HAVE WARNING!
