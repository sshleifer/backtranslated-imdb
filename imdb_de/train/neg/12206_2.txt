I see no reason to describe this film in detail. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, author and survivor of A Season in Hell. He was recruited from prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to secretly return to Vietnam to take pictures of the American prisoners who are believed to still be held in terrible incarceration camps and return without to attack the enemy. <br /> <br /> Fat chance. What if he did nothing but sneak in, take pictures and sneak out? Who would watch the movie? <br /> <br /> It's essentially a celebration of Stallone's muscles. As we prepare for his mission, we see his well-oiled muscles bounce. (They are oiled and bounce everywhere.) There is the ritualistic donning of black leather, ugly weapons, and even ugly knives. The black guns are cleaned, put together with loud clacks and almost as oiled as Stallone's muscles. The bow is tested and has enough poundage to hit a bolt through the forehead of an opponent. The knife is sharpened with smooth snicks. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of his POWs will be betrayed by one or two suits from Washington, cynical politicians who, as you can imagine, have never been in a fistfighting gymnasium. No courage, you know? Just sit on your desk with your feet and drink a different beer. <br /> <br /> The film does what it intended to do, but what it was about to do is unbearable. The myth, which was circulated in the mid-1980s, becomes consciously aware that there were countless MIAs held by the North Vietnamese in miserable camps. The stickers were omnipresent. (Free our MIAs.) Why should you keep them? It was never properly justified, but perhaps to turn the prisoners of war into slave labor - in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor. Or perhaps for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States - a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese have kept secret from the world. As a prisoner, Rambo is treated by the north in a medieval way Vietnamese. Dipped in pork droppings in the neck and then pulled out at the wrists, his muscles are still visible. Then a Russian officer who does not settle for subhuman Vietnamese is called a Gestapo officer - "Vee haff vays from MAKING, whom you remember." The Russian is a high-tech type and uses psychology and electricity, not just pig dump. <br /> <br /> Rambo returns and says he intends to drift aimlessly until "this country loves us as much as we love it". Another myth was mentioned that veterinarians returning from Vietnam were uniformly spat out and cursed. That's why we elected so many to the congress and appointed others to high-ranking positions. The last three lost presidential candidates belonged to this despised group. At least, Rambo's aimless drifting left room for a sequel that arrived swiftly. <br /> <br /> The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were littered by Wisecracks, but Rambo is humorless. She marches inconspicuously through her phantasmatic ideological mire, which kills without mercy, barely spoken, barely able to speak. Speaking is a sign of weakness.
