When the People of the Movies Video put together their fine "Slapstick Encyclopedia" collection, a selection of mutilated, multi-cassette comedies, someone decided to start with ONE TOO MANY (1916), an obscure one-roll farce from Florida start the very young Oliver Hardy. As pleasing as the set may be, this decision was an unfortunate decision, because ONE TOO MANY is a very bad movie that almost scares the viewer away from further viewing. As with any typical farce, this one is a greed-inspired deception, panic when plans go awry, and complications escalate to absurdity, but unlike the good guys, ONE TOO IS MUCH incoherent, irritated, and downright annoying. At this point, it is difficult to say whether the hopelessly confusing plot is due to lack of footage or inappropriate filmmaking. Whatever the cause, even the most attentive viewer has no idea what the character relationships are or what happens, and in the end, it does not matter anymore. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest here is the 24-year-old "Babe" Hardy, who is a lot heavier than he did a decade later when he worked with him, Stan Laurel, who but still full of youthful energy. In the opening scene, which awakens with a hangover, Babe performs an extremely athletic backward movement from the bed. Trust me, that's as funny as this movie will be. If you read this before you see the first cassette of cinemas "Slapstick Encyclopedia", I suggest that you pass this by and switch to the good stuff.
