You know the story. Pretty kids alone in the woods when BAM! Something starts to cut her up. <br /> <br /> Well, this crap is no different Brother has disappeared for years. Suddenly, a "UNKOWN CREATURE" star was cut, and the only help is a doctor / biker. The acting was terrible. <br /> <br /> The creature looked very cheesy. And like all movies these days, they try to reach you with a twist end, which they do not! <br /> <br /> There is a bright spot on this film - LOST star Maggie Grace as the female lead.
