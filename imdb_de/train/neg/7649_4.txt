Joyce Reynolds seems to have been raised for the role of Janie, a young crazy sixteen-year-old in small town America, who ditches her boyfriend for a visiting soldier AND lands on the cover of the Life magazine (snogging at a blanket party) all in the same week ! Nonstop tide of wisecracks, put-downs, bullfights and inglorious businesses like Janie's little sister, who captivates family members, Hattie McDaniel (as a maid), who is constantly hovering over the naughty child, Janie's mother involved in the Red Cross and Janie's dad tries to write an editorial on the problems with today's teenagers (as the parents, the stuffy, sexless Edward Arnold and the pert, the talkative Ann Harding, are an unlikely couple even in 1944, he does not seem capable to be less of a child to conceive two of them). Warner Bros., who was nominated for an Oscar (!) For the cut by Owen Marks, followed in 1946 with "Janie Gets Married". Reynolds must have outgrown her comrade by now - she was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 of ****
