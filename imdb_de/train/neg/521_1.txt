Impressive! This movie is really terrible. I can not imagine how anyone would have read this ill-written script and given the green light. The cast is uniquely secondary to some truly horrific performances by virtually all performers. The story is incoherent, fragmented and incoherent. The say, lead and predictable. No joke, no charm, no humor. Not in the least sexy. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There is also a strong flow of misogyny that became more difficult as the film progressed. If your guide (Carrell) is not disturbing and unsightly, it goes uphill from there. Despite the false ending in which love triumphs over lust, I had a sick feeling in my stomach. If this applies to humor and social commentary, we are definitely doomed to failure.
