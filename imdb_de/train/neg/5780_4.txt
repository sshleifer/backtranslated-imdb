I really wanted to like this movie and I went all the way thinking that it needed to get better. Do not get me wrong, it's not the worst streak ever, but it will never reach its potential. The premise is good, the cast is great (I was particularly pumped to witness the return of David Naughton), and, God, they can say everyone is trying to do their best. It is always too short. "Brutal Massacre" should serve filmmakers as a constant reminder that only Christopher Guest can shoot Christopher Guest films, and although it makes it look so easy, you should just forget to try the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are awesome and should be seen more often ... they are the reason why I get 4 stars from me. If you're going to have the "Spinal Tap" of horror, I suppose you want the guy who made Spinal Tap to rule it ... just think aloud.
