I thought I saw this movie twice. Then I read all the other reviews and they did not quite fit together. A man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this city to study alleged grandfather sightings. I'm still pretty confident that this is the movie I've seen despite the discrepancies in the reviews. That's why I put my review back: If you like the occasional "B" movie as much as I do, then "Return to Boggy Creek" is the movie for you! Be it when you set the sleep timer and nod to your favorite movie bombshell or hang out with friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button, and you have a fun improvisation night. Attention! Is the legend true? I think we could just figure it out, along with a not-so-stellar cast. Will there be malfunctions of the equipment at certain key moments in the film? Does our blonde, male, young hero have breast hair? Does the extraordinary high-tech Technicolor take the whole movie? You have to be careful to find out for yourself.
