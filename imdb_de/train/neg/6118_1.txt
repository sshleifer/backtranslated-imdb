This is not a very good description of the Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show his wonderful wife. Bo Derek in '10' was at least a humorous movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This movie is nothing but soft porn. If you want that, move forward quickly and skip the rest! This movie (like Bolero) was again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show her horrible drama. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this one; This was one of his few mistakes! Do not waste your time with this movie ... buy the book instead.
