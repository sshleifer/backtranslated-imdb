Good Lord, who made this turkey must be buried alive. I'm sorry, but the other reviewer must not have seen this movie, he must see something different or have never seen a movie before ... 9 out of 10 stars? He says something, that's as good as Ben Hur or Gone with the Wind? Unintentionally funny, unbelievably incredible characters, absurd situations, it looks like it's in Griffith Park (which works pretty well - MASH was filmed in Griffith Park) - crappy script, anything that could go wrong in a movie in a package , Should be an example for all future filmmakers, how a film could be terribly wrong. It reminds me of something that a USC student can do for a film class. <br /> <br /> Give this one pass unless you take drugs and are in high camp.
