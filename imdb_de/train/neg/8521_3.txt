Incidentally, this gives away part of the story. A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value of Christmas and just enjoy the holiday. This is not the case. It tries to capture the emotions of A Charlie Brown Christmas, there is even another Christmas game, but fails with lackluster and light jokes. Charlie Brown no longer wonders about the spirit of Christmas, but instead wants to buy a present for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the movie. Here's one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but does not know how to spell Charlie (for some reason he has to be in her letter), so she decides to call him Sam because she knows how she does go spell Sam. In addition, Sally plays an angel in the play with a word: "Hark!" She says hockey stick instead (har har). If Sally's saying does not kill 12 times (all oddly sound the same), nothing will happen. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are a big focus, but that does not make it much better. Marcy is funny with her answers to Patty, but Patty is a different story. She sounds like a boy (which does not dispel the rumors) and gets angry when she has to involve the sheep (terrible baas and everything). Apparently she is the sheep every year and worries that she will forget her lines (lines she does not have). She is so worried that she mentions it twice in a row and gets the same answer. I assume that she has a short-term memory loss or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus still has some annoying advice) but hardly too much airtime. I'm sure Schr√∂der is not even there. All in all, it tries to be a parasite of the original, but it has affected the news for a few quick laughs.
