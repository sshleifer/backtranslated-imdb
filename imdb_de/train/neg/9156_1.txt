Ben & Arthur COULD were 10 years old. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, stared and produced this film. Sam would have had to give his idea to a good author and director, leaving acting to someone who could act. This is a good example of a person who controls the entire production. There was no one who told him, "Sam, that's bad, really bad." <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was the only good thing, but with a good director he could have been much better at working with actors. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and watch this movie (twice). The acting and direction was so bad that this film was turned into a comedy. you only had to laugh and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> A second good point ... that would be a great date movie. After the first two minutes you would cancel the movie and pay more attention to your date!
