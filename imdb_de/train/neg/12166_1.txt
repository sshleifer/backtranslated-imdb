Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes she is related to Bruce), the killer of the first movie, has her old tricks again. She is one of the consultants at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls in the camp are nice and have no sex, drugs and swearing are okay. But take a few steps over the line and Angela kills her - and makes bad jokes. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a vicious and unpleasant splatter movie, but had some good points. This is also vicious and evil, but has NO good points. The action was done to death and this adds nothing new to the formula. There are many bloody killings here (people are burned alive, heads cut off, throat slashed), but everything is so obviously wrong that it actually turns out to be weird. This also has the lowest number of campers I've ever seen, and virtually everyone is too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, there is the free female nudity (here provided by the enormously untalented Valerie Hartman) and the compulsory good girl / good boys team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the exception of Springsteen and Higgins, acting is bad - even after Slasher film standards. There is also a cruel edge in this movie where a character is drowned in an outhouse! Boring and sick with a stupid plot, pointless nudity and bad blood. Skip it.
