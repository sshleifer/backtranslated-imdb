For two of the funniest comedians, the movie was awful. Forwarded quickly and never got better! Waste of time and a waste of money! Tina Fey is a great writer, I thought she would be so great in the comedy. The previews were so great, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that for a chick movie, it sucked. What's wrong with that? The movie was very slow and boring. I will not recommend it to anyone right now. I would like to get my money back! BOO of us here in Arizona. Thanks but no thanks Who is doing such a stupid thing that people think you are pregnant. I thought it would be so funny, I had my own children and I helped others to have children. It could have been more in reality.
