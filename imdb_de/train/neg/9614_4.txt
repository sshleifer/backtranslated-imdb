I would not recommend this if you are not interested in David Copperfield and want to "complete" the set. There are some good performances (eg Uriah Heep) and well-directed moments (like hitting), but overall it's really pale compared to the BBC version from 1999 and earlier. <br /> <br /> There are inexplicable changes in the story that really serve no great purpose other than possibly disguising them (the stolen jewels are an example of this). The American cast has been poorly selected: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is wrong as Betsy Trotwood, and her English accent is only slightly better than that of Dick Van Dyke. I can see why Michael Richards was selected to play Mr. Micawber; he bangs it a little too much and gets irritating. He also speaks his lines with an accent that goes beyond eccentricity and simply becomes absurd. Anthony Andrews is threatening as Mr. Murdstone, but one is almost expected to put on a black cape and tie David's mother to a railway line (though perhaps this is partly the fault of Dickens). <br /> <br /> I got it for free from a newspaper. It helped to pass a Sunday afternoon, but in the end I was more disappointed than charmed
