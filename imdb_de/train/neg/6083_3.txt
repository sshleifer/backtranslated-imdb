Two types of movies we like are (1) westerns and (2) 30 or 40 years old films. We should have liked A Man Called Sledge; BUT ..... <br /> <br /> BUT ... this picture is uncomfortable, annoying and stupid from start to finish. Since there is no one in the story (good or bad) to warm up to, there is no one who motivates the tension necessary to interest the viewer. No camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it. Sledge has a pretty girlfriend, but there's no reason why she's slumbering in the whole guy, or why she wants to be in the same room with this pig without an account. <br /> <br /> The movie also suffers from intrusive behavior and gawdawful music score, and from extremely poor writing and directing by Vic Morrow. <br /> <br /> Of the last 30 older films loaned by Netflix or Video Vault, this was Rock Bottom, the only true guy in the group.
