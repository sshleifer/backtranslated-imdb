"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. It is a gravestone for the directorial career of German director Wim Wenders. Many felt it in "The Million Dollar Hotel" and now "Land of Plenty" makes it clear; Not only has Wenders lost it, he has actually become a bad director, creating awfully weak and superficial stories and scenes. <br /> <br /> One could argue that the "time you lose" applies to every director, except for Wenders' case is extreme. It's like forgetting everything he knew about the cinema and starting from scratch - just to get sloppy results. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie does not deserve your time.
