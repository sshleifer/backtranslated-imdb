The film has only one mistake, which unfortunately affects all the credibility of the piece. <br /> <br /> The movie begins by condemning the Israeli occupation of controversial territories. The reason Israelis are there is not addressed. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. Therefore, Israel "occupied" its land because these lands had lost it in a war. <br /> <br /> The film also claims that Israel opposes the UN by failing to comply with Resolution 242. Problem is, 242 was rejected immediately after its introduction by ..... the Palestinians, which invalidates them. Many films are well composed and can really show material that changes the mind, but remember, when you look at something, you do not believe in what you hear and only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> All of the participants in this film are well-known critics of Israel, and some have made many anti-Semitic public comments that undermine any credibility of their words. <br /> <br /> All participants urgently need a current history lesson, which is objectively and not taught by a Palestinian sympathizer.
