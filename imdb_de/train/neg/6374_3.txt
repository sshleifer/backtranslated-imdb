This movie was a bit confusing at first. I usually like Gina Phillips, but this one I have to say was a bad choice, just as she did the movie Ring Around the Rosie, which is not one of her good movies either. Jeepers Creepers was much better. In any case, Faye Dunaway was good. She drove me crazy and in the end it was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips), who comes to the funeral of her twin sisters. She stays in a house owned by her sister and her grandmother (Dunaway) lives with an aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) somehow sacrifices her relationships to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she can not die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, what she tries. Ravens have a strange role. When the relatives go to sleep, the ravens eat their organs so they can not sleep. But they do it. Basically, everything is crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her relatives will be buried, but not dead, because they will have to suffer forever so Mary Ellen can stay alive. Yes, I hope that helps. If not, excuse me. Love you.
