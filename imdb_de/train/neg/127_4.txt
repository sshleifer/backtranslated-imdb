I rent I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video library because it was first released in 1967. I also heard that US customs were first seized if he had ever tried to enter this country. I really had to see for myself a fan of films that are considered "controversial". <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a young Swedish acting student named Lena, who wants to learn all about life. In particular, she wants to focus her attention on creating a kind of documentary about what the average Swede means on specific political issues, such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. Asked about her opinion on politics between politicians and ordinary citizens of Stockholm, she has had sex with her acting teacher, classmates and married men. Prior to this, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even if they are not filmed like a cheap porno movie. While my compatriots find it shocking, sex and nudity are a mainstay of Swedish cinema in Sweden. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably her answer to the good old John John Ford, had sex scenes in his films. <br /> <br /> I recommend to the filmmakers that any sex shown in the film is shown more for artistic purposes than just to shock people and make money in the pornographic theaters in America to be shown. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good movie for anyone who wants to study meat and potatoes (not a pun) in Swedish cinema. But this movie really has no big story.
