I enjoyed the commentary from the first reviewer much more than the movie when I saw it in a second theater in the early '80s. At that time I was impressed by the care to create costumes that were so closely modeled on the Tenniel drawings. But for me, the cast was largely squandered, their personalities were muffled by the masks, while the direction I think was unusually static and the photography cloudy. The rating recorded at that time was nothing, which means it's not worth going through just once.
