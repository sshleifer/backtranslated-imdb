I knew there was no truce between me and D-Wars between the moment we met. At first the title was lazy. D war. It was too much for her to write Dragon. Besides ... You really can not be so blatant about your title unless it's your Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do anything he wants. <br /> <br /> The second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the insane progress of the story. Here's the movie, a dreamy reporter guy reporting big snake tracks, looking back on a time when he and his dad went into competition for the store in Gremlins, and the dreamy kid reporter finds a box that's glowing , The old shed reveals some terrible truths. This Bauraki, a supposedly evil snake, was cheated out of his chance to be a god. He tells the child that he is a reborn warrior and that somewhere in LA is his reborn lover and gives him a piece of jewelry. Shop Keep also reveals that, despite its apparent whiteness, it is a 500-year-old Asian. <br /> <br /> Fifteen years later, the dreamy reporter remembers it and begins to be half crazy as he tries to find this random girl. Cgi Hijinks follow and for the last ten minutes my brain is melting from my nose. Why? Continue with the dear reader when you have the balls. <br /> <br /> So Sarah, the born-again lover, has her own flashbacks. I have the advantage of having a best Asian girlfriend, and in the scene where she starts freaking out and making some posters with Asian characters, he tells me that the guy who made this movie has no idea what he makes. It is a Korean legend and it was reborn by a Korean princess, but everything is in Chinese. Later in the night, her dragons start to hurt, she calls the police because it looks like she has a heart attack. Look, in this crazy crazy world, they seem to be treating heart attacks differently, because the next time we see them, she's locked up in her room with a guard and a nurse says she's crazy. I have a new phobia now, and if I'm ever in trouble, the first responders just assume I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another issue with my hard mistress Dwar. There is a scene where Patrick Dempsey Jr (Dreamy Reporter) is in a caf√© with a naughty black friend. In the scenes of the Miffed Near deity, Bauraki killed an elephant, slithered through a suburb, and killed one of Sarah's friends. You see, people were scared to come out after 9/11, but we all have to freeze after the decision to make coffee and biscuits was worth our lives. Business as usual, by no means can a huge snake stop me from taking my caffeine. If I stay inside and fear for my life, the terrorists and serpent deities will win. <br /> <br /> After receiving a satisfying kite in the helicopter battle, my cruel lover Dwar pampers me with a pi $$ and a vinegar-filled scene to end it all. Bauraki has his own fortress and his LA rights, I think. They do not really say, but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah are killed in a car accident that would kill smaller men and when they wake up, yes, Dragon Palace. Some delayed dialogues later, a good dragon serpent god emerges from nowhere, and the serpents wrestle / love whatever. And I do not shit out of nowhere. Maybe you think I'm blowing it out of proportion, I'm not going to mention that this is suddenly mentioned in the movie ... there! A few seconds later, a good dragon becomes the Dragon God, sets fire to Baurki, Sarah transforms into a ghost and goes with Dragon God, a dreamy reporter who rolls in the middle of nowhere ... Thank God. <br /> <br /> Now our relationship was as rocky as it was had good times. There was a guy who looked like a turtle shredder, just like a Star Wars Tuscan raider. I will call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, it could never be useful. He could run through a wall in a scene that did not help. He could go into your dreams if that does not help, and he could set fire to ten arbitrary soldiers, but not when it matters. He was also allergic to the junk jewelry. I like him because he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic smoker sounds from Tuscany. <br /> <br /> The actors were mostly great ... great when somehow terrible meant. Jason Behr, whom I thought was great in Roswell, is slowly finding out that he can only act in one way, his lead actor, Bauraki. This giant snake played his heart out. I dare say that he could better play a CGI serpentine demigod of evil than John Barrymore Richard III. Or Hamlet played. There was an emotion in every scene that stole the thunder from his death-belt. If he ate an elephant, I felt like nobody in the past, present or future would ever eat an elephant with so much feeling. He was more than an actor, he was a force of nature, putting his heart and soul into every second of this cursed project. Damn it, my favorite actor in this movie was a CGI snake. I have to admit that I have to admit it? <br /> <br /> Here's hoping Bauraki gets more work and is not thrown in the guy that Jason Behr finds a range of emotions that are different from the dreamy looks I'll never see Blue Monkey again. <br /> <br /> So, D-War is over. I want my CDs back and let's just be friends
