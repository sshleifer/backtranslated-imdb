Private practice should be a medical drama. I think my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in medical history. Just by watching House I "solved" two (out of nine) medical secrets before the doctors did. Seriously, if you're a lazy writer, why not copy some cases from older ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap? House is new and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to come by ... <br /> <br /> Second biggest complaint: These people are supposed to be forty-something, right? Why then do they have to deal with the emotional maturity of the 15-year-olds? Three weeks (three whole damn episodes) of intense thinking is really necessary to understand that if your best friend does not want to be your "friend with benefits," it may not be because he wants you to hurt, but because of him does not want to risk your friendship? Incidentally, the character who's doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist - the whole plot is just so unrealistic that you can not really buy into the alleged "drama". <br /> <br /> And I will not even complain What the show did to Addison's darling when we met her in Gray's Anatomy ... On a side message, do not think it's weird As Addison craves for loser Pete (sorry, but anyone trying to cure insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, graduate student or not) and Derek gets into a relationship with Whiny, who irritates Meredith Miles in rainy Seattle. Apart from this little swarm with Mark, they seemed perfect for each other. Sometimes I think that Shonda Rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships our first choice is often the right one ...
