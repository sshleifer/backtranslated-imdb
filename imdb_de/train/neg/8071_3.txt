I wanted to see this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but she only has a smaller part and her character is not very likable. However, the main character played by Melissa Sagemiller is extremely beautiful and a perfect pleasure to watch the full movie. This is really just a showcase for her looks and talent. She does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty nonsensical at first sight. After a car crash, some friends may be dead, but they continue their lives as all sorts of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are after them, but we never really figure out who they are (maybe they were in the other car, but we certainly do not hear why they're after them). The final scenes are especially cinematically ambitious, but I can not make anything coherent. The opening scene, where the bad guys (wearing weird masks) cut a blond girl's wrist and collect some of her blood, is never explained or persecuted. Unless the bad guys are supposed to be a portrayal of the surgeons trying to get Cassie (Sagemiller) back from the dead ... but no, that does not seem to work. The bad guys are just evil; They really screw up a story that would otherwise have been interesting. In a supernatural story about death, love and sacrifice, who the hell needs villains? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 points.
