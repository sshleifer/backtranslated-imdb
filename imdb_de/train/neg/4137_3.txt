I have a high tolerance for crap, so I was looking forward to it. It did not disappoint. He is apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carmilla. He follows a father and a daughter chasing a female vampire who fortunately travels with them. Then we run Santa Claus (or the general, as he likes to be called here) over random zombies. Did I mention that there was a zombie outbreak? The dead return to life, but nobody seems too worried. We have construction worker zombies, soldier zombies and even St. Trinian schoolgirl zombies. Apparently Santa Claus is looking for his daughter, who has been turned into a vampire. Wait, there are no vampires, the girl is in a lunatic asylum and Carmilla is her nurse, right? The zombies are back and Santa Claus is crazy. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I like zombies, but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like a simulated cunnilingus to let the juices flow. When will vampires see zombies fight? Is she a vampire or is she crazy? Or both? Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here come the St. Trinian zombies. Chainsaw time !! More lesbian sex than the zombies kill and eat the vampires. I think the zombies have won or not? Plot? Who needs an act if you have lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies? And cunnilingus?
