"Fred Claus" somehow avoids becoming this year's "The Santa Clause" by having at least a few more amusing moments than this Tim Allen star, but it does not mean it has enough to make a visit to the theater , <br /> <br /> With the holiday films it is imaginative and sentimental. But that could be the least concern as "Fred Claus," who prides himself on having David Dobkin ("Shanghai Knights," "The Wedding Crashers") at the top, and contains almost no really funny moment while he awkwardly takes the step enters the line between a boorish Vince Vaughn vehicle and a blurry Christmas movie. In the end, it's not much of both. And with a cast of Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates, one remains disappointed. <br/> <br /> Vaughn plays Fred, Nick's (Giamatti) older and alienated brother Once upon a time when he and his parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) had left him, having had enough of his parents' favor for him to endure his younger sibling. Nick becomes Santa Claus (and as the spokeswoman tells us, time freezes you and your family when you become a saint), while Fred becomes a Yuletide-disturbed repo man in Chicago, who has a hard time contacting his girlfriend to remind Wanda's (Weisz) birthday. <br /> <br /> He is in trouble with the law and has had to call his younger brother (who looks eerily at least ten years older than him) to get him out of prison. Nick agrees, but only if Fred agrees to help with the toy packaging business at the North Pole. Fred reluctantly agrees, but his cynicism clashes with the everlasting nature of Santa and the elves. Even as an efficiency expert (Spacey), he checks the operation of the toy factory. He's just too happy that all the Arctic operations are closed when things fail. <br /> The film has, as I said, its moments, but the padded run length extends them over time. In between are stacked Christmas clich√©s, the z. The efforts of sentimentality are as appealing as the fruit cake of last year at the table, but the castrated writing of Dan Fogelman prevents him from REALLY doing his thing. Giamatti, under the bad, fat suit, gives his iconic character a cheerful, old charm, but unfortunately Fred must play second fiddle. Spacey brings his game face, but his features usually end up being unlucky. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, "Fred Claus" becomes a memorable movie that falls under what those involved deserve. Sure, there are worse ways to start the season in the cinema, but there are certainly far better options.
