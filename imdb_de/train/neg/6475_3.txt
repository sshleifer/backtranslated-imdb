Although I have not reviewed the movie in about two years, I remember exactly what caused my opinion to be as low as possible. After loving the original little mermaid and being infatuated with mermaids from childhood, I decided that I would take the time to sit down and watch the sequel. Disney, I have a little message for you. If you do not have the original director and actors at hand, just look for the butt. <br /> <br /> In the sequel, our story begins with a slightly older Ariel and her daughter. Melody. My first big problem was that Eric and the rest of the crew sang. Yes, I understand that Disney has a large number of vocal and dance numbers, but that has made Eric my favorite prince. He was calm, collected and a true gentleman who knew how to have fun. And he did it. NOT. SING. <br /> <br /> And then there's the bad guy. Oh, how could we forget the shivers that ran down our spines when Ursula fell on the screen, terrorizing Ariel and audiences around the world? Unfortunately, this gene was not passed on to their seemingly useless sister Morgana. There was never anything said about Morgana in the first movie; She just jumps out of nowhere and tries to steal the baby. Oh how sweet. The younger sister is ticked off and, instead of following the trident, decides to kidnap a month-long baby. Gag me. <br /> <br /> Apart from being a flat figure with no sense of originality, Morgana was simply very unorthodox. The same plan as her sister, the same henchmen (who, by the way, did not scare anyone.) I had a three year old on my lap when I saw this movie and she laughed hysterically.) She had no purpose in being; I would have liked to see that Mom is the bad guy. I'm sure she would have done a better job there than Little Miss Tish. <br/> <br /> King Triton did not have the respect he deserved in the first movie and did not even get it. I started with Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a stern but loving father in the first film, and in the second film it's almost as if he has lost the will to put fear into the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with its "Dingle-Hopper" (yes, I'll admit it, I've sometimes called my fork a Dingle Hopper). Scuttle is almost forgotten in this movie. He was already a minor character in the first scene and at least added something to the film. He was rich in a taste that the others did not have, and in the sequel they almost completely withdrew it. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as worrisome as before. Disney, do not do that. Do not even try to play with our favorite crab. Or our little favorite fish, who becomes a father and has a multitude of very annoying children. He is fat and he is bland and he looks like he's going to flatten every second. <br /> <br /> The walrus and the penguin were not needed anymore, and after a while they start to annoy everyone. Especially Melody, who has no depth. <br /> <br /> And one day, Disney, I was expelled from my life. <br /> <br /> If I did not love your originals so much.
