Yes, in 35 years of filming I have finally seen the stinker who surpasses all the other spooky films I've seen. "Good Will Hunting", "Baise Moi" and "Flirt" out of sheer misfortune. This is a presumptuous bliss of the first order ... not even an entertaining presumptuous bilge. The effects are cheap and worse - pointless. <br /> <br /> The script seems to have been written by a film student in the first year that does not get much out but wants to appear full of characters! Acting is simply indescribably bad - Tilda Swinton carves out a career filled with empty woods, with a performance that neurotically switches between comedy and ridiculous "intensity". Apparently, a fool out there has enabled the director of this movie to do another ... be warned
