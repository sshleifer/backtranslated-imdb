First, this movie, the Slick said he won "Best Film" at the "Worldfest" film festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year. <br /> <br /> If this was not the worst movie ever to happen, but it definitely shit, is pretty much as horrible as other Aussie B-student "Body Melt", but at least that's the movie not like it was shot on HI 8 video. <br /> <br /> My guess is that the filmmakers have seen many Troma movies, and really bad B-grade Gore movies in the business that releases this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I really love inferior movies. Only the fact that some of the characters set the wrong American accents, as if this would give you more chance to sell it in the States or something. A really disappointing ending, the showdown could have been much more exciting and some good fight scenes. You can fully see that the filmmakers are trying to copy "Bad Taste" with the whole explosion, the car explosion, the rocket launcher, and the infinite number of people shot down, but the finale does not have excessive humor or a style like " bad "taste". <br /> <br /> If you see really bad movie films or are interested in no-budget movies, look at them or you will stay away.
