As an independent filmmaker and a big fan of Edward D. Wood, Jr., I bought this documentary, convinced that this would finally set the record for how talented and brilliant Ed Wood really was. <br /> <br /> What I got was a disappointing, self-centered, conflicting and contradictory compilation of bitter, self-glorifying hares. <br /> <br /> Where people remember Ed Wood Jr., people actually remember the second cousin of the man with the tape who knew someone who was in Plan Nine From Outer Space? <br /> <br /> It looks like there's a renewed interest in Ed Wood right now, these people are coming out of the "Wood" work! Just to send mean vivacious blows to someone who actually gave them a chance if no one else would! After 50 years I would suggest that many of these people should give up the fact that they did not get the $ 75 they were promised! Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker who knew how to talk. In fact, that was all he was for. You can chuckle when you watch Ed's movies, but you somehow know that you're laughing with him and not with him. <br /> <br /> But I digress ... Back to the movie. If you are expecting a movie about Edward D. Wood Jr., you will not get it here. If you want a movie about crazy bitter old actors, this is the movie for you!
