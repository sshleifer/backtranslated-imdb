If you've seen other films like these, they're probably better. The Omega Man comes to my mind. To the honor of the studio, they avoided the sprawling, unnecessary and inexpensive Technofest that is typical of films of this kind. In addition, structure and premise were excellent: Four people whose past is practically irrelevant to us are trying to escape an overwhelming infectious disease. What's bad is EVERYTHING! I'm tired of endless stupid, careless, lame, ineffective, arrogant characters in a movie. That pretty much describes everyone in the movie someday. I rented it and called me over and over again to scream on TV: "No, do not do that!", "Why are you so stupid?", "Attention!", Etc. A real lack of character development is evident halfway through. A movie should give you a strong personal relationship with at least some of the characters, so you really care about what happens to them. This one does not do it. There should have been a longer, more poignant ending to the film.
