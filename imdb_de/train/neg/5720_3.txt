Some Gorehound friends have recommended "Live Feed" to me, and basically I can not really complain because the film does provide a lot of dirt and buckets of mud, but of course it's not a very good movie. Not only is Ryan Nicholson trying to beat the latest trend in horror cinema, the so-called Torture Porn, but trying to outdo any other movie in this sub-genre (and including the role models "Hostel" and "Saw") with his sick & twisted make-up effects and thoroughly spoiled footage of naked classmates who suffered and suffered throughout their lives. There is no actual action that can be described. Five completely brainless twenty-friends make a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but otherwise I do not really know why they decided to travel to Cancun. They obviously are not interested in the culture of the continents and even cause a hectic scene when they see a local dog slaughtering a cute puppy in the market. The quintet then plunges into the dazzling nightlife and one of them inadvertently insults the leader of a criminal clan. A simple apology is obviously not enough, as the gangster follows them into a theater for adults and subjects them all to malicious torture. One girl has impaled her breast and another poor girl has even pushed a poisonous snake down her throat; yike's "Live Feed" is surprisingly boring despite all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values ​​are hard to miss, even if you're used to watching an independent fan boy trash movie like this one. The fat guy on the cover, an oriental S & M executioner, admittedly is pretty cool and he's also the most talented of the bunch because he keeps his mouth shut, at least. I would not recommend this shit, but hey, if you like loud and horrible metal music, foul-smelling torture stuff and mindless losers, just keep going and watch!
