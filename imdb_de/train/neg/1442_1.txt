This is the worst conceivable crap. The novel by H. Rider Haggard is very entertaining and dramatic. The makers of this worthless film do not follow him exactly. Well, old novels are not sacred and it's good for me to make free versions of it, if you have your own ideas. If you can only change something and replace it with uninteresting and diluted clich√©s, you should stick to the original. Had they done so, the movie would have been at least twice as good even to worse actors and to a cardboard-boxed studio. But there is no imagination, only fatigue. This should only be bought or viewed by collectors of Victorian novels who have been made into films. <br /> <br /> Just a hint and not a spoiler, I think, to help those of you reading the novel understand what has happened and what to expect if you decide to watch it on TV , or - God forbids - to waste money when you buy it. Gagool, an old villain who is in the book and a forerunner of Gollum, has turned into a beautiful girl!
