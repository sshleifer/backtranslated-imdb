First and foremost, I'm a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle, so excited to see a movie being filmed for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. However, this movie ruined that excitement for me. I'm sorry, but Meg was described in the book as bubbly curls and glasses and considered very uncool. In the film she has straight hair and no glasses and is the "athletic type" with a deep voice. Madeleine L'Engle did not introduce Meg. In fact, Meg based on Madeleine's character and described how she felt in her youth. This is just one example of how book and film differ. I would say, if you want to see it for entertainment, take a look at it, but if you're an avid fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her series "Wrinkle in Time," I'd suggest skipping this movie.
