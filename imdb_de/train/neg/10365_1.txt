Dreadful. This thriller should have been buried. What a crap. Terrible writing, characters are less credible. Terrible lock !! Put some B-Stars in a terribly written POS to try and give them some credit, but it fails miserably. If I did not have to write ten lines about this movie, I would have given it a word word that starts with 'sh' and ends with 'it'. <br /> <br /> Terrible end, delayed. Who writes this crap? The end of this movie is so thought-out that it's as weak as if they had no idea what to do with this story, or they had little money left. Probably due to the number of cameos in this movie. It's a good thing these actors are on the road, because this would be a career killer. Good for her that hardly anyone will see it. At least no more important than future investors. It could have ended a thousand different ways, but as it is, I feel cheated out of my precious time.
