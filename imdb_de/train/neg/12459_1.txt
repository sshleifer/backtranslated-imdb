Considering how much money was budgeted for this movie, one would expect more of the entire story. This could be the most worthless movie I have ever seen. There was no real progress. Character development, minimal. Plot progress maybe. Enjoyment, none. I'm not sure which points were even tried. If you want to see a movie in which terrorists are somehow good people, the American CIA bombards everything that is not in our opinion, all capitalists are corrupt and you want to see everything that resembles a storyboard rise with a death. For those of us who know that it does not have to kill a good man to say one point, we stay with other films. In summary, this was a terrible attempt to hide a movie in the style of the "Ocean 11", in which the person proceeds in such a way that one must think only because one knows not only what is going on, also no one, who made the film did, did it. Home Alone 3 was a better movie piece.
