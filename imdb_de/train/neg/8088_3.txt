To make a good movie, you need either excellent actors or an excellent director. You need at least one of them. In this bottleneck we have none. <br /> <br /> I can not even remember the name of the director. He did not have to do much in his career. I really like Donald Sutherland, but he definitely can not be the lead actor in a movie. He falls short. Sutherland is excellent in a movie if he does not appear for more than 15 minutes. For example, I would say that Sutherland in JFK was honored by Oliver Stone when he talked for 10 minutes to Kevin Costner on the bench of a park without taking a breath. Wonderful But Sutherland as the lead actor in a movie is not good. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? She's probably good for TV shows. The DVD is terrible. Terrible colors. Terrible light. I could not even appreciate the landscape of Storm Island because of the bad photography. <br /> <br /> This story by Ken Follett was good, but it's a pity they made it into an uninteresting movie.
