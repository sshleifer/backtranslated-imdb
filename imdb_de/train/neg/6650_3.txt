I think that would have been a much better movie if the Cajuns had been portrayed in a more credible light. My family is from southeastern Louisiana and I live in southeast Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I never heard that the people I grew up with speak like these people. The Cajuns were depicted as rear rednecks. Most of the Cajuns I know are well-educated, proud people, and do not sound uneducated at all when they speak the way these people did. All in all, it was an OK movie with great scenery and music. I understand that the writers came from Lake Charles and had knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things, Cajun, we ask the actors to learn the language, to live among the people who portray you, and to have a thorough understanding How to Understand Them Before you leave, try behaving like them. In my opinion it is a much more enjoyable movie if the actors make you believe they are that person.
