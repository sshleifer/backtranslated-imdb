My friend once brought the zombie chronicles that we should consider a joke. We did not know the joke counted for them, because they paid Â£ 1 for it. As I watched this movie, I came up with things I would rather do than watch The Zombie Chronicles. These included: <br /> <br /> 1) Drinking bleach 2) Rubbing sand in my eyes 3) Writing to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-adjusting the American Civil War 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Having sex with an old one Lady. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy could not even dig a hole properly. The best he did was kick down a door (the best part of the movie). This was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a movie had so many mistakes. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning that piece of crap. <br /> <br /> News only in: Owen Wilson saw this movie and tried to kill herself. Fact. <br /> <br /> NOT GROW
