This seemed like a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie, and throughout the movie I hoped it was a wise use of my time, and yes, I have to admit that the acting talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval was really commendable, but despite the best efforts, this film can not effectively convey a meaningful message that seems to be what Somnath Sen has been trying to do. The last point is short and the end seemed somehow unsatisfactory after all that happened. A bit like the real life in this respect, but films that are different from real life end up in about 2 hours and the end should satisfy the audience, if that was actually the intention of the director. This is inadequate in this respect, and that disappoints me the most. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that worried me was the national stereotyping of the American characters - they all seem to be the same block. It seems to me that most American characters in Indian English films are based on how ordinary Indians perceive Americans themselves, and it is obvious that no effort has been made to convey to any American in the film any sense of depth or complexity These two aspects make a disappointing story.
