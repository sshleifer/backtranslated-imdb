Basically, this is a pale shadow of High Fidelity, a funny and wonderfully played movie with several really convincing traits. Watching the detectives has none of this. <br /> <br /> The premise of a video library geek ripped off its feet by a quirky, mysterious woman is good, but thanks to a very weak script, it's never fully or adequately examined and the miscommunication of the clues, all too silent about the lack of a true visual narrative style. I mean, this movie is about MOVIES, but is incredibly unspectacular itself! This is a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that the main characters just do not care to us because the script and the actors (Murphy and Liu) do not make them true or likeable in any way. Real way. So the movie becomes a series of episodes involving two people who do not seem particularly terribly interesting. Oh, yes, one more thing: for a romantic comedy? It is not funny. And the romance is also not very romantic. <br /> <br /> How to avoid it. It's not worth it to sit through the 90-minute run ...
