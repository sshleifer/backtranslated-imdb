I picked up this movie for $ 5 at a discount bookstore, Adam Sandler is a great actor and I thought it was a good movie, well, that was not it. There was absolutely no storyline, bad jokes, and the other comedian said "The F-Word" every other word he said, cursing did not usually bother me, but that was overkill. And even worse than the lack of an action were the parts when Sandler was just starting to talk into random parts of the movie. It reminded me of Dora the Explorer, as they turned and looked at the screen and asked you questions. And the last one is when they happen to make bikini shots of girls in the movie. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, it's a waste of money
