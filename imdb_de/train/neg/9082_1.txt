This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was deceived because I thought it might be good because some of my favorite actors are there. Now I want to slap Jason Schwartzman in the face because he takes that role. I was physically ill after seeing this movie. Sometimes I really do not understand Hollywood. There are so many people trying to break in that I'm sure you can top off and get the best. In this way, the worst movie you make is Ferris Beullar instead of this mud. The gags like the hair puppet and the obvious tearing off of jeans spots contributed to the humorlessness of the film. I'm glad I shunned this movie and watched it on TV. This proves that you should avoid the release of January at any cost.
