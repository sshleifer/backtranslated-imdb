Amateur, no budget movies can be surprisingly good ... but this is not one of them. Ah, another cruelty from Brad Sykes. Acting is disgusting, except for Emmy Smith, who promises a lot. The camera "direction" must be seriously reworked. And no more gimmicks "hold the camera and walk"; it just does not work. The special effects are unimaginative, there is a problem if the effect can be detected in real time. If you want to tear off an ear, do not let us see the real ear of the actor under the blood. The scenery is boring and boring (just like Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a mix of cheap motel porn and really bad guitar-driven metal (see scenery commentary) the lack of real conspiracy or character development? Apparently, the scriptwriter did not do that. Whoever finances this guy ... please stop. I have seen some of his other "home videos" (which I will not join) and they are just as bad. Usually a "director" will grow and learn from his previous efforts ... not from this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. <br /> <br /> By no means a popcorn movie ... Of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort /> <br /> Award: The worst military pushups in a movie.
