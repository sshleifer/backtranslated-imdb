The bad news is that it is still very terrible. I gave him a 2, because occasionally, something of this bizarre slapstick parody seems funny. <br /> <br /> It should be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ace Kicker" and the progress should be rewarded. Or maybe I drank a lot when I saw it and felt generous. Anyway, it's "2". <br /> <br /> Maybe the best thing about this movie is that it's over pretty fast. It picks up on elements from most of the main themes and battle scenes of Kill Bill I & II, chops them down, dumbs them down, smears the dialogue and crushes all the chaos in about an hour of really horrible amateur videos <br /> You smoke the most Powerful, if you want to enjoy this. And bring this DVD back to the video library in time! You will really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee.
