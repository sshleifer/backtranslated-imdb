This movie is so bad that it hurts. The car makes 30 miles an hour if it's supposed to be 100 ... the gear stick that's stuck (in park!), The nurse who drives the phone with her cell phone for almost 2 hours ... can not do any of the 2 idiots , take this damn phone? There is nothing credible about this crap. I would be ashamed to be seen in such a movie!
