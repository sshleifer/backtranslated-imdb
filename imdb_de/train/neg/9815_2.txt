This film presents a somewhat original idea, but later became a big frustration. What about an original start, when the rest of the film has done little to avoid a stereotyped conspiracy? The movie itself is incredible. I'd like to know exactly how someone enters a clinic, gets a nurse outfit, kills a doctor, gets a patient out of bed, uses his Chevy pickup, and leaves? I guess nobody could answer that question, so they just jumped to the other scene and hid those little details. The performances are just bad. The bad guy is just another "annoying crazy antagonist", no depth, totally linear character. After 20 minutes of film, most scenes are unbelievable, it seemed like they were only there for the 90 minutes as they were completely unnecessary. A doctor clearly sees a woman under heavy medication, is not allowed to examine her, is thrown out of the house and just leaves the silence? The final scene made me laugh, only Mickey Mouse could make it more out of reality. I give 2 out of 10 points for the first 10 minutes of film.
