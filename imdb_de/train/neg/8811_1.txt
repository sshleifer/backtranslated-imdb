SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I saw half of this movie and I did not like it <br /> <br /> First Reason: Boring. Hardly anything happens, the women sit around and discuss how horrible their lives are and how they have no hope. They smoke weeds, read magazines, take care of their sick friend and cut open the occasional body. Boring !!!! <br /> <br /> Second reason: There are too many things inexplicable. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who abducts arbitrary men, holds them in a chair and interrogates them. Who are these men? How do you know about illegal activities related to the affected meat-eaters? Why does he kill you and let someone else go? <br /> <br /> Also, there's this guy I thought he had the carnivorous disease we originally thought - never explained! How frustrating is that? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found the women annoying, the story uninteresting, the duologue boring and the plot absent. Also, the cover is misleading, because you believe that this movie will be cool, if it is clearly not the case. I've rented this movie based on some reviews made by other people on this site, and although I respect the fact that some people may have enjoyed this movie, from now on I'll make sure I get more than two reviews in a movie To avoid renting another movie, I regret it.
