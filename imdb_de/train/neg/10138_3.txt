Over the years, I have seen some of these films directly in Segal Segal films, and all have the same entertainment. Unfortunately, the entertainment level is at a low level. Sure, the action sequences were amusing, but that was pretty much everything. Seagal was really at his best when he made films. Under Siege, Under Siege 2 and Executive Decision (at least in terms of the action), but over the last decade, these types of films in which Segal plays the main role, really do not match his previous qualifications The more positive side was that the film time well spent, like some of the action sequences and the joke. Just when the movie was apparently just dragging, a pretty cool action scene pulled it out of the gutter. I truly believe that more of Segal's films would be better if he were not the only one the fans recognize in the film. Supporting actors and actresses is a very important thing, and if his current films had these well-known supporting actors and actresses, the film could perhaps get more popular results.
