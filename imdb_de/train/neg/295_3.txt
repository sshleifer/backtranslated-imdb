I got this movie because I worked in a movie business, so I could rent it for free. It came in and the cover made it look okay. Hot chick, carrying a gun, all right, I'll check it. <br /> <br /> Oh man, a bad move. That was so terrible that I saw half of the movie in the fast-forward to get to the nudity that was minimal. I think, possibly three scenes are partial nudity. Cheese dialogue, grumpy violence, bad apologies from characters. I think it's bad if I reject this film because I know it was made on a cheap budget, but also "Clerks" and it became a cult classic and a franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
