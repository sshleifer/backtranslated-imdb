It really does not matter that Superman comics are incredibly na√Øve and their target is ten years old. What matters is that "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, a question for you Dear Readers, How many of you really believe that Superman will be defeated by the bald Kevin Spacey? Someone? Just as I thought so. No spoilers here. Let us now turn to some important topics. <br /> <br /> First, the movie looks like a commercial (scene in the bar with Superman / Clark Kent, which Budweiser drinks is just a scene that looks like expected). Imagine a Superman commercial for two and a half hours. Let's be serious, this is not "Amadeus" or "The Departed". You actually have the feeling that this movie is way too long. And special effects are not that special, by the way. <br /> <br /> Second, the scenario is stupid. Sometimes, even if the comic is acceptable, it just looks stupid in the movies. And so it is in this case. Of course, dialogues are shame. I can not believe that someone needed money for it. How often do we get fed with bad talk? How often are laws of physics raped? (Jesus, it's not just Superman's strength, but also a resistance of materials he's dealing with.) How many times is Kent deceiving Lois Lane? How often do Hollywood producers look for a story in dirty comics? Since it's hard to make a good story, why a faint story for a starter? It just does not work. Guys, hold on. Please try harder. Or just stay with this strike forever, who cares? I have a feeling that the WGA is constantly on strike. No offense. I do not doubt the lame money these people get but the quality of the product they deliver. In this case, there is no quality at all. (At this point, you might be wondering, is it that bad? Yeah, that's it.) Third, acting is weak, which is pretty surprising as Bryan Singer (Usual Suspects) directs. Kevin Spacey is having fun, but he is the only one. The audience is not in the mood for jokes. The comic hero can develop into a real personality, with clear motives, but also with doubts, fears, and some depth. In this case nobody did this job and characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole effort of the makers makes this film a parody. The second unit is so bad that it attracts attention, because nothing interesting happens on the screen anyway. The harder they try (if they try), the funnier it gets (but it's not a laugh to expect). <br /> <br /> Final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This film, ladies and gentlemen, is a camp. Do not waste your time and do not waste your money. Stay home, read a book.
