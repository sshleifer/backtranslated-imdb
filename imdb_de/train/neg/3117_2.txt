My husband is a big Robin Williams fan. I also like him, but I've generally found that he should "stick to what he does best" and focus on comedic roles. My thoughts were confirmed with this movie. I was completely bored throughout the movie. The story was predictable. I know that it was inspired by a true story. However, I suspect that even tension and intrigue may have occurred, though the truth remains in the story. None of the characters was well developed. There was a side story about the main character and his partner. This relationship could have been further explored. More important, however, would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the "boy". Her psychological profile would have been interesting. Obviously, she has a long history that has been touched only superficially. If my husband was not such a big fan of Williams, we would have 20 minutes left. Too bad that I will not get back my 20 or 2 hours.
