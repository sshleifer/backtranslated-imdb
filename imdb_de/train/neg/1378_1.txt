It's like a bad television program of the 80s is getting loose and trying to become a softcore porn movie. Oh my god it was bad. The actions of each character had little relevance. The plot itself had nothing to say. Something with a stalker, I think. In the end he shoots himself? It's not really clear, but somehow a volleyball game is involved. And the main character (Randy) sleeps a lot. The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was there, and they wanted to fast forward to the scenes with him. Thank God I did not spend any money on it, but I want to go back this hour of my life.
