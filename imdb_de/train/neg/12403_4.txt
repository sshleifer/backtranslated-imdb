ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (9th) film of the series and shows the direction in which he was inevitably hit. Characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) would be up front and back. The rest of the cast also just ran the clock and collected their checks. The series would once again develop into this opportunity and have its moments, but a fatal decline had set in. Lewis Stone would continue to portray the character of JUDGE HARDY sympathetically throughout the series. The rest of the cast would be professional, though less and less is needed. Mickey Rooney, on the other hand, would continue his character as if there were no learning curve. The reaction of ANDYs to every situation was naïve and unbelievable. Even as he returned to LOVE LACHS AT ANDY HARDY (1946) as a World War II veteran, his response to any "teapot storm" was the same, youthful. This is clearly shown in this film. ANDY gets into some incredible situations that would have been solved with a simple explanation. This videotape machine was called an "idiot plot". A means to stretch a badly written scenario. Maybe it was less Mickey Rooney's fault than the director and the writers. Most likely, George B. Seitz had judged one too many, and a firmer hand was needed to control the excesses of Rooneys. For an overview of the entire series, go to YOU ​​ONE YOUNG ONCE (1937).
