I really can not say anything bad or bad about this thing. His characters are sympathetic enough, it is capable of producing and designing and looks professional (except the cheesy monster suit). However, it has no originality, no ideas and nothing you have not seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, cookie cutter, "greasy corporate drones in space against unstoppable monsters." Pretty much a waste of time.
