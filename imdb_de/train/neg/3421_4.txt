STAR EVALUATION: ***** The works **** simply miss the mark *** This little bit in between ** Afterwards * The pits <br /> <br /> Some plutonium disappear and some very unpleasant people Now you have the ability to develop a bomb capable of destroying most of the bomb - said Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his cocky young protégé Deke (Judson Mills, another actor from the previous film) with support from Josh's adopted daughter Que (Jennifer Tung) I wanted to stop her. <br /> <br /> This was another movie about terrorism one year after the events of September 11th. Norris himself was filmed in 2001 and later even commented on how sinister the film's plot resembled what happened that day in downtown New York. So there were those who were in the mood for a movie in which Norris and his side kicked a terrorist ass, if nothing else. Besides, it's as interchangeable as anything Norris has ever been. One wonders what the original has done to justify a sequel and whether it is possible to make it into a President's Man 3. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a Norris movie, you've all really seen them, and with this movie, nothing new or unexpected happens, but at least you know what you're getting and how I said it could be accurate that was what some needed to release some steam. **
