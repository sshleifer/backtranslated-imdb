Let me first say I saw this movie at midnight, and usually garbage was just around that hour, but this movie broke the record. but he can fuck all the girls who come on his way, for example he goes to a store, talks to a girl and then you see her f *** <br /> <br /> secondly there are a lot of sex scenes and in many of them there is no nudity at all, I would not be surprised if one of the characters in the movie said: Quick, put on your clothes, so we can fuck! Third, this film should show what sexual addiction can do to a man or a family. This film shows only a gentle, bad-looking erotic. I wonder why these actors were willing to play in such a trash
