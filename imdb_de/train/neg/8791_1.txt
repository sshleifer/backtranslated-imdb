Be warned! <br /> <br /> That's crap that other crap will not be with because he's among them! Okay, got that out of the way, let me say something more substantial. <br /> <br /> I saw Ashes of Time a long time ago when I thought it was a fresh take on the material, based on a novel-based Wuxia novel based on the rising reputation of director Wong Kar Wai. Nevertheless, WKW has not been able to adapt the novel on the screen in the opinion of many Wuxia fans. Mostly it's just footage of dripping water, beads of sweat, running horses, etc. I could not sit most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Fast forward many years later when I shot Mr. Wong's films again after receiving much praise, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his newest 2046. A friend told me to start with Chungking Express because it's his most accessible movie. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I let myself be persuaded to waste my time and money on this presumptuous nothingness. Some professional reviewers have mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern city, bla, bla, bla. It's okay if the director has a point of view and has something to say, why these things happen and what they say. But no, he only shows what is. Faye Wong's play is very typical of Hong Kong's style: mutilated utterances, deer in the spotlight with wide eyes, trying to look sweet and girly; The rest of the cast is equally unimaginative. <br /> <br /> I think the word Auteur is a euphemism for a director trying out something new and different. Yet he mastered the art of cinematic storytelling what Mr. Wong has been for 17 years!
