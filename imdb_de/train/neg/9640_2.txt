I've always been curious about this movie because it's so hard to find. When I stumbled over it on Ebay, I raised and bought the $ 10, now I understand why it is so rare! This movie is so bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget, that the credits showing all the cut scenes in which they played through their lines are literally the highlight of the movie. The film is about a clairvoyant (Pettyjohn, for an obvious reason, her topless scene), who uses his powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. When she pulls some sort of box like an object, the military casually throws it into the open cargo bed of a truck. A soldier guards him, and you know, what do you know? SURPRISE! A child in a foam rubber costume appears, kills the soldier immediately with a scratch over his face and flees to a nearby town. But instead of getting half of the district forces to find them and protect those in the public eye, let Pettyjohn and Ray find them alone. But no matter, this film has until then its full credibility. This hardly misses a choice of 1, just because I laughed unintentionally. Someone has to notify the producers of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they do not already know! 2 out of 10, really, really bad!
