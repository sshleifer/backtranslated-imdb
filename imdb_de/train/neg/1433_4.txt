The pictures are great and reflect well the landscapes of Canada. The story was rather boring on the other side; For me it was a love story in the forest, just as the Titanic was a love story on a boat. I do not feel that Gray Owl is a great environmentalist. I usually like Lord Attenborough, but this one was ... bad.
