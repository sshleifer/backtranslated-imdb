If there was a 0 star rating, I would like to return it to this horrible pile of garbage. The fact that the actual summary is perfectly alright and, if it had been done differently, could have been brilliant only makes it worse. The basic task of locking a group of people in an experimental chamber is good, but WHAT IS THE EXPERIMENT? All I see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture that I do not know or want to know ... The challenges are pitiful and stupid. Reality TV is about showing REALITY. If you face a "challenge," you must not let it play with over-the-top foods and stereotypical cultural elements in "Friday night games." make a real challenge. And how you can make money is fine if you actually earn it! These people are crazy. If only they would improve the show, the idea would be great. But that will not happen!
