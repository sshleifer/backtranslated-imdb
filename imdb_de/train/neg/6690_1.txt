I watched this movie with very low expectations with my friends. My expectations were not close enough. I honestly could not say which genre this movie was, and if it was a comedy, the humor was completely missed. The plot did not exist and the acting was horrible. My friends and I managed to watch about 30 to 40 minutes of this movie before we shut it down and immediately asked the video store to take it back. I can NOT recommend this movie to anyone unless you're deliberately trying to watch the worst movies of all time. I honestly do not know how this movie lasted more than a day in theaters, and I also can not understand why anyone would like to watch this movie, as it is not only very uninteresting, but also the absence of famous actors / actresses in his cast. This review is not a joke and I honestly think that this is possibly the worst movie ever made. It's certainly the worst movie I've ever eaten.
