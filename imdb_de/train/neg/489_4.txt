Acting is good, the women are beautiful and the men are good looking. So if you are looking for a well-functioning, soft porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you are wasting your time. The motivation of the main characters, especially the main actor of the same name, is often a mystery. She could have just told the truth - the truth in the film, rather than the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he had not committed. Was she protecting her father, who, so to speak, half went mad as he fiercely made a malicious complaint? Was she protecting herself with her reputation, which suddenly aroused concern, as yet only her art seemed to play a role? During the process, this strong-willed woman turns to mush before our eyes. Conversely, her lover, who begins as a narcissistic idiot, becomes an unselfish hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love. Since no good deed should go unpunished, we are told that she will never see him again.
