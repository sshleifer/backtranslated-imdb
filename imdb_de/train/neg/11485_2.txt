Prohibited siren is based on the game Siren 2 Playstation 2 (as many 2s). Like most video game films, I would say that the majority does not translate well into another medium. And that goes for this painful too. <br /> <br /> There is a rather long prologue that explains the story and provides the premise, and the mysterious island where a writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, the daughter, stand Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) move in. The villagers do not look too friendly, and soon there is sound advice on the siren on the island. When the siren starts to howl, they stay inside. <br /> <br /> Of course and slowly things start and our siblings embark on a mission that's going crazy, to see exactly what's happening on this unfriendly island with their alien inhabitants. But in truth you will not care what happens, folklore and fairy tales are thrown in to further confuse the conspiracy. What really drove her into the realm of bad comedy is the unintentionally badly placed moments that just made miserable giggles in their sheer stupidity, until later explained. It's one thing to try to present something clever, but another thing that makes it compelling and loopholing. <br /> <br /> Although it runs in less than 90 minutes, I think it's a horror movie phenomenon a runtime benchmark - there's almost two hours of slow construction to say what it wants. Things are starting to catch up in the last 20 minutes, but it's a classic case of not too late. <br /> <br /> What saves the movie is the way it changes the turnaround and its revelation in the end. Again, this is a common device that tries to turn a seemingly simple horror movie into something more special, hoping to thrill an audience. It turned out to be pretty satisfying, but leaves a bad aftertaste as you feel cheated. There are two ways in which you can feel yourself through a phrase - either the movie is lifted to a memorable level or you get that hokey feeling. Unfortunately, the banned siren was one of the latter. <br /> <br /> The salvation will be cinematography through the use of light, shadow, and mirrors, but I'll say that explicitly - it's still not worth it, so better to avoid it.
