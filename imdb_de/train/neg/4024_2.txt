This movie is just awful. Poor John Savage had to bend down so hard to be in another movie. He's playing a rare kind of vampire to help a lady who looks like a washout and is thrown into the streets, a dancer at a local strip club. She sourly tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires while they are carried around the floor of the locker room. Savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare vampire breed, who looks like a mix of '80s punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. Savage scrambles and dances with a dwarf with a tattooed spider on his head, one of the rare ones. He quotes the Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. That gets only rediculas. And the grossest special effects they might come up with are Corri throwing up her organs and pulling them out of her mouth. And you can say that's all to fake. Her son does not know what to do with his new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of serenity. I enjoy a good vampire movie, believe me, but I just hated it. Even the photography stinks, and the camera changes the camera that way, trying to make it look like the vampires are going too fast for the camera to keep up. Then, in the scene where Savage is chasing the son, the camera turns bright around Corri until he blinds himself. Avoid these !!
