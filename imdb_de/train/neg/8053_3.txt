As a premise, this hillbilly version of the Dead Calm plot had promise. <br /> <br /> The inability of director Eric Red to make a compelling hurricane, however, leads to a flood of continuity and lighting errors. <br /> <br Finally, the viewer is more fascinated by the bizarre weather effects than the intended plot. Intermittent thrusts from hamfisted-over direction also divert attention. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance, who does an Inzed Backwoods Hardass outfit, is doing his best to save the movie. But in the end, Undertow squeaks like a pig ... and has even more ham to offer.
