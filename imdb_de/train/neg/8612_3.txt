This was a movie that could be watched, but the plot was a bit weak and most of the jokes came from some of Rodney's earlier films. With that said, it was worth the time to watch. I rated this with 5 out of 10 points. Basically it's one of those movies that you will not miss to see, but if you find it in the subway, take a chance.
