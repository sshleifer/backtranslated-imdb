I say one more thing about this film: There are no breaks. You can not get bored if you see that. The problem is that it is too intense. There is too much action and it takes some rest! That's the risk you take in modern action movies. They want it interesting, but not overdone. This is way too over the top. <br /> <br /> Although the acting is fine and includes a few "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still has the feel of a "B" movie. The best part of it is Scheider's dialogue: the only "A" partner of this "B" movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality, but had some outstanding scenes. One was especially a very innovative scene with land mines. That was memorable. The other scenes were not enough to be a guardian for a long time.
