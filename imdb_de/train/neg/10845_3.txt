It was surprisingly a plot! ;) I've seen movies with less action (I do not want to mention Asian movies, but ...). I did not think the camera was bad for such a cheap movie and the atmosphere was not too bad either. There is no real reason for most things people do and how they react to what happens. I think about many movies, but of course it was awful in this case. <br /> <br /> It just ripped off some movies SO for single scenes. The acting was bad, but I have seen worse. The movie was bad, but I have seen worse. The reputation of this film is an experience between boredom, laughing fits, death wishes, sadism, horniness and entertainment at a low level. If you like bloody movies with stupid acts, this movie is right for you. <br/> <br/> I gave it 3/10 because it CAN be entertaining if you do not expect to see a good movie and you are in the right mood.
