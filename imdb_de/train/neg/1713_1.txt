If you have not seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you do not have it. A contest like "Make Your Own Horror Movie One Day" could not possibly make an entry than that indignation over insulting a viewer's intelligence. Mr. Sheets forgot a story, a plot, a proper dialogue, the fact that people need a BASIC acting talent, and the well-known lighting designer obviously forgot to show up. It seems to be recorded on the worst mobile phones and copied on even worse equipment. Make-up effect consists of black mascara for the zombies and yoghurt, which are poured over the heads of humans to simulate the melting of the skin. This is nothing more than a home movie and a really bad movie. Just fun for the friends, family members and neighbors who were ready to appear for the shoot. I can not understand why this mockery of a product is listed in a reputable film magazine or on a website. I have home videos of wedding parties that are much better and more interesting. A total waste of time, money and energy. The sequel ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just the same garbage.
