Dr. K. (David H Hickey) has tried to master a formula that stops all illnesses and disabilities, but he needs living donors to complete his work. His doctor-brother Richard (Dennis O'Neill) has a son named Eddie (Derek Philips), who is admitted to medical school. Eddie has a friend named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas), who is a prerogative and plans to attend law school this fall. She and Eddie resume their relationship when Sarah quits with her current boyfriend, who also deplores the wife of Walt (Bill Sebastian, Eddie's best friend, who recently paid for his cheating girlfriend's fraudulent job). Eddie accidentally gets hit by a car and appears on the death throats when Dr. K. Richard makes a proposal. Let him "recover" Eddie with his secret, illegal methods. If Dr. K applies his serum on Eddie, scare terrific results. Eddie's face bulges massive warts, while tasting of human flesh. Many will die for Eddie to satisfy that uncontrollable appetite he can not breastfeed. Soon he could even pose a threat to his father and his girlfriend. Eddie Monster has to be stopped. <br /> <br /> Typically, the terrible direct-to-video horror movie suffers from a serious lack of budget, acting and talent. The premise, which looks like an interesting fearful, can not even be executed as a zombie cry. The blood is limited to a few chewing scenes, but most of the violence occurs outside the camera. Using time to advance the story can be really annoying.
