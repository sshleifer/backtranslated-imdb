This is the most depressing movie I have ever seen. I saw it as a kid for the first time, and even now that I think about it, it really makes me nervous. I know it was at a time when life was hard, and I know these people were poor and the harvest was vital. Yes I understand. What I find hard to accept is that I can not remember a single moment of light throughout the movie. Maybe it was lifelike, I do not know. I'm pretty sure the acting was first class and the direction and quality of the filming etc. was wonderful and I know that every movie can not have a happy ending, but as a family movie that's bleak in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a movie. I can not stress enough how this movie influenced me as a kid. I talked about it recently and all the sad memories came back. I think it would be anything but the heartless grab for Prozac.
