I'm a big fan of the horror genre! I love horror / slasher / gore flicks of all kinds. Some of my favorites are the really "good" evil horror movies. But this movie has NOTHING to guarantee viewing !! I will not spend a lot of time talking about anything wrong with that. <br /> <br /> The script is awful. The spectacle is terrible. The FX are not even worth discussing. The "set" is an absolute joke !! The sad part is that I think there is real potential in some actors, but this vehicle left them NOTHING to work. <br/> I feel deprived !! The time you observe this would be better spent with your cat's floss.
