Where do I start? I find it very offensive to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie, and I expected this to be a brilliant movie, but I was so disappointed! The acting is terrible, the original Annie came out a few years before my birth. I'm 25 now and Annie is still one of my favorite movies. I was really excited to see Annie 2, was one of the characters originally? very poorly written, directed and acted. This is not a movie I would like to see again, and any Annie lover I recommend not to watch this movie because it just leaves you very disappointed. The singing of the young girls is not bad, but it still can not be compared to the original
