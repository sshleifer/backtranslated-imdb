Alone In The Dark is a bad movie and linked to Deuce Bigalow for the worst movie of the year. I wish that was ALL I had to say, but of course the IMDb dictates a word count and all that. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what a bad movie is a worse movie. A low-budget muck like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge budget shame like Gigli, Superbabies or that guff. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos because the director has no idea. Films like this happen because the director is a stupid, money-hungry idiot who simply does not interest his audience. <br /> <br /> It's more shocking to think that Uwe Boll (The mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has a real garbage under his belt) has created something that only happens once in a blue moon. The really terrible bad horror movie. Everything about it is a mess. Cheesy CGI, bad plot, crazy random camera cuts and awful soundtrack. Alone In The Dark is a terrible movie that nobody should see. Woo hoo! Review over Give me a bud, roll on 2006 and I'm never allowed to talk about it again. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this movie.
