Let's see ... I try to find the positive in everything, so what can I say about the Pallbearer? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances were - no, that will not work because they managed to deprive Gwyneth Paltrow, who is usually so alive, of all personality and to create caricatures of Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> <br / > Oh, how about the story? It will not fly because it could doze. What was the genre anyway? It was not funny, that excludes a comedy. It was not interesting enough to be dramatic. Was that a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, because I can not be sure - let's call it a "loser". I'm sure the filmmakers started with a vision, I mean, they probably had an attraction for the studio suits, but I need help to find them. Who could forgive the sheer stupidity of history, I could not with a clear conscience Recommend a movie that allows a man to conduct a professional interview in a windbreaker and messy, fluffy, stupid hair. Speaking of hair - should the intentional black roots and platinum locks that Hershey wears amuse us? <br /> <br /> What am I doing? I've already lost 97 irretrievable minutes watching the movie - I can not devote any more time to this loser.
