This movie was definitely not one of the best movies by Mary-Kate and Ashley. I really did not like it and somehow was disappointed in this movie. For some reason, it seemed like a movie they put together very quickly. In some places it got so boring that I had to rewind it. It had no bloopers or exciting parts like their other films.
