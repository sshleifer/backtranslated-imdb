WARNING! Do not look at this movie in any way. It's not even worth downloading from the internet. Every piece of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid. The so-called filmmakers apparently have no idea how to make a movie. They could not tell a good joke to save their lives. It is an insult to every human being. If you are looking for a movie full of fun, go elsewhere. Let's hope that this Mr. Unterwaldt (the "Jr." is a good indication of his obvious inexperience and intellectual childhood) dies a slow / painful death and NEVER makes a movie again. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's even a waste of time to WRITE EVERYTHING about this crap. That's why I stop right now and watch a good movie.
