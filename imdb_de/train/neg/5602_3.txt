"Pandemonium" is a horror movie parody that looks rather stupid than funny. Believe me, if I tell you, I love comedies. Especially comedy parodies. The trilogy "Airplane", "The Naked Gun", "Blazing Saddles", "High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that fool a particular genre. "Pandemonium" is not present with these films. For most of the scenes in this movie, I sat in stunned silence because the movie was not so funny. There are a few laughs in the movie, but if you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh more than a few times, and that's all this movie promises. Geez, "Scream" had more laughs than this movie and that was more of a horror movie. How bizarre is that? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
