I can not believe the positive reviews of this movie - I thought this was one of the worst, worst movies I've ever seen. And the conspiracy was completely ridiculous (sp?). She begins to go out with him while he is tied to the chair? Puh-lease The worst part was that it was not even bad in a good, ridiculous way. Just terrible - I could not understand why they even bothered to show it on HBO. I found Belushi silly stupid - very unbelievable as an "eccentric" hit man. idk, i could go on - again i am shocked by the positive reviews. The only thing that got me into it is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad. And the end did not disappoint in his stupidity! "Live with the sword, die with the sword ..." ridiculous.
