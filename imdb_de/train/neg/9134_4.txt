I tried to like this program. I really did. I even bought the pilot, first on VHS and later on DVD. However, I could not deal with this story because their two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed to fall in love with each other, on the one hand. I admit that it was a smart dialogue in the shows that was crucial to the success of the TV program, and I appreciated that dialogue very much. Basically, it was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the '30s and' 40s with a man against a woman. They get many discussions, allegations, screams and screams. Many people seem to love this kind of quibble, but I hate it, so I never got into the moonlighting car. <br /> <br /> Only Allyce Beasley as the hapless helper "Agnes" was entertaining. It's too bad she had so little air time. Shepherd was nice in the eyes, and I suppose women would say the same for Willis, but too much discussion between the two eventually put me off.
