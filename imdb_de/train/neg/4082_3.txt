This movie was just painful to look at ... not the good, dramatic way that makes you twitch with emotion in front of well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I did the last sentence quite a bit when I went along), but only in an absolutely boring for over two hours. Well, you all may think, I'm just an ignorant reviewer who does not respect Shakespeare and "artistic filming." Well, you would be wrong on both counts. I love the works of Shakespeare, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and Hamlet, and I've seen many arthouse films like the surreal and well-made Eraserhead and Fellini's 8 1/2. .. but that was just over two hours of Shakespeare lost in translation, WAY too much nudity (I can understand artistic nudity in some scenes ... but not in any other movie sequence!) NOTHING TO HISTORY !! !) and basically just overzealous film production. I had high expectations for this film because it was described as "very artistic" and was an adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but this was just an extreme flop. I gave this movie ONLY three because of the powerful presence of Sir John Gielgud (who far surpassed all the no-names in this film) and the combination of cinematography and stage design, because many scenes look like moving pictures. However, much of this film would have been better than just a painting with a scroll underneath. A real disappointment ... If Zeffirelli had received the director's chair, it would have been much better. But this is the opinion of a member of the audience, many others like it much more than me. However, if you can not find this in a nearby video store (currently not on DVD), try not to find it too far to find it ... it's not really worth it.
