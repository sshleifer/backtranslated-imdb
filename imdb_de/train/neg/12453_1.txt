I've always been a big fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman. When the sci-fi channel was running this movie, I had to see it. I was bitterly disappointed. This is a Wonder Woman movie that just bears the name of the right costume [she must have refused or arranged major changes] and the plot runs like a James Bond of a poor man. There are none of the things that made the comic heroine a success, ie the superhuman strength or the determined will I do not think Cathy is so attractive anyway. I would not waste your time with it.
