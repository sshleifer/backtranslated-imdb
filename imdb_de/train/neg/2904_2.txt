If you do not realize in the first 10 minutes of this movie that the main character writing a column for the Life Council will have the tables - oh, so skilful - and learn some valuable lessons for life yourself, then probably something is with you not OK. The setup is so predictable that it ruins the movie, even though the rest of the movie was good (which it is not). <br /> <br /> There's almost no chemistry between the leads and Steve Carells stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny. It's hard to believe that Binoche's character would have any interest in him. In the end everything is so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. Is not that great, America!
