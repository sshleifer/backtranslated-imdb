After too many bad memories, I had to skip this episode every time it appeared in season two. I looked at it recently to remind myself why. I have always thought this was the worst ST: TNG episode (with the exception of "Shades of Gray," which barely counts as one episode). <br /> <br /> I listen to the chunky dialogue and reflection from the scriptwriter's script 101 script in pencil: "SHOW, DO NOT!" From Deanna Troi's utterance and the constant elbow movements of everyone else about what a charming, dangerous rogue Okona is to Guinan's explanation of how witty her droid joke is (it is not), there is no such thing as a caring solution to the conflict. It's not a plot point which is not highlighted and threefold underlined for our edification, and there is no credible moment in it. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor under other circumstances, is too gorgeous to be the center of the machinations of the plot. On the other hand, none other than John Barrowman (Jack Harkness of "Doctor Who") could deduct a roll from this signed placeholder. <br /> <br /> (Zero points by the way While I think Joe Piscopo was not funny anymore decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to do here, even though the Jerry Lewis bite was silly in a stupid way.) < br /> <br /> On a good day, you can imagine this as a charming little tribute to a smaller episode of the original series. I would rather jump to "Time Squared" or "Q Who".
