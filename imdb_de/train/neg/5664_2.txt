I liked Boyle's performance, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Everything was exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Most actors talked like you expect your 9-year-old nephew to speak when he pretends to be a clumsy, stone-faced cop or an extremely vicious villain. The croaking voices seemed to me amateurish. I could buy a cheap synthesizer and make better opening music. And what about all the police police torture certificate? It was completely superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox added many things that he thought were really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. This is a big disappointment because Borges' stories make the stories so good because they are minimalistic - they are intimately connected, with no superfluous details. This movie is just the opposite. I stopped looking for the scene in which Lonnrot questioned the Yiddish guy. I wasted $ 4 on rent, but at least I can get some satisfaction in writing this report and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake.
