I should have known that I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the lead character. Words can not describe, nor do they live up to the terrible movie. But please allow me to describe it: terrible acts, terrible dialogues, crazy situations, and this gives you the feeling that you are force-feeding the beliefs and propaganda of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. It's a weak attempt to show Hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and contains a deep, religious message. They failed miserably. It was clearly the worst movie I have seen in a long time.
