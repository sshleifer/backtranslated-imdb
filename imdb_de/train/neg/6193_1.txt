I can not believe I just watched such a weak movie for an hour and a half. If there is only one movie to miss, this is the one. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father has recently passed away, so he starts hanging out with some local antisocial teens and taking drugs. All of which unconsciously makes him more violent, and finally such a subconscious explodes ... <br /> <br /> The first thing is that I do not think I can find any sense or a trace of great ecstasy in this film, not in any one single character. If the director sees what I have seen in the last few minutes as a great ecstasy, I have to say that this is not even close. <br /> <br /> The use of cinematography is also not mature. Most of the time, I could not see any facial expressions from the actors, and I did not feel that body language was enough to make an impact. Maybe the crew was just so tired that she fixed the camera there to record everything in the settings. All but the audience are happy. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly weak. There are a lot of disconnected scenes and speeches that might be related, but they are really so random that you can never contract them unless you are the one who wrote them. <br /> <br /> In the hour and a half, you can find real acting less than 5 minutes, and at other times there are only people who walk, talk and move. So I really can not say anything about acting. <br /> <br /> Good music selection in the last few minutes. Maybe this is the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I have never given a movie a 1, but this movie definitely deserves it (at least you laugh when you see Scary Movies). This is a film about a failed attempt to portray troubled teens and an extremely disturbed audience. I hope you will not fall into any group.
