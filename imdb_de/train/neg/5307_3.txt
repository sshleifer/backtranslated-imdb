What happened? "Doubt" had so much potential to be a brilliant movie - instead he wavered with a sluggish simple storyline that made me stop watching. The only thing the film had was the glory of Meryl Streep, who did not deserve the DOUBT Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of her best achievements, she nevertheless gave us a solid and truthful character that blossomed through the canvas. <br /> <br /> However, even the brilliance of a screen legend could not keep this movie from going downhill. From the boring start, which had neither strength nor clout - to a not very convincing end - the film was really a disappointment - especially since he offered so much potential through his advertising and trailer. It was obvious that the director had difficulty with the simplicity of the plot, and he ended up with a boring movie that went on too long, with too much talk and too little action. <br /> <br /> Also, the other Oscar nominations were less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour gave Hoffman a decent performance, he was by no means Oscar-worthy. (Especially because they have completely omitted performances like Will Smith in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like a cardboard box - one-sided and simple. It would have made more sense to nominate her for a Razzie, as I'm sure she would have gone away victorious. Viola Davis gave a short but true performance, but because of her length I wondered if the academy should have named her. Overall, I consider Doubt to be one of the most disappointing movies. It was a mess of a movie with so much potential and I do not recommend it. The only bright light in the film is Meryl Streep, who delivers an impressive, solid performance - not even enough to save this movie. *** / 10.
