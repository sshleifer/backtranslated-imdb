A big disappointment. This was one of the best British thrillers / detective shows of the 90s, which developed the fascinating title character of the Scottish Robbie Coltrane. However, this one-time event has little to add and may suffer from an unavoidable disappointment due to heightened expectations when a favored show returns after a long break. Coltrane does not really have much to do, much more attention is devoted to the uninteresting killer, and what he has to do he seems uninvolved, almost bored. The story of the ex-soldier is written by the books, and trying to bring us up to date about Coltrane's family life seems light-headed. If the authors had a whole series ahead of them, and not just this two-hour show, they would have written it with much more depth. Skip this and look at the old cracker from the 90s who is far superior.
