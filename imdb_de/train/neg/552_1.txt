I sat almost an episode of this series and just could not take it anymore. It felt like I had seen dozens of episodes, and then it hit me ..... There's nothing new here! I heard this joke on Seinfeld, I saw someone fell for friends, an episode of Happy Days had almost the same story, ect. None of the actors is interesting here! Some have been good at other shows (not here), and others are new to a job they should never have gotten into. Avoid this stinker!
