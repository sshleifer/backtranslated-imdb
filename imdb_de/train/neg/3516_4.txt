It is beyond question who in this film dominated the training of cadets: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to the military discipline of creating a new kind of soldier from his cadets - the Bombardier. But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his mind about the value of women working in the military. He is tough when it has to be, but at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor that he has perfected in other films. His character is the basis of the plot around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems to be natural in the role and plays it fine. Two things help this film: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular end of the special effects.
