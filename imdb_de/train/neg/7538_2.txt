I saw this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, I found it weird and completely pointless ... so I decided to turn around a bit and get the 70s copy of it in my hands. Impressive. what a difference. The original was much better. I want you all to know that it originally made a statement. Their existence had a purpose. It was really the Christian public that expressed their fear of paganism. As you delve deeper into it, comments are also made about life, but I do not want to go into details. If you've been disappointed and want to know what it's supposed to look like, you can look at the 70's version, a bit dated but much better.
