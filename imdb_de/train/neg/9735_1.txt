I struggled so well I could sit all the way through this irritating mess, but I just could not. Brad Dourif was absolutely at the end and the side cast was only slightly worse. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is just ridiculous, from the terrible acting over the ridiculous FX to the stupid conspiracy. Do not bother root canal therapy would be more enjoyable. Bamboo chips under the fingernails would be much more pleasant. <br /> <br /> Watching a Uwe Boll movie would only be a little bit worse. Do you get an idea?
