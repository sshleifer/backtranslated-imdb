INSPECTOR GADGET (1999) ** <br /> <br /> Performers: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 minutes Rated PG <br /> <br /> By Blake French : <br /> <br /> Disney's new film "Inspector Gadget" is about a policeman named John surviving a serious accident and being rescued by a state-of-the-art experimental operation that turns him into a robot-like agent He has tools and fixtures of all kinds built into his body when he says "Go Go," just to be called Inspector Gadget! <br /> <br /> The actual structure of the film is similar to the body shape of Inspector Gadget itself. It is loud, fragmented, energetic and consists of a series of half-hearted apparatuses that are thrown together to create something that does not deal with much common to other objects. Essentially, the film consists of a series of crazy action sequences combined with characters, and an uneven story that would only appeal to children between 6 and 9 years of age. <br /> <br /> The policeman, who is being dramatically reinvented, is played by Matthew Broderick, who was on the road to success with "Election" until "Inspector Gadget". His character becomes Inspector Gadget after a meeting with the hard-nosed villain of the movie called Claw. He is played by Rupert Everett, who has already experienced a disaster this year with the terrible "William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream". <br /> <br /> In this movie there is a romantic subplot as well as an abundance of scenes Inspector Gadgets crazy body parts and mechanism elements. Gadget and Claw drool over the attractive Brenda character, played by Joely Fisher, both for her looks and for her knowledge of a specific invention of her late father, who was previously killed by Claw. The competition is developing into battle scenes and a reason for many events in the film. A main character is also the gadget Mobil, a life like a car designed for Inspector Gadget itself. It is by D.L. Hughly from the sitcom comedy "The Hughly's". <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" is a movie that I thought was pretty bad. I know, I'm not exactly a target audience of filmmakers, but even my ten-year-old relative found the film for his dislike. The film is full of shortcomings and obvious problems. I never cared about the characters. There is no mood, apart from some nice credits, in contrast to the much worse movie "Mr. Magoo" from the year 1997, which was opened with clips of the original cartoon. Is it too much to ask for the same kind of stuff in this comedy - which is rarely funny and hardly ever convincing. The entire production design is nothing more than a jumble of incomplete visual gags and consists of a joke: Inspector Gadget's hummelige stupidity. In movies like these, the audience craves borders - something to find out what can happen and what can not. In "Inspector Gadget" there are no such limits. This is truly nothing more than a party time for the actors, who certainly had a lot of fun. I remember another comedy missing a couple of years ago, called Blankman, which once again contained a lot of props and energy, and the actors certainly had fun with all the things and props, but there was something missing for every movie as well audience. <br /> <br /> One character I found out as a hilarious is Gadget's daughter, who still has no idea what her name is at the end of the movie. It is used only as a plot - and I wonder how it was used to drive the plot. Because their presence does not bring the film anything relevant or productive. We never know her reactions to the surgery or accidents of her father. So this is someone who would have been left out and did not influence the movie a bit. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to say that "Inspector Gadget" is a terrible, inadequate apology for a children's comedy. Believe it or not, I compare this movie with last year's violent and very young audience action image "Blade". I say again, I'd rather have a movie in which nothing happens than in one where everything happens. "Inspector Gadget" had so much to offer at the same time that it literally made me dizzy. <br /> <br />
