This movie had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck seriously did NOT attempt to act in any form, form or form. He totally sucked. Nothing about the movie was believable. The first problems were in the intro, where the Salvation Army man Santa Claus gives everything of value, but it does not show why. And then the grandma puts her head in the oven - really nice and has absolutely nothing to do with the film - it is not even in the same tone as the film. There was no explanation for the motivation for Ben Affleck to choose the house he chose; There were no credible reactions from the family he chose. and people are influenced here and there without there being any reason to influence themselves (example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's characters are slipping down a steep slope - this is the incident that suddenly makes them fall in love with him one or two funny moments - but they were a rarity in the movie, it seriously needed another revision (or 4), I hope you like it!
