The film was seen while Nicolson was on the screen. However, I had to fight boredom when the movie depended on Meryl Streep for scenes without Jack; She was as bland as possible. The relationship between the characters was nothing special; these characters have been shown earlier - and much better. It felt like it was a scenario based on real life, in the very worst sense: 90% of everyday life is boring and it's not worth writing or watching over it. Why Ephron felt that her life and her relationship with Carl Bernstein was so interesting that I could write about it escapes me. Maybe she wrote it as therapy - for many authors it's a cathartic thing to put an episode out of her life on paper. Well, but why anyone in Hollywood was worth anything to film this story remains a mystery to me.
