Is this the "worse" Star Trek TOS episode? Maybe it will at least get my vote as the lowest 5. I mean, this episode makes absolutely no sense. Do you see something that drives you crazy? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feeling, the music is amplified, almost forced to amplify a sense of stress, to the point where it bugs. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, higher beings like Triskelion or something else than Medusin. These aliens are very boring to make an episode. McCoy pronounces his famous phrase, "Hey's Dead, Jim." Spock puts on the goggles when he carries the ambassador away, but Kirk does not. They're boring for the third time through this crazy "barrier" that I can remember. At least the next episode of Season Three would be "Specter Of The Gun" and "Day Of The Dove" and others to follow. So Trek is a decent show syndicated. Personal observations, Trek loved to use the color purple, a kind of pink purple. When they are in the hall outside the compartment, the normally gray gangway is now purple. We never had a violet bridge, but it's interesting to see I've noticed it in several episodes, it's been done by a light filter and it works very well, but in this episode the ship's corridor is pretty lame.
