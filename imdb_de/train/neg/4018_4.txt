This movie is too skeletal. It's a pretty cheap movie (hopefully!) That apologizes for it, but the lack of a good cast and a sophisticated plot hurts it too much. Phillips is quite believable in his role as a tattered son of a wealthy family looking for himself (though his family is ... um ... a bit too white ...), but the rest of the cast is reaching for straws. Any moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama, and there are * too * much too many bargains (which is an obvious sign of deficits, they needed filler ...) I would not recommend this movie to anyone either Hardcore Phillips fan, he still has * nothing * to do. 10.4.
