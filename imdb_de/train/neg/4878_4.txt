If you want to make a movie like this, the threat must be real. Do not wrap your Patsy with a few bonzos. There is no credibility here. The plot is boring and unbelievable. The spectacle is even worse. I thought I saw Arthur Lake (Dagwood), who is one of the worst actors in history when I saw the main character. Well, at some point he has to face the music and get angry. I do not care. Do you? There are all these long scenes in this austere office (cardboard or masonite furniture). People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most actions take place in five minutes. After that it is over. Do not bother.
