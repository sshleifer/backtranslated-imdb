I saw "My Bollywood Bride" the most at the IAAC New York Film Festival today, and had to make the theater rise up because of nausea. I've seen Bollywood movies and watched satire Bollywood movies. This film could not decide which movie he wanted to be, so he was joking on himself. <br /> <br /> The film was apparently copied from films like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling a sloppy, lazy job here , How can Bollywood ever be weaned from its determination to stick to overused, well-worn fonts? Is not there anyone who can bring to light the millions of real, fascinating stories that surely exist and evolve in the land of a billion people? The over-intelligent car driver, the cow on the road, free scenes from strange places, pointless scenes from the streets of Mumbai, they are all there. Any clich√© about India has been faithfully recorded. So disgustingly predictable. Pooh!!! The acting performance is weak at all levels except Neha Dubey, who is talented and beautiful. One wonders why she would choose such a project.
