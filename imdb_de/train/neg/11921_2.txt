I can sum up this movie with 20 words or less. Far too predictable for a story with the potential to be funny, however, falls flat on his face. You see, 19 words, but I did not turn this strip around completely with just one star, but chose two stars instead, because Julie Bowen smoked hot and gave me enough eye candy, so I can not tear up the DVD directly out of the device and blow up with an M80. My advice, take the $ 4.00 rental fee you would have paid to watch this movie and send it to me directly as a thank you for saving yourself time and frustration when you have to sit through this train wreck, or you may wish to send I would have paid the $ 50.00 replacement fee if you had taken out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as a skeet-shooting exercise.
