My dear sir, what a movie! First, let's talk about the "special effects". Do not get me wrong, I'm not one of those effect fanatics, but I really thought the overlay was a practice of the days gone by, mostly the '60s. I thought they had recorded this movie some time ago, and it took ages for it to be edited and edited. But as far as I know, they did not have cell phones in the 60s ... <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for in movies is basically a good story with a really good message. Acting is secondary, effects are secondary, a few minor inconsistencies I do not care. In movies like this bad drama, unbelievableness etc. this makes a bad movie even worse - that's what happened to the Celestine Prophecy. <br /> <br /> My wife said the book is really really good and even though I'm not in it all spiritually, I can somehow see that it can be credibly brought over - the movie did not do that. <br /> <br /> There might be a single reason to watch this though. If you really love cheesy movies, this is for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality, I MUST have rated this movie with ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are three stars for the fact that there are worse movies, such as "Critical Mass". (look in the comments to this one - weird). The Celestine Prophecy is entertaining, at least to a degree.
