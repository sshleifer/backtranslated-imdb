Protégé is linear; Do not expect any speedy action, and you will not be able to catch your breath, because there are simply no moments when you are sitting on the edge. <br /> <br /> There is no big sticking point, so do not expect either one. I would not complain about the acting - the show would have been much worse if Wu's acting was not the only salvation of the film. And, oh, this cute little girl. <br /> <br /> The humor is at best weak and the show needs to go as well as an anti-drug campaign using the usual shock tactics (especially in the scenes with Zhang) to tell us things that we already know - ie drugs break families, heroin drives you crazy, it is not so easy to move away, you will be in a vicious circle. <br /> <br /> I think the show is far from seamless and uneven (* SPOILER ALERT *): Take Andy Lau to the police station, for example: What have we been told? I've had all the ribbons and evidence against you since 1997. And so he was caught. No, no chase action, just a scene change that undermined Wu's role as underdecker. I suspect that the lack of creativity is due to the fact that it is after all a production of Mediacorp Raintree, a production company from Singapore.
