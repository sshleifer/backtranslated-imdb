While it cracks the weird good joke, the humor is generally quite dry, with members of the panel often pulling faces or using coarse language and waiting for the crowd to applaud jokes lame enough. Another comment says, I do not think so This is the best RTE ever made, it is really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of joke, there are few really funny, smart gags that would really make you laugh. People seem to be convinced of the comedians' well-known names instead of judging the quality of the gags that are not so good. All in all, mediocre with some good laughs, but often it can be quite mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allen's. I think Benny Hill is funnier.
