I'm sure deep in the niches of Jack Black's mind, the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely funny, but no, it is not. You can tell the old Jacks that they have a whale hammer playing a smarmy, slimy Mexican monk who dreams of becoming a wrestler, but this movie is a total failure in almost every single department. <br /> <br /> I was sitting in the main part of the movie thinking, "Is this funny?" and "This is the type of Tenacious D, right?". The truth is that this movie has NOTHING to offer. EVER! It's a lousy script with crappy characters and really neat acting and directing. You'll see endless moments when you think something funny happens, but it just does not happen. I was bored, stupid for about 10 minutes, but it would certainly improve. Did not do it 90 minutes later I had barely managed to ward off an aneurism that was so painful. <br /> <br /> It's as if I remember years ago, when you would see anything with your favorite actor in it, even some of them the early pap of yore, when they were famous, and you would be really embarrassed that the actor actually had that much plop. Yes it is. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Jack Black's earlier films like Shallow Hall and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny, but come on, man. If you do that again with us, Jack, then I have to go there and hammer your kneecaps or something. At least there is a serious conversation. <br /> <br /> I know it's a clich√©, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for so many reasons ...
