POSSIBLE SPOILER <br /> <br /> The spy who steals me is a much overrated and overheated sequel. The international mystery came out of the blue. It was a single star that few people had heard of. But it was amazingly original, had a strong sense of humor and a strong sense of humor, always tasteful and brilliantly cast. The Spy Who Shagged Me has been promoted and hyped much more commercially. <br /> <br /> OK, I admit, when I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was very funny, but only after I saw it or three times that you see all the flaws. Acting was okay, but Heather Graham can not act. Her performance did not seem very convincing and she was not nearly as good as Liz Hurley in the first one. The characters that flourished in the first part (Scott Evil, number 2, etc.) are brought into the background and do not hear many independent scenes. The movie is simply overrun with cameos. <br /> <br /> I particularly hated it, as they have completely ignored some scenes in IMOM. When they killed Vanessa at the start and left Basil sitting, he knew she was a Fembot all the time. What was the point of it? They killed number 2 in the first one, and now they're bringing it back without any explanation. This is supposed to be a spy freak, I do not think any of the characters in the movie even hold a gun. It's only on one track, farther from the point. <br /> <br /> The new characters are very undesirable. The whole Mini-Me, who makes fun of my size, gets old very fast. Fat Bastard is just a lame excuse for gross humor. Overall, there are about two or three good jokes. The rest is either tasteless or warmed up by IMOM. <br /> <br /> If this was the first movie in the series, I would probably be easier. However, the series started with a dry joke and then dropped to a degree of humor. So, I say, just watch this movie if you have not seen its predecessor yet, because the spy that steals me is an ultimate disappointment.
