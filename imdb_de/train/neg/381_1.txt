This film is traditional Bollywood cuisine in terms of star power, sentimentality and the love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me about this movie was the absurd notion of surrogate mothers. A whore who receives a child with someone after having sex with the man (the family that wants a child) is not a surrogate mother. She is also not a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I've seen Indian movies and TV shows that worked smarter on that topic 10 to 15 years ago. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and absolutely implausible. I realize that most Bollywood movies are not plausible, but they do not. This movie wants us to emulate with the characters, but that can not happen with such a ridiculous conflict. I would have expected better from Abbas and Mustan.
