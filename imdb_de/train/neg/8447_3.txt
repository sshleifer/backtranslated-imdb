I do not know what I've missed here, but I can not believe all those positive comments from so many people in this movie. I thought it was stupid and a little over the top. I liked the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, but the others were just ... boring. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movies, I really do, but that was a bit further down the alphabet. I've seen someone compare humor and horror with "Army Of Darkness" and "Shaun of the Dead" as well as "Equivalent to the re-animator". You are joking. I did not find this movie funny, he tried, he tried hard (maybe too much effort), but in my opinion he failed. By the time I was hit with the third or fourth One-liner, I rolled my eyes and looked at my watch. <br /> <br /> There have definitely been tributes to several other films, which is always cool, kind of an inside joke for us horror fans. But this may have been due to a lack of original thoughts. Although there were a few nice special effects, good Gore, but that can not carry a whole movie. The mutant Grant looked like a cross between Jabba the Hut and the early stages of the mutation - Chet of "Weird Science" (after being turned into the monster) and one of the alien creatures / children of "The Explorers". It just did not work. I thought it looked like something a 5th year child in art class could have designed. Then there was Brenda, the woman Grant had impregnated and chained in the barn. When the help finally arrived, it looked like a huge tick waiting to be pounded. The design was completely unimaginative again. A round, flesh-colored balloon with a face in the middle. * Yawning * <br /> <br /> Now to the Zombies: The more movies I see these days with zombies, the more I wish George A. Romero had a patent on them and was the sole author / director who was entitled to films about her. Except for Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, he's the only one who did it right (but that was a comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but it was a different zombie style. Maybe Mr. Romero has ruined every zombie movie for me because he's so awesome to moan, moan and upset his actors as if their joints were dehydrated and lacking a drop of synovial fluid and their muscles fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis, which had just begun before being revived. The people of "Wheelsy" just did not have the right motivation ... they were terrible zombies. <br /> <br /> At the end I give "Slither" a 3, for a few laughs and some nice gore scenes.
