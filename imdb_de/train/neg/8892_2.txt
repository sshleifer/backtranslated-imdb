I have to admit that this version shames Shakespeare! Nobody can do anything except the nurse who was my favorite! Juliet had good abilities as a teenager, but she can not give her lines emotional depth and we can never connect with her. It's worse when she does the scene as she thinks about drinking the sleeping potion ... God, stop moaning! I would have poured it into her mouth to silence her! Anthony Andrews ... yikes! Considering his other great films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), he is a real shock in this film. And do not bring me to Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It's still good to see if you're on the hunt to see all the Romeo and Juliet ever made in movie history. The version of Olivia and Leonard is still the best, followed by the version of Leslie Howard and then by Leo and Clare!
