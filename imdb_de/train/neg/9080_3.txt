Well, I just ordered it at my pay-per-view at home because I was bored and needed a laugh. I have to admit, I laughed a couple of times, but I do not even know where they were. I do not understand why this movie was made. It claims to be a comedy, but seriously I do not find a singing penis or a 70-year-old woman very funny. This film has attempted to integrate into the "tough" comedies of recent years, such as American Pie and Road Trip, but it failed miserably. It was too much, then it was a comedy. Why did Cameron Diaz record her name in this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I found it sexy and enjoyable and well done. Also, avoid this movie. 3.10
