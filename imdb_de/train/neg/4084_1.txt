From time to time you hear radio DJs who invite listeners to nominate films that the listener can not stand or that he has never seen. This is the movie I'm thinking about ... days later. <br /> <br /> It has something to do with a play by Shakespeare. I'm not sure, but I think I've been in this movie for about 20 minutes. I think I realized that my toe nails are not pinching, and they looked at me imploringly to have me cut off. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed boring and overbearing. <br /> <br /> Even if this is the first movie I've given such a low score (which I've actually tried to watch), I would not do that. I'd like to hear from other films by English director Peter Hold Greenaway. I remember thinking that his "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" was a really great British movie, even though its content was sometimes an upset stomach - a brilliant movie, but I can understand why People would not look at this. <br /> <br /> Another good movie by Greenaway was "A zed and two noughts". Again, it had content that exceeded the bounds of good taste but was intriguing. <br /> <br /> The other movie I usually think about late for such radio show themes is "Brazil". I never managed to watch this all the way through either falling asleep! <br /> <br /> If you're not looking for some idiosyncratic films that are disgustingly highly stylized, tedious and hard to follow, then steer clear of Prosero's books.
