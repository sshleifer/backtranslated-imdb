This movie is more deceptive than ever. Using an exciting-looking actor like Walken for this piece of junk gave the impression of having nothing better to do than playing a boring role like this one! And the fact that the film should be a witch can only be seen at the end of the film. But you must now sit down and watch this boring movie as it comes in or try to understand the meaning. You have to go through all this way of boring actors and actresses all the time thinking about how you have gone over another movie and opted for decided that movie and how you've just cut your money, which makes useless all the time there. I'd rather watch cartoons, for God's sake. Please leave this alone!
