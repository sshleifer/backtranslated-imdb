I'll be honest - the reason I rented this movie was because I'm a big fan of Kyle Chandler (especially the Early Edition). Since he usually plays the good, I wanted to see him in another role (out of curiosity). The act itself also attracted me; A Wanna-be Hitman (Tony Grecoa.k.a., Mr. Chandler) must arbitrarily kill a person before he becomes familiar with the life, or rather, the death of a witness who testifies against someone in the "family". The films did not meet my expectations. It was sick, I hated the end (if you had seen it, would you know why), and there were so many unnecessary parts. Basically - it was dirty and made little sense. Yes, it was a mob movie, and yes, the guns go BOOM. But a movie has more to offer. This movie looked like he did not have the time to go into detail - just deal with it and understand it. Acting really made up for it - James Belushi was quite amusing as "The Rose". Sheryl Lee made Angel seem as credible as she could. She surprised me the most. And Kyle Chandler was also a staunch newcomer to "The Family." If only the script would suit the actors.
