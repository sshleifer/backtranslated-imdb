Hunters chase what they believe a man through the forest, though the public sees that he is a werewolf. The hunters do not seem to notice, because after they shot him, he looks normal if they behead him. A doctor transplants the eyes of the werewolf into a man who has lost his own eyes in the laboratory. The man, Rich, can have sex with his sister (Stephanie Beaton) even before he removes his bandages. <br /> <br /> After leaving the hospital, he realizes that his wife has cheated on him as well. When a fog machine sends clouds past an amateur image of a moon (with a false tree branch in the foreground), it becomes a werewolf! His torso gets bigger and splits his shirt, and he grows a huge werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in his eyes. His pants remain intact. The mouth does not chew convincingly, although sometimes a kind of robotics (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows gives it a bad look. Despite the poor werewolf costume, there is a lot of blood and blood, and they are pretty well done. There is even a pretty good beheading later in the movie. However, when a man falls from a great height, a pretty bad dummy does the job. Rich has a friend named Siodmak, who is a kind of occult expert, and also happens to stumble upon a little man crutches called Androse, who is also such an expert. They try to help him. <br /> <br /> Rich kills people who did him wrong. A police officer investigates the murders and tries to attack Beaton, who is not interested in lesbian scenes, so none of this. <br /> <br /> Pretty cheap, but between nakedness and blood and blood and not history - the most dangerous game with the hands of Orlac and the Wolfman, it's a bit entertaining. Sold individually or as a set Scream Queens Vol. 1
