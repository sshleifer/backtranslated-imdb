Anyone who wrote the "nice" post about it must have been a friend of these guys. This is bad even for wrestling in the backyard. In fact, this is not even a backyard wrestling, but a few guys meeting on a trampoline. Every man is about 45 pounds wet and there is no ounce of entertainment value in this one. It's only a few bored kids who even give the court guards a bad name, if that's possible. If you want to see a fun backyard wrestling, get Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. It shows the two biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. They have actually left since then and have been professionally trained to become "real" wrestlers. They have become real and have become better. I recommend the two guys. MDogg is crazy and off the hook. So do not waste your time or money on this crappy DVD, there are "better" backyard videos.
