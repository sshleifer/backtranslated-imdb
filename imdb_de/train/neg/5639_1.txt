I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing rave reviews, but I think the critics were just busy with Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who attended the festival. It's definitely the slowest movie I've ever seen, with lots of pointless, ridiculously long scenes of nothing. Apart from Defoe, who was decent, the acting of the two and a half others in the film, including Defoe's wife Giada, was ridiculously horrible (as they do not play the role of the saleswoman in the bakery). This film is less plotted with a lame attempt to be abstract and detached. The only scene that triggered any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came out of nowhere, as if it shocked the stupidity that this film is. I'm sorry that I'm so tough, but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema, but this film is not worthy of admissions.
