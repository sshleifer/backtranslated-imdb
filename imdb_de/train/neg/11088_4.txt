This is an OK movie, but it's either really emotional or story telling. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually no, no real tension. <br /> <br /> Washington is believable in the lead role, but he's asleep, there's no scope for playing muscles that work for him or the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> The story just drops off A bit flat, although I've never heard of the title character, the end was obvious, but unlike other films about such injustices, it has no emotional impact. They do not really care about him and the motivations of the outsiders are more academic than worried about his well-being. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to spread emotions with the boy outside, who adores the hero Carter, but that seems to be enforced. <br /> <br /> It's an OK movie, but forget it right away.
