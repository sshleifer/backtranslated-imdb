This collection is really shit! <br /> <br /> I rented them because I thought I really wanted to fight. Man that sucked! Fast, eye-catching cuts, an extremely annoying spokesman, and the fights themselves had been heavily overhauled and shortened (especially the fight of Jet Li in Fists of Legend and Jackie Chan's fight of drunken Master 2). > <br /> And what about these street fighters?! What's so "cool" about that? I have seen more interesting battles over martial law! <br /> <br /> This is a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap! <br /> <br /> Instead, you should buy the films that make up the fights and the fights in their uncut fame!
