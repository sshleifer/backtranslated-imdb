The script is nice. Although the casting is absolutely unobservable. No style. The costumes do not look like High Highbury society. When I compare Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale, all I can say is that Mrs Beckinsale speaks British English better than Mrs Paltrow. Mr. Northam is undoubtedly the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he is romantic and not at all sharp and unfeeling as Mr. Knightley in the TV version. The viewer can not see Mr. Elton-M at all. Smith's relationship is the same as in the Motion version, so you can not understand where Emma was trying to make an Elton Smith match (apart from the portrait).
