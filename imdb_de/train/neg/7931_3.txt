The blast from TV stations must be eternally grateful to Randolph Scott Western's production line, as one of Randolph Scott's seemingly one hundred film sequences must be played on at least one no-budget channel at any one time. <br /> <br /> "Man Behind The Gun" is a typical early 1950s melodrama with pre-World War II production values, which relies on a historically-recent murder mystery plot with action scenes to deny the complete absence of Screenwriting development of the script and thus camouflage the lack of tension. In the coming years, the role of these films would be taken over by television programs such as "Gunsmoke", "Bonanza" etc. - and this work actually did the job better. Randolph Scott, who looks particularly gruesome here, is the good guy who fights the bad guys he'll eventually prevail against. There is no interest in what he experiences emotionally, except in what his horse feels, unless you are wondering if he will resolve the initial misunderstanding with the female leader to the end. The music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the "characters" than the actors. But it is good if your boat is swimming; and I would not berate you for enjoying "diagnosis, murder". <br /> <br /> Workmanlike, pedestrians and fast aging. 3 stars for competent company; 0 for artistic efforts.
