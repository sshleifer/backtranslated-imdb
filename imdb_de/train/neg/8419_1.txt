I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for a long time ... which is with all the rave reviews, nominations and media attention. And I have to say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really did portray the black music scene back then. At the end of the film, me and my whole family were bored out of our minds. The singing always came one after the other. I mean seriously, just a music number and it would even be broken with RENT. <br /> <br /> Also, I have not found any character development on any of the characters; I just did not care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of an overdose of drugs, I knew that I should have been sad, but I could not feel any emotions for that character. The characters got a bland background about singing in their childhood and so on, but the personalities were not revealed enough to involve me. which goes hand in hand with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copycat movie based on Ray, Chicago and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). All in all, I think this film would be best suited to someone who does not really care about the overall story, but still enjoys two hours of entertaining and fun vocal performances.
