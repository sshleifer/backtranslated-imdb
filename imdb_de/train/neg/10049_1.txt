I love the often abused "Masters of Horror" series. Horror fans live in a constant lack of food. Projects like this one (and the similar "Greenlight Project" in which we gave "Feast" - like it or a lump) are the source of wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors, whose horror is the development of maturing processes for us, the we develop, aim for I love to dine on horror. <br /> <br /> This started with a kernel of the Real Kool idea and ran ... right on the edge of "Where in the world am I going with it?" "<br /> <br /> I do not know how to spoil the spoiled, but" SPOILER AHEAD "All of a sudden ... no, there used to be the light that used to drift across the night sky ... we have long time haired luminescent aliens (huh? ... HUH?) brain-piercing men and ... yeah, I understand it, but ... well ... the worst curse of storytelling - a rousing and promising setup without any worthwhile dissolution. <br /> <br /> Cue to Storyteller ... Your build must have a payoff that exceeds the build-up, not the other way around. Storytelling math 101. <br /> <br /> End of Spoilers - Big Oops!
