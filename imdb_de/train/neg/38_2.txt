or anyone who prayed for the sight of Al Cliver wrestling a naked, 7 foot black guy into a full Nelson, your movie is here! Film starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group demanding a $ 6 million ransom to be delivered to her island hideaway. What they do not expect is the robust Vietnam veterinarian Peter Weston (Cliver), who is hired by a movie producer to rescue the girl. And what they really did not count on is a local tribe that likes to offer young women with bloodshot beetle eyes to their monster cannibal god. <br /> <br /> Pretty much the same shooting as CANNIBALS, this one as far as the entertainment value is concerned, the price is a bit better, thanks in particular to a hilarious dub track and the incredibly silly bumbling monster (Franco confirms that they were split ping-pong balls in the interview on the CD). Franco receives a strong EuroCult cast, including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most scratchy things I've ever seen, as a guy who is not quite himself). The movie shows tons of nudity and the blood (Tempra color variation) is there. The highlight for me was the slow fist fight of the world between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the waves. Unfortunately, old Jess fills up this hour for an amazing (and sometimes distressing) 1 hour and 40 minutes if it takes 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> In most cases, the Severin DVD looks pretty good, but in some darker scenes there are some weird ghosting. Also, a long section of the dialog is in Spanish without subs (this is an option, but only if you hear the French track). Franco gives a nice 16-minute interview about the film and has a lot more fun to report about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.
