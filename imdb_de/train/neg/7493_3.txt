I could not believe my eyes when I saw Nuremberg on Dutch television yesterday. It starts very slowly, the background of the Nuremberg Trials becomes clearer step by step, the Germans have a funny English accent, but suddenly in the last minutes of the first part of the series the audience is most seen shocking, horrible material that I have ever seen have. <br /> <br /> It's important that people see such material (although I totally disagree that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this material), but in this movie it was completely ridiculous. It should only enhance the effect of a regular television series. It should shock the audience, which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to convince us with successful scenes, inspirational dialogues or interesting points of view, the audience is tortured with horrible images of prisoners from skin and bones. It shows no respect for the victims of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> I'm very angry.
