I've searched everywhere for video stores to find this movie, the big Elvis fan that I am, and I found it a big disappointment. kurt russel had the most "elvis moves" down and the voice imitation was great, but the dubbing voice of elvis just did not work for me. The voice did not always agree with Russell's mouth, and I found it hard to lose myself in the plot because it bothered me that it was conspicuous. There were also so many crazy disagreements in the movie. People who do not know much about elvis would probably take them for facts. Songs are sung by him earlier when he recorded them in real life. The time when he got his first guitar is wrong. I'm pretty sure his brother Jesse Garron was buried in an unmarked grave, not in a huge gravestone with JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a TV movie, but they jumped over important events like the comeback special and pulled out some scenes way too long. If you want to see a good movie showing elvis at his best rent, THE WAY IS IT, or another Elvis concert. Listening to and seeing the real elvis preform is the only way to realize your talent. (brilliant statement I know, but still ... go out and lend a good Elvis-Flic.)
