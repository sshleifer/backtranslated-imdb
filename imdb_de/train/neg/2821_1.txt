I only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. The film has little or no action and seems to be nothing more than ongoing scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else. I wanted to see this movie because he was with Zoe Trilling in the second "Night of the Demons;" and I wanted her to play somebody normal. Unfortunately, the Tobe Hooper script hardly starts and goes nowhere when Robert Englund dominates the film and chews the scenery and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now. hides from this movie!
