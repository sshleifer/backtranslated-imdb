Suffice it to say that the director of this awkward, hideous fight has not made a film here despite the strange ridiculous panegyric of his soi disanten "abilities". Well, that's great news for me. <br /> <br /> Dead Babies has all the bile of its creator, but lacks the wit and technical skills that make Martin Amis a novelist. <BR /> <br /> When will the British film industry wake up and realize that if they want to regain the status they once had, they should stop producing something and do something that real people really see want? <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
