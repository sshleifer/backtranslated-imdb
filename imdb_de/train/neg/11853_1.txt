Let's face it, romantic comedies are lightweight compared to dramatic movies (just watch the Oscar nominations every year). Still, the good guys are really an art form. Check out "When Harry Met Sally", "Sleepless in Seattle" and classics like "Roman Holiday" and "It Happened One Night". I like the good feeling of seeing two people who are fortunately destined. <br /> <br /> This film tries to construct something that resembles a romantic comedy. But no one believes the romance between the main characters, and there is nothing funny that can make up for this great lack. Modine has long been no leading man - especially a romantic trail. I'm sure that as executive producer, he had the means - but not the common sense - to throw himself. And Gershon ... I see opportunities for a comedic talent, but she did not have a script and a poorly developed character. And whose idea was the English accent? Pointless. <br /> <br /> Others have said it, but I would like to repeat it: this story is poorly designed, poorly executed; the actors are terribly mismanaged; and the characters, well, we just do not scream about them. <br /> <br /> An art form is not. Rent "Moonstruck" again.
