Tobe Hooper is probably the biggest coincidence the horror genre has to offer. Like any other horror fan, I loved the Texas Chainsaw, but I think to put a name on a movie title, you should at least have a successful movie. I can not really think of another movie that Hooper filmed (not counting Poltergeist alone) that really influenced the horror genre or the movie world. And this movie, Night Terrors, just underlines my point of view. <br /> <br/> Poor Robert Englund, I give him credit for doing a good job with the horrible stuff he's received. He did what he could. As for the movie itself? Pure drudgery. Needless nude scenes every five minutes, a story that must have been written in one of our really awful sceneries, music and cinematography. Nothing in this movie is redeemable. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Overall, 1 out of 10 points. I'm sorry for Hooper, his career seems to be over before he really starts. I hope he can pump out at least one more good movie so he can give some justice to his cult status. <br /> <br />
