The Marquis de Sade, Egypt, ancient gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a double role, casual sex and nudity, murder and chaos ... on paper, Tobe Hopper's Night Terror sounds like there should be at least one entertaining, entertaining movie given the ingredients , It is not. It's a conspiracy less, incoherent confusions that brings little entertainment. There is basically no conspiracy except a vague stuff about a cult following the work of De Sade, who, for some unclear reason, feels the need to seduce and kill the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist. That's about all - I think it has something to do with the Gnostics, but who knows what the authors thought. The film is largely a meandering jumble as the heroine is exposed to various insane, dream sequences and erotic encounters associated with scenes from Englund while De Sade crouched in the 19th century. It seems that the makers have been looking for something serious, but whatever their claims may be, they are buried in the cheesiness, the bad acting, the mess and the wrong appearance of beheaded heads. <br /> <br /> There are not many good points. Robert Englund is fun, as always, and the lead actress, Zoe Trilling, while not very talented, is attractive and undergoing various stages of undressing through the film, but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I've seen the movie that made the "When You're As Criminal As Me" bit from the Australian film certification advisor, which was on the front page of so many VHS tapes of the nineties.
