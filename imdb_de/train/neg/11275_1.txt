This is a really bad LOCK STOCK clone with a great cast and a terrible script. I have no idea why so many top British actors chose this junk, they must have been bribed. A Miss Match of an action goes on and on and if I did not pay good money, I would have turned it off after 10 minutes. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, this honor goes to the really pitifully used Bogroll of a "movie" (I use the term loosely) "GUMMO" (I want to sue the so-called "director" for the lost hour and one my half life), but this garbage is almost exactly in there. Definitely one of the worst 5 movies I have ever seen. Such things remind Hollywood that they really do not have any really good movies.
