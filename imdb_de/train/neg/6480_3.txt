It was nice to see all the famous characters again, but the story bothered me. We loved Ariel in the first movie. Why is the second one about her daughter? The new characters were annoying and I did not like the plot. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not come back as the voice of Eric! Disney, please stop making classic movies with these bad imitations.
