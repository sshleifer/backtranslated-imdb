Anyone who thinks that another Home Alone movie is a good idea should have their heads examined ... same plot, different kid, more bad guys (leading to more infinite stupidity in the traps). The other two films were bad enough, and here it hits the low point. The other films can just as well be considered as action, since everything is identical.
