This movie seems to be completely pointless. There is no reason why anything happens in it, as if written by a small child halfway bored, thinking, "How can I pack this?". And what did Jared Harris and Christopher Walken think? Did you make it a bet? I can not tell you the story, I'm not sure if there's one that's totally open, but if it's there, she did not register. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after falling down the stairs while being whipped up like you. They go to a house with a very annoying little girl, meet Christopher Walken, who dug up an old woman from peat. He does not bring her back to life for any other reason, as she continues the story, and she shows her gratitude by immediately adorning him. From then on, everything gets a bit stupid. A few hours of my life I would like to return!
