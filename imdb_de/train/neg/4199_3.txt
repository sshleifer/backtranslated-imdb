Very bad effort, which offers pretty much nothing, except a hardcore fan of Stanley Tucci, who tries not to save the poor structure, dialogue, direction or talent of our leading man. The only trick this story of a naive new salesman for an alerting company, are the quirky minor characters. But without a realistic background, such characters are pointless. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to see here, keep moving ... <br /> <br />
