Guy is a loser. I can not get girls, have to build up, get picked up by stronger, more successful guys, and so on. I have to say that Rob has to move past Adam Sandler part of his life. And out of the plans of Adam Sandler. There are two funny parts throughout the movie. I could not even finish the last 5 minutes. I got bored "The Animal" is a good movie. I like Adam Sandler movies that have the same storyline. But it was too hard to impress. The jokes are very old. So trust me. This is not a movie that most people could really dive into. But some did, so I'll be nice. <br /> <br /> 3/10
