This film is a travesty and not suitable to stay in touch with the superior original. The plot is an absolute mess and the movie is way too long. Every time they try, they desperately inject a sentimental memory from the first movie. <br /> <br /> "Gregory's Girl" is one of the ten British films of all time.
