I had to leave the theater. After an hour, I saw only people who cheated on wives, how dogs rode in a rut and used the F-word like a diabetic with Equal. No thanks. It was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot. Any one of the characters could have been interesting if he had more to do than fake, talk about, and summon each other. <br /> <br /> On the few occasions that it looked like it was some kind of character development, all that happened was a different sex scene. The development of parcels in the first hour can be summarized as follows: 1) several murders, 2) Vinnie sees murder scenario 3) Vinnie stares across Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheats on the wife and 5) Joey (most sympathetic figure) The Show is thrown out of the house of his parents. More than that, I did not wait to see. <br /> <br /> The photography and interaction of the characters was great, but there was nothing they could do. The tide of sex and vulgarity was barely worth an hour of waiting for ETWAS. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill or Shawshank Redemption. Both are a better study in community and interpersonal relationships.
