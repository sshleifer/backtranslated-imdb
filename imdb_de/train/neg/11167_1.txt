Jack Black can usually only make me chuckle by breathing, but in this movie ... Besides the direction, writing, lack of action, constant ambushes (assisted and assisted by continuous direct camera shots) and an average of .050 jokes was still waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but the potential that was there, with a complete lack of comedy and one of the worst directions I've seen on this site, wastes Mexican very negatively. This is undoubtedly true, but I do not think this movie should be racist. I think that's more the result of a "creative" team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear her screaming behind the camera: "Hey look, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people, please, out of love for everything that's stubborn, LAUGH!" Utilities. If you look at it, it is anyone who provided good money and time to look at that pile of leftover beans that should have been offended, IMO.
