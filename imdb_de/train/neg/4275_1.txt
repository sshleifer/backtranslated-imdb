I can not understand why so many folks have praised this show. Twin Peaks is one of the most boring titles I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen all episodes of season one and season two of Season 1. <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the right introduction to the criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> In the first season, there was a scene in which Agent Cooper throws stones into a bottle. Can you imagine why he did that? He just wants to identify the killer by doing this 'joke', mentioning the supernatural abilities of the Tibet Dream. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this show. <br /> <br /> For example, Season 2 began with a "funny" scene that a stupid old man serving Agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper lays down on the floor. (He already has the gun in his stomach.) This old man does not do anything except a few stupid comments. That's all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 minutes, 30 seconds ... it's like hell.) <br /> <br /> I'd rather read some comic books than see this show more.
