I have not seen anyone designing this movie yet, and I think I could be the first one. <br /> <br /> It was awful. I did not actually see the end. It was like a boring soap or a really good soap (all soaps are crap). The actors were bad and the plot was bad. The person who rated it 10/10 has no idea what it is about. The script was awful. 2 People were in a furious conversation with threats and you expect the good man to say something really good and beat the crap out of him, but no. He says, "If you do that ... I'll hurt you" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, watch out. Please do not watch this movie because ... CRAP !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: Bad action, bad fights, bad script. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention! Of course that's my opinion.
