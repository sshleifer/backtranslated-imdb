I have no idea which fool from San Francisco came up with this stupid conspiracy, but apparently they have to take all the drugs they take and put their analyst on the dole - NOW. <br /> <br /> This is a plausible story if you consider the alien kidnapping sequence in "Life of Brian" plausible. <br /> <br /> This movie is little more than a left pipedream. Had the US and the USSR abandoned nuclear weapons, the result would have been to remove the only real obstacle that prevented them from going to war. As bad as Korea, Vietnam and other wars of the era were, they were "proxy wars" that stopped the superpowers from direct engagement. This film makes me think how realistic it was in a group of high school kids to go on a hunger strike to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. As if someone would say, "Mr. President, some kids on Drastic High are not eating!" and Ronald Reagan would answer, "My God, I should better revise my defense policy!" Right. <br /> <br /> Like this movie? Would not it be better if the Soviet Union had collapsed because they could not support their massive arms production ... wait, that's what happened!
