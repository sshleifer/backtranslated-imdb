This is Peter Falk's movie. Period. <br /> <br /> I was 10 years old when this movie came out; I was already a movie buddy at the time. Of course, neither my parents nor I saw this movie when it came out, but I was in love with the writing of his ads and the aura that this was an important movie. Okay, 34 years later I finally saw the movie - never before seen a movie directed by Cassavetes. He is a hack altogether. No sense of time, editing. Genas performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman's involvement in "Rain Man": Technically on eye level, but only one note. When Tom Cruise steals "Rain Man", Falk takes the cake for this movie. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed with Genas performance, really consistently - he seemed better for awakenings (blecch!) to be suitable. It's not all her fault: she's a basket from the first to the last scene. We never find out why? But Falk's character seems to be genuine and is presented by WALDERFULLY as a seriously flawed man by Falk. <br /> <br /> At least an hour (an editor needed!) Should split off, and this would have been an impressive portrait that depicts no woman under the influence of a simple, cro-magnon, man who deals with a woman who does not work and can not handle the three hours of her three children and her husband yet. <br /> <br /> I remember Cassavetes for "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby". He would have been a better director if he had cut off his own tendency to self-duplication - as he demonstrates in detail with this film. <br /> <br /> Bob
