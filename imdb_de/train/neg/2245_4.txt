This movie is NOT the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, which is a pity, because the 1954 version is much better in my opinion. I do not deny the talent of Barbra Streisand. She is a good actress and a brilliant singer. I am not familiar with Kris Kristofferson's other work and therefore can not give a judgment. This movie leaves much to be desired. It is slowly moving forward, it has an unfounded nudity and bad language, and it can be very difficult to prevail. <br /> <br /> However, I'm not a big fan of rock music, so it's only natural that I'd like the Judy Garland version better. Watch the film from 1976 with Barbra and Kris and judge for yourself.
