I did not expect much when I saw this weekend at the Palm Springs Film Fest. It was an alternative choice when two more movies were sold out. Nevertheless, I held out hope. It sounded a bit like "Bride and Prejudice" (the guy L.A. falls into an Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). B & P was not perfect, but it was an entertaining movie with good laughs and sympathetic characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood Bride" had none of this. The acting seemed stilted and a way to the numbers. The characters were so clich√©d that the story looked as if they had been written by a freshman of the high school drama. Technically, the sound really bothered me. It seemed as if the dialogue was overflowing a lot. I mean, I know, sometimes it's necessary, but it sounded like half of the movie was filmed in a closet and it got very distracting. <br /> <br /> Two stars are a bit generous.
