A few days ago I saw a documentary titled "The Fifty Worst Films Ever", and this is the first time I've heard of "The Incredible Melting Man". As a lover of fluffy films I make it my goal to find some films from the documentary - not just THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first "bad movie" I've seen since, and I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed. Although it is really a bad movie, it is far from close enough to be included in this list. <br /> <br /> Before I see the documentary, I have enjoyed "bad movies" since I first published the book "The Fifty Worst Films Ever" by Harry Medved. Despite the same title, the book appeared long before the documentary, and the makers of the documentary have never attributed the concept to Medved. From the Medved book, I have seen about 35 of the 50 films, but have come to a dead end - the rest of the films is simply not available on VHS or DVD. I thought I would try the movie of the same name. <br /> <br /> The reason I was most disappointed with THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN was that the film had some good elements. First, the melting special effects were generally really cool and disgusting. It is obvious that a pro (the famous Rich Baker) was involved in making this look realistic. However, I should point out that there were more than a few cheap and cheesy effects - like the floating plastic head and the way the monster walked around after cutting off his left arm - you could see it. "cleverly hidden" under his clothes! As for history, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts miraculously penetrate the rings of Saturn without being crushed. Then they comment on how beautiful the sun is - we see close-ups of it. This is strange, since Saturn is so far away - he should NOT look like that - he should be a big stain. Nevertheless, the scene changes immediately and we are told that one of the surviving astronauts is in a hospital. What happened between the last and this scene? Yes, nobody can say that. Well, shortly thereafter, the survivor escapes and gets into a murderous rampage while his whole body melts. Well, considering that they have a psycho that looks like a melting ice lolly, you might think the government would do that Pulling out all the stops to find and stop it, right ?! Not correct. A general commissions a single doctor to find him !! No army, no police - just a stupid doctor. Even when your bodies begin to pile up, you never do anything to organize a meaningful search or get a backup. <br /> <br /> Well, given the film's stupidity, you will not be surprised to find the following: <br /> <br /> When the melting guy walks around the doctor's house, the doctor gives his Ms. a strong sedative and leaves her in the house. <br /> <br /> If a The cute, old couple goes late into the night. Of course, they stop in an orchard to pick fruit and are killed. When a lady sees melting guys, she closes the door to protect herself. That would be wise if she did not have the back door of the house next to her! Instead of just leaving the house and escaping, she's just waiting! <br /> <br /> When a photographer and his model take snapshots, the guy grabs his assistant and takes off her shirt. Why? Well, to give the audience a cheap thrill and turn it into a valued R-strip. <br /> <br /> When the melting guy is finally located and the sheriff has a clear shot at him, the doctor stops him - though by now the monster had killed about half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the film is filled with stupid plot elements. It is a very bad movie. But with the occasional good special effects, it was not a horrible movie, as I had hoped. Sure, it's good for a laugh, but not in the vicinity of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE in bad shape and should never have been included in anyone's worst movie list.
