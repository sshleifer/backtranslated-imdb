I thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies I have ever seen - the others were THE Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST. All three films are about death. If you like to be depressed, take a look at this movie or one of the other films. In this movie the acting is good and some scenes (apart from dying) are lovely. But I am worried that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the movie and teach themselves! Despite a "happy ending," the main part of this film ends in one terrible disaster after another. And for some crazy reason, I do not want to be depressed when I watch a Christmas movie (I know this crazy guy sounds - after all, you do not yell your eyes and feel miserable about what the holidays are all about?). <br /> <br /> For a more uplifting viewing experience, try out the forgotten HOUSE WITHOUT A Christmas TREE, George C. Scott's Christmas CAROL or A Christmas STORY - unless you do not like being miserable.
