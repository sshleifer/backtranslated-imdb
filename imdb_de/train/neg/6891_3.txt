Starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes the charm is lost. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same shape as the main protagonist of American Pie and Loser with no support for Cast or an innovative story that made the pie films a commercial success. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest - Heder's acting was pretty bad. Keaton, Daniels, and Faris did their best, but did not have any significant actions or scripts to work their way through. The film ripples without pace or clear logical action that justifies its length. <br /> <br /> as they come - so predictably, I ticked the box for the spoilers for this one line. <br /> <br /> My tip: Avoid, unless you really have nothing else to do / listen to or watch and even then you will feel that the producers have betrayed you from one and a half hours of your life ,
