I just got back from this movie and decided to see what others thought of it. I wonder if those people who give glowing reviews have seen the same movie! This may be a very good story, but it does not hit the mark. The script is very weak - the plot has so many holes that it would be a great dive net for the Angelszenen. The characters were not well developed and the plot jumps around so much that I asked how we came here. at least half a dozen times during the movie. <br /> <br /> There was a lack of chemistry between the performers. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's antics during the shoot. It was pretty clear that everyone came up and did their job, but did not commit to their roles. Take a nice warm bath and save your money for something that's worth it!
