This movie is so bad that it simply defies reality. Filming is at best school material, acting is pathetic and the director should be forever excluded from filmmaking in any form. It can not even be considered as comedy, something like showgirls. The only thing this DVD had was the cover. <br /> <br /> All I can write to those of you who have not had the misfortune of witnessing it, is to do yourself a deserved favor in advance and your time or your money is not for this piece waste garbage. If you want to watch a movie for the aspects of comedy, there are many others worthy of the rubbish in such an area.
