I've remembered this show "Trouble With Tracy" in the TV Guide for years. CFTO TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 o'clock! I lived about two hours north of Toronto and we could not get CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can not have. <br /> <br /> Well, I knew what I wanted and what I wanted was to see what "Trouble With Tracy" was all about. Did it have a beautiful girl in the lead role? Was there nudity? Was there tension? Was it a comedy? It would have been good if the show were promoted. At least I could have known what I was missing. But no! The mystery drove me crazy until CTV subsidiary CKCO built a transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario, broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time as CFTO ... Saturday morning at 6 o'clock !! On a Saturday morning, I got up and turned on the television at 5:59, and finally I could see what "The Trouble With Tracy" was. Yes, the "problem with Tracy" was that it was Canadian content and stuck at the harmless 6 o'clock point so no one would ever see how awful it was. Talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died a few years later, but many claim he died "the first time" when he first appeared on the show. When I saw it for the first time on that cold Saturday morning and fell into my bed dejectedly, part of me died too.
