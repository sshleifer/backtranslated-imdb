I've been watching the movie recently and it's very similar to the book it's based on. I blame the bad script and the direction. Some parts were forcibly entered for no apparent reason (gay rape scene). I actually read the book after watching the movie and about 20 years after reading it for the first time. I found it hard to read and a bit awkward. Too many disparate ideas were never introduced ... except for the sensational parts of time. Since these are things that, to say the least, were considered "sensitive" in communism, I can see the fascination that set them off then. This is no longer the case or maybe I see things differently now or a little bit of both. The film tries too much to cover many aspects of the book. The result is a compilation of scenes that makes sense to someone reading the book. However, this is a movie that is hard to see and perhaps should never have been made.
