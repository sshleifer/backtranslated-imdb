Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save that dead fish of a movie. For starters, the script was definitely written to be turned into a B-movie, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to get out of television) and Hutton (looking for the "two" one) He had hoped he would define his career after "decent people" were attached to the picture. Cheesy lines, big bad wipes from scene to scene (Come on - who uses wipes after the 12th grade of the telecom class?), And the plain old bad acting submerges this movie. Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad plague that this movie represents. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material at all. I have to admit to feeling Duchovny's pain as he reads the lines that are the voice-over. While I laughed when I was sure the director wanted me to be scared, Duchonvey did not prepare for the end line: "If you ever need a doctor, call 911." If only the Studio 911 had called, that dog of a movie would never have been made. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
