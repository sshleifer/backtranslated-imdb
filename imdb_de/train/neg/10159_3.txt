Wide-open, hysterical hyper-happiness of the 50s, which gives a new meaning to antisocial, pathological behavior. Danza and Grayson will make you beg. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that all the people involved in this movie are now dead (or in nursing homes). I somehow thought about suing her for torture. As this film unleashed its shamelessly aggressive operatic attack on my poor, defenseless drums, I immediately felt strong, intense pain that surrounded my whole being. This damn muscular vibrato can shatter Soviet tanks into tiny pieces, no matter what glass is. <br /> <br /> "Why did not you change the channel if you did not like it?" Could you ask angrily. Fair point, fair point ... The answer is that I wanted it, but the pain was so sudden and unbearable that I fell to the ground and was in pain. With my last ounce of energy, I tried to reach the remote but could not. <br /> <br /> A stupid little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by Niven, who then goes on to "pigmalionize" him. Lanza is in love with asymmetrical Grayson, but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally come together. This may look like a thin plot, but this loud movie is so full of song and music that there is hardly any dialogue. This movie is RELENTLESS. Forget the torturing of hippies and prisoners of war with Slayer's "Reign In Blood" (as in a South Park episode). Whatever this little conversation among the stupid adults who infest this strange musical world of the '50s, it's all infantile - as if they were all six-year-olds who embody themselves as adults. I can only envy people who find such films funny. It must be awesome, easy to please: what a world of wonder would open to me if I could only enjoy any stupid old gag as a weird comic comedy. <br /> <br /> But let us examine this phenomenon, the musical of the 50s. My best guess is that the musicals of the '50s gave the more dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven (depending on whether you go to church or Lenin's tomb) or at least a very cheesy version of that fantasy. inspired places. TTONO is more a representation of hell, but that's just me. I do not seem to get any musicals. People talk, there is a story - but suddenly everybody starts to sing for about 4 minutes. After that, they calm down abruptly and pretend that nothing out of the ordinary has happened! If you think about it, musicals are stranger than any science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> Worse, TTONO (my favorite style of pizza, by the way) is not just a 1950s musical, but an opera squeal. Opera is proof that there is such a thing as over-training a voice - to the point where it becomes a deafening weapon and not to give the listener pleasure. The clearest example of this travesty is when Lanza and Grayson combine their dark-side vocal powers into a truly unbearable duet. I tried to decrease the volume. I lowered it from 18 to 14. Then from 14 to 10. Then I lowered it to a 1 that is usually low enough to be heard only by specially trained dogs and certain types of marsupials, and still I could still do it hear how the two roar like donkeys! <br /> <br /> Take the scene in a small boat in the river. Danza starts with one of his deafening, brain-slinging tunes and then ... nothing. No animals anywhere to see. Even the crocodiles, who are mostly deaf, have almost everything left. If you look closely, you may even see that the trees change color from green to yellow within minutes. No, this was not a continuity error, it was just an old torture of flora. And these trees were just matte pictures! Imagine how real trees would have reacted. <br /> <br /> The reason that glass breaks when a high C is ejected from the overweight belly of an opera-screamer is not due to physical laws regarding waves and frequency, but because glass is only human - hence It can only hurt so much by spontaneous self-explosion, before it comes to suicide. I can hear the loudest, most rude Death Metal band for hours, but just give me a minute of soprano and I get a headache.
