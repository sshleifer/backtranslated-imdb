What a complete waste of time. The film begins as a clone of the Saw series, but with even worse actors. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely terrible. The end is ridiculous and the story contains no twists, no surprises of the plot and just a plain bad ending. I liked some characters and hoped that in the end everything would be tied together. It just does not happen. It's a total "wrestler" who ends up with no good acting. I can not believe that I spent the time with it. It is not "fun" as some people say. A man in a mask abducts people who are connected and forces them to find out. The connection is a stretch and he should have shot the lead actress first.
