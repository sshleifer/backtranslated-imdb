At first, Jon Bon Jovi does not seem to be in a vampire movie. Together with the other not so interesting characters and the bad plot, the entire movie becomes predictable. If you remember and are a total vampire movie fan, you can have fun with a few scenes. Do not expect Tarantino-style chapters or Anne Rice storyline here. (I expect to have forgotten the whole movie until tomorrow;)
