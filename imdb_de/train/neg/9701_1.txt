A really bad sequel. Part 1 had a lot of fun moments - Part 2 is just bad (in a boring way) and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans. <br /> The only slightly amusing moment in the movie is Helge Schneider, who seems to be involved seems to occupy the other characters. It's pretty easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The script is sloppy / absent. The director should do everyone a favor and immediately stop working. The drama is worse than a school play in the 2nd class. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is awful too, but who can blame the cinematographer / sound guy who had to work with such an untalented director?
