I saw this movie during a college year taught in Tolkien style. Unfortunately, I was sitting near the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a whipping boy - everyone else laughed, but they were not in constant sight. <br /> <br /> Let's get rid of it: The films "The Lord of the Rings" by Peter Jackson owe something to the Bakshi movie. In Jackson's version of The Fellowship of the Ring, for example, the scene in which the Black Riders attack the empty guest beds is almost a complete copy of the scene in Bakshi's film, shot by shot. You can call this plagiarism or this homage depending on your agenda. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the similarities will not stop there. I will not do any research to find out what they are, because that would mean that I have some respect for this film. I am sure that others have outlined the similarities. Take a look around. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor, and many, many people have died in the accident. I have decided to enumerate in a more or less chronological way what I can remember. If I have omitted everything else that has offended me, it is because I am completely overwhelmed and confronted with a plethora of failures (and at mediocre highs). <br /> <br /> * Through intensive use of rotoscopy, Gandalf is no longer a gentle, wise wizard, but a wildly decomposing prophet of doom (whose hat inexplicably changes color one or two times during the film * /> <br /> * Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as "Aruman" without explanation during the film, and for some mysterious reason, he wears purple and red. * Sam is utterly abhorrent, his portrayal of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childish and unsatisfactory Yes, hobbits are as small as children, but they are NOT children. <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin are never introduced - they simply appear during a scene change with a one-sentence explanation sloppy cut like this. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry are singing cheerfully as they bounce down the street, one of the hobbits is making a sound at least twice his size his back is - what was not visible before - and starts to play in a typical fantasy-Bard-style, as it breaks all in "la-la-la" s. AWFUL. <br /> <br / * * Aragorn is apparently an Native American, dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic (no pants) and with a huge, square, pilgrim belt buckle. He is arguably the worst swordsman in the entire movie - he often gets a wobbly swing before being hit on the ass. <br /> <br /> * The black riders look more like lepers than threatening instruments of evil. They hobble everywhere where they progress painfully slowly. This is disturbing but not scary. <br /> <br /> * The scene before the Black Riders attempt to cross the Ford of Bruinen (staring at Frodo standing on horseback on the other side) goes on and on, while the riders put their horses in a vaguely threatening way and raise ... otherwise do nothing. The scene was likely to illustrate Frodo's hallucinatory decline as he succumbed to his wound. It turns out that it is more than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli, the dwarf, is just as tall as Legolas, the elf. He is a ZWERK. There is no excuse for that. He also looks like a hired David the Gnome. It's a rough but accurate description. <br /> <br /> * Boromir seems to have stolen Elmer Fudd's golden Viking armor from this episode of Bugs Bunny Opera. He looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the resemblance to Tolkien's portrayal, the Balrog seems howling and the least threatening villain in the entire movie. It looks like someone wearing pink bedroom slippers and is barely taller than Gandalf. "Purists" may prefer this Balrog, but I take Jackson's version every day. <br /> <br /> * The fight scenes are uncomfortable and embarrassing. Nearly none of the characters have some competence in their armor. I'm not asking about action-packed scenes like those in Jackson's movie, but they're supposed to fight. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard makes a very brief appearance, and I am sorry that he has made every effort to appear. Watch the movie, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Okay, now for the GOOD parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> * Part of the speech is pretty good. It's not that Aragorn SOUNDS is bad, he just looks like the Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br / * * Galadriel is interesting in this presentation; Like Tom Bombadil, she seems to be immune to the temptation of the Ring, and her spokeswoman is not terrible either. <br /> <br /> * Boromir's death is not as heartbreaking as in Jackson's portrayal of the same scene. But it's still appropriately dramatic (and more likely to kill him in the book, though I do not think Jackson made a mistake when he did it that way). <br /> <br /> * As my professor pointed out (between) (whispered threats), the orcs (mainly in Helm's Deep, if I'm right) are similar to war-torn corpses of soldiers. A political statement that works pretty well when you realize what is being attempted. <br /> <br /> * While this is not really a positive point in terms of the movie, Bakshi can not be held responsible for the majority of mistakes in this movie, or so I was told - the project was close Budget and was late In production, he lost the creative control to some of the higher (which I certainly had not read in the books). <br /> <br /> Let me clarify: I respect Bakshi because he has even tried something of this magnitude. I find it hard to believe that he was satisfied with the final product. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not even recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy, unless you've already read the books and have your own visualizations of the characters, places, and events. I'm sure someone will confuse a copy of it somewhere confused. As you do so, stay open and learn what you can do with it.
