The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, with the paricide of Caesar being the time. In addition, Spanish was spoken without subtitles. Therefore, it is difficult for me to thoroughly review this movie because I did not understand what was said. Cleopatra is a historical symbol, the part is very difficult and I found that for a newcomer. Leonor Varela is just playing well. She is strong-willed, but also a very supportive, tender soulmate. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and her romance is the main feature of the first episode. So it's not really a documentary or a peplum, it's a great love story. After the paricide, a new lover (Marc-Antoine) comes, but the taste is gone: we always remember our first love. So I found the second episode boring and their tragic fate is not told powerfully. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the production is luxurious: the sets are large and tastefully decorated; the Moroccan live location exotic and the wardrobes gorgeous. The producers have a lot of money, but do not spend anything on the special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, sphinx) that it's funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to hear in French or English to get a final opinion on these two films.
