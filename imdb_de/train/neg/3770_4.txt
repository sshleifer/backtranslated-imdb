Warren Beatty's intention to turn Chester Gould's famous comic strip into a live-action cartoon (starring Beatty himself as a square-edged detective) had sweet notions of innocent nostalgia - quite unusual and intriguing by Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is a necessary ham, is fun for a while, but eventually becomes tiring. Dick Tracy tries to bring down the gangster Big Boy Caprice, supported by Tess Trueheart, but stumbled upon by the evil Breathless Mahoney. In the first half hour, the Academy Award-winning art direction and stage design are wonderful to absorb, but since the plot is predictable (without any real engraving in the writing), things begin to freeze. Al Pacino got a surprise supporting the Oscar nomination as Bad Boy Caprice, and Madonna (who serves mainly as a decorative prop) sings Stephen Sondheim's "Sooner or Later", which wins the Best Original Award was shortened song. Thank you, thanks to Beatty - who has dedicated himself to his vision - but the picture is too cool and too expensive. There is a lack of heat. * 1/2 of ****
