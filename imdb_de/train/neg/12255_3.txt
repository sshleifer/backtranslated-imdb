... which is not exactly a sound confirmation. Overall, "DinoCroc" was a much better movie. Sure, in this movie, Matt Borlenghi played a complete Wuss bag that spent the entire movie eating his little brother from the DinoCroc. However, the special effects in "DinoCroc" were better, the plotting lines were better and the drama was better. Here are the issues with "Blood Surf" - 1) The killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a retractable jaw. 2) the conspiracy is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. are shipwrecked on a desert island where they meet a rabid group of nasty Filipino aborigines trying to impose themselves on the women in the group. That was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there is not enough crocodile time. There are a few redeeming qualities of "Blood Surf" - the actresses are pretty attractive and Matt Borlenghi is eaten by the Croc at the end of the movie. However, if you are on your deathbed and only have time to watch a Matt Borlenghi / Killerkrokodilfilm, skip this movie and start "DinoCroc" instead.
