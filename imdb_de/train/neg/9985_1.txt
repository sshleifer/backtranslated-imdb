Have I ever seen a shockingly inappropriate movie? I can imagine a lot that suits it, but not one that surpasses it. The actors are all terrible stereotypes charged with flat dialogue. I am ashamed of all the people involved. Each of them carries an expression of fear that is not generated by the conspiracy, but by the realization that this project could easily accelerate their careers. Even the many charms of Mrs. Diaz are no sufficient reason to be exposed. Avoid, it's obviously a movie style that Americans did not really understand. Look at the end result if you have to, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DO NOT say I did not warn you ...
