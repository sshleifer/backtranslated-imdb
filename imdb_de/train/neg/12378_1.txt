Creepy and lascivious wolf. The young "Red" wears full make-up and extremely short shorts and bathrobe. After about 20 minutes it became clear that a pedophile's dream could come true. The "up-beat" music sounds very much like something I would hear in a strip club. I actually think that this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Gross, glad that I looked at this with my daughter. I do not want her to think that it's normal for families to look at child pornography together. Very bad, very sad, it is sold as a family movie. Joey Fatone is probably being embarrassed that he was there. And what about advertising as "spectacular special effects" ??? The effects look cheap, terrible.
