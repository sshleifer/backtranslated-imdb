I thought you should have called this movie "Whites" instead of "Heights". Godawful ... the kind of movie that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are so selfish and think their life is so important ... give me a break. So lily white cast that Glenn Close was the most ethnic character in this movie. This movie called out that someone would really come in to steal it ... and so they introduce him, a character even whiter than the rest of the cast (I thought he was an albino first), the one should be Welsh! I'm still trying to decipher that accent! Intellectual Dishonest ... This movie is the kind of movie that can make so many people think it's worth it because they have something more ambitious. Fill the theaters better with MI5-10 than with this presumptuous crap ... it must have been a better piece because you can not fall off the floor.
