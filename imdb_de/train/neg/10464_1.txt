This movie is not based on the bible. It leaves Christ completely out of the movie. They do not show the Rapture or the second coming of Christ. Let us talk about it. It does not quote from the scriptures. The end times are called the Great Tribulation. The movie does not even show bad times. The seven bowls, seven viles and seven trumpets of judgments are shortened to 15 seconds and the structure of the sea is changed. The anti-Christ was killed 3 1/2 years after the tribulation, and so the movie ended. The only part they correctly understood were two prophets. Of course, they did not use names there because that would be too close to the truth of the scriptures. The worst part was, I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to bring unsolicited people to it. I feel that the movie is evil. It's a fake, just like everything the devil does. I just hope it does not take away the upcoming movie based on the books left behind. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the movie is that it was just bad. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and bad character development. I have seen better episodes of Miami vices.
