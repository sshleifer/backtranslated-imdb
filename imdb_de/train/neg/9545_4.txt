Will Farmer (Lanter) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and Ripley, the super-governmental computer profiling potential terrorists, chases him because Will (by hacking) has paid some money from his neighbor's bank account to pay for it School trip to play chess in Philadelphia. The neighbor next door whose computer Will repaired has relatives in the Middle East sending money through her bank to the neighbor's bank, and Ripley sees a terrorist connection. Ripley can retrieve rocket attacks. Oh oh! <br /> <br /> This version of War Games is much faster and more aggressive than the movie War Games of the early 1980s. Well, the electronics industry has so much more to do these days. Makes sense. The movie amazes us with awesome CGI on computer screens, and once Joshua, Ripley's forerunner, is ready, we have to watch computers against computers, and people are pawing, hoping, praying ... somehow. Oh, ing, OMG-ing, and more screaming things will go their way. In other words, we are now experiencing a movie made for television, and it's Oh Hum Time. Go back to the 80s and watch the original War Games movie. It's much better. <br /> <br /> But we really have to ask ourselves: Are we making computers too smart, where they will one day rule in time? Hmmm ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.
