As the only film I could see at this year's "Nordic Film Days" in LÃ¼beck, this year's festival will be remembered as an absolute low point for me. <br /> <br /> This movie, as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick crap! Excuse the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are not the best. But even better actors would not have saved the movie. For example, The plot: After the first 15 minutes it was clear that John was ill, the neighbors were not real and he had killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but disgusting (meeting until blood flows for me has nothing to do with sexuality), but unfortunately these were not the only disgusting pictures that were shown. Everything else was taken care of by other directors such as Lynch, but of course without her genius. <br /> <br /> So, to sum up the entire movie and save time and money for other viewers: guy loses girlfriend, girlfriend returns home, guy kills girlfriend, and then gets angry Guy turns hot but crazy neighbors Guy has very disgusting sex with one of them (or he thinks), in the end he realizes that he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lie in his flat all the time. bad story, bad actors, pictures that you want to make you vomit ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 (1 point for the fact that you realize how well you can understand Norwegian if you learned Swedish have - at least one advantage of the evening - and you can not choose 0 points here.
