This movie is not so funny - such a waste of big stars who seem so caught up in their own glory that they forget. Only beaming moments belong to John Cleese as a hotel manager who likes to disguise himself - you almost fall out of helpless laughter when he dances with high heels, mink coat and dainty hat to Donna Sommers "Bad Girls". The rest: FORGET IT!
