The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire greatly. The pipes had absolutely no chemistry. I could not believe for a second that there was something deeper between them than pleasure. The story just did not sound right. Add to this stilted conversation, tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow action that basically does not lead anywhere, and you have a real stinker. Kay Lenz's nude scenes are worthwhile for those looking for something horny, but otherwise this is a huge waste of time. When I saw the movie, I thought it would be better to do the title "Cheesy".
