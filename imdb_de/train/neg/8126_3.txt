I did not find that as horrible as some people seem to do. It is referred to as one of the kitsch horror films that could make you lose time in the middle of the night when you can not sleep, although admittedly it's not better quality. It's true that acting is not great - I thought that Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck, for example, appeared completely dispassionate - but the main problem is that some aspects of the plot did not really make sense to me. The Becks are on a journey described by John (Stewart Moss) as part of their work, and in part the honeymoon they've never had (now that's romantic!) Of a tour group through a cave refers to one's work?), but it gets weirder when we find out he's a medical researcher in the field of preventive medicine (or, in the cave, he turns into something I suspect was a hybrid of human bats ( although he does look like a monkey human when we finally see him in make-up) and a murder rush starts in. Here's another problem: The first murder is a nurse in a hospital First, everyone thinks that her death was an accident The second murder is a young girl who is reported to have her throat ripped out, and the sheriff (Michael Pataki) then tells us that her death is similar to that of the nurse was (meaning that the neck was ripped out? - How could anyone think that was an accident?) And what about the sheriff? He seems to be pretty nonsensical until he drinks a sip of alcohol in Cathy's hotel room and nearly rapes her. After that everything seems to be normal again. It's filled with an end that left almost everything unsolved, and also with one of the most irritating title songs I've ever heard in a movie. Despite all this, there was something here that let me observe. Sometimes pure cheese does one and a half hours. Pretty bad, but not as horrible as some people say.
