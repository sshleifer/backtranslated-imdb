Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) sets off for a weekend of tranquility, rest and relaxation with his native Jindabyne fisherman in Australia. But when Stewart discovers the body of an aborigine floating face down in a river, it seems to make the worst of it. The biggest victim of the weekend is the common sense of the men. You do not hike out of the gorge, but end your fishing weekend with some great catches. Then they go out and report on the body. <br /> <br /> The city and the life of the men quickly turn into a mess. The local media rave about them and indigenous accusations are raised by the locals. Stewart's wife Claire (Laura Linney, EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE) recognizes the deeper meanings of what her husband and friends have done, but struggles with her own mental illness. <br /> <br /> Amidst all this chaos was the life that was this young woman who is now a media spectacle spread out on a morgue. Their murder and their subsequent dropping into the water symbolize what was beneath the city of Jindabyne: a separation of men and women, black and white, social and outsiders. For example, two young children are present: Stewart and Claire's son, led by a half-blooded Aussie whose mother was killed just a few years ago. The young girl lives with her grandparents and tries to let go of her mother as much as possible, and the discovery of a new body seems to be happening? oddly enough ?? A method to achieve this (again, the underlying flow of Jindabyne is suspected). <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone in this town in Jindabyne feels what lurks beneath its surface, but none of them is ready to dive in the murky water and look around (the symbolism here is to see if one nearby lake, which is used for rest and swimming, the old town of Jindabyne is located under its surface). No, that is, until Claire forces her to do it. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting if it's a bit too complicated. There are far too many storylines to explore, and it just will not get done. too many loose threads. The acting was okay, but the shooting was horrible. Shaky cameras, grainy or dark shots and just a general sloppiness have hurt the entire production. <br /> <br /> I like symbolic movies. NORTHFORK is one of my absolute favorites of all time. But Jindabyne had to put his head over the murky water so he could see his own problems, which just did not happen.
