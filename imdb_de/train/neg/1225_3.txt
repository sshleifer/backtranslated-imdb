Well, let me start by saying how incredible HILARIOUS this movie is. I just could not stop myself from laughing at the sheer stupidity. Do not get me wrong, it's handled very well by Bassinger, but the script is just fine, the mind really fails. <br /> <br /> The premise is good until Della actually witnesses the murder she commits After that, it's just downhill. Halfway through the movie, the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and, of course, instead of tapping on the guy's head, decides to kill a screwdriver, a jack, and finally a torch (like a sinking ship) or their victims , <br /> <br /> Then there is the last line that I promise, if you are not in seams, then I will eat my own left foot. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie for those who just want to laugh about something old-fashioned, horrible filmmaking. May I also suggest that you pay attention to the scene in the junkyard, where the guy falls from the one-meter high plank of wood, gets me every time.
