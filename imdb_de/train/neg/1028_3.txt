I do not remember the last time I reacted to a performance as emotionally as Justin Timberlakes in "Edison". I became so emotional that I wanted to scream with fear, destroy the screen and accept the hopeless cries of nihilism. Timberlake is a terrible failure; In fact, casting for him is like Andy Dick starring in "Patton" or Nathan Lane playing Jesus. But that is almost incidental. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is just a bad actor and he would be just as awful in every role. I once had problems with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. With his Metrosexual Lisp (read lithp), his boyish looks, and his emotional expressions that result from something like "The 25 Cliché Expressions for Actors," he poisons the screen to which he is mercilessly inflicted, and no matter how you choose him do not cut and will not buy his role as an amateur crusader-for-justice journalist. It just will not fly. <br /> <br /> However, Timberlake is not to blame for his failure alone. Director David J. Burke not only puts him in the (essentially) primary role, but also introduces him to Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I'm surprised he was so good) LL Cool J I can imagine that one who suffers almost physically has to watch how some of these performers interact with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Of course, this has one advantage: the moment one of these actors interacts without Justin, it feels like a double relief. A pleasure, if you like. Freeman and Spacey can not have more than ten minutes alone, but these ten minutes are unlike their scenes with our so-called hero happy. Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> But enough of Timberlake bashing words in this particular case are not enough to do the trick. "Edison" is a very common corruption story. The plot ranges from cliché to simply absurd. However, I admire the motivation behind it, which I interpret as a tribute to films like "Serpico" or "Donnie Brasco" or maybe even "Chinatown". Do not get me wrong - "Edison" is not even in the same racket as these movies, but I can extend my suspension of disbelief to admire his reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting. <br /> <br /> The script itself is surprisingly poorly written. Yes, there are some decent exchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (being wasted here) and Timberlake seems like it's taken straight out of a Dawson's Creek episode. It is your typical outlook for reality, let us impress the audience with how well we articulate (and fail) the dialogue. Mind you, this dialogue is interrupted in the wrong moments of great music - sometimes it feels as if "Edison" turns into a music video in which the emotions of the scene are conveyed not by acting, but precisely by the poorly chosen music and different film speeds (read slow motion). <br /> <br /> If you think about it, "Edison" is a curiosity. It's sure to damn well kill a cast, but the performances are adversely affected by Timberlake, who just does not work. When there is one thing in the movie, as in most art, the whole thing feels whole. Directors have to make difficult decisions. David J. Burke missed the mark here. Some of the scenes are good in and of themselves, but as a whole they do not seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different jigsaw puzzles that are forced into an incoherent image. And it's not a particularly exciting puzzle.
