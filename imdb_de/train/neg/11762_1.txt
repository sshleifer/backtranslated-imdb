As a South African, it is an insult to believe that someone has actually been paid to produce this nonsense! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the director was one of the authors of the original Shaka Zulu Mini, this "supplement" was added. to the series is horrible! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who has helped shape the history of local tribes in South Africa. However, the storyline of this film is none other than Hogwash, scratched by a writer at the bottom of the barrel, has not impressed since the mid-'90s. <br /> <br /> While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what is David Hasselhoff doing here, rescuing drowning slaves with his red buoy and his pale smile? <br /> I've always expected blonde, busty women to emerge from nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red swimsuits for no apparent reason. Not that this would have been more bizarre than the fantastic storyline that had probably come up after 10 pints of beer at a costume party where a caveman costume inspired the writer to return to his next "blockbuster" on an African theme.
