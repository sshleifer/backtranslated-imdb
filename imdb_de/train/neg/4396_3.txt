My complaints concern the speed of the film and the material at hand. While the use of archive films and letters gives the film a fresh and interesting perspective, the material chosen for emphasis is too often simply not very interesting (for example, when Goebbels complains about this or that complaint, etc.) or the commercial film footage small German hometown). In addition, the film creeps in cover c. 1920-1939 and then steams through the war years. All in all, the film is little better than a History Channel documentary, with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensitivity than the average History Channel documentary editor and can artificially arrange the details of Goebbels' life. Nevertheless, I found it to be desired.
