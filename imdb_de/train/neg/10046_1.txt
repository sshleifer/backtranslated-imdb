I was not particularly impressed with Dante's first season offer in Homecoming, it was not a big horror story, but a smart political statement with the undead. Screwfly is the story of a virus that has been released in the world and that replaces the sex drive of men with murderous tendencies towards women. The episode begins with a short film that explains how the screw was killed by scientists. Then there is a brief scene in which a man is arrested when female bodies are discovered in his home. I assume that this should show the beginning of the eruption, which is unclear, as this is never repeated. The episode continues for a while and the characters are introduced to blah blah blah. It looks cool and mysterious, but the episode keeps getting worse and worse as it progresses to its sad and unsatisfactory end. The worst episode. Well, except for chocolate.
