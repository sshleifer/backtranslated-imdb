I gave this movie a 2, and although I consider myself a science fiction fan, I found it hard to take this movie seriously. It was a late night on AMC and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie is probably good for a few laughs, but not much else. <br /> <br /> The special effects are about average for the period - not terrible, but not great either. Of course, we know more about Mars today than we did then, but we can not really stand that against this movie. The main reason why I did not like this movie is because of the story. <br /> <br /> There were several parts of this film that I wish I had explored in some detail - the injury / condition of the astronaut, the city on Mars, the creature in the lake, etc. Overall the movie is like a long episode of The Outer Limits' 1960s version - complete with a cheesy ending.
