I am a very unpolitical guy. So when I say sexist, I mean that the female guest management has been reduced. Miranda Jones, played by Diana Muldar. despite all her supposed brilliance and self-control, nothing more than a big, jealous, unreasonable baby. They've gotten the plan now, after their techie Marvik, also a spurned lover, tries to kill the Medusan, Ambassador Kollos, out of jealous rage, but saw it first. (You think he could just have walked into the room with his eyes closed and adjusted the box too easily), he takes the Enterprise into an inaccessible space outside the galaxy before the boys could subjugate him. Well, the ship is in limbo, at that point they could have gone to the good doctor and talked about it. "Spock has to mingle with the Medusa so we can get home, I mean, like Beetch, do you want to stay that long until we run out of supplies and die?" But the lady in true Star Trek fashion is a jealous monster who whines and whines when the idea is raised, even if her Medusan idol told her to shut up and go with them. The damn bastard gets confused with the fused Spock and lets him forget to put on his visor, causing Spock to go insane. Kirk, of course, found out what a total jerk she was, and shamed her for repairing Spock with her superior telepathic powers. In the end, of course, the lady and the Medusa go and everything is forgiven. They almost want the president of Battle Star Galactica to show up to throw the witch out of an airlock for her destructive trick. In Star Trek Land, however, ladies may be completely unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time supposedly sexual equality. I mean sexist.
