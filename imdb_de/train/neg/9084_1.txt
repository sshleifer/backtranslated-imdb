This was the worst movie I have ever seen! Molly (Molly Hall) could not work anything! She had no emotions, it was all blabla bla, as if reading from a boring textbook. The smart kid and the kid who loves food (they were not names to remember) were so annoying that it drove me crazy. All conversations were about science or food. Molly's dad did not feel enough that his daughter was missing. The policeman and Molly's father said the same thing four times. it was just awful. Everything has been repeated way too much. Beatrice would have had to do something bad to her because she was so mean. I just wasted a moment in my life when I saw this movie!
