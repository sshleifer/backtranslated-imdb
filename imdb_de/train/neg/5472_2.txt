I've been watching dinosaurs all day now, and they've had the same basic problem all day. <br /> <br /> They do not believe in firearms. They just do not seem to have talked about them or anything. Bullets _bounce_ of dinosaurs! Maybe it's because they were extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder, and the laws of physics were different then ... Aah, no. Come on. If they are close enough to operate chemically today, they would have to be susceptible to fast (even subsonic) missiles. It's that simple. <br /> <br /> You see, the toughest reptiles in the world, alligators and crocodiles, are now totally susceptible to gunfire. They are nothing magical. You can shoot a pistol directly through the heavy scales on your back. They do not take armor piercing or anything special. Small bullets penetrate them, they just do not kill them. Something (but not REALLY) big balls are preferred because the challenge (as with most games) is to kill the animal with one shot, so it does not work. (Hunters consider it immoral to let prey run away without being harvested.) <br /> <br /> Most animals, including predators, are easily fended off by rifle fire, and between the sound and pain of a non-lethal wound, run Most of them are except big bears that are so fearless that they only get mad with deadly wounds.Cap buffalos are considered to be highly dangerous because they are known to attack in wounds We have a video of the big bulls in a herd of A big cat runs when she can, but if not, she is calculated as the last despair, where a T.Rex would fit into this spectrum is unknown Behavior was simply not observed In these larger animals, the task of safe hunting is to raise a large and powerful bullet and / or several g's quickly use it to counteract its load. Of course, with a T.Rex this could be a serious problem. I've seen a T.Rex skull (they have one in the downtown museum) and a gun large enough to blow up, which could be impractical. Chewing your neck with a much smaller fire could be a viable option. Small bullets would still penetrate them, they would not just bounce, just because the animal is too big to kill easily! <br /> <br /> Here we have Cortez and his men (this is before the famous Mexican campaign, obviously), which was captured by Native Americans and planned for the victims on the pyramid. It seems that all these human sacrifices were about reassuring the thirst for blood of the two T. Rexes, who were terrorizing the continent that day. Cortez and others persuade the Aztecs not only to cut their hearts and feed the lizards, but to make them hunt and kill them. OK, maybe they do not have M-16s like the guys from the "Carnosaur" series, but they have flintlocks, crossbows, pointed sticks (big ones from trees) and swords. Maybe it's a bit less inconsistent than full automatic, but there are several types and I would quickly bet on a dinosaur. Oh, wait, there's a cannon over a 4 incher. This is just the ticket to a Tyrannosaurus skull! So they set a trap with a bunch of men, cannons, pointed sticks in a ravine and lure the first T.Rex in, using a pretty brown girl as bait. Cortez points out that they will NOT have time to reload, so they must close the area until they are sure of their goal. T.Rex completely ignores her volley of Flintlock, and we both see a crossbow bolt _and_ the cannonball _bounce_! Forget it. End of Credibility A crossbow bolt would defeat Cortez's hull armor, and a 4-inch cannonball could pierce the hull of a wooden ship! I believe a _whale_ could resist a 4 "cannonball?) And here is T.Rex, who is still standing and does not even bleed Cortez lures it into the ravine where it falls on the pointed sticks which (I think by magic) Yaaay, sharp sticks! <br /> <br /> The dinosaurs are not totally invulnerable to gunfire - they manage to spot the second with a gun, which runs away, so it's NOT so mean like a bear or a buffalo, at least in the movies. <br /> <br /> You kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - made from a pumpkin filled with gunpowder and gems - my money would still be on the cannon Its technical function is to concentrate all the energy of the gunpowder in one direction - toward the target - a bomb is a much more diffuse force application.a _real_ bomb (NO pumpkin bomb) has a steel case that blasts the explosion to extremely high pressure contains Lt. (At thinking. Pipe bomb against fireworks) A heap of gunpowder, which was set on fire, is just go POOF. (Trust me in this case.)
