This movie is just crap. Although the directors claim to be part of this culture, it is still a very bad directorial debut. The theme itself is very interesting and I accept the bad acting due to the fact that they are all amateurs and have never played before, but the worst part about this film is the dialogue and very inexperienced and naive directing. There is no timing in this movie. I felt that the directors were so excited about making this movie (it's their first movie) that they never really wondered what story they wanted to tell. I've met Ben (one of the directors) several times and he's a nice and thoughtful guy, but that does not make him a director. I think "American History X" is full of clichés, but somehow it manages to transport a story. "Oi! Warning" is full of clichés, says nothing new or provocative and (that's the sad thing about this movie), it's far away from any Oi! -Reality. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it weird but great German films, watch the films by Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> Benny's Video Funny Games. <br /> <br /> *** of ten for theme and photography
