In the US, very few films were shot about Rome, which were filmed neither at the time of Julius Caesar nor shortly thereafter. Hollywood's sword and sandal epics are mostly Christian in nature, making it difficult to penetrate into earlier Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and met with resistance in Hollywood because he did not have Jesus) /> <br / > It is interesting to see at least one image that takes place not only before the time of Caesar and Christ, but especially when Rome was just one city among many on the Italian peninsula and had just ousted the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a historical movie; It is peplum, and although the production values ​​are not on the ground, spectacle and characterization are cardboard. I can only imagine how the dialogue was in Italian, but with English dubbing it is very casual. I got some good laughs first. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many films of this genre since I missed most of Hercules movies in the 60s. It's amusing to some extent, but the movie gets a little boring. <br /> <br /> One thing is for sure: If I had seen this film at the age of ten, I would have loved it. At this age I did everything with Romans and sword fighting. At least this movie brought back a few childhood memories.
