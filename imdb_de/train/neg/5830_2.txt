Drawing Restraint 9. you: Matthew Barney. <br /> <br /> How do you know when you're in the middle of a sophisticated art film? Is there only 8 dialog lines in 140 minutes of movie? Is it when Bjork carries something like a huge furry pita on his head in a pseudo-Asian ritual? Perhaps when mammoths and spines are used in a whale blubber experiment. Or when you're ready to kill the composer for creating a minimal and still annoying version of a Philip Glass score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is one of the most sophisticated films of modern art. At 135 minutes, it increases its claim by becoming boring. I would call the use of color stunning and the opening sequence interesting, but the rest of the movie looked like it had been filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary. Until it looks like they're trying to film their version of P-ss Christ, but that will follow later. <br /> <br /> In fact, the documentary parts were the best part of it. The surface plot is about a whaling ship, and then there is a ritual of making whale fat. Then there are the guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney, who are greeted on the ship by undergoing a ritual of humiliation that includes the already shaved head frenzy, nicotine patches, and huge furry pita hats. Then there is mutual denigration, cannibalism, and we must not forget the huge pile of shit. Matthew Barney wrote that this is about "the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity." It's almost like saying, "If you do not understand it, then you're not creative in your interpretation, so damn it, because I'm an artist." Oh, wait, that's the POST-modern interpretation of this sentence and what the movie would be about if it were POST-modern. But it should be modern art. To the art itself. <br /> <br /> So let's start with this whole interpretation, right? The following lines are only 3/4 serious and should not be understood as a realistic attempt to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> The first half hour involves pearl divers and the construction of a huge ramp. Obviously, the ramp is a symbol of the need for self-enhancement at the level you love, and the pearl divers are searching for pearls of wisdom. Then they build a box on a whaling ship that looks like it's in the rough shape of a whale. Obviously a rough element of foreboding. On the ship they make whale fat within the whale's shape and take out the fins part. They replace this with a spine and later with a huge shit. These are supposed to be the states of the movie itself. If it's fat, it's entertaining but bad for you. When it comes to the spine, these are the "important" parts of the movie or, as it were, the backbone. Then the giant crap is the guts of the movie, or if the movie is crap. <br /> <br /> Bj√∂rk and Matthew Barney, who arrive on separate ships, are put into strange, humiliating outfits that are not well-done. OR SYMMETRICY, one suspects that they run out of money and Barney tried to quit smoking , SO, they've put stains on his head. They go through a ritual and learn from a Japanese wise man that the ship was drawn by another ship when it was hit by a ship. a crash or an intersection, if you like. This inspires Bjork and Barney, who differ from the outside, to cut off each other's legs and eat them so that they can turn themselves into whales and be the same person. They cut themselves. Did I forget to mention that this was done in a video by Robbie Williams? Then the pearl divers come back with their mouthfuls of knowledge beads dropping them to form a stupid Venn diagram. Of course, Barney made it through the geometry of the 8th grade. Or at least a few social studies. <br /> <br /> Oh, and did I forget that I forgot Bjork's deafening I-want-to-kill-her score? Sometimes it's hypnotic, but for others, you just want to kill them. <br /> <br /> Art film is one thing, but if you raise all kinds of symbols, hoping to provoke people's reaction will be a self-destructive joke. When do you cross the line between art and joke? Dali and Bunuel often made surreal pieces of nonsense, but were more coherent and / or entertaining than this piece of garbage. Un Chien Andalou had the sensibility to stuff so much symbolism in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> Can I recommend it? Only if you like boring HIGH ART movies with a lot of symbolism and flat pictures. <br /> <br /> D +
