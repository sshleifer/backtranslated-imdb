Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a mob boss and is leaving a psychiatric institution behind in his gangster world. How can a director make a cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very pretty), Gabriel Hyrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol, and such a waste of time? This movie is a comedy that is not funny and has a constellation in the cast. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Prazer em Matar-te!' ("Joy to kill you!") <br /> <br />
