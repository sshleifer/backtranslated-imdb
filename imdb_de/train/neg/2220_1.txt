What the hell is in your thoughts? This movie is shit! Every minute I got bored. I tried to see the end, because I hope that at least something would happen! But instead, I was amazed at how boring the end was. Why does not he die? For God's sake, he is a damned human! A mere boy who killed his stupid sister 15 years ago. Then what ? His stay in a psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This film is fascinatingly stupid ... It is a must of stupidity. I'll sell it now to a stupid guy who will understand this stupid movie.
