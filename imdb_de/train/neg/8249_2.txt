Hi Guys, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is really shit. Think "love actually" vice versa. Nothing fits exactly, nothing is consistent and nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a total flop. As mentioned earlier, however, there are three points of redemption for this limited potential of a film. <br /> <br /> A) Jennifer Love Hewitt's star payroll will see hordes of people gracing this film just to catch a glimpse of little Hewitt's shapely clothes. To tell you guys now ... there are some promising scenes ... but it really is a faint eye-catcher. The "possibilities" here are watered down. Nevertheless, I have seen how the whole thing was tempted by the next scene, that you know what ..... tickling! <br /> <br /> B) The end is romantic and positive. That it is on the contrary and "over the top" relevant ..... yet was still a positive point for me. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays a friendly friend ........ REFRESHING! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/5, not worth $ 10. <br /> <br /> 2/3 of the way through, I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hewitt became the next softcore legend. I take that back first ... it depends very much on her next movie. Oh, and her sister is so stupid. Her husband is so stupid ... and heck, she's stupid. <br /> <br /> Next time. can not wait for the next love with JLH!
