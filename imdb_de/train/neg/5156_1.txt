"Laughter is a state of mind," says the day, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson. What could he have thought during the production of "Toys"? Did he see a successful, witty imagination when he saw the noise? If so, he works on a different level than me. This is a painful picture in which the production draft is 90% (and even the cartoons are a disappointment). Robin Williams and (especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as the brother and sister of a toy mogul, who are bypassed as heirs to the factory when their father dies. There's nothing remotely funny (satirical or slapstick-wise). It's even slimy, ugly and one of the worst "big" movies ever made. NO STARS of ****
