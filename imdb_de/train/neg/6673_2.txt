My first clue as to how bad this would be was when the video footage was reported by the people who brought us Blair Witch Project, which was a masterpiece compared to this trash. Acting was on the caliber of a sixth-grade production from Oklahoma, and the conspiracy it gave is predictable, boring, and crazy. 85% of the script consists of four letters and innumerable variations. Mother F seems to be the darling of the "writer" as she is constantly being used. It had to take 10 minutes to write this script on a recent dive. Thankfully, I rented it and was able to go through most of it in the fast forward. Do not waste your time or money with it.
