I just finished a marathon of this series, and it was agonizing to see how it progressed. From the fictionalization of historical elements to O'Herlihy's awful accent in later episodes, the show breaks down as progress grows. If you are looking for some generalized WW2 fluff I could recommend the first season, but avoid it afterwards. It degenerates to a step out of a soap opera with increasingly bad storylines and sensibility. <br /> <The old B & W movie is by far the best name of any entertainment called Colditz, and you can not even hope for that.
