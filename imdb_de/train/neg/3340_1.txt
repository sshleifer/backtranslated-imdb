This is the kind of movie that wants to be good but shit. First, what the hell does this punk want to do with the school? I think the kids do not seem to realize the gravity of the situation. The Deker guy tells the girl that they are under his responsibility when she asks why he wants to get her back, but right after that he gives the wheelchair user a gun and wants him to fix the phone line by himself. Where is the responsibility there? I understand poor actors have to pay for their food, but why not give them the money they need to make such a stupid movie or give the money to a charity. Oh yes, and none of them can aim. The stupid punk guy shoots nowhere like a madman in the cafeteria. They all want to look professional, but they all suck. Another thing I do not think that there is no emergency exit at school. The children try out several doors, but they are all locked. What happens when a fire burns and the security guard of Dumass is dead? It is illegal to have an emergency exit at school. There is much more to be said but it would be too long. I've spent some time of my life looking at a crap.
