It's not just a bad movie. It's not just four of the "best" Mexican filmmakers in this film; and not only the script is terrible. It's just ... this movie is shit ... great. These people are wasting money in terrible writings. The Mexican society should be criticized, but we are fed up with these kinds of films. Should bad language be funny? I do not get it. Mexican cinema has big problems if this type of movie is still being played (and written and produced). <br /> <br /> Please do not think that these types of films are well received in Mexico: we hate them and they do not reflect us.
