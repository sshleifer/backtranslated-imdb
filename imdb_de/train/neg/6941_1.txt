This movie is not only boring, it's also done really badly. The graphics are so bad that they are not even secondary - they are awful. The characters show no facial expressions, the voice seems empty and without soul, and the plot is absolutely missing .... well ... everything and everything. My 5-year-old likes it - but he finds it a bit boring. I agree with him.
