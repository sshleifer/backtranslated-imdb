I saw this on Showtime tonight and was amazed at how making a movie with such an interesting premise could become so terribly awful. WHO IS YOUR PAPI? plays Brandon Davis as an adopted high school graduate Chris Hughes, a geek who inherits the heirs of a porn empire left to him by his birth parents. Although the premise sounds like the movie could be a lot of fun, it ruins the inappropriate directing of first-time director Andy Fickman, a clich√©d and predictable script. Even the usually funny Charlie Talbert shows up in a surprisingly gloomy performance as best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and unsteady guy. 1.10
