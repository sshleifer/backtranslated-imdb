A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but it's all tied up in some stupid act or something. <br /> <br /> One of the most disturbing sex comedies ever. Does anyone know that this movie makes child abuse easy? I suppose it's okay, because it's a teenager - if we had a man seducing a teenager, that would be (rightly) outrage. I'm sorry, but if you did it to a boy, it does not apologize. It is still sick. I know that Brown was of age (he was actually 18 when this was done), but he looks 15. I just find it annoying that some people find this OK - but can not act; Brown is easily one of the worst kid actors I've ever seen) and the constant nudity gets boring and is not nearly erotic. In 1981 I was a theater. I was 19 years old and with my 14 year old cousin (who could easily pass 18). He wanted to see it - I did not do it, but I decided, what the hell? We got in and I actually bought tickets for three teenagers who were obviously minors. My cousin thought it was boring and the other three kids went halfway through! Let me make that clear - three TEENAGE BOYS have left a movie with tons of female nudity! That should give you an idea of ​​how bad that is. I am surprised that this has ever been published. A 1 all the way.
