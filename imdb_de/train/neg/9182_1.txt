As everyone else has said, the spectacle is terrible, no story or whatever, bad direction. About the SFX, the 360-degree shooting with Matrix style, 1 shot is stupid enough, but for every character. I mean, come give me a break. And what about all those video game scenes, just to remind us it's a "video game adaptation"? Jesus, they should have fired who invented this idea. <br /> <br /> 0.00001 / 10
