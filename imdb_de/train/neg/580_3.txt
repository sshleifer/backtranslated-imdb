Truly a bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable and bad as a supplement. <br /> <br /> The hunter story of this vampire is the worst I've seen so far, to which Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi) travels Mexico in search of bloodsuckers! He uses some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade) and is part of a hunter network of Van Helsig vampire?, OK, but he works alone. He is assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen who seeks a black crucifix to perform a ritual that enables her to be invulnerable to sunlight (almost a sequel to Vampires (1998) by John Carpenter with James Woods). Derek begins his quest looking for the Queen with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, also really bad), a teenager without experience, Father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente), Catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner), a special vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary), another vampire hunter. He is obviously not alone in this adventure. <br /> <br /> You can feel how this film only looks at its main actor (Jon Bon Jovi). is a big difference in acting quality compared to James Woods, and if you watch the movie (I do not recommend this part), you get involved in one of the simplest stories that are completely predictable and contain terrible theatrical performances, really bad special effects and incoherent events! I highly recommend not to watch this movie! borrow another movie, watch another channel, go out with your friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3 / 10
