In the seventies many really great horror films were produced - but this movie is certainly not one of them! It is a shame that the child is not better, as it starts from a decent idea that takes up some sometimes successful horror motifs. We have the idea of ​​a vengeful kid who worked so well in classic films like The Bad Seed, and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course was the backbone of many successful horror films. The plot is basically this: A young girl accuses a lot of people for her mother's death, so she goes to the cemetery and raises the dead to avenge herself (like you). That's all very well, except that it's boring! For the most part of the movie, nothing happens, and even though he ends up with a few nice sounds; There is no finale enough to get through the rest. The film was obviously shot on a budget because the locations look cheap and all the actors are garbage. I really can not say much about the movie because it does not have much to offer. The child is a dark 70's horror movie and I can not recommend it.
