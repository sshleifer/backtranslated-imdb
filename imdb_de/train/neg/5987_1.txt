I really did not like this movie. The plot was very predictable. Typical American conspiracy, I'm sorry. Guy gets the girl in the end. And London has a monorail? Bank of London ??? Bank of England is what it really is !! - I liked Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds myself though. And the British were bad guys? (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What happened to that? Oh, and they used to say things like "Here come 'The Thunderbirds'" - but it was never known as "The Thunderbirds" in the series. I would like to see it with more British actors in 20 years. I preferred the original series. We are sorry!
