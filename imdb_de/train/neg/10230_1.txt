Passed on a copy of it. Not mine, and if I had spent my own money on it, I would find those responsible and reclaim them! I can only say that would be a horrible student movie. An understanding of the medium of film is missing. Acting is awful, the story would have been rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as unoriginal and lame, and the change in the main character's response to the "ghost" is ridiculous, just agree that the "glowing" reviews of this movie are from friends and Family come. I'm afraid it's not even entertainingly bad. <br /> <br /> Amateur in the extreme! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
