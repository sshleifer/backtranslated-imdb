--- what happened to these unlikely people? Alan Arkin was not funny as usual and just went through the role. The kids are all a mess. Mariesa Tomei probably wishes that this role would never have come her way. And what are Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno doing in this really bad, mean movie? If you enjoy losing losers in their dysfunction and not trying to improve it, this is your movie. Everyone else goes for a walk, read a book or see something different. <br /> <br /> Jane
