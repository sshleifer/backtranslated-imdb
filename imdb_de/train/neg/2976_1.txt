As if by a miracle, this is actually very good to watch. I mean, it's bad. It is very bad. But while the original was so bad, my life is bad, it's so bad, it's mildly entertaining bad. Right, that's enough weak praise. The production values ​​are rotting all over, acting is agonizing and the Romero would-be satire can not decide on which side of the ecological fence it mocks itself. The internal logic recedes behind the heads moving out of the refrigerators. The incubation times of viruses vary depending on the "conspiracy", bullets against the zombies or not, zombies with language power or not. Gore is of course the draw, but the frame is so sloppy that it sucks. The dialogue sounds as if it had been translated by the same computers in which the manuals were mutilated, and the extent of the zombie attempt is not related to any of the ingenuity of Romero's films. The whole thing is rounded off with a horrendous synth note. Absolute garbage.
