It can be assumed that those who have praised this film ("the greatest filmed opera of all time", I have not read anywhere?), Either are not interested in the opera, not interested in Wagner or worry about anything else her desire to appear cultured. Either as a representation of Wagner's Schwanengesang or as a film, this seems to me a disastrous catastrophe, with a leaden reading of the score, which agrees with a tricky, melancholy translation of the text. <br /> <br /> It is questionable that people with ideas about what an opera (or even a play, especially Shakespeare's) should be allowed to have near a theater or film studio; Syberberg, very fashionable, but without the slightest justification from Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is a "bisexual integration", so that the title character in the last stages is turned into a kind of Beatnik baby, although he continues to sing high tenor - few if any of the actors in the movie are the singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor who is seen as the face (but not voice) of Amfortas, and also appears monstrous in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat during Good Friday music - in which, by the way, the transcendent loveliness of nature is represented by a proliferation of lavish and flabby crocuses stuck in poorly laid robes turf, an aid that amazes me. In the theater, we sometimes have to mend such imperfections with our thoughts, but I can not imagine why Syberberg was so lavish for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, the alpine pastures, as Julie Andrews has provided in Sound of Music. <br/> <br /> The sound is hard to bear, especially the high voices and the trumpets have an acoustic brilliance that adds another kind of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and the paralytic unfolding of the ritual. Someone in another review mentioned the Bayreuth recording of 1951, and Knappertsbusch, though his tempos are often very slow, had what Jordan generally lacks, a sense of the pulse, a feeling for the ups and downs of the music - and one after another half century The orchestral sound of this set is still superior to this film in modern pressings.
