One more of very unprofessional films about computer programmers. <br /> <br /> Looks like the authors of this movie do not know exactly what the world of programmers is. <br /> <br /> 20 top programmers in the world who program which ones have their own satellites (for what?), a program that uses satellite frequencies. Someone kills someone to steal the codes (why?) And many more stupid moments in this movie. People who are not programmers will see something terrible in this movie because not professionals on this. But people will not see real things. <br /> <br /> Programmers will find this film odd and awful - because many moments in the movie are not connected to real life (why not scifi in this case?).
