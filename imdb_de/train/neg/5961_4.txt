It was all over with the slashers around 88, so it was time for the kitschy rip-off of these older movies. The brain is well done, the script reminds me of Videodrome, but then, as I said, a bit cheesier. Acting can go through with it. But it's the effect that makes you laugh, the so-called brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown. The opening sequence makes the movie worth seeing, the hallucinations are really nice and reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street. Remember the vivid phone ... How to watch this movie all the time, and wait to see what happens next. It's visible to all the freaks out there because there's no thrill in it and as I said, the blood is not there, but there's nudity for the perverts. I've seen worse movies than this, just wished they'd made it bloodier ...
