"The Dream Child" from 1989 is the fifth film in the (mostly overvalued) "Nightmare" series, and at the latest from that time on, the series became a total waste. The only good films of the series were Wes Craven's original from 1984 and the third part "The Dream Warriors" from 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part, in which the formerly weird crazy Freddy Krueger started with idiotic jokes annoy. This fifth installment of the series has little to recommend, except for (admittedly great) visuals and a scary scene, a flashback sequence, as Freddy Krueger was created. The rest of the movie consists mainly of our razor-mad lunatics screaming silly one-liners, and the old formula of a bunch of teenage girls desperately trying to avoid falling asleep, because good old Freddy expects them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox is again in the role of Alice Johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting crap, like a super-silly 'eerie' nursery rhyme, is added for no other reason than to have a justification for this redundant and boring sequel. In a nutshell: no originality, just a drop in the old formula and an overload of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals and, above all, highlights the difference to the terrible sequel to "Freddy's Dead," which is unbelievable. If you're not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast, "The Dream Child" should be avoided, and even if you are, it will most likely disappoint.
