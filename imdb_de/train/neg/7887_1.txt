... then they have a decent place to dump this crap. Sorry, not a "secret" as it claims to be religious hocus-pocus. I have always waited for the "unimaginable evil" that was promised to me, but the "evil" in this film would be unimaginable only for a five-year-old with learning disabilities. <br /> <br /> I can not believe it actually managed to find some well-known actors who were willing to take part in this embarrassment. Unfortunately, it has changed my mind about them, and I will probably avoid anything they do in the future. I am also a bit worn out that I now have to memorize the name of a writer and the director, as I will avoid anything the plague may from now on. <br /> <br /> This is a pity The religious fanatics post here, saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, and so on. This could lead to more people being tricked because I thought this film was something other than religious preaching. <br /> <br /> Well, it's off to the video store to get my money back for fake advertising. Too bad that they can not give me back the 105 minutes I had wasted thinking that this was indeed a Hollywood horror / supernatural movie.
