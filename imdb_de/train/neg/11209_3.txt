This bland mini operetta with Eddy McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad that it is five minutes to an endurance training. It's silly from the start, as this brevity opens two military men talking about the lack of masculinity in the son of one of the officers. In less than a minute he drove to Morrocco, where he lives a double life as a red shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe who would rather sing than fight. <br/> Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare have fine light operatic voices (with little histrionic ability), and there is also a decent bass, but the acting is Random scenes that are so poorly prepared that you feel that things come together over time. <br /> <br /> These two roles were part of a larger stage production in which six authors are listed. With more room for spoof and bustle, the show had maybe some entertainment value, but this piece Quickie is not much more than an insult to an audience that is waiting for the feature presentation.
