This was a disappointment - nothing of the nuance of the original. The British seem to be able to make a truly disturbing film without the exaggerated histrionics of the American version. The original series combined both spooky stories and subtle performance with great attention to lighting and settings. I have seen the series many times and am still fascinated. <br /> <br /> Just a bad adaptation in the direction of the terrible adaptation of "crackers". Meet BBC America or BBC Canada and look out for delicacies like Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John Deed. Take a look at the original Touching Evil and look for "Wire in the Blood" to learn more about Robson Green's truly unobtrusive, elegant performance. Hollywood has to look at this actor!
