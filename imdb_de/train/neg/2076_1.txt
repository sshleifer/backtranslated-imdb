Well, I have to say, this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year! The jokes were extremely meager (I did not expect it as a PG movie) (Rated PG in Canada) and they were not funny! At least I had expected a good acting with this great cast, but I did not even get that. I'm a big Rainn Wilson fan and was extremely disappointed with his performance for the first time. Neither the characters of Luke Wilosn nor Uma Thurman are the least sympathetic and I could have really been less worried about what happened to both of them. I did not expect that, because in the past I really liked other films by this director (Six Days, Seven Nights for example). I guarantee you, like me, beg when this movie is over.
