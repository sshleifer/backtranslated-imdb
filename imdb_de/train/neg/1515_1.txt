I saw the movie "The Flock" because of the casting of Gere and Danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting. This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time (and I have seen a few turkeys). I've never posted online, but this movie was so horrible that I had to do that. I think the problems start with the script, which was so amateurish that it is unbelievable. History makes no sense and dialogue is so banal that it is disgusting. Poor Gere, he deserves so much better. As far as the Gere / Danes are concerned when playing with the screen, one does not believe any of the characters for one minute because of the terrible writing. I'll bet Gere wishes he could buy back the negative if that were possible. It's a shame to waste so many talents, not to mention the desire to get my 2 hours back. (I know what you think, how do I really feel?)
