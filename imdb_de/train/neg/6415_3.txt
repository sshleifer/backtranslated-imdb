This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It was slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not entertaining. Sarah Michelle Gellar had grown up with her old playbook and had empty expressions of fear and shock. She could not sell her character or anyone else in the picture. <br /> <br /> For those who thought the Grudge was "kind of okay", you should not see this unless you enjoy wasting your character's time and your life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I did not watch this movie for free, so I do not want it to be a scream from a guy who lost $ 8 in a horrible movie. It was free, it was still sucking, I hated it. <br /> <br /> Dodge.
