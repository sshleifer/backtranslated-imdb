Earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian hit by a truck. He goes to heaven and he gets another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white man. So Lance does some things in Charles's body. The movie has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the 2005 animated comedy, is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done far better things. They will only make the whole movie laugh about four times. And it's not really funny to laugh. They'll make you laugh and maybe giggle, but you definitely will not roll on the floor laughing.
