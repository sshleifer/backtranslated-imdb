I'm sorry, I had high hopes in this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to hold my attention. When I realized that the entire movie was actually just an older man reliving his dream, I felt betrayed. Surely it could have been a means to bring us deeper into something deeper and more meaningful. <br /> <br /> So, do not buy a big drink or you will run into the restroom. My children did not enjoy it either. Ah great.
