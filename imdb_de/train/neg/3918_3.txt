This movie was perhaps the biggest disappointment I experienced when lending movies on IMDb reviews. All in all, I just found it a second-rate movie. <br/> <br /> Leslie Cheung is certainly passable as the anti-hero and Ma Wu handle his character with cheerful competence. On the other hand, Ma Wu's make-up (facial hair) is obviously so phony that I just could not take it seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager disguised for Halloween, complete with the $ 4.95 stick-on beard. The special effects were so-so, although the "undead" in the basement were pretty good. The Tree Tongue looked like a vicious monster movie from the 1950s, although from the tongue's point of view the POV shots resembled Sam Raimi's trademark in the newer "Evil Dead" trilogy. The pyrotechnics were high and the last fight is as boring as you can. (In fact, it most closely reminded me of the "Lost in Space" episode, in which the Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and ....) <br /> <br /> The plot was not particularly original and became countless times tells in the form of European fairy tales. There was no tension and no plot twists. In fact, you know instantly how to be introduced to the characters, who is good, who is bad and who will survive. <br /> <br /> I just returned this movie to Netflix and then sat down write this review The first thing I did was check the production date. Yes, it's 1987 ... not the year 1967 that I thought it could be. And that puts it in a nutshell: the production values ​​and FX are typical of the 1960s. The storyline and action seem much older, as Hollywood actually produced some interesting and challenging movies in the '60s. <br /> <br /> ** out of *****
