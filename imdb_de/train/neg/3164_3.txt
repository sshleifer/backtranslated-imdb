The disgusting Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) from a truck falls on her and kills her. She then tries to ruin her ex-boyfriend's relationship with his new girlfriend, a clairvoyant who can see her. Obvious unoriginal movie would not be bad in a stereotypical way Longoria's character is hateful and vile that she pulls all the fun out of the movie. It's like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper. To be fair, Longoria or anyone else in the cast or crew, that's not the problem, it's the horrible script that distracts the process. It's just very, really stupid.
