There are three films with this animation style that I like to remember in my youth. This movie, "The Last Unicorn", "Flight of Dragons" and "The Hobbit". I have copies of "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent) and had not seen "The Last Unicorn" for over a decade. That was until today and I wish I had not done it. What bothered me the most was the script. It was incredibly choppy and often crazy. Things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation. We're not just talking about trifles here. We talk about important plot points! The story itself is not great at first, but it could have worked if the script had been decent. Not even close. Besides, the music was terrible! I know that music in movies like this rarely has classical pieces, but the music in this movie got me knocked out with a bowling ball. This was one of those movies I would show my kids one day, but he was just cut. I do not think I could get through this crap again. Disappointed, it brings mild.
