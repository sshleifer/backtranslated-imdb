This has the logical consequence of marshmallow stuffed with ketchup, and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting. <br /> <br /> Used at the 9th circle of Hell for recovery time. Just torture. <br /> <br /> I would rather see 90 minutes of my computer through 5400 blue screens of death than to see that terrible noise again - always. Dreadful. Dreadful. Dreadful. <br /> <br /> You know, the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that besides the holes you also get cheese: here it is ONLY holes - and the excitement factor? Well, that turns dry painting into an adrenaline rush and an Olympic race. <br /> <br /> My brain hurts when I want to find out who fixed that jerk. (I sincerely hope not, otherwise there will be no salvation.) The only consolation is that they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes. Made for TV should not be a synonym for: "Sure, let the horseback run through the living rooms! Our audience is idiots!" <br /> <br /> I was addicted just to know how it could get worse. That's not a good sign, people. <br /> <br /> Hallmark should be ashamed to have it published. <br /> <br /> I should be ashamed if I look at it. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed. I'm having a long shower.
