Why such a generic title? Santa Claus??? So bland and unpredictable. Movies before tried to take advantage of the holiday spirit, especially "Santa Claus conquers the Martians". At least it was entertaining to watch for the lack of action, and all the archive material used for whatever reason seemed to me to be happy. But this movie brings Christmas only in the butt and the joy of all children. Santa Claus lives in space? His enemy is a devil called Pitch? Santa gets help from Merlin, the magician? How coincidental is that? Well, since it was done in Mexico, some of you may know how the movie was made. I had to admit that some of the effects were just crazy for the time. It was a total pile of madness! Despite all the difficulties with the film, it still feels like a Christmas movie. Good conquers the evil, and Christmas still plays a part of our hearts of any good girl or boy in the world or possibly in the universe, thanks to Santa Claus conquering the Martians .. apparently. I think you should try, even if it's one of the worst holiday movies of all time ... even though it should make you smile every day.
