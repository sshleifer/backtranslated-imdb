I think I like the new Star Wars movie "Phantom Menace" the best. He'll probably blast "Titanic" out of the water if you forgive the pun, when it comes to a devastating box of office receipts and thus out of the number one place. Every time I tell someone that "Titanic" is the best movie they've ever seen, I think, "You do not watch a lot of movies, do you?" What a travesty. You could make 50 good films that are much better than "Titanic", and for the same price. <br /> <br /> "Well, it has won many Academy Awards, many people really loved it," as if someone could say in defense of it. Well, many people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that does not mean it's of high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans MAY be wrong. <br /> <br /> First, I have to admit that part of the problem for me was the megahype about the movie. I waited about a month to see it, and in the end, it did not meet the expectations set on it, which simply drew more attention to the dreadfully stupid love story. It's true, "Phantom Menace" is likely to suffer a similar fate. but. <br /> <br /> James Cameron's "Titanic" is. a) a cheesy action film disguised as a serious piece for the period. b) a three-hour epic, in which the best moments in the trailer are given away. c) a juicy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d) something better for documentarians, which would have been much more fun. e) a movie with arrogance that corresponds to the level shown with the real ship. f) a robbery of 3 hours that I never get back, hence the biggest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone who has not seen it yet, I say, "I wish I could swap places with you." g) a slap in the face of a real victim of hypothermia. How long should we believe that people can be immersed in ice-cold water and still form understandable sentences? h) Thankfully, a movie that was not recognized for acting at the Oscars. i) a technological achievement in filmmaking and little else. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm posting this as an anonymous comment is that I can NOT welcome the refutation of 10,000 thirteen-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio fans, who have no doubt about it, in his defense, and I'm not really interested in hearing a defense of the history of the Titanic, its acting or its length.
