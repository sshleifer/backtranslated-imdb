This is a good example of how NOT to shoot a movie. <br /> <br /> There are very few meaningful dialogues, no context for events, and constant cuts between seemingly disconnected scenes. The result is a confused, unsuspecting viewer. It is absolutely impossible to follow the plot and the presented ideas are meaningless without the comments of the director. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot to do with human atrocities and tries to show how wrong it is, with emphasis on child abuse. It contains some inventory of real, terrible acts of violence, including wartime executions. Although it works in the context of the film, I feel that the ideas behind the film could have been portrayed without having to resort to such extreme content. This movie is absolutely NOT for weak stomaches or easily hurt people and should under no circumstances be shown to minors. <br /> <br /> The climax is anti-climactic compared to the content of the film. If you do not hear the comment while it's happening, you'll probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The director's comment was a one-shot mode: "Sit down on the guy and let him talk, no cuts" comment. While not necessarily bad, the director often ends up spending minutes on complaining about his college, shooting conditions, co-producers, a bad movie, and a dozen other things. The constant negativity has a negative effect on what is otherwise an essential tool for understanding the film. <br /> <br /> The film was shot many years ago on a 16mm and a Super8 film over a four year period on an extremely low budget. For this reason, the video and audio quality is poor. That alone does not make it a bad movie, but it makes a bad movie even worse.
