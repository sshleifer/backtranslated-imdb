There is an interesting discussion in this film. Is it good enough to be a moral person, or do you need something more? <br /> <br /> The film preaches that being a morally good person without God's guidance is not enough. At the beginning of the film, there is a line: "You and I can look at a person who is morally good, but both know that he will go to hell." <br /> <br /> While I'm not a Christian, the discussions throughout the film were intriguing, but not in the manner intended by the film. I left the film with the stronger feeling that it is morally good to be enough. The arguments and discussions put forward were strongly biased, crushing them under the weight of their own ignorance. Fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially if it is derived in the minds of the ignorant and illiterate. As George Carlin's figure in Dogma said, "Hook while you're young." <br /> <br /> The basic requirement is also very interesting. A Bible scholar from the 1890s tries to publish a book that states that morality is fine without God as long as morality matters. Just tell a kid not to steal? Or tell him that he should not steal because God tells you not to do this? (He did not mind addressing the child, not stealing, because how would he feel if his marbles were stolen?) The author, Carlisle, wants to help his school's recommendation to sell the book (around the world) spread). However, it requires unanimous consent, and one of the scholars is against it. He expresses in a very interesting discussion early in the film the morality of morality against the argument of God. To prove it, he produces a time machine (just use the movie to get the action working, which I'm fine with), and sends Carlisle to the year 2002 to see where teaching morality without God leads us As it should be obvious, he has his opinion and is changed by what he sees, and has turned around until he returns (because he returns, that's not a spoiler, that's a bible) .) Film after all). <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, it's pretty slow and pretty badly played. What was not * needed * in this movie is that it produces two "bad guys" who want to find out who Carlisle is, even if he did not hurt anyone, committed a crime, or anything. What's wrong with the movie just showing Carlisle's opinion, showing his view of this "sinful world" and giving it back with a new point of view? <br /> <br /> There are also some points in the film that confirm that I'm happy, that I'm not a Christian, or at least someone who says, "It's God or nothing." Three at the end of the movie really worried me. First, when the two "bad guys" make corner Carlisle just before the jump, Carlisle makes his * only * truly despicable act. He falsifies how his leap in time comes Jesus, and makes it so that the "bad guys" (who, by the way, are also Christians, strangely enough) that they simply missed the rapture. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after Carlisle returns, he finds a boy in which he insulted not stealing at the beginning of the movie (but not to mention God, the child kept the marbles and ran away) , and tell him this time, stealing is wrong because God commands it. As in the Carlin quote above, scare children into religion is a faux pas in my book. <br /> <br /> And finally the epilogue. Another anxiety tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far he could go in the future and he says he does not know. The epilogue shows him trying to distort a Bible into the distant future (begins around 2100), and he fails. He continues to diminish the years at 10 and try again and by hiding he is around 2030 or so. Throughout the film, Carlise mentions that he felt the end of the world because the world was full of sin and the loss of the name of God. Fear tactics have been used for thousands of years. In these cases one would think enlightened times would have enlightened the church too. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie. I was pretty sure it was morally good, but now I know it. Worth seeing if you are not a Christian to confirm how happy you are, do not be as ignorant as the people in this movie.
