After about twenty minutes I was already bored. These characters were just pretty boring. Occasionally something good would happen, but then things would slow down again. Luckily my patience was finally rewarded, and the end of this movie was not bad at all. It was by no means good enough to get through the first ninety minutes. Well, I would say that the movie was mediocre overall, and considering the talents in the cast I would call that a disappointment.
