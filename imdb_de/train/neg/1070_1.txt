I've seen some bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy That Steals Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so dreadful, so boring that I was about halfway finished and could not stand the rest. A shame. With talents like Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham, what went wrong? Branagh is a great lawyer flying a night with Davitz. Her father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hanged her cat, etc., so Branagh sent him to a nut shack and he flees promptly. Somehow (I could not figure out how) Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all involved in the story, which moves more slowly than stationary. I wanted to do that, and since I'm a big Grisham fan, I read all about this movie and I expected (stupidly) something interesting. This is, frankly, the worst movie I've ever seen, and I wish I could get my money back. * out *****.
