I actually felt bad for the actors in this matter. Undoubtedly, a high school acting class could do a better job or at least a job. The actors must have believed that this would be their big chance to work in a movie. Apart from the terrible acting, the stories were boring and largely predictable. The remote control made no sense at all. Unfortunately it had the best premise in the group. <br /> <br /> I support only low-budget films and give new filmmakers a fair chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to him the observer. I only saw it because of some good comments. They must have been planted by people with ties to the movie. You can make people look at it, but you can not make them like what they saw. Sure it failed miserably, but it tried. I reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this dribble. I wish I had.
