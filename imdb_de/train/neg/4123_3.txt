Although the beginning suggests All Quiet on the Western Front, this stupid and superficial version of the war falls far short of its much better contemporary. This is the funniest war ever to be waged, with the first hour and a half dedicated to romance and good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see a fight, it's lame: an enemy plane is flying by? Shoot it down (in one shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before he shoots. Enemy soldiers in the forest? Do not worry, they willingly surrender. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Tepid, plausible, predictable ... <br /> <br />
