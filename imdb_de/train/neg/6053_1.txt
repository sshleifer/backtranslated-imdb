absolutely garbage. I liked Halloween and from then on Johnny was in a downward spiral. This is about the pits. we get it john Pro-lifters are scary! You do not have to make a crappy movie that bores me hell to "tell" me. It feels like John does not have much to do here. It looks like he did not write that garbage. There are countless times when the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look stupid or say something stupid. I love the long cut. Too bad that the carpenter does not know how to use it. he has to shop 30 years ago with Herzog and Fassbinder. Please, John, stop fooling yourself and bore me to death!
