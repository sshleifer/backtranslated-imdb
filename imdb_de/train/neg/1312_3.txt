Tom listens to one of those old-school radio programs that kids would watch on television from the 1950s to the present day. However, no television was broadcast when this cartoon was produced. People got their entertainment - from comedy to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom literally wiggles his boots and listens to a story about the "phantom". In fact, he literally does everything the narrator says, for example, "hair is upside down, icy chills race down his spine, her heart beats in the throat," etc. Jerry watches Tom and laughs off his fear - cat antics , <br /> <br /> We then get a taste of what we will see after this cartoon for many years, in which Jerry Tom tortures for no other reason than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but if he takes care of his own affairs and Jerry physically (and in this case) physically abuses him, it's hard to root that "little guy" early T & M efforts were a minute longer than anything that followed. Sometimes this one minute makes a difference. It did here when it actually lingered for a while. It could have been reduced to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches were too long. This is common for Tom and Jerry. Usually they are much faster.
