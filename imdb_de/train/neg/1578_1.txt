Imagine, it is about 12-1 clock in the morning - you are at home, you are bored, you are not tired. This scenario occurred about four years ago. I turned on the TV and flipped through a few channels and found that this movie was running. Oh my word, this is the worst movie I have ever seen! A runaway car that can not be stopped (because the brakes are off or so), when it shuts down on the highway - what will happen ?! This movie was so bad that it's actually funny - I think the stunts cost about $ 2 to make it. There has been a case where a baby / toddler was cranked out of the car in a helicopter - to excite the viewer - a conveniently located position The bridge is approaching soon ... THIS IS THE BEST BAD PLEASE OF A FILM - It shows that the kid just missed the bridge, but it looks so bad - you can almost see the look of the dumbbell they used - total low budget classic! I can not remember the end of the movie, but I bet it was great. <br /> <br /> I doubt they'll ever show this movie again, so I'm glad I saw this junk !
