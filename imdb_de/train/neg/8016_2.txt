At first, GLACIALLY is slowly on the move, and I can see most viewers lose patience in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film was one that I think would be the basis for making an excellent movie; What was missing most here was a conspiracy that would drive the underlying issues. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate, because in the hands of a writer like Lanford Wilson, I think that symbolism is like a mountain lion entering a group. The school campus could have great, tragic proportions without being stubborn , <br /> <br /> I think with a good script supporting the movie, the same filmmaker, the same taste, and even the same actors (who did not even have the chance to impress me) might have a meaningful and Touching portrayal of the pain and struggles a boy undergoes as he develops a strong "crush" on an older boy whom he admires. Unfortunately I have to say that without this foundation and armed with a vague, boring and extremely uninteresting script, without any conspiracy in sight and without any kind of weapons, is reasonable structure (for example I believe that after viewing you can not refer to climate scenes, but you will find, "Well, maybe this scene or these were highlights ...") - the result is 95 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> Without a good action, we will never be terribly interested in any of the characters; Your exams and difficulties are just boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, dramatic gimmicks and surrealistic directorial freedoms are more puzzling and confusing than plot improvements. For example, I never really believed in the creation of "Leah," and I think most viewers would be amazed by the traditional way their phone calls were filmed. <br /> <br /> What the movie looks like, I'm afraid I can not recommend it at all. What I can never understand is why a movie like THIS is not recreated by an enterprising filmmaker ... instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were outstanding in the first release! All it takes is a good script, written by good writers, and I think this film could easily become a memorable classic about an aspect of male adulthood that is rarely treated in dramas. All the elements that were so boring in the movie and so researched (the messages written on the boy's belly, the "Leah" scenes, the TV fantasies) could get rich if they were backed up with a good STORYLINE. <br /> <I see in some comments that people are talking about this movie as if they were somehow of a "gay" topic, and I think that's wrong. Obviously, the "swarm" depicted here is a freshly pubescent boy of an older adolescent boy, but the character of Logan is far too young to have made certain sexual choices, and in his pictorial masturbation fantasies all sorts of sexual stimuli and non-sexual, as we would expect from a very young boy like him. I think "crushes" like Logan's are common among male adolescents who have a decided preference for female sex partners.
