This movie was awful. I could barely stay awake. I would never see this movie again if I got paid for it. The so-called horror scenes were increasingly predictable and dubbed. There was really nothing about the movie that originally made it or worth the $ 7.50 I paid for it. Do not look at it, do not rent it, do not read it online, because one of those things would be a waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a lackluster performance and was really ashamed to have sullied her good name with this movie. Be ashamed, Sarah, of being associated with this horrible, terrible movie. Terrible movie, it's not necessary to ever see him.
