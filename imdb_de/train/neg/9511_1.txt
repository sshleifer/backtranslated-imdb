I wanted to watch this movie since it was first shown on TV. I went to Tinsel Town at 7:40 am last night. I regret the day my ticket for this garbage was wasted when I could see something better. The beginning was a pile of sex rubbish and clich√©s. They have exaggerated the way that love works in reality. All girls were stereotypes. The friend was too stupid for his age. The passing gases that the pregnant girl barely laughed at. The bank robbery was completely boring with gags used in other films. Her escape car was an old Chevy van that was said to have no breaks. Hey, why did not they get a pretty girlish vehicle for the robbery instead? It could have raised the audience's opinion about the movie. This film was very low low low low budgeted because nothing was damaged or destroyed in it. This movie contained a lot of things that would drive Christian people crazy. Hey, I even expected a car chase scene because all bankrupt movies have car chases, but I've never seen any. So I rate this movie with b, which stands for little budgeted and one in ten stars.
