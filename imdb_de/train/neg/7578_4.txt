"Superchick" (1973) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that still manages to be entertaining, as a movie-length version of the 70s TV hit "Love, American Style" with nudity. And the main character here, Tara B. Right, is really some kind of super-chic. A stewardess (not a flight attendant) who looks so good that even her plane's autopilot has made a run (!), And with a well-made friend in each port, this full-fledged girl really brings the "lay". in "stopover". What about Tara with her Germain surgeon surgeon Beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star guy in LA? And if she does not take these guys off from all their masculine energy, as the onlooker learns, she'll probably take a karate class, miles of clubbing, defend blinkers and rapists, visit groovy pot parties, and stop a hijacking attempt on her plane. As I said, carefree fun and certainly good for a night in which you feel a little brain dead and just want to get out in front of the tube. The future astrologer Joyce Jillson brings in her role as Tara with an empty charm, and the film looks good to please. Disappointing is the 70s of Buxom that Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (also known as Candy Samples) are wasted in very small roles, but they can still do what they do best - show off their pecs! Although the picture is never hilarious and does not really have much thought in its metaphorical head, it manages to be thoroughly amusing, and I think that's something. Strange that the credits should pay attention to Mrs. Jillson's body. Do not think I've ever seen this before!
