I saw "Shiner" on DVD. As I watched it, I thought, "This is a really bad porn strip without the porn." I also thought, "Whoever wrote this has some real problems." Then I watched as the director / writer Carlson explained his process as a special feature. Yes, it was really special. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is on two alcoholic losers beating each other to get out. They are not very attractive. There is frontal and full nudity. These factors are probably responsible for the movie being seen at all. <br /> <br /> The most exciting element of the movie is gay bashing and the subsequent gay-bashing of the same victim, who unwillingly tries to avenge his attackers on the two drunken losers. The topic is treated not only from a technical point of view absurd and bad, but the spectacle is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> Then there is the topic of boxer stalker. This is really crazy, not only absurd. This hunky boxer is traumatized by the stubborn attention of a fleshy mother's boy working in the parking lot of his gym. That's in LA, mind you. The boxer is so traumatized that he appears in the house of the stalker, spreads out in front of him and gets excited. <br /> <br /> Well, all I can say is why a boxer who cares about being an exhibitionist is so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It just does not make sense. And, I'm afraid some psychodynamics actually make sense if you take the time to read about them. Bad scripts make no sense at all. <br /> <br /> The director / writer seems to have believed that this film represents a significant minority within the gay community. Well, he could be right, I think. We may never know, as this minority would be so dysfunctional that it could barely organize enough to ever get to an obscure gay film festival or DVD store, the only places they could find that turkey. Thank God.
