What a stinkeroo that was! Linda Darnell was one of my favorites at a time much earlier in her career - not a great actor shake, but very nice and enjoyable (especially in movies like "The Sign of Zorro" and "Blood and Sand"), but when saw this monstrosity, the memories of their golden days fading quickly. The story is unbelievable and unconventional, the acting secondary, the understaffing unbearable. I can not think of any immature performance compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring protagonist they could have chosen. Add to that the terrible photography (and I'm not just referring to the color!). Everyone who deals with it must shudder whenever it has been shown.
