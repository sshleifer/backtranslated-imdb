I am Irish and have been living in Denmark for some time. I was looking forward to going home last week to see Intermission. And I'll stick to what's being said: <br /> <br /> THIS FILM IS WONDER. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad, something like "The most fertile man in Ireland", but definitely not on stage with other Irish films like The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the movie are actually quite funny, like Colm Meaneys in American style. But the movie itself is completely wrong. The hopping of the camera and the constant zooming in and out try to give the film a pithy look, as if it were a pithy drama. But it is not This is an Irish Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and it should be shot like that. There should be a gentle movement from one shot to the next. The movie just looks sloppy and ragged. <br /> <br /> The performances are okay given the horrible screenplay. A friend of mine said to me as if they were following Colin Farrell for a week in the Dublin area. He gives a decent appearance as a Dublin Dirtbag, but it is by no means comparable to his achievements in the Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was achieved by Dierdre O'Kane, who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who has just been dismissed by her bank manager for a younger woman. I think she should give up her dreadful stance and focus more on her acting. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is by no means in line with the expectations that the Irish press places on it or even deserves to be considered one of the best Irish films ever. <br /> <br /> I expect these comments to be backlashed as most of the people I talked to said it was great. But before you answer, ask yourself: Would you rate this movie so high when playing in England or America?
