I really wanted to like this movie much more than me. That's because I love crazy foreign comedies - especially the strangers that totally surprise you. Although this one often surprised me, these were almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park when almost EVERY social norm was violated until the only ones left were too sick to be funny. After exploring adultery, drug abuse (of almost any kind - ranging from pot, heroin, speed to coryza), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc. - the film came to the hilarious (?) Theme of pedophilia. Mom encouraged her one son (who looked about 12 years old) to sleep with neighboring men. In fact, at some point, she gives this boy to the dentist instead of paying for the dental work! Funny?! You want to kid me. This movie just goes too far and plunges into the "Black Hole of the Comedy". What should they make fun of about cancer or rectum tumors next?
