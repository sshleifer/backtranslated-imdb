I looked forward to watching this movie, and then realized that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was overrun by unnecessary cursing. Now I'm in no way a nerd, but obscenities screaming at each other does not make a good movie. Ewan Bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at the time (testifying to his performance in the god-fearing Life of Stuff) & his cockney accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. Like many more of these films, "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang," "Beautiful Creatures," we have to suffer before the filmmakers realize that the F-word, the C-word, and so on, do not replace the proper dialogue.
