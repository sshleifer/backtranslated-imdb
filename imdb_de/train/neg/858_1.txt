I hate this movie! It was NOT like the book and it makes me crazy to think about it. If you watch the movie before you read the book, it's a good movie. But King's book was incredible and this movie was not like that at all. I mean, the general meaning may be similar, but most aspects of the movie are completely different. The end for example! The book is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes. But in this horrible movie version, Jack likes to lead them through a stupid labyrinth ... Yeah, the book is not a labyrinth and there's no reason for that. Another part that infuriated me was that Jack killed Mr. Halloran! What the hell, he's basically the hero of the book and they just kill him like he's not important. Overall, it was just awful that the movie was so extremely bad.
