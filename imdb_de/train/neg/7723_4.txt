Well, I could not even enjoy this movie because of its cult values. It is a B-movie action movie by the director of Commando, but far too lame and stupid to be entertaining enough for a good B-movie. <br /> <br /> It's a '90s movie, but most of all, the movie was supposed to be reminiscent of an action movie from the' 80s, when this kind of B-movie was an all time high. These films have always been exaggerated and never paid much attention to the story or the drama. It was about blowing things up, big muscle heroes and bullets flying around. This film contains all these ingredients, but I really did not like this movie as much as similar films. Hard to say why, because history and acting and the like are just as bad as in other genre films of the same era. <br /> <br /> This is probably because the movie is often far too stupid. All these types of films have their stupid moments, but this movie is just full of it. The fights, Dolph Lundgren, walking around shirtless, the characters, the story. It's not very good, because it's often too lame for words. Sometimes history does not even try to make sense, and what's even the main line of the entire movie? His story is really everywhere and just seems to be about making a movie with combat sequences, firearms and so on. And those sequences are not even good at really looking at them. The moments are too short and quite disappointing to really watch from the man who brought us "Commando". <br /> <br /> It is primarily a Dolph Lundgren, in which he plays the big action hero-star Who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease, understands the handling of weapons and other weapons and of course gets that from Tia Carrere played girls. This also leads us to one of the worst montage sequences in the history of action movies and definitely one of the worst sex sequences I've ever seen in a movie. Both are just too lame for words and very poorly put together. <br /> <br /> None of the characters really works. The good guys are policemen, but they never seem to behave like one. They just kill around without blaming anyone, and they are not very keen to make arrests or inform anyone about their discoveries. Not even when they find out that a large Japanese crime syndicate wants to take over the streets of L.A. and serves a brewery as cover for a drug factory and for drug smuggling on a grand scale. And just think about it, what's the main purpose of Brandon Lee in the movie? The movie could easily have gone without him and the girl. <br /> <br /> Too stupid, lame and simple and just not entertaining enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
