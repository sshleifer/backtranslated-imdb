I would not look at all the good reviews so quickly and say that this could be a good show. This show is only good if you do not know what "talent" is. I will not even say how offensive it is (I know that it can be offensive to many people), because that's not really what bothers me about the show. What bothers me is that people think that's funny and think it's too stupid, and I'm actually scared that someday it will be run by people watching this garbage. <br /> <br /> Basically, the plot is simple .. it's about an offensive, self-centered, spoiled woman (Sarah Silvermen) to get through everyday life. <br /> <br /> That's it. Like not a million times. In fact, almost every joke was made or is racist. <br /> <br /> Sarah likes to sing too ... I like her voice..that is ... not the lyrics..the lyrics are awful ... and she likes to sing about a lot of things .. <br /> < br /> If you want to see a hot woman, put down all the others and do th you feel like crap while writing crap and crap on every race, then this show is for you.
