This is the first horror-test movie I've seen, and after almost thinking, I do not need to see any of the others. I've been told it's a "horror movie by the thinker," and I have to say, if I thought so, I'll take the trigger to think about what the splatter / gore movies in the collection will look like. Do not get me wrong, not even the bunch in this movie is worth it to sit through. <br /> <br /> The plot is saved with far too much art for the arts. The camera effects and music are mostly inappropriate and the characters are banal, to say the least. Some characters and scenes seem to be worthless in the end when they start unveiling some of the hooks of "The Hamiltons". I found out with whom Lenny was about half an hour when I found out the movie. I was so optically underneath worlds and confused by the Lenny revelation that I felt completely torn off. I expected what I got, but they could have gone so much, in fact the whole blood pressure is completely gone. With movies like "Hostel" and "Saw", you need to get a little better for a movie that is considered "too graphic or too disturbing for the general public."
