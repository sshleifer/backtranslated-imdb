I can not believe that the city of Muncie is so harsh for attention that it would embarrass itself if it allowed the show there. This show is like a slap in the face for hard-working police officers. I've never seen anything so stupid in my life before. If they had charged it as a comedy, that would be one thing, but to say it is reality is nothing less than a lie. I only saw it once and was appalled by what I saw. I wanted to hunt the little guy with a bad guy. What a joke that would have been. Nothing on the show was even close to the real world. The city of Muncie, the police chief and all the police should hang their heads and should never want to admit they are from this city. No wonder it did not stay on TV
