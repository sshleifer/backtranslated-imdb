As a big fan of Corman's horror movies, I expected more from his western than I got. Well, I was well entertained. I had almost as much laughter as Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles. <br /> <br /> See the spectacle of the mobile tire tracks in the prairie of the old west. You can kill time by counting it, otherwise there's a boring scene going on. And the horses also seem to have cogwheels, considering the fast forward chases. See the swinging bar room queens of the traditional Wild West salon making a number reminiscent of a particular 1920s fashion dance, decades before the style was invented. I hope the salon around her will not crumple. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this chaos, the leading actors do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are really alright. Special praise to her for doing the best they could with the material that was largely removed from Johnny Guitar, but not quite as impressive. But with a ridiculous Western is really nothing to complain about. Just like a really bad old horror movie, it can fail in some way, but it still manages to bring joy. That's one of the reasons why Corman's work appeals to me. Therefore, I dare to recommend that you experience this movie if you have the chance.
