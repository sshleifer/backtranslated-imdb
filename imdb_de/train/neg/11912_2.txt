The story behind this movie is very interesting, and in general the plot is not so bad ... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, tempo, action sequences, stunts and the use of CG cheapen and destroy the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, action sequences. They are all pretty exciting. Most people get up and get shot and try not to run, fight, dodge or whatever, even if they have all the time in the world. The sequences just look boring after something that was done in 2004. <br /> <br /> The CG features are beautifully rendered and animated, but they look cheap because they are used. <br /> <br /> Pacing: everything goes too fast. For example, "Elle" is trained to fight in a few hours and can setback from the beginning, etc. Why is she so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the movie. As Lilith, she would not have had to do backflips - maybe not because she had wings. <br /> <br /> Also, we have sequences like a woman who gets run over by a car and get up and just wander into an abandoned room with sink and mirror, and then stab herself in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and without the viewers really worrying that they just got off a car (and then felt the secondary effects of another, exploding car) ... "Are you alright?" asks the driver "yes, I'm fine," she says bloodied and disheveled. <br /> <br /> I saw it all because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting ... but in the end, the bad execution made me want everything else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, myself the movie with vampires, in which Jackie Chan was a weird relief, because they managed to expose my unbelief, but that made me wake up the director. Give the writer a good talk.
