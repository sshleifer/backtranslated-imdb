Oh, this movie is bad. It flows terribly. The story is about a racer who is in love with himself and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain. He does not love himself. He tries to get out of the contract, followed by terrible, painless gag. Jim Nabors seems to be sleepwalking and not acting. You'll miss such Burt buddies as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stinker. Loni Anderson's hair is downright spooky, which proves that in the sixties, not a lot of hair spray has gone out. Or maybe that was a wig. By the way, Burts wig was not bad in this movie. His worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and the Bandit 2". Anyway, this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie ever with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper", which fortunately had no sequel) are great, funny movies. This is not. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, stinks. They long for a rogue of the kind Jackie Gleason, who has fun at hating. And mind you, this is not one of those funny movies you can take with you. It is bad, pure and easy. Even the outtakes at the end were boring and boring and worst of all. And I do not forget that "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails, the Burt's coffin before his somewhat busy years in "Boogie Nights" sealed just fine, if he has a good platform for it.
