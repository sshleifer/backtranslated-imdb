Sorry, not good. <br /> <br /> It starts off interesting, but it loses a few minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> It does not help much that none of the normally great actors (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) delivers a really good performance. <br /> <br /> It might be due to the fact that I saw a dubbed version (German), but the character of Dennis Quaid was especially wooden and annoying, and Danny Glover does not really make a believable villain. In addition, the character of Jared Leto does not really add to the story (other than saving a main character at a certain point, but this scene is just as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine ;-) <br / Speaking of unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is really the complicated and clichÃ©d story: The detective (of course!) Must settle a personal matter with the villain and is (of course!) suspended from his official duties of his personal involvement. The killer (of course!) * Wants * to be tracked down and play a cat-and-mouse game with his opponent for years ... I do not know how many movies build on a similar plot - most of them are better , <br /> <br /> The plot has many holes and many totally incredible and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the plot (for example, the truck stop scene or the car at the edge of the cliff, etc.). ). <br /> <br /> To top it off, the end tries to be original and exciting, but fails completely in this regard. We've seen * much * better finals with a similar kind of ultimate fight-on-a-train-in-a-lost-winter landscape ... In the end, there's the supposedly moving union of parent and child. at least not.
