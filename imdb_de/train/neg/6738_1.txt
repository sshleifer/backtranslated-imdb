There were so many films on the same topic. A sweet girl needs a handsome boy to impress ex, pays him and then (you know what?), She falls in love with him, there's a bit of fumbling, followed by a row, before everyone's found before the happy ending already done many times. <br /> <br /> The thing is, I knew that before I started to watch. Nevertheless, I was looking forward to it anyway. In the right hands, with a good cast and a bright script, it can still be a pleasant way to spend a few hours. <br /> <br /> This was not one of them. <br /> <br /> was bleak. <br /> <br /> A female lead that lacked neither charm nor wit and that did not trigger even the slightest spark in me. I really did not care if she got her husband or was left alone and unhappy. <br /> <br /> A male leader I wanted to kill after a few of his endless words of wisdom. Just to remove that smug look. I had no idea that the life of a male whore was the path to all-seeing omniscient enlightenment. <br /> <br /> A completely unrealistic movie full of unrealistic characters. Neither of them seemed to have a job, everyone had more money than meaning, a groom who continues his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend. Besides, I would miss you even if we had never met "!!!!!" I could go on, but I just realized that I waste even more time with this slag ... I could chatter about introducing a character, only to have a cheap laugh about the name "Woody," but in truth, that was just the slightly humorous thing that happened in the movie.
