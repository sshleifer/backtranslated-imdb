If you want to see a movie about two totally unsympathetic characters, this is one. The show is great, both by John Cassavetes and the insane paranoid, which, as the saying goes, REALLY IS, and by Peter Falk as his lifelong best friend to save himself. A big mistake, but since they are both amoral gangsters and misogynistic bastards, it's hard to decide who to use for LESS. Only the author / director Elaine May could have got through this with. I found it interesting that in a detailed interview with producer Michael Hausman, which was included on the DVD, he revealed that the two stars had "very different ideas" about the script that the director almost could not work with The director was concerned with photography making impossible demands on him that the crew was constantly angry because they had to wait and so on. This mood of a large, very dysfunctional family is clearly expressed on screen.
