I knew it would be, but I gave him a rent for some laughs and maybe some pointless fun. Anyone who has read some of my reviews can see that I am pretty easy. I really did not think that I would feel that negative. <br /> <br /> The plot is about an ancient army of dragons headed by a giant snake that will destroy the world unless some heroes are chosen who inherit the responsibility ?? become one with ?? a good dragon? or so?? I dont know. It was so stupid, I did not bother to keep it. <br /> <br /> It contains a really stupid story full of ridiculous moments and silly concepts. So many of the events just felt random and sudden. <br /> <br /> I think there were studio glitches or something, because the biggest problem I have with the movie is the fact that the story seems like it's going to be terrific and epic, but everything goes so fast and goes by so fast. I feel like I've just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in a big ball. The film is like a slap in the face. It does not take much time to establish characters or dramas. Imagine the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy in 90 minutes? They could have the most epic battle sequences, but there would be absolutely no accumulation and you would hardly care about the outcome of those battles. That was the case with Dragon Wars? 90 minutes in which I did not give a damn and waited for it to be over. <br /> <br /> A fantastic CGI with neat direction, but awful actors, fast paced and stupid story made it hard to enjoy for some reason. I probably loved it when I was 6.
