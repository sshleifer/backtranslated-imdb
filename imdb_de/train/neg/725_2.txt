That was a horrible movie! Not for the item, but for the delivery. I was with my girlfriend at the time (when the movie came out), expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw was two hours of brutal police pressure, and in the end there was no uplift. In the previews and ads this was NOT mentioned! And for all that they have played, my memory is that they will be arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews say nothing! (Not that you would expect that, but it's just the problem). If I had known how depressing this movie would be, I would never have seen it. Or at least I would have been prepared for it. This was a bait and switch campaign, and I will NEVER see this movie again!
