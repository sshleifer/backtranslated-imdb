Camp Blood III is a big improvement on Camp Blood II, as it usually sounds in the right places and shows a rudimentary conspiracy. This time around, they ventured a little further from the parking lot, the other two movies were filmed, which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past a remote wilderness. <br /> <br /> This time, there's a reality TV show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants. This is not a new idea, I have seen at least three more horror movies that have the exact same premise in which the real killer appears, but this one has at least a plot instead of just killing people by accident with a knife. <Br /> <br /> In contrast to the other two series in the series, this is at least for a few laughs. I liked that there's a shot effect when someone gets stabbed early and the way the boom microphone hovers behind people like a phantom. I do not know why anyone wants to do a third Camp Blood movie I thought it would be better to start over, but at least they tried. The half-naked, deformed woman was a little too much for me, it looks like they were trying to maintain continuity by hiring a freak who takes off her clothes for $ 5, just like in the second movie. They still have not figured out that a machete is used for cutting and does not sting, but well, it's a Camp Blood movie. What do you expect? If you like crap films, you will have fun with this movie.
