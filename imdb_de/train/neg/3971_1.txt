Give me my money back! Give me my life back! Give me a bit of credit. This movie was worthy. Useless and time consuming. What a waste of energy and completely pointless. Okay, I understand the premise and the sound of the idea, but give us a break! Next time give me the money and let me spend it. Lost child, mothers regret, husband blamed! Clich√© yes ~! Do not you have anything else to do! Sorry, but this movie was a total waste of my time, my money and my being. I would rather cook eggs! No real explanation why this happened. Jail? Why? Loss? obviously but why? Acting deserves a What do I do here Oscar and the camera a Do I do it only for a reward? How much did this movie do? That stupid fool has hired a copy. Enough said
