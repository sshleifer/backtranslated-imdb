This movie is being shown on the cable again and again lately, so ... <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for these two attractive women, either about Luke Wilson or about the equally vapid 'villian' in this one To argue film. The actresses are very cute and that is the only reason to watch this movie. I suppose it's "funny" that Lukes is even uglier / dorkier / stupid friend nearby, but that's what we get men in this movie for over 5 minutes. What we get is that they sob and cry and fight and so on, as about 2 guys that were best described on Friday the 13th. 4. Dead * @ $ #
