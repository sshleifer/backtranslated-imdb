I was not quite sure what to expect from a comedy, drama, fantasy, sci-fi genre, but considering the actors involved, I thought I'd give it a try. The sound of the film felt awkward, experiencing patches in each of the genres, but never feeling fairly balanced, so I finally gave it up and focused on the cinematography and individual performances I had in total considered good, given the individual characters had little depth because of the nature of the story (does not reveal anything here). I have to say it felt much longer than its 96-minute runtime and not in a good way. In the end, I was looking for closure, a degree of satisfaction, but it did not turn out to be a clever or ingenious piece that I had hoped for. I think Tony falsely thought about what he did at the end of the movie. That did us ... but it was a tragic mistake to confirm the last 95 minutes with the ill-conceived conclusion. Ultimately, I feel betrayed. IMO it would have been better to leave it without the "end" as a feat ... just. Or ... I may have missed the point completely :)
