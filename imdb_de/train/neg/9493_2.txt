This ridiculous film offers the "hippie mentality" of the 70s in a nutshell and bores us. It is an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with sex rites and washing-up from old age. A naive young hippie, played by the waif-like (Kay Lenz) followers, wanders and sleeps with all the wrong types, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (Holden), who was drunk hard as an old man and drunk as an actor and she decides that she "loves" him. If you think this is superficial, the entire film encapsulates such scenes. She always says how much she "loves" him and she only met him, he is thin and very fast. I could only laugh the whole movie. It's obvious she uses it only as a food menu, but the director is still immature enough to believe we're buying that love is actually taking place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and have sex. I had to rewind it because it almost inspired me to vomit. A crazy music offer from the 70s is also spread through the film. Avoid this if you can. Grade D.
