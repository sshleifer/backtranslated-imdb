"Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is a very weak movie. Mira Sorvino plays a detective trying to find a killer who shoots at arrows. Mira has an Italian accent that falters from time to time. Could not she just speak English? All other characters have a Mexican / English accent that distracts. The dialogue is very bad and the delivery is made of wood. The cinematography looks good, but that's not enough to save this trip. THIS NEXT PART OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> During the climax, the villain looks like he'll go away, but then he comes down the stairs again to be shot and down a cool stunt down the railing. This just shows that this script has no originality. AVOID!
