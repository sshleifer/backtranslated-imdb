I remember seeing "Lost Missile" (actually, I had a seizure, until my brother and several cousins, with whom I was staying as an overnight guest, agreed to look at it together - I was occasionally the Eric Cartman of 1960s - sorry, and it was a bit embarrassing when the lingering wave of millions of degrees of heat turned up as a plotter - even as a second grader, I knew a rocket could no longer spin the energy for so much heat or destruction duration and limited radius of a nuclear Detonation. <br /> <br /> I inflicted this turkey on loving relatives, it was a crime that punishes itself. <br /> <br /> The production value of the film was very good. Acting is not bad. apart from the actor's shatnerism, mentioned by another governor), but the idea of ​​a rocket that easily mimics the surface of the earth with the help of easy-baking Heat the heat of his exhaust ... no. <br /> <br /> How would the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 ever miss The Lost Missile? <br /> <br /> It's a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch if you want to drink some beer to spend a weekend.
