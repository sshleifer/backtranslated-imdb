I was lured by his starpower to see this movie, but after all, that's all he delivers. It is much more a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about corruption in big cities. His biggest mistake is the predictability and the total lack of tension. We know who the bad guys are from the beginning and just follow them as they fall like dominoes. The film in his favor renounces non-violent violence and sex, but has forgotten to replace good, clean romance or excitement in other ways. All the flavor of a good, flat, decaffeinated Diet Coke. "Q & A", which also takes place in New York, is a much better alternative than "LA Confidential".
