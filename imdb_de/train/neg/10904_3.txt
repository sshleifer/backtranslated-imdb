I turned on this movie and expected a few laughs, hopefully enough to amuse myself, but I was very wrong. This film showed very minimal moments of humor and the pitiful jokes made me shout for shaming the madness ... The film targets an age group of 10-15 years and will certainly make the audience feel dissatisfied outside of these borders. Not more than 3 votes, very unwelcome for those who do not want to waste 2 hours of their lives.
