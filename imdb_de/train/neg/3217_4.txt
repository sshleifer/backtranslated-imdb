A missed train. An incorrect phone number An extra cup of coffee. What happens to your fellow human beings when you make a seemingly harmless decision? Most people do not think about it while immersing themselves in their own thoughts and actions. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" tells the story of the connections and cause and effect of the everyday, as it belongs to a universe group of normal Parisian folklore. It has all the ingredients of what is true of contemporary theater, with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned. There's a deceitful husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic slacker, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother. an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate and a homeless person. Audrey Tautou acts as a former protagonist (in the sense that she, like everyone else, is in front of the camera opening and closing the film) and a normal girl who just does not seem to find the right rhythm in her life. <br /> <She learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on the train, what her horoscope holds for her. What happens to her during the day is told through different characters. Does the prediction come true? The concept is good, but storytelling is weak. The connections from one event to the next are weak. In 15 seconds, there's a better storytelling of Liberty Mutual insurance advertising, where one person sees one good deed and passes it on to another, rather than in two hours of Happenstance. If you like Audrey Tautou, then of course you can sacrifice the time for this movie, but you'll end the movie dissatisfied and wonder what that plot could be if it were edited by a better producer and director.
