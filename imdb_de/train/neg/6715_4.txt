I entered the theater to spend a pleasant 90 minutes if I was not enlightened. I did not go entertaining or enlightened. This film can not decide what it wants to be, and in the end, is not much of anything. There are a couple of funny lines and a few unbelievably demanding movie references (The 400 Blows - for this character, come out!). While none of the characters are treated with much respect, the over thirty gay men get the worst: all predatory, fat, sad sluts. If you're in the mood for a movie that deals with gay relationships, check out Parting Glances, Long-time Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. You will thank me. <br /> <br />
