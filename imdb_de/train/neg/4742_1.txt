Impressive. This was probably the worst DCOM ever. I saw the first half hour and laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, the beloved girl with the hot jock friend, and has friends who are determined to be Homecoming Queen. She is supposed to save the world as a warrior, and Shin helps her with her martial arts. Shin teaches her the skills of a snake, a tiger, etc., and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for kids who want to engage in martial arts and Chinese culture But acting and casting were horrible. <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comedian, and I can not see her playing a serious role. It was funny laughing to watch her cry over Shin. Shin could not act at all and everything was absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and tried to imagine something similar, and I came up with the Power Rangers. This movie is so fake and the stunts were so Power Rangers that it was just dumb and stupid. The characters were not sympathetic and I just could not bear to see it. Disney really needs time to make decent movies. High School Musical is the only movie that deserves to be on the Disney Channel, along with other such films as Jumping Ship, Color of Friendship, Go Figure, Read It, and Weep & Stuck in the suburbs. <br /> <br /> If you like action adventure and stupid jokes, you'll like this movie.
