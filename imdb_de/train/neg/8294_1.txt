There may be something poetically right when dentists suffer. In this dark, really horrible movie they do, but they also cause non-dental pain. If you've ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids, kids with scraps of flax, sick kids, lots of long, long, meaningful looks, a dead woman, and a worried husband, everything is there for you. Boring, extravagant, it's one of the screaming examples: why? Is there a saving grace? Yes there is. There is a short scene from Nabucco, with pretty good vocals. Save your money or save time when on TV or on cable. You can always read a book or make an omelette.
