It is absolutely incredible to me that anyone could say that this movie is not preaching. It is not only oppressively preaching, but also absurd, staged, dramatically straight jackets and painfully overworked. When you see it, you feel like an 8 - year - old child being punished by having to write 100 times on the blackboard: "I will not become a fascist". <br /> <br /> Now I understand that it was made at the height of World War II was a courageous condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he (which would wholeheartedly applaud everyone), and me I am sure that he has captured the mood of the day exactly. But it is portrayed in such an immature, over-obvious way as the sledgehammer and fails as a work of art. Only Paul Lukas, who is sincere and intense, performs well as a calmly heroic anti-fascist; and Lucile Watson as an amusing, disgruntled rich grandmother, who slowly realizes how dangerous the world has become. Although their rootless education has put them through all sorts of hardships, the children are ridiculously portrayed as robotically restrained little snippets. They do not even resemble real people. And Bette Davis, a great actress, is so dimensionally noble that I flinch every time she's seen on screen. Her every word, every gesture is meant to show how SUPPORTIVE and UNDERSTANDING she is from the SACRIFICES her husband has to deal with and the great cause he struggles for and that she must have been addressed for a painful electric shock when she dares allow any hint of doubt or shading in her presentation. <br /> <br /> Well, this is a very IMPORTANT movie, just not a very good one.
