Chris Kattan is a great skit performer on Saturday Night Live ... but he probably should not leave the film industry alone unless he gets creative control. He plays an annoying, upbeat character that basically delays slightly and acts on tempo. Do you want to know the only funny parts? The stuff they showed in the previews. Yes, his rendering of me is funny. Nothing else is. Especially if you can say that he is trying hard to be a physical comedian he should not try because he is one. And yet his bit of how he has demolished the veterinarian's office, crawling bad. This movie made me lose an eye. Avoid it at all costs and watch SNL.
