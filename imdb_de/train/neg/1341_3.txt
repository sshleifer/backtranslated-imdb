Following the success of the (dreadful) Gilligan's Island TV movie re-runs, a series of television films were shot in the 1980s uniting Casts' classic shows. Most of these films have missed the boat completely, so they have regained the humor that made the shows so special. THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing as it is a Laurel and Hardy-style comedy style that was not really included in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedian and indispensable to the show, is utterly wasted - she has less time in this 90-minute film than in any 30-minute episode. And since the roles of "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this film are nothing but cameos, what was the point of making them younger and redesigning them? With a few paraphrases, they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although it was a nice sight to see some of the munsters' confused relatives, I did not enjoy Sid Caesar as a hammering mad scientist, mainly because he had too much of him and not enough of the underexposed Munsters (ironically, this year, 1981, Caesar's old partner ) Inogene Coca was also played in the comedy in a major TV reunion (RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange inexplicable piece at the beginning of the film, the Munster family has depicted as wax figures in a local horror wax museum. Why should they be there if they are a "typical" (albeit foreign) American family, not famous monsters? This was the last Munsters project to feature the original cast in their roles. In the late 1980s, there was a terrific revival of the series with a whole new cast and a television movie from the 1990s, in which DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick in cameo roles with a family eating.
