... that the lieutenant has chosen this one. First, the movie was not terrible, it was just Hollywood. The worst case where I feel the need to happen or we do not have to make a film: If Willis' mission was to save the doctor, but she was adamant that her "people" make it out of the missionary, he would have put her on this first helicopter and brought these refugees to the border without them. He would not have compromised his package for the refugees. That's not how it works. But like I said, that's Hollywood, we have to have drama. That's why we make films because the reality is not that complicated. However, I thought that Willis and the good doctor had practicable chemistry. That said, there are also some successful fight scenes in the film. It's not a waste of time, "Tears of the Sun" is worth the DVD rent. Check it on a rainy day and you will be satisfied.
