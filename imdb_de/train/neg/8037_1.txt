OK, a Slasher movie. a very, very silly Slasher movie. <br /> <br /> We've got your stereotyped teenagers up and running in a home affair. We have an FBI agent who once saw Dirty Harry too many. "So, what's the secret ... punks?" We have about 4 different small camera shots and scenes that make no sense at all. "Hey man, I fix the sprinklers" ((this guy was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly, a preacher is tied up on a couch and watches home movies on the killer's outing into the middle of nowhere without policemen. Suddenly she is in a church wearing a wedding dress. I swear, this is the dumbest Slasher movie I've ever seen.
