I spent nearly two hours watching a movie that I thought would be worth watching by any good actor. I could not believe it when the movie ended and I had no idea what had happened ... I was crazy because I could use the time to do something else ... I tried to find out everything but had really no idea. Thanks to everyone who found out and explained it ... right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything !! Who was the woman in the dark-haired movie we saw driving away a few times? How did First Lady know that her husband cheated on her? At the end of the film, Kate said she would find out the truth. Does that mean we're exposed to End Game 2?
