First of all, I agree that Mr. Chomsky's mouth escapes. His factual transmission of an interesting counterpoint makes the man a hit on the campus of the university. He is sympathetic, modest and pragmatic. He is not focused on the current political style (obnoxious bipartisan party), and he has both the left and right extremities in mind and chastises both, and for good reason. the film itself is a guy. In fact, I would not call it a documentary, just a collection of speeches. The reputation of "rebel without a break" does not differ from watching a speaker in a 3-track segment on CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no edits, no stylistic touches. There is no story, no narrative. <br /> <br /> Technically, the production is strictly amateurish. Audio is terrible and inconsistent. Sometimes we hear Noam not talking, sometimes we can not hear the questions asked by those present. When Noam rarely speaks, we can see the audience's reactions, unless we get a short shot of his wife, who seems to be proudly attending each of his speeches and rays every time we see them. "I can not recommend this film and would say that it's probably better to listen to his spoken words on tape or CD to hear him in the car I'm in a generous mood today.
