If you have seen very few films, this could be a great one for you. If you've seen a lot of movies, that's a joke. The spectacle of real heroes is portrayed very poorly. Not to mention, there are songs, there are many flashbacks and most of all the fight scenes are stupid. New characters, good direction, would have done a better job, but since they contain all the Bollywood heroes / heroines, you can predict what's going to happen next. They are not sad when something happens, the emotions they radiate are terrible, especially because we saw this actor in 1000 other Hindi films. It is believed to be a realistic film, but it is not shown. There are times when you wonder, thousands of soldiers are full of soldiers who are moving, and the Pakistanis bombard them, and none of their bombs hit them. Are the Pakis really bad at aiming or did the director stupid them? There were only a few characters who behaved very well, but as far as action is concerned, it is poorly judged. This movie could have been short if he had taken out songs and flashbacks.
