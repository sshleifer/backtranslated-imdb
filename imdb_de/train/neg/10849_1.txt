Usually I go to the B horror movies when I get into the Hollywood video. For me, the basic principles behind a B-horror movie are the stock value, heavy gore, lots of unnecessary nudity and special effects that everyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex. I hired Cradle of Fear strictly because I've been a fan of the band since the release of the first demo in 1995. The film started with an interesting note and when I saw Dani Filth pounding on an extremely obvious latex mask LAY DOWN When I saw the lesbian sex scene because of a lesbian sex scene, I even laughed harder. I laughed so hard at the whole movie, and when I did not laugh, I shook my head and thought about how a multi-million dollar rock star wanted to make a movie that looked like it had a budget of several one hundred dollars. The whole point of this movie seemed to me to be attracted to the "hardcore goth kids who think that death, destruction, sex, blood and satan are the biggest things invented since Lava Lamps, that's really it." like 80.5% Of the things that happened in this movie, it just happened to be satanic.This movie had a lot of potential and could have really been a really good movie, but in the end this "movie" is just an extended cradle of filth video.
