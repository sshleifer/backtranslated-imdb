This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, everything is weak and incoherent. The spectacle is absurd, the costumes even more crumbling and the story does not exist. This sword and adventure movie titled "Poverty Series" was designed to capture the success of "Beastmaster" and "Conan," but there is no reason to follow it. The main character is lukewarm and boring, he can not even fight with a sword and the sword dates from the 16th century. All the action sequences are so slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the terribly outdated music they play when riding a horse. Do not even bother with this crap.
