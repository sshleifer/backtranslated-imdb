Must agree with the other reviewer. This must be the worst movie, not to mention Western, I have ever seen. Terrible spectacle, a dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic (not to mention the presumption that it was probably in the 19th century), and oh, did I mention a rechargeable battery prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters? I waited for the boom microphone to fall into the middle of a scene. And the end? The least I can say is that it matches the rest of the movie ... totally awful. And yes, it contained every cliche in the book from the slow walk on the empty dusty road down to the ridiculous "Remember us if" shots when a main character dies. Luckily I saw that on free TV. Do not waste your time.
