Poor Paul Mercurio. After landing the role of Scott Hastings in Strictly Ballroom, the best movie in history, he managed to find plenty of garbage. None of the characters in this movie is very unlikely or even hateful, but the track of Mercurio is the kind of person you'd rather ignore. A big mistake in costume design.
