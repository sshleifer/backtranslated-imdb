In this paranoia-driven potboiler, our reporter hero battles authorities, double staff, renegade UFO debunkers, and silent, creeping aliens. (Although it is possible to control objects and zap objects remotely, three of them are required to operate a control panel with about two dozen buttons.) The script runs from event to event, leaving the enigmatic players in hull and box Fill back. Why did the aliens blind the dog? Why do they roast the soldiers with radiation if they only patrol an empty landing pad? And which world people who are worth their moon cheese, kidnap the ugly photographer first instead of his model? Questioning heads want to know! Writer and director Mario Gariazzo apparently researched his subject by skimming over a pile of UFO-themed tabloids while engaging in a Sunn Classics double-screen movie. (The final screen verification proves that it's based on actual events ... like "Plan 9!"). Some feel burned by the abrupt finale, but should still be interested in conspiracy.
