That's right, you heard me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I own 10 of his books and have read the entire series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the screenwriter should be turned. <br /> <br /> What right did a filmmaker have to slaughter a terrific fiction book and make a mockery of the mystery out of it? If I had ever thought that Harry Potter was slaughtered, then Michael O'Hara proved me wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next screenwriter who deals with this fabulous book will bring much more justice. To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: Do not finish your day job.
