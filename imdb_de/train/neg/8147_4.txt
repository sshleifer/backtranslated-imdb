This movie was a confusing piece of garbage. You never knew what was going on. The characters were poorly written and were except for Gus (masterfully played by George Eads) completely unsympathetic. I hate this movie, but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) he should have received an Oscar. It was especially sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a shameful and cheesy movie. Lifetime They have sunk to a new low. Someone has to make sure this director never works in movies again. It should also be a horror movie because it was a lot funnier than scary. For the shame, for the shame.
