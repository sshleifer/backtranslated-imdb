I saw this movie just 15 minutes ago and still have no idea what I just saw. I think it's mainly a movie about an internet S & M star of CD-ROMs as realistic as flash cartoons on the internet. She was murdered by someone, causing her sister and a team of two FBI agents to investigate death. The local murder department of Big City, USA, has also made inquiries, although most of its work is to erase the CD-ROMs that they claim are "just as realistic" as the "real" ones. I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only one in the film who has any credits behind him. He's in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of it beats the head girl for no apparent reason. I will not even explain the end, because I honestly can not make it myself. Before the final scene, however, we have a 3- or 4-minute montage of everything in the movie. Honestly, they would then have run the last scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross direction and everything. <br /> <br /> All in all, stay away from this movie. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I could really have used the 80 minutes for something else and was happier. Play this game with a knife that pokes repeatedly at your hand. That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining.
