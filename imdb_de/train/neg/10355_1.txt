I loved this book since my 5th grade read it to our class many years ago. And I have read it as a teacher in every 3rd and 5th grade in my last 18 years. Allegedly a movie was made in the past, but I could never find it. Well, my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engles outstanding book to the screen. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie, I had the highest hopes. In the course of the film, I became increasingly discouraged. They had messed up a lot! Never before had I been so disappointed with a favorite book-to-film adaptation. I understand that films can not strictly stick to a book, but they do not have to change anything for the sake of it! Most, if not all, deviations from the book were completely unnecessary! <br /> <br /> I initially kept my opinion to myself and only listened to my students discussing the film. Well, it was not just me. Almost every one felt the same way - cheated out of the great story Madeline L'Engle had skilfully created! <br /> <br /> Why, she wondered, did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the Star Wars movie? Why was Calvin's hair not red? Why did not Mrs. Wright have the right "witch-like" outfit that was such a smart game with her name? Basically, we all wondered - why did almost every detail have to be changed? <br /> <br /> I've always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would be. I'm still waiting for this movie. This was just a crease in time, only with the widest senses. I will write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take over the task!
