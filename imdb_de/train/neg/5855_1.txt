The film, which was released in early 2000 with MELA and both catastrophes, is so sad that it begins with such nonsense a millennium. <br /> <br /> The film seems to fit for the 70s, but seems to be an unwanted comedy for 2000. > Anywayz some classic gems from the movie: Paresh Rawal I do not understand how to laugh about his role or his scream. Reason: He is looking for his mother in the village. The worst part is when he realizes a secret of Anil that he keeps in his belly that gets big and makes him look pregnant. I remember in my childhood that my teacher told me the same joke, Urrf !!!! I laughed as a kid then, but here? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a joke, can not explain. We have Anil in a dual role (one older and younger) and Rekha plays the older woman and Raveena the Younger We also rejected Harish while Shakti plays the son of Aruna Irani who both fight who has the worst wig. <br /> <br /> The direction is outdated. Music is bad. Anil tries it looks very younger in the younger role and looks too young in the older role, but good effort Rekha is sufficient, Raveena is okay too Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is like Rajnikant is okay in a cameo
