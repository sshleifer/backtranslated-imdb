As I said, the visual effects are stunning. They are breathtaking. Personally, I use Blender and such graphics are not easy at all. But that's all in this movie. The plot is not only confusing, but the general conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo try to escape, who knows what. The conflict here seems to be between man and nature. Later, as they enter the room of the bottomless pit, Proog explains that "one step outside the place and (they are dead)" are. Here there is a closer conflict between the negligent person and nature. As the film progresses, it is clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly there is a conflict between man and man, as Proog Emo kills out of nowhere in the world. Proog immediately switches from a caring guardian who looks after a lost child to a "sick man." He tells us. This is not only depressing, it does not matter to us because the conflict between the thoughts and actions of the character is not developed. It's not a story about someone getting stronger through a fight. It is depressing and has no meaning, because there is no great truth about the human soul or about the world that is brought to light like a great drama. In my opinion, the movie is underdeveloped in every way. The graphics are stunning, but a movie is so much more than a feast for the eyes. There is no truth, no fight and a nasty surprise ending. Finally, an underdeveloped film without meaning. ... but the graphics are good.
