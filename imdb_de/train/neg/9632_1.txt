I have a terrible pan & scan videotape of "Boom!", And I want to see it in all its widescreen splendor. So I chose "1" and I hope you will. Together, we can pull this movie into the depths of film slags and hope someone sees the chance for BIG MONEY, "Boom!" To publish. in his Director's Cut Extended Version. The movie is one of my howling darlings. You just look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the cameraman, and you say to yourself, "Yeah, I think you can fool some of the people for a long time." Producers who released the DVD from "boom!" Consider It should be noted that everywhere, where it was shown, in the cinemas sold out crowds took place. But it was not Frostbite Falls yet.
