I was in school with Jeremy Earl, so I heard about this movie. I do not know if it was in the theater at all. I can not remember the name. I saw it, it's like one of those specials after school. Acting is OK, not great. The plot was pretty weak and the lines were pretty hackneyed. The only comment I can give on this film is "Eh". I borrowed the movie from Jeremy. If I was in a movie rental company, I would pass by and after seeing him I would not recommend it to anyone middle school age I've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed, the slang is overused or simply obsolete. I often think that makes their characters incredible.
