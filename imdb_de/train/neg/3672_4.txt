I watched the entire movie and accepted the participation of William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I am glad that I had no idea of ​​the presence of Peter Weller. At the end of the movie, I said, "That was Peter Weller?" Kudos to Mr. Weller for an outstanding performance. Weller played a main character, and his performance was such that I did not even recognize him. All in all, the plot was bad, the writing was bad and the services, apart from those of Nosbusch and Weller were subpar. The scenery and surroundings were interesting and Weller was fantastic. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, out of a possible 10.
