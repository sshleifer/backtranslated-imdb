You can not overreact, knowing that it was made in four days, and I expected it to be campy anyway. (In reality, not all of this is so effortless, with the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not take themselves seriously, the rest of the cast plays halfway; Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The ridiculous story is actually paying attention, which somehow shocked me; I figured that the purpose of these ultra-low-budget horror films was to satisfy the simplest sexual fantasies and not be a pity on the story, but they use many words like "technological" and "corporeality" in the script to them to get her point over. (Although it's possible that the story is only important to explain why there are so few performers.) This stupid act is of no interest to anybody, and the only interesting thing in this movie is the mocking of cults and the softcore Homerotic (which are not all that nervous). I would have enjoyed it more if there had been random murders for no reason. The film is grainy, looks in TV quality and acts on one level. There are some "sexy" scenes that are alright - the boys squirming in bed in their boxers and straighten up; or be tied up and make orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them - and some of them are kind of weird. And I liked the excavations of L. Ron Hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones, but it's still not good. 3.10
