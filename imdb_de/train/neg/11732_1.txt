The IMDb guidelines state that you must declare if your comments contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well, this whole movie is something of a spoiler ... a warning story that glorifies what it warns of, a story of lost youth that does not know where to go. <br /> <br /> I just saw it at the tribeca film festival. Not only was this movie bad, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is inconsistent, the characters are the most cliched offer with little depth, and Farnsworth's acting was particularly bad. <br /> <br /> From the patronizing accents to the pointless plot line to the no longer existing "graphic" elements to repetitive dialogues and scenarios ... that sucked on the big one. <br /> <br /> I think he was looking for a kind of edgy, updated "drugstore cowboy" with a touch of "natural born killers", but it's not as sensitive to the characters as the previous ones and not where shocking (outside a frat-level gore) like the ladder. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, someone really had to A) edit the script <br /> <br /> (there are some things that build on it and clearly <br /> <br /> deals with one dignified theme ... if it is tried with the ham.) B) edit the movie. If it has been reduced to a core, it could be passable. <br /> <br /> I would go less than 1 if I could ... like maybe zero Kelvin.
