While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a movie called "The Making of 10 Items or Less": <br /> <br /> Producer: I have good and bad news. The good news is, we can get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Writer: That's great! But what are the bad news? <br /> <br /> Producer: We can only afford to hire him for a day. I think we have to get someone else. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we hire him for a day. A movie is one and a half hours long. One working day is eight hours long. I see no problem. <br /> <br /> Producer: But ... it will take time to get into the role of the character. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we have a character who plays him is essentially himself. <br /> <br /> Producer: But he still has to understand his motivation and all that. They do not say we play a big actor doing a low budget movie, right? <br /> <br /> Writer: Why not? <br /> Producer: That's ridiculous! But well, at least we have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I think we have to shoot the movie in Los Angeles too. <br /> <br /> Writer: Of course. <br /> <br /> Producer: This script is a lot of crap. We make better money with it. Just in case Morgan Freeman's character has "Wal-Mart" or "Target" or one of those stores installed, so at least someone wants to sell the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Writer: Sure thing! <br /> <br Producer: Wait a second ... what about a tiny bodega with an express track of "ten items or less"? <br /> <br /> Writer: Oh, I think that's pretty funny. But we can not change the title now! <br /> <br /> I doubt that my script is very similar to reality, but not "10 items or less". This is a case of good acting, but bad writing, and I hate to see it happen. If you are watching an independent movie, you expect it to try to convey some kind of message. I think they might have tried for the tired old "no-holds-up" message that was killed in much better movies. Anyway, with "10 Items or Less," the only message I received was, "Look, look at Morgan Freeman!"
