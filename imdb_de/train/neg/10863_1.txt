LOCATION RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing movie. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good, but this part really makes you bored and disappoints you .......................... ............ <br /> <br /> This movie really wastes time and money. I went to this movie with my boyfriend on the first day of his release and both get bored in the cinema .......................... .... ........................ <br /> <br /> The role of CIRCUIT in this film was very small and useless. I think SANJAY-DUTT has reduced the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> Character of the movie is too not well defined as in the previous one. This film shows u the result of OVER-CONFIDENCE ......... <br /> <br /> The ideas of MAHATMA are also undefined and confusing .... ......... .... <br /> <br /> A really big disappointment
