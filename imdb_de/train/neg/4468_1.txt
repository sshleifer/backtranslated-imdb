OK, plain and simple, if you're a fan of the other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD). KEEP AWAY FROM THE LEGEND. <br /> <br /> It is without a doubt the most disappointing TR game ever. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is completely unplayable and I gave it up. I have the feeling I was robbed by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It is very simple. Above all, TR was a PC game. You steer Lara over the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games the controls were standard. In AOD they were "sticky" but still the same general control sequences. In Legend they have completely changed their movement and control methods and they are completely uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> In other places, I have seen comments from people who say "use mouse". No, why should I? Others say "Use a gamepad". No, why should I? Others say, "However, this has been the standard for third-party control for years." Well, I do not care, it's not the standard for any other TR game. Oh, I know, because they do not care about their original, loyal fan base, they want to earn money with the new kids who have not even heard of the show, and make a lot more money. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> My advice to a serious TR fan is that you stay away from this game, and when you buy it, complain to Eidos. I have seen masses of other contributions, mainly in the Eidos forums, from people who told them how garbage they are, maybe they are listening.
