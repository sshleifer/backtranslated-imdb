We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He did the unthinkable. He could be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on IMDb! He is like a kind of cockroach. No matter how little talent he has and how bad these films are, he manages to make them over and over again. I know he's financing them all through a bizarre German fund, but still, his ability to continue filming in spite of absolute, total failure is one of the great secrets of the universe. <br /> <br /> would not be so bad, except that video game developers give this guy her best features. I really enjoyed the series Alone in the Dark. Even the newest, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of play. It was a good movie from Edward Carnby's adventures, but it's not. Now Uwe Boll got Bloodrayne and Hunter in their hands: The Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Downfall? I can only imagine that the guy will break the game-to-film adjustments if he is not stopped. Someone needs to take their credit line away, or these video game publishers need to be aware that if they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise, nobody is interested in that title anymore. <BR /> <br /> Are you thinking, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title? Under no circumstance. A new House of the Dead game comes out for X-Box and nobody cares. The title is dead and everything because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you work for a game publisher, know a publisher, or have access to a publisher, please warn him. <br /> <br /> This movie itself is not even worth a review. I can not separate what I do not like about this bastard from the rest of it. Literally everything is annoying. Writing, acting, music, CG effects, editing. I thought if I waited for it to come out on DVD and rent it with low expectations, I would not be disappointed. Boy, I was wrong. Never underestimate Uwe's ability to extract a large, steaming pile of BOLL sh * t.
