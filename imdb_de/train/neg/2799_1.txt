Anyone who has written the script for this film does not deserve to work in Hollywood (not even live there), and these actors have to find another job. The most terrible hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just looked to see if it would get better, which unfortunately was not the case for me. <br /> <br /> Even at the end, the credits scared me. I think there were not many people behind the movie, so they had to roll the credits slowly ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a great "How Not To Make a Movie" guide. Too bad that I can not award 0.
