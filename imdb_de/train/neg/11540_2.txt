This reminded me so much of Michael Winner's crappy "Dirty Weekend" with its terrible English low-budget feeling. <br /> <br /> First, I have to say that I am both a fan of exploitation and serious film. I guess we say 'Demented' for his inability and 'Last House on the Left' for his sheer brutality. And a series of imaginative and increasingly brutal Italian spin-offs. <br /> <br /> This was pointless, though. As a UK budget director has said, 'Remake of' I Spit on your Grave ', without the coughing now that Horror is back in fashion with Hostel. <br /> <br /> The whole thing just does not hang together or have a point. What about the daughter of the rapist? Why should the man be an expert on security cameras? Crappy.
