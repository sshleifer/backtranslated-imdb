The good people in Webster's Dictionary define logophobia as "fear of words." Maybe I'm just a logophobic. Because no word combination scares me more than if at the beginning of a movie the credits contain the words "Produced, Written and Directed by:" and the name follows a single person. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but so few all-rounders. Even the most experienced directors like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take such control over their films. But there I was, embedded in my theater, with popcorn in my hand and just about to see the medal flung upon me like a fastball by Nolan Ryan, were the words "Produced, Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland". Whoa! <br /> <br /> As a film fan, I knew Brian Helgeland. As a writer, his film in the last ten years of 1998 would be portrayed as the share price of a dot-com company. There were as many unpleasant plays (Assassins, The Postman, Conspiracy Theory) as critical and award-winning achievements (LA Confidential, Mystic) River). They seemed to take turns? A good one, a bad one. I knew that BloodWork's last film was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood's career. I took a deep breath, hoping for the best. Looking back, I should not have exhaled. <br /> <br /> The Order Stars Heath Ledger (Helgelands A Knights Tale), as Alex Bernier, a priest in a Carolingian order called to Rome, when another priest may be killed as the arch Bishop means "curious". They met with Father Thomas (also of the Order, who was wonderfully played by Mark Addy of Still Positionings) and set about compiling the puzzle left behind after the premature death of the priest. <br /> <br /> Complicated is a subplot involving Mara Sinclair (played by Shannyn Sossamon), who fled an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism. Alex has feelings towards Mara and for some reason that the audience does not know, they travel together to Rome. <br /> <br /> Hardly a good night's sleep is done, and Alex is confronted by William Eden (Benno FÃ¼rmann), who claims to be a centuries-old Sin Eater. A sin-eater, we are told, is the one who eats the sins of a dying man when the church does not, and thus allows entry into heaven. William, as luck would have it, is fed up with the healing and seeks to have Alex take over his role and free him from his worldly duties. Alex hesitates, but after the death of his new love Mara, Alex resorts to the Sin Eater ritual to save her, and the transformation is complete. Alex then looks for answers to his many questions, while Father Thomas reveals the Vatican's conspiracy behind transferring authority to his investigator. <br /> <br /> The Order is not a horrible movie, but it's terribly boring. There were ridiculous special effects and no connection to the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene - the scene in which Alex entered the dying Mara - he is pale and bland and leaves no emotional response to the plight of the couple. Everyone seems so quiet and callous that the flat lines and smelling salts could have been administered to keep me from napping in the middle of the movie. <br/> <br/> Mr. Helgeland I ask you not to try this again. Share your vision with others and let the experienced guide you in ways that are not so narrow-minded and selfish. Until then, there is nothing that shows that you can do more than a bad grade. Two stars. <br /> <br />
