This is an interesting idea that has gone bad. The hidden meanings in art left behind by a serial killer as clues sound fascinating, but the performance in "Anamorphic" is unbearably slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the movie as boring. The death hints are the only interesting part of "Anamorphic". Everything that connects them is boring. Willem Dafoe is a credible investigator, but he has little to do with a script that reaches its limits. Several supportive character actors are wasted, including Peter Stormare as an art expert, James Rebhorn as police chief, Paul Lazar as a medical examiner and, above all, Deborah Harry, who is seen on the back of the DVD case talking few lines through a cracked door. Not recommended. - MERK
