As much as we love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this movie. A publicity stunt about the grubby end of a seemingly once-honored and idealistic career Pacino plays a roll like a premature bed, attacking everyone with a completely false and fickle southern accent. So with so many loose ends and improbabilities, the ghost spools up (and pulls then back). Kim Basinger is here and does not do much. Her scenes with Pacino are shallow and unconvincing. Hard to believe that they meant much to each other. There is no energy there. <br /> <br /> Tea Leone lit the screen. She was electric and her scenes with Pacino were by far the most interesting in the film, but not enough to save Al from embarrassment.
