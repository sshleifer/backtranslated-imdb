In this God-forgiving film, there are three stupid millionaires who collect a lot of people for a deadly game and the winner receives one million dollars. At first, the spectacle is terrible and the movie makes absolutely no sense. It's not scary at all, it's so stupid it made me laugh, so it deserves that 1 star. The movie is not violent at all, but rather dirty and focuses on the women's breasts all the time, and some of the characters are very annoying and whiny. Plus, the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that you just feel like throwing something on the screen. Finally, the end is terrible. I do not want to give it away if you're really funny enough to see this piece of garbage. AVOID ALL COST !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not rated (but should be R) for nudity, obscenity and mild gore.
