I have my appreciation for Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg come true. I saw the whole movie with my family and some friends. I have no idea what the movie was about. After much discussion, we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts. <br /> <br /> It does not hang out very well. It is too choppy and there is little comedy. I'm disappointed. It could have been much better. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting months to watch this movie from liner notes. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money unless you are a complete and just want to see all the films of Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It was a bad way to spend an evening.
