I had never heard of this Adam Sandler movie until I saw it on the wall at Blockbuster. I was a fan of Adam Sandler and rented it. HONESTLY I could only see about 30 minutes. from that. It was terrible. Do whatever is necessary to remove it from the public. I really hope that this movie will soon be OOP, and I hope it stays that way!
