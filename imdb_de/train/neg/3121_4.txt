This movie is low on waste. It has a terrible taste and is pedestrian and unconvincing in writing, though it is supposedly based on real events - which does not add much, but rather seems disappointing. The direction is not good, because scenes and dialogue are not correct. Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. At first, Williams does not convince as a gay man in a relationship break, nor is the relationship itself interesting. What's worse, his character is forced through an ugly pedophile story that is simple and has no room for action. They have an older Rory Culkin, who spits tastelessly "d_ck_smker" - which is fun - which is annoying enough and then laughed at by the Williams character. Finally, you have Sandra Oh as a guardian angel advisor to Williams and one to expose the whole fiasco towards the end. Toni Collete's character is just annoying and a repeat of her sixth sense performance with a worse alignment. Very unable.
