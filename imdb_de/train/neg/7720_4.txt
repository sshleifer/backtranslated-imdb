There are not enough gay theme films and there are not enough films. Everyone is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production values ​​are high (the film looks "good", Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks REAL in a pair of jeans), this is a bad one. It's a piece of time: gay life under a depressing regime (East Berlin, 1989), a life that seems 40 years behind the West. In a way, we see our own story. as it might have been for gays in the 40s and 50s (it often reminded me of `Last Exit to Brooklyn: the book does not do the movie). But it is tirelessly depressing and slow that evokes an old SCTV broadcast by Ingmar Bergman. It's so sloppily edited, I wonder if the director did not accidentally hack. Yes, it's a miracle that this was filmed and published before the wall fell and yes, the life behind the "curtain" was heavy for gays. A good director could have shown it all without stupefying the audience. A good director would have called me one of the great coming-out movies and not one of the Misses.
