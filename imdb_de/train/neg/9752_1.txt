I honestly can not believe what is now serving as entertainment. Death (and fun over death), violence, sexual innuendo, children threatening children, cruelty, alcohol abuse by minors, drug use, disturbed parents, babysitters from hell, stereotyped jokes about African American, police and fat people in the middle of the house Night - yes, sounds safe for me like a children's movie - NOT !!! Add to that the dark and spooky elements - a dead woman who owns and transforms a house, keeps her loving husband in jail for over 20 years, and also terrorizes an entire neighborhood - how sweet for children. PARENTS - Is that really what your children should see? Is that what you want to teach them about life? This movie is too scary for young kids, and I'm worried that teens today might live on some of that movie scenario - so why rub it into their faces? For an adult audience - you will not find it scary or amusing - just boring, invented and predictable. And the characters are just wrong - unsuspecting parents, ignorant cops, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters and beer drink and women friends. What great stuff for kids - does it sound like a children's movie to everyone? Even the computer animation and the good language work are not enough to save this terrible movie. Save your money, save time, and save your kids' minds - hire Ice Age, Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - all are far better than this horrible movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - too bad that you have made such a disaster and then put it as a children / family movie bill in !!
