This movie classic of The Smoldering Passion of 1997 has earned its well-deserved legendary status as one of the greatest legends of the screen of a condemned and hopeless love. The pervasive, ongoing and advancing magnetism between Judge Reinhold and the name of her name will surely make the heart of a spectator flutter with memories of his first crush. The brilliant script dangles this embryonic future affair before the enthusiastic audience and sits fixed, while the abstract, almost expressionist cinematography focuses deeply on the subterranean desires that go up and down between those responsible. You can relieve the sexual tension with a blunt tire iron. <br /> <br /> A tiny drop of sweat at the end of a nose captures the bright sunshine and leaves no doubt about its meaning. There are plenty of scenes like these that you can watch again and again. As with "Jane Eyre" and "Rebecca" (with whom this masterpiece is so often compared), the close-ups of the faces of the actors, while experiencing the slow blossoming of the great love that is not to be, are experienced forever. <br /> <br /> The now classic RC soundtrack score, with its creative and unique use of the solo synthesizer, emphasizes the emotions that permeate like a leaky crankcase. <br /> <br /> If I had criticism If I mentioned what I think was a small mistake (and dared to risk the wrath of the millions of fans who love this classic so much), I would say that the "Runaway Car" hallmark - his sense of being sexual tension - is briefly broken by the freeway scene, which now seems a bit overdone (and probably even unnecessary?) after repeated consideration of the eternal, bittersweet story of Love Interrupted. <br /> <br /> I dare, what I intend to perceive as the smallest flaws in this critically acclaimed triumph of modern cinema? "Citizen Kane" had his "Rosebud". , , "Runaway Car" should also have its buzzword. Maybe the film could have started with an extreme close-up of Judge Reinhold's saying something like "A car is an extension of its owner!" Say, and the rest of the story could then serve to analyze every syllable, subtlety and nuance of that sentence. Had this action been done, this film could have beat the "Titanic" at the Golden Globes this year. I am positive. <br /> <br /> My only regret? That I did not read the novel first.
