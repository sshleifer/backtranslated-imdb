LOC could have been a very well-made film about how the Kargil War was waged; It had the locations, the budget and the ability to have been India's "Saving Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down". Instead, it looks like a bloated, four-hour attempt to merge the campaign with the Masala film. Even the war scenes were terribly executed, using the same hill in all combat scenes and spending unnecessary time for occasional talks. Rather than addressing the Indian audience, a better movie would have been a book about what happened in Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down"), or even spending time on the militant standpoint (like "Torah") Tora, Tora ). Better yet, it could have been used by a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma to write, direct, and edit the film. Until then, I would like to see someone re-editing this movie, with only the relevant parts included. That would make the movie look better.
