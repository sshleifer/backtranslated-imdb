This film about secret government experiments and the corrupt use of citizens by mysterious and vile shadow figures had the potential to be a really interesting movie. But for me it failed. I will not devote much attention to the rather confusing plot line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment "Reluctantpopstar" gives a good description of it. <br /> <br /> But that did not work for me. I found it slow, which would be okay, but it did not seem to go nowhere. The viewer remains in the dark about too many things to really get a handle on this movie. In some films, it can be argued that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and therefore things were ambiguous. I do not think that's the case here. <br /> <br /> As for the frequent long shots of two buildings often mentioned by other users ... I see they have a point Give the viewer time to get another drink without to miss the "action". And I suspect that many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several drinks on board to get through this drink.
