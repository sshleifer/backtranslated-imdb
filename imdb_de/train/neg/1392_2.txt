"Gray Matter" AKA "The Brain Machine", but the video people thought it better; the screen says 1972, but IMDb says 1977; It's such a movie. The government has an overwhelming interest in this "Brain Machine" project, which has resulted in a shrinking room for four people - roughly a philosopher, a horny priest, a scorn veteran and a patriot who has been given an abortion a computer that can read their horrible secret thoughts. In the end, the government forcibly takes over the lab and everyone dies. Here is a movie that is incompetent in every important respect; MY s *** has better production values ​​than these. However, it held my interest only to see what exactly these exploitation filmmakers thought they were doing and trying to move in a four-man-in-the-room character drama. The answer: a tract about how science is inferior to God. Many thanks. It's like opening a kid's egg and getting your 30th goddamn puzzle. The priest is played by James "Roscoe P. Coltrane" Best, the philosopher of Gerald "Republican Simon" McRaney. Even very, very, very, very long recording and transient recordings in large numbers, this moves almost as slowly as the liberal assembly.
