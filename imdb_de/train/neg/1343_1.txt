We bought this movie in a shop called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration because we had previously bought the movie No Big Deal and made it new. <br /> <br /> We expected this movie to be very inspiring, so we could rebuild it and put it in the tube. This was shocking. Boredom is the noun I can think of. The bad effects and the script are not enough to see you. The body of the main woman seems to have been whipped out in favorable moments to interest the viewer. However, you're just wondering if they've used up the budget to get them to undress? If so, I would have asked for a refund! It looks like a homemade movie, the shots do not even correspond and the camera work is so amateurish that our remakes of bad movies look professional. I can not believe that this will be sold as a marketable product. <br /> <br /> It's just boring and undue to watch. The actors are bad and there is no professionalism. There are no words to describe how awful it is.
