If this series was to be an improvement on Batman - The Animated Series, I think it has failed terribly. The drawing of the characters is lousy ... (Catwoman, for example, looks terrible ...) But what really annoyed me was that Batman looked like some kind of sissy who just can not take care of himself in a fight, without the help of two, even three sidekicks. I mean, he's Batman, for God's sake! I know the comic books, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl should be next to Robin Batman's allies, but still ... lets Batman say he needs help from them ... what's he failing to do with a few punches? In the BTAS he could easily compete against a dozen opponents ... He is getting old? Come on ... <br /> <br /> And one more thing: I do not think Batman would allow a kid like Tim Drake to go to battle so fast without years of hard training. First, it's irresponsible (and Batman is everything but irresponsible), and second, it's not what's happening in the comics if we want to be true to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - The animated series has made history with its animation, stories and characters ... It really was a legend of Batman. The New Adventures series turned the legend into another Batman movie.
