I just watched this movie and basically did not find it funny. <br /> <br /> I'm an RPG gamer (computer type, none of the DnD turntables), but I found none of the jokes in this weird at all. <br /> <br /> Some scenes seemed to draw a lot out (tilt and zoom could be reduced to 5 seconds instead of over a minute) and it feels like the director was doing this. I'm just trying to schedule time. <br /> <br /> I think I've laughed a total of 2-3 times throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting itself was not so bad The standard a B grade film should have. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that you do not engage in this movie unless you are a big DnD fan, and even then, it would probably be best to stay away from it.
