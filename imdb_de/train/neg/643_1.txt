I'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch. This movie hurt me. I had to use the fast forward to avoid falling asleep. It was boring! How can someone ruin this title so much? The story was the only good thing. Actors were sh.t. You can not live the role. The main actor (Tom ...) is a zero. Watch the other roles of this actor. The fight scenes were unbelievably boring and not to follow, somehow they should not follow the situation. Like other critics said low-budget movie with bad actors. Maybe next time someone else will do something better from this title. French can not do the right thing with big movies like Alien 4. After alien 1,2,3 that was a bit brrr.
