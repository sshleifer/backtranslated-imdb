I think that Elisabeth Rohm is not very good, although she tries hard. I think it was the only one they could get for the price for budget reasons. I saw it mainly for the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most credible and certainly the most captivating he could see. When he was not on the screen, the thing was dead. This was shot in Vancouver. He gave me goosebumps, but rest assured that in real life he is a friendly, fun, compassionate man. He even said that role gave him goose bumps. <br /> <br /> I'll do it all, but Elisabeth RÃ¶hm - never again. She was as exciting as Lint in Law and Order. Maybe a very nice person, but not an actress.
