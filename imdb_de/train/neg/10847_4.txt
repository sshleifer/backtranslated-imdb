The Director Cut version I saw was very long for this type of movie. Almost two hours are way too long. If you have the choice, you definitely opt for the non-directorial cut. <br /> <br /> The main rendition is pretty much unclaimed, the movie is mainly composed of several murder scenes, but they are linked together. The feeling is that they are only shown to the film with lively force to fill. The connection is only revealed in the last part, and the lack of context bored me long before I was there. <br /> <br /> It does not work as a horror movie. You will never get the feel of the character due to mediocre action and general disposition (character is presented 15 minutes later the character is dead). This strong side is in the splatter area.
