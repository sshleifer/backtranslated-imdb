This film was seriously affected by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or how I should say Steven So-Dull! As previously Seagal is either too good or too stupid to cover up his own line again, and someone has to embody his voice for the shots in which the sound has to be repeated. He did that before a couple of movies, but I do not think so far! To be honest, the movie looks pretty good, the script could use some work, but parts of this film looked like a real movie! All in all, this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Without Seagal, who has become a cartoon of it, it would have been much better. Do not bother. Anything over a dollar for this is too much! I honestly believe this is the last time for me and a Seagal movie. What took me so long to realize that ?!
