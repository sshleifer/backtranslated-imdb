I've seen a lot of horror shows over the years, like Nightstalker, who dealt with the Wendigo legend, and I was looking forward to an angry spirit that adds chaos to the Halloween season. Man, I was wrong. The entire film creates a sense of events that will be scary and scary, but then provides a very simplified story of revenge and murder over the loss of property. Very scary - not! This movie has a lot to do with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser. <br /> <br /> It's getting harder and harder to believe what Hollywood is suggesting in terms of scary movies, as they rarely go through something original and ghostly. What idiots pay to make such a false movie? Go back to the drawing boards and do something useful with the millions of greenbacks you have to throw around.
