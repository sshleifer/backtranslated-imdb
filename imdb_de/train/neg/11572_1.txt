Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder that the company Weinstein did not buy this. This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while they film themselves and stop producing. There is no way to see and enjoy this. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2-minute movie with this idea, which is not a function. I am so sorry that I rented this movie. I will never see anything named Spurlock. It is completely garbage. Filmmakers like this should be on Youtube and never get a distribution contract. The film states that American consumers and their shoppers owe the current depression to shopping and buying products.
