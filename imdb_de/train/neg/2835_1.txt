The Dereks apparently had difficulty finding "10" rolls for Bo. <br /> <br /> I worked for a marine park in the Florida Keys. One day, the script for "Ghosts Can not Do It It" circulated among the coaches in the "Fish House", where the food was prepared for the dolphins. There was a scene in which a dolphin supposedly suggested Bo (or Bo, the dolphin) and wanted to "make eggs". After reading the script, we declined -... <br /> <br /> We did not shoot any part of this movie in our facility at the end, though our dolphins in "The Big Blue!" > <br /> This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn's life. I hope he enjoyed this movie because he certainly did not do anything for his heritage.
