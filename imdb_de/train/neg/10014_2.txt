I saw this movie in 1959 at a drive-in movie theater. Until "Howard the Duck," I considered this film the worst I've ever seen. This film tried to combine all genres in one; Comedy, horror, teenage fear and the hot rod that "My mother, the car" must have witnessed. Maybe it deserves a second consideration to see if it is an accurate reflection of time.
