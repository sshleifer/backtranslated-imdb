Wow, I knew this movie would be bad, but not so bad. Spoilerist comments follow. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper is a sick sweet retired policeman (cliche!) who helps everyone - he smiles like a postoperative lobotomy patient and complains about his dead son. His adoptive son returns from "special ops" of the armed forces and because he has "seen things" - represented by clenching his teeth when someone mentions something about the past. Time to clean up the streets of another man who used to know Piper and his dead son (whom the villain had killed) and his adoptive son. Oh, the love interest is a pretty young woman who chooses. There's no reason why she wants to throw the ex-army guys in the bone. This happens in about 2 minutes of a scene. <br /> <br /> The action could have saved this movie, but it's even worse than action and acting. Everything has been done before, everything has been done a lot better (Ong-Bak is a prime example). This is the worst movie I have ever seen - and I have seen Waterworld twice. <br /> <br /> Um, the movie's name is HONOR (Spelled Wrong for the Americans) and the name line has "from the maker of bloodsport and kickboxer" - Watch the other films by director David Worths and you will quickly find out why they put these two films on there even though they are over 10 years old. Such classics as "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - that really says it all. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 10 pounds if you do not visit this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - Sorry you do not know any sign names, but tell you something.
