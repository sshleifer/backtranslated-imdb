Ah, the sex and gore movie. It is a pity that they do not do this anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if they all developed that way, that's not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The movie basically consists of the two beautiful vampires who pick up their pants and take them home to their castle along a country road. Having crazy sex with them and then eating them (except for the first victim, which they keep for no particular reason). Things are complicated when a woman camping with her husband becomes too curious about those mysterious women she keeps seeing. It gets really ugly from here. In the end, the two vamps are so blood-blooded that they can eat everything in sight and escape their captive victim. Oops, so much for this secret existence. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie has to offer is the fact that the two vampires do not mind getting undressed and messing around with each other. Otherwise, it's a bloody, confusing mess (why is her grave so far away from her castle?) And can only be watched for the few minutes of vampire playtime. The only thing I got out of this movie was these two valuable advices: shooting lesbians will not kill them; it will only turn them into vampires and pick up no hooks on a country road; They are probably vampires. Other than that, it was not really worth my time.
