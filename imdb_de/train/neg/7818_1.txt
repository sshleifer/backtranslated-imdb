Usually I do not go out of a movie, but halfway I did it. This movie promised something else, but I've always thought, have not I seen it? Spoiler alarm! Back in 1, the spaceship crashes and lands on the ground. Well, all those years later, with a super-adult on board, this thing is still burning and burning! What, this advanced civilization does not seem to develop any landing gear? For an industry that is so liberal, we see another Woody Allen movie, no blacks, please! Superman runs around and saves people to make sure he stays in Europe and the US. Please do not go to dark areas. Maybe I could endure about 30 years ago, but now.
