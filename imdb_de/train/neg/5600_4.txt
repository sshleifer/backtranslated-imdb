fulci experiments with sci fi and fails. In his non-horror movies we usually get a lot of great, but not here. For example, compile very funny scenes, such as when the Prisinore are forced to stick to a bar for 12 minutes, and when they drop, they are selected. The guy falls and has a seizure on the ground for about two minutes until his friends, who wanted to hold on tight, lift him off the ground. The city is an obvious model, but not a bad one. and the final explosion is ridiculous at best. And do not bring me into the terrible fight scenes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
