If you are experiencing the wonders of cinema for the first time, if you've never seen a "moving picture," think that this movie is a child of the gods. BUT if you've seen a movie, a TV show or even Barney the Dinosaur, you will not be very impressed by this movie. Heck Barney, the dinosaur, was even more realistic than the dinosaurs in this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I like B-movies. I just saw "The Giant Gila Monster" just before I saw this swill, and I liked the movie a lot better. It works as a B-movie. It has Lamer dialogue, hirsute acting, cheesier effects and an honest Gila monster as a monster! Carno 3 does not have a big B-punch. It has a bit of gore, and this Polchek guy will be almost funny a couple of times, but this movie is unimpressive, almost ... limp. It's the little machine that could not dinosaur movies. I'm not saying that you should not see the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people watch chewing gum dry on a sidewalk and feel entertained. If you are one of these people, give this film a chance.
