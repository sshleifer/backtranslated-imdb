Liongate has yet to prove it. Every single Lionsgate movie was miserable. I've tried and tried to give them more options and they beat me over and over again. And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception. <br /> <br /> I could not even pay attention to most of this movie, it was so frustrating and bad. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot. Guy cuts the dead dog for some reason. Infected by random viruses, she transmits to children in a camp, children start to get infected and die, the city experiences it and instead of helping them, she kills her. then the water gets infected and everyone dies. The end. <br /> <br /> Seriously, that's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely left behind, they do not care about one of them, and the one child should be stuck with the boy who hits the world. My friend and I loved it when we talked about how fat and humid our classmate would be more fun than paying attention to this movie. We managed to make it all the way to the end while screaming at the cops $ @ t, because this movie is going to make you do that a random kid and how apparently everyone in the country is left behind and hickig. And why did this dog attack the girl? Why is the boy the Hicks tried to kill sitting in a chair, waiting for them to kill him? that was part of her plan? Impressive. best plan ever. I can not believe this movie has a theatrical release. I could hardly stand the DVD, let alone sit in a theater and do not move for an hour and a half. It was not scary or funny or cool or anything. It's just a waste of 90 minutes you could use to ... I do not know if you're planting a tree or something. it is more productive than this piece of rubbish. Acting, special effects and script are a joke. Never record this. <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever gets an uncomfortable shaving scene of 10 out of 10 years
