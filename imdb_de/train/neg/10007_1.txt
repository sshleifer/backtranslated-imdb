This movie is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers. Her bitchy appearance of "Law and Order" is transmitted in a failed attempt at comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only one who gets away with this awful anti-comedy. The only positive thing that comes out of this mess is the marriage of Charlie and Denise. Hopefully, this effort will lead to better results.
