Definitely a strange debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life collapses around him. Cecil reaches for a telephone book, searches for the name of a preacher and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's house and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the Word of God and to have Jesus in his heart. That makes everything better. Ahh ... if only everything in life would be so easy. Of course, the fact that this "movie" looks like it was made at about $ 500 does not help. 1.10
