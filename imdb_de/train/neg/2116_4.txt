The Poverty Row horror images of the 1930s and 40s express hell out of me. God knows, I have nothing against low-budget movies, but those produced during that time have such a dreary, shabby look - and in the end they're not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a bit more entertaining than the end of the barrel like "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man", but it's not a classic. Bela Lugosi, long after his "Dracula" wedding, is still playing a crazy doctor. the unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains to a dubious young reporter (Luana Walters), a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also present, which could appeal to hardcore fans of the 30s and 40s.
