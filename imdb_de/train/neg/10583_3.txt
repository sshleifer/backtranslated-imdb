I'm sorry to say that, but the acting in this movie is terrible. The dialogue sounds like they are reading their lines for the first time ever. Maybe I accidentally got the "dress rehearsal" version. The director overruns slow motion on special effects to possibly compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written and the combat sequences are actually better than I've seen in many action movies. The battles seem pretty real. But all of this happens as two protagonists miraculously survive unbelievable amounts of automatic weapons, automatic grenades, grenades, Morter rounds and bazookas. The enemy soldiers are definitely one of the worst shots I've ever seen, especially if they're aiming for the truck from about 30 yards away and every bazooka shot is at least 50 feet wide. These bazookas must be seriously calibrated on-site.
