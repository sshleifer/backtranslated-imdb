There should be a rule that clearly states that films like Resident Evil should be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing everything up. RE was a survival horror game and a damn effective one, but Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of spirit as Resident Evil. So, of course, there's little hope that the director manages to have a piece of brain that's enough to make a horror movie, not an action movie. Instead, Alone in the Dark proves that video games are no hope anymore. <br /> <br /> The plot, though it obviously does not matter, is the biggest of many movie issues. The movie starts with what can only be described as five-minute scrolling of text that may or may not be important, because after a minute the audience stops worrying and just sits in the middle and hits the object the next time. Then there's something about an orphanage, some artifacts, an old tribe, a bureaucracy, and some demons, all jumbled together so that the audience really can not follow. Characters move into and out of the storehouse like sweets, some have large bodies for meaningless deaths. Basically, I can understand that some demons have been released and Edward Carnby (Slater) has a connection to them, thanks to an operation given to children in his orphanage who have failed him. He finds an artifact involving the demons, and brings it to a former anthropologist (Reid), with whom he naturally has sex for no good reason. Then, out of nowhere, hell breaks loose, and the couple ends up with a military team headed by an asshole commander (Dorff) who appears to have a mutual hatred for Carnby. <br /> <br /> It's all ridiculous, And the reason I do not really understand is not just because it's complicated and confused, it leaves no room for someone who really cares. I urge you, if you need to watch this movie, to bring a tennis ball or something to keep you busy when the plot gets confused. <br /> <br /> The action scenes in a movie with an action as horrible as this should at least take up a bit, right? Too bad, this movie is like any other ruined manure ever made, with enough quick cuts to behead a chicken coop. Given that this is based on a horror game, not on an action game, it is particularly annoying. <br /> <br /> The first action scene in which a man chases Cranby out of a taxi is one of the worst I've ever seen and the rest is not so great either. The demons look a bit cool, although the fact that they turn into powder when killed kills all of this effect. For scenes with many guns that should be cool, they should use the muzzle flash as the only source of light, and the camera must zoom and panning faster than the head of a crack addict. It's the kind of seizure that causes crap keeping kids in bed at night. <br/> <br /> Acting is what I call actors who make them do nothing. Slater sounds important to the entire movie, though he seems to have more talent than he leases. The same goes for Dorff, who despite his talents gets a thankless role (something that has happened to him many times). Reid is pretty much what she should be, background sex appeal, because if she tries to act, it's a disaster (as well as the unbelievably bad look the scientist she has in the beginning). <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that worries me about future video feature films. If they ruin their minds in this way, it is only a matter of time before Samus Aran kills the Middle East with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti fights an alien squadron. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this movie does not deserve a second chance. I do not think anything could help me forget how awful this movie is. It is bland, uninteresting and uninspiring. This is the film equivalent of diarrhea; It's all thrown together, nothing really fits and in the end you're just glad it's over. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: 4%
