I recently saw this movie with my sister, who likes the performances of Sophia Loren. I am a person they call culture barbarian. I hate art in any form. Rambo is more my kind of movie, action, kill, blood and horror. If you recognize it, avoid this movie like the plague. Nobody dies, no action, no nakedness, nothing like that. Let me give you a CV in a few sentences. It starts with 5 minutes of black and white propaganda. Every Italian in a block of flats takes part in a parade in honor of Hitler, with the exception of a housewife, an anti-fascist and a caretaker. Housewife cheated on by her husband meets the anti-fascist. She falls in love with him, wants to love him, but the anti-fascist is gay. Nevertheless, they love each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the guy himself is deported by agents. The end. You would like an even shorter CV? Boring ... so short enough? The guy should have used his rifle at the beginning of this movie and shot himself to save the audience from this cruelty. Incidentally, my sister loved this movie. As I said, I am cultural barbarian ...
