Why did the stories of Maria and Rhoda have to be so bad? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the original show and the characters? The daughter figures were stupid and uninteresting. Why can not there be daughters who like their mother on TV? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis and Rhoda would return to NYC, but why could not Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars? It just seems a pathetic way to remember those wonderful characters. It was nice to see Mary and Rhoda together, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there was a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do better next time she revisits her old Mary Richards Stomping Areas.
