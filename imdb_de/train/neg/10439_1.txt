I'd like to think I'm a pretty open-minded guy and it takes a lot (!) That I do not like a movie, but this movie is without doubt one of the lousiest, craziest movies I've ever seen! <Br /> <br /> I have no idea what's wrong with the people who gave such a good rating here (imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to reviews) ... the only thing I know Imagine is that people must have chosen during one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. 2. You have received cash for your votes. 3. By force of arms <br /> <br /> I can not believe I wasted a good 1 hour and 45 minutes of my life for this pitiful apology for a movie.
