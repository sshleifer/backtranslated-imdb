I knew that I would watch a low budget movie, but I had expected much more from an Alex Cox movie. The acting of the two leading men was terrible, especially the whites. The girl should have won an Oscar in comparison to these two. This movie was full of jokes for people in the movie industry and a few other jokes that I actually understood and made me laugh, which is rare. Without these loud moments I would have given this movie 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox, who made all the classics of the 80s? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> After the movie, there were a few questions I had. Why did the Mexican go to the other man's house at the beginning? What did his daughter say that he fired 100 people from his last job? Why did she break her own stuff when she was mad at him? I think I should have gone to the questions and answers after the film, but I did not want to get up at 10:00.
