I saw this movie after I had difficulty downloading it through Rapidshare. And I have to say it did not deserve it. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so upset that I was really looking forward to seeing it. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of those films that the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers are not met despite a great story. Even sadder was knowing that the story itself was not original, but based on the classic "On the Waterfront". Anil Kapoor was annoying, especially when he came from America. The direction was often lacking in quality, except for a few intervening scenes. <br /> <br /> Give this script to each of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra and I'm 100 years old% sure they make a stunning movie out of it. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that Parinda was bad. It just was not good enough.
