I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. Compared to Robert Altman's ingenious, witty, crazy and groundbreaking 1970 movie classic, this show was probably rather mediocre ... even if she ran for eleven years, she does not necessarily do any good. This show was too integral an integral part of my early childhood (it took place every evening at rehearsals, and I think her parents watched and laughed at her), but it's one of the memories I do not miss. And now that I have actually seen the movie, I can give this series an accurate review. Alone, it's not nearly "2 out of 10" bad. The characters in this show, however, are not identical to those in the movie. Some of them are technically identical, but they only have a similar name. For example, since when is Alan Alda something like Donald Sutherland? His humor is completely different, as is his characterization and attitude. The new characters are not that great; They only serve to make you miss those who replace them. The same with the new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that actually gets into the series is Radar, who is still (although played by the same actor) just a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh yeah. With a laugh track (it does not matter if it was used in surgery scenes or not), it's scary, which happens in the other settings. And because it took almost four times longer than the actual Korean War, it takes viewers into this bizarre temporal gap that does not work outside the cartoon world. I never liked this show and I will never do it.
