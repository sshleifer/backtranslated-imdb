I liked the first movie, but this is a textbook example of a sequel that would have been better on the drawing board. The general idea in the first film was, if not great, then very interesting. This sequel tries to build on the idea and characters of the first movie, and though Christopher Walken is still good at being Gabriel, the idea is suddenly becoming ridiculous. If you have not seen any of these films, get the first movie and forget the sequels. You can take all the pleasure from the original.
