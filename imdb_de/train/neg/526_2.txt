It's almost as boring to see what it was to read, and Evening is a great failure ... until Meryl Streep comes in and silently shows her other actors how to do that. Vanessa Redgrave is shocking in her role as the dying Ann and Claire Danes a cipher. If Vanessa and Claire had changed roles, maybe we could have seen the vibrancy in young Ann, who gave her appetizer to the rare world of history, and we could have imagined that the older Ann was actually dying. <br /> <br /> I had hoped that adding Michael Cunningham to the writing credits would compensate for the erratic storytelling, but unfortunately. It made me headache.
