Although this is generally a cheesy jungle adventure movie, there are some highlights - the settings are pretty nice and the pace of the adventure is good. You will not be bored if you see it. <br /> <br /> Keith is as airy as possible to play the eponymous lead role, a blatantly drunken jungle guide who accompanies the rich boy Van Hoffman and his beautiful wife Shower on a hunt expedition into cannibal country. He never takes things seriously. The shower is a decoration and Keith makes a lot of use of her - she does not really have to do much. She is not the only woman to show off her body, and the oppressive aspects of the film make it about halfway into a T / A image. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film that would attract any attention or away from it. Produced to be Shlock, it succeeds without fuss. A good programmer for 2 o'clock in the morning.
