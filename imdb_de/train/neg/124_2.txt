This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, FÃ©minin and I urge you to watch this movie instead. <br /> <br /> The film has two strong elements. undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, I notice most of the endless stream of stupidity. Lena Nyman must be the most annoying actress in the world. She looks so stupid and with all the nudity in this movie ... it's unattractive. Compared to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced by stupidity. Without going too far beyond this issue, I would say that this follows from the difference in ideals between French and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> A film of its time and place. 10.2.
