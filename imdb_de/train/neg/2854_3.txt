Dreyfuss plays a mob boss who has lost his mind, but now he is "fixed". Lane is his girl, who played around with his number one (Goldblum), which should have something to do with Lane's sister (Barkin). <br /> <br /> With what anyone could consider an All-Star cast (Burt) Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even a performance by Richard Pryor) can not remedy this conspiracy, since Dreyfuss proves that he is not "fixated" and tries to kill just about anyone. <br /> <br /> You know, it's not like you do not know what's coming. The first ten minutes were nothing but guys who wanted to tell Goldblum what came out for Dreyfuss, but I'll save you the trouble: skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The real reason I chose This movie is because I've recently been on a Diane Lane kick and tried to watch all of her films. The real disappointment for me was not just the terrible plot, but also the fact that she does not appear until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (though we hear from her throughout the movie). Even as a fan of over half the cast I can not enjoy this movie. In the places where the tension was supposed to be, I had to laugh about what was really going on. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
