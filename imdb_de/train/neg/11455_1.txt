First of all, to give you an idea of ​​my taste in movies ... <br /> <br /> 2007 Comedies I Enjoyed: Superbad, Knocked, Hot Fuzz, Blades Of Glory 2007 I hated: Evan Almighty, The brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck <br /> <br /> I should have followed my first instinct and switched off "Hot Rod" after reaching the 20-minute mark. I knew at the time that this movie would not even make me laugh. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monster 6 in IMDb cracked. Anyone over the age of 10 who has enjoyed this must have a kind of mental defect. <br /> <br /> This does not come close to Will Farrell and it's clear that Andy Samberg can no longer wear a 5 to 10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL. I do not know how they got Ian McShane and Isla Fisher to make this movie ... they must have favored or owed something. I came in the knowledge that it would be a stupid movie, but I thought it would be funny at least. I did not smile either. <br /> <br /> I usually do not comment on movies on IMDb, but that was so terrible, I just had to warn people. This is just the fourth movie I've seen, and I felt compelled to rate 1/10.
