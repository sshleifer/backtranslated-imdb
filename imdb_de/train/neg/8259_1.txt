I have already seen this movie at its premiere. <br /> <br /> It is based on the idea that autistic children with messages typed in can communicate with someone else who just helps and guides their hands. <br /> <Then suddenly these kids, many of whom did not even watch the keyboard or the screen when the messages were typed (they might look up to the ceiling in some cases), but their presenters were glued to the screen with writing abuse messages from their parents and other people, and sent parents and child support agencies into an intoxicating Tizzy, left and right. This whole thing turned out to be a fallacy, as a third person opened a folder, opened it to the kid and said, "Enter the picture you see," and then, when the presenter turned the folder over to the presenter, a fold would be made fall down and show another picture. <br /> <br /> Kid may have seen a dog, the presenter saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Each time at every flowering time, the name of the image was what the presenter had observed, never what the child was shown. <br /> <br /> So, who typed? Never the child. <br /> <br /> This movie took another catastrophic turn with the Australian poster. The person who molested the child in the movie was IN the situation that tried to help the child If Melissa Gilbert had never put her son in that place, he would not have been molested, the film says. Under her supervision, he felt better. <br /> <br /> If I give my child to your organization and get bothered instead, do you think I would like to hear everything you need to say afterwards? Unlikely! I think it's a safe bet that all the accusatory messages these kids have typed on which this film is based have never accused anyone in their operation as it happened here. Unfortunately I remember that Gilbert's film as a mother of an autistic did a very good job, but apart from that, the movie really did not do much. <br /> <br /> The worst thing was by far the kid, that ended the end with Patty Duke and we hear the mechanical voice again reading what he typed. , , , , "we won!" This kid was molested. If you cut my leg off and I take you to court and you're found guilty of damaging me, attack, whatever, that's legal justice, but it will not bring back my leg. <br /> <br /> Best of all, in my condition, I will consider it a hollow victory. <br /> <br /> The chance this child has of what is perceived as normal is further harmed by the harassment of autism alone. <br /> <A "normal" child has enough to cope with such an experience. <br /> <br /> It is completely superficial to think that you have to look at every situation and "we have won" when that person is found guilty in court. <br /> <br /> Just a bad handling of a situation and the circumstances here.
