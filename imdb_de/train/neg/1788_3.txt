Only if the Technicolor, the costumes and the sets are properly credited do they deserve a noteworthy mention. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the lowest point in the long career of BING CROSBY at Paramount. The script is as clumsy as you can imagine, and neither the occasional Bing, William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do anything about it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks extremely stupid in a Page Boy wig. And poor Rhonda Fleming plays a major role as a costume queen, prompting her to admire Bing and other things admirably, except to fling a few uninspired ballads in a voice that was probably dubbed for the occasion. <br /> <br /> Just awful! Mark Twain's joke can not be recognized in any of the screenplays. Only die-hard Crosby fans can really appreciate the chaos of a movie in an uninspired direction. Even the extras look like they do not know what to do. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Dull as rinse water. Also not recommended for children.
