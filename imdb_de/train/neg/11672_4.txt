Three writers made a bold attempt to adapt Jane Stanton to Hitchcock's novel for the tube, but this TV movie was overcrowded with too much melodrama and does not know when to stop. Fighting artist Meg Tilly is suddenly hired by the wealthy, enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, who wants a mural on the walls of her unused ballroom. After Tilly had learned from the last meeting - the leaving party of Ellen's daughter - Tilly decides on her artistic theme. She never dreamed that the daughter had mysteriously died before the event even began, and that she and the deceased also have a striking resemblance to each other! Two great actresses give their services to an unbelievable yarn that does not require an in-depth examination, one that in its emotional intensity does not match either of the ladies. Burstyn's role wavers in the camp, while Tilly gets stuck in the dreamy eye-waif routine. Only a sequence late in the movie (the morning after the mural is finished) is charged with honest feeling, anger, and betrayal. The rest is Piffel.
