Quite typical for Swedish films of this type. Strange that acting was so bad, these actors usually give a good show. The casting was bad, it was expecting something (I will not tell you what). The main character was terrible ... I do not know where to find them. Be sure to stay away and see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen".
