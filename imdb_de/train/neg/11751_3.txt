If HEY ARNOLD! first came on air in 1996, I saw it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episodes were shown over and over again, so I was sick of waiting for new episodes and stopped looking at them. I was kind of surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! THE MOVIE, as it does not seem nearly as popular as other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. After I had nothing better to do, I went to the movie anyway. I did not expect much at the theater. I just expected it to be a silly movie version of a kid's cartoon like the RECESS movie. I think I got what I expected. It was a stupid kids movie and nothing else. There were some good parts here and there, but for the most part the movie was a stinker. Easy for kids.
