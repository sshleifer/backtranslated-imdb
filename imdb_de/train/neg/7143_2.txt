This movie has some of the greatest cars I've ever seen in a movie and definitely the hottest women, but I have to say that it's still one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot, and if you read it with a little twist, you also have the drama. <br /> <br /> Start bringing characters with you, hot female singing (obvious lip-synching). Music agent or producer comes in and finds that she is gorgeous and asks her to race. She refuses, too many bad memories. Flash to war hero, back from the war, has several fights and becomes a movie hero with the attitude that he is better than anyone else. Get started in a fast exotic car. Brother runs, then dies. Hero to avenge death, away from a friend to get weapons. (You have not seen this friend before or since, but you seem to really care about him.) Are you sure you want to do this? Yes; I mean, are you really sure? Yes, give me weapons. are you really sure; Yes; OK, I guess I can not talk you out, be careful, man, I love you. Now he goes to his uncle's house, which owned the car his brother drove. Find a woman, decide to save her, she leaves and he can not kill his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the movie. Oh yes, you still need to introduce a scene where evil people come in to beat people who do not really matter, but maybe there's a little conspiracy. The race is not even so exciting, of course it ends with two cars, and one that should win in a surprising ending. You can send me all your money because I should have given you as much pleasure as this movie. Do not get me wrong, the cars are fantastic and Nadija is beautiful, but it's really a horrible movie.
