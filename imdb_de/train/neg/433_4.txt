This movie is predictable; It is more predictable than a pass from Vinnie Testaverdi if he holds the ball for the jets. You saw the end in the middle of the movie. Politics reminds me when I was back in the East. Many people know when the problem is resolved. I gave these four because of acting, but the story is lame.
