This is one of the worst movies I have seen lately. If a man says he wants a superpower to enjoy himself orally, I think the film is a rather childish 14-year-old male fantasy. The bedroom scene was exaggerated and reduced an intimate moment to a farce of biological functions that resembled the passage of gas in public. From the beginning, every second scene has been a discussion about how little sex they would get, how long ago it has been since they got them, when their next sexual connection is and with whom they should be together. Moreover, dialogue and acting were very bad and very forced, not felt, and they filled their lack of content with dirty sex scenes. That could have been really funny, because the concept is actually interesting, but not well implemented here. Do not even think about taking someone under the age of 16, if you need to see it.
