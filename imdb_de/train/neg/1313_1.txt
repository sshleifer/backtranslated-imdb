Do not try to see this horrible miniseries. It's a six-hour hole, an incredible love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. There is no heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance. It's a dry, boring, drawn out and uninspired one as they come. And it does not even meet the expected technical level. Take these six hours of your life and use them for something more valuable.
