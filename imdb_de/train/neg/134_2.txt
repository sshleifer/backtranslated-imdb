This movie in Away was very smart. It's theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made. Valentine tries ZERO to be original. What is Valentine's Day? It's a group of people who give each other the same lame messages that were sent to the same people the year before. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /> <br /> I've only seen it once, and here are some of the movies that were cut off. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4. Any other horror movie in which someone kills someone. <br /> <br /> I know there is more, but my mind slowly became a puddle of silk I could not pack it as fast as it came. <br /> <br /> Valentine did not have a chance to be a good movie. How is it that every horror movie has to have a "surprise killer"? People who do not interest you, because their emotions change in every other scene. In a minute, a nice girl turns into a bad B-ch, then she's an insecure woman and so on and so forth. Valentine does not have that again. It was as if they had tried to make it PG-13, but failed and left the processing. <br /> <br /> Do not look that overly inspired, rip-off, unless you hate yourself and want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
