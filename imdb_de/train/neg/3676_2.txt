Susan Swift is an attractive young woman, a flower child who was transplanted in the 1980s (like a young Susan Dey), but she does not have the right vocal range for a sophisticated dramatic lead and she tends to moan; Nevertheless, she is pretty sweet and has bright eyes and a pretty smile. In "The Coming" (as it was briefly referred to when it was briefly released in theaters), Swift could be the reincarnation of a Salem witch. The strip is very cheap and borrowed from so many other pictures that I gave it up in about 15 minutes. It starts off strong and has some warehouse acceptance. Obviously, there are more serious films that deal with the processes of Salem that deserve to be seen through this movie. But when junk movies go, it's not that bad. The venues in Boston are definitely a plus, and the side cast is amusingly hammy. * 1/2 of ****
