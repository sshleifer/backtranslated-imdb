First of all, the film was not true to the facts at all. I only saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie was not like that at all. First of all, Nash was a genius in mathematics, so the movie should not be about a story about a man who was healed and eventually found love, and so on. There are also many scenes that were simply wrong - the scene in which he cycled on campus did not take place in his early years at university. In my opinion, Russell Crowe did not fit this role at all, because he does not look like an intelligent / individualistic guy and therefore could not really play. It would have been great if more of the math (similar to Pi) and not the overly dramatized love life had concentrated. At this level ABM was too hollywood and too superficial to be great. Personally, I think he was neither crazy nor paranoid and he was up to something, as people of this caliber know more than we "less mortals". 5.10
