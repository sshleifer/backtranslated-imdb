I have read the book a few times and this film does not follow exactly as it should. I could leave this slide, it's a movie. However, I have serious problems with the setting of the film. No one has apparently mentioned that this film and the book on which it is based are based on actual events in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city on which this film is based. First of all, the "small" city, which is referred to as the backdrop, is the third largest city in the state. With around 50,000 inhabitants. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Second, the scenery for the film is wrong. Grand Island is located in the Platte river valley. Which is very shallow with very few trees. I was trying to watch this movie, but it was driving me crazy that my hometown was being treated so badly. That was a real event. Large parts of the city were wiped out. The book talks about cycling from Mormon Island to Fonner Park. I think you could, if you do not mind, make a fifteen-mile ride in each direction.
