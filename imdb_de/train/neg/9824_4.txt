I was not familiar with the US television stations when I opened it with my in-laws' cable. At first, I thought it was just a low-budget science-fiction movie, and after a few minutes, I thought it might be smart satire about the worst excesses of the Christian fundamentalist, and then it dawned on me-good grief, these people are serious! It's been a while since I saw anything unwanted. I was reluctant to write a review for fear of insulting believers, but then I saw other reviews and thought, hey, they can take it. Difficult philosophical riddle: How do you make a movie that criticizes films without actually showing what you criticize? Answer: Make it so that the only people who appreciate it are people who hate the kind of films you criticize. I suspect some liberals (ugh! Spit, if you say so!) Could be offended by the disdain of the filmmakers for the spectators who are not obsessed with the myth J **** C *****, but me did not do it - it was so damn funny!
