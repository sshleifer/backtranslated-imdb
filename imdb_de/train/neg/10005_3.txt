The second attempt of a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a "Swedish" film - the first was Susan Sontag's "Brother Carl" (made in Sweden with Swedish actors, not less!). The results? Oscar Wilde said best about Dickens's "The Old Curiosity Shop": "You have to have a heart of stone so you do not laugh about the death of Little Nell." Pretty much the same here. "Interiors" is full of solemnly intoned howlers. ("I am afraid of my anger." A look into the middle distance: "I do not like who I will be.") The directives (to use a polite expression) of Bergman are about to parody. The incredibly dedicated family keeps reminding us how brilliant and talented they are until they strangle. ("I read a poem from you the other day, it was in - I do not know - New Yorker." "Oh, that was an old poem, I've revised it.") Far from addressing these people but I found them pretty weird. Much of the dialogue is just like the funny stuff from Allen's previous films - only he has instructed his actors to play the lines straight. After not interfering in the film himself, he has got poor Mary Beth Hurt to copy all her theses, intonations, and neurotic habits and turn her into an embarrassing substitute (similar to Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity). <br /> <br The basic plot - a dysfunctional family with a quietly dominant mother - seems more or less to be Bergman's "Winter Light". The basic family melodrama was tricked with much existential anxiety. All this is revealed in the worn-out visual and acoustic tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the massive surf that overshadows the people walking on the beach. etc etc .. <br /> <br /> Allen's later "serious" movies are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining. I will take "interiors". Woody's has rarely made a funny movie.
