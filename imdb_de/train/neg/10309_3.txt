"CIA Codename: Alexa" is an absolute horror of Luc Besson's classic "La Femme Nikita" (1990). Essentially, the film is about a woman being picked up and trained by the CIA and forced to perform a secret mission for her. (Pretty much the same story structure of La Femme Nikita) The combination of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history. Lama's "drama" is simply a bad imitation of Steven Segal. Seeing Orenthal in this movie is a torturous experience. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting is sometimes so bad in this film that it's ridiculous. There are so many action movie "conventions" in the film that it's ridiculous: unnecessary car explosions, people flying through glass windows, terrorists, bad ponytails, etc. The score is similar to David Michael Frank's "Hard to Kill" (1990 ), which promote the Steven Segal theme of this film. The film contains many martial arts and is pretty well done for low-budget American production. The thoughtless action and exaggerated acting never let up, and I have to admit that I was easily entertained. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas had the look of an action star in the early 90s, but he's certainly not an action star. That's why he makes soap operas, not action blockbusters. My recommendation is that you skip "CIA Codename: Alexa" and try "La Femme Nikita" instead.
