Be warned: Neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor play the main role, as the poster would have you believe. Their roles are indeed minor. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles heavily between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama, without them both being really compelling. In particular, I find it impossible to have much sympathy for the lead actor, not to mention his screwball friends and sex-obsessed fiancee. The action draws terribly and I turned off this after about 2/3 - unusual for me, because I like to end what I'm starting. The good acting and the beautiful environment ranges from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
