This is not a good movie. Acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincing. The movie does not seem to know if it's a real horror approach or if it's a camp and kitsch route. I never saw the first movie, but this movie does not stand up for its own merit, there are several unconvincing phrases and the viewer is never alerted to the importance of the main female vampire. Is not worth the trouble of watching
