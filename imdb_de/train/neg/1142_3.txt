They were tortured and beaten up by my harsh statements about "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals" films in submission! Now comes another breed in disappointing rediscoveries: Ninja Movies! I've already seen many of them, and let me tell you, it's not all that matters! They usually do not stick to the point. Among other things, this does not suffer from any originality! What does a ninja have to do with preventing an atomic holocaust in Russia? And is not that supposed to be a "martial arts" movie? Do many shots sound like an incredible action movie to you? Is blood the main reason why one should love this to death? Are you wasting some of your hard-earned money on a woman singing in her transparent tank top? The answers to these important questions can be found in THE NINJA MISSION, which should be in the martial arts section of your video library. For even more nonsense Ninja fun, check out the Godfrey Ho films released by Trans World. You get what you deserve and that is a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts!
