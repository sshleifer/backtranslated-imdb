In this movie, I think the others I saw with Combs were an accident. The plot had more holes than I think I've ever seen in a movie that was supposed to be more than a "b" movie. The acting was so ridiculous that not even the memories of Comb's earlier Campy triumphs were enough to save it. Considering the script, I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for continuity and original ideas. I'm totally annoyed that I've paid blockbuster prices for this garbage. The fact that it was made for television would have helped me to avoid this cruelty, and to be honest, something to warn against these poor movies. Avoid this movie, no matter what.
