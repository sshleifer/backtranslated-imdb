Overrated and only for the people in their 20s who wear extra thick glasses that they did not actually see because they were too young. Terrible animation, dialogue and a tired story. A real product of the 80s, the novel gimmick of a TOY puzzle (that's right, TOY is not the absurd, overbearing, and alien "collector's figure") sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other utensils, just for those who do Bought TOY when they were "real" children in the period from "84" to "87". It has become cult because the same adults are too immature to let go of their memories. Avoid.
