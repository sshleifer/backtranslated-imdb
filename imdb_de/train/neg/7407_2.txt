1. viewed 18.06.2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): Funny psychotic film about a girl with autism being tested in a hospital, power flickering and then hell breaks loose. I'm honestly not sure what the filmmakers intended with these intentions. What we got for the next hour and a half (at least it was not) was a twisted Horror / Twilight Zone / Zombie Fest / Ghost movie that did not make any sense in the end. After the power fails, everyone is initially missing in the hospital, with the exception of a small group of outsiders, including the girl and his father. There is the typical annoying character, a spooky old man and the typical tough guy, who resembles many scar festivals, and of course the young girl to whom the main character draws. Random stuff happens at different times, as ghosts and monsters appear, an indication that time has stopped, and dead people as this small group tries to escape wherever they are I really hate it, like them have used the suffering of this girl, claiming that she was the cause, and placing it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame. We never really find the answer to what was going on - which is very strange, so please avoid this dog. If you do not want to be hugged and confused for an hour and a half, this is not for you or any movie viewer. What a waste of time? Really !!
