What a disappointment! The score of 6.1 here on IMDb had some mild expectations, but I was disappointed. The first thing that annoys me is these Braindead, stereotypical university kids. Yes, I know teenagers can be childish, and so on, but why are they always portrayed as complete Braindead idiots in movies? There was a character that I thought was alright, but he / she (not revealed here) was killed long before the end. The other characters were badly executed and even the supposed heroine or heroine just did not do it for me. On the positive side: The plot is pretty good and the productions are rated slightly higher for this type of snippets. Acting was generally not very good, Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role. But with sober and braindead characters everything fails. You just stop worrying about them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and that's generous).
