The film begins with promises but remains too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. We hang on, but there is nothing but boring shots of serious and thoughtful male faces that you can enjoy. Certainly not a rope on the wall to help us with climbing. It's a shame, because the concept is not without merit. <br /> <br /> We wonder why a loving couple - a father and a son no less - should be so far from the real world that their own world is preferable if claustrophobic beyond imagination. This presence loss in the real world is too obvious and unnecessary in contrast to the fact that the son has applied to the armed forces. Why not the circus so we can at least appreciate some color? We have a nagging sense of loss, but unfortunately no education, which is confusing, since the film is apparently a form of reaching that is not available to all of us.
