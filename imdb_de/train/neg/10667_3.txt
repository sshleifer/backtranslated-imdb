Do not be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are just glorified extra extras. Her scenes were probably shot in a day or so. Whatever their motives for this movie are, if you have an actor like James Woods you should make better use of it. For me, this is a sign of a bad direction through and through. The story itself was not that bad. And the spectacle of most actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr., however, was terrible. He was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since this was meant to be a serious movie, that can not be a good thing. The action scenes were not bad, but they missed the special punch to make it more exciting. Again, a better direction was needed. Even the tempo was wrong for a movie like this one. It took almost half an hour for the main character to take action. This is way too slow for an action thriller of only 90 minutes. The only salvation factor is Angie Harmon. She is doing her best to make everything work. Too bad the director let her down. Yes, this movie could have been much better with a great director. Andy Cheng is too inexperienced as a director to make it. And for an action / stunt coordinator of his caliber, you would expect at least more exciting action scenes. Do not waste your time with this. Avoid!
