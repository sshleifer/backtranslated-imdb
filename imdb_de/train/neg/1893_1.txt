This movie became extremely stupid when it started. I could not care for any of the characters. Susan Walters was so annoying and the lead actor (forget his name) got on my nerves. I can not remember exactly how it ended and so on, but the whole idea that aliens have human bodies, and everything just seemed stupid in this movie. My dad told me it's a stupid movie ... I should have listened to him.
