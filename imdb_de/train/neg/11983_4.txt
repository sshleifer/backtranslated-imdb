Marie Dressler wears this depression drama about a benign bank owner recently broadcast on TCM during her April Fool Comedy Month. If you are met with a big laugh by the Dressler-Polly Moran team, you will be disappointed, as this is really a very rundown movie. It's also done very poorly, surprisingly, considering it's from MGM. Leonard Smith's nude bone cinematography comes exclusively from the "setting up the camera and not moving" school, often to the detriment of the cast that delivers lines out of the screen (it's like a pan & scan print before there was one!) , ) or cut off the heads. The film does not even have a credited director based on the apparent night fly of production. All in all, it's an unsatisfactory mess, with Dressler often throwing too much emotion and just that bizarre, final reel into the bathroom to distinguish him.
