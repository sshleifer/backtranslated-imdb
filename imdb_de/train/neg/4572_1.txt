This film often extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas, limited by statements such as "We create all our own reality." <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, people. <br /> <br /> The idea that "everything is possible" does not stand in the way of closer inspection: if something is possible, then opposing things are possible and thus nothing is possible. This leads to postmodernist nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths, so that all reasonable and stupid ideas are the same. Who put it so well, "Reality is what, if you stop believing in it, does not go away."
