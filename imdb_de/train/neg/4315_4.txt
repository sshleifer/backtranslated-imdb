The only good thing about this year's ceremony was really the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was rather short, it was still a bit boring. I think it's time to start looking for a new director and producer for the show who can have something really new. It is quite obvious that this year they tried to make the show "hip" and more attractive to a younger audience by having Beyonce performed and having P. Diddy and Prince presented a category. Making Chris Rock the presenter was also an attempt to redesign the ceremony and make it more appealing. Nothing really worked. <br /> <br /> Sure, Chris Rock is a weird guy, but he was not really a good presenter. I really only saw him as a man who spoke only occasionally between the different categories. His presence was not really as big as Billy Crystal's. <br /> <br /> The award ceremony was also quite stupid at times. It was funny not to let everyone get on stage, but also to award some of the awards in the middle of the theater. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I can not remember being happier with the winners. None of the films has really carried away the prices, as has always been the case in recent years. Does that mean that it was a good year for films with many competitors? I do not think so, most movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years, with the exception of "Million Dollar Baby" and "The Passion of Christ" maybe. Certainly, I do not agree with every single award that was presented this year. For example, Caleb Deschanel would have won for the best camera, not that I do not like the work of Robert Richardson, he has done amazing work for most of Oliver Stone, but I really feel that Deschanel has earned the award much more , I would also have liked to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell for Best Editing and John Debney for Best Music. But of course, the Academy Awards can not please everyone, I understand that. There will always be people complaining about the winners. <br /> <br /> It was also funny to see that most of the winners were much more nervous than the nominees and winners. Did Prince mention any name of the nominees? And was Sean Penn's sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they missed you" Irons were the best presenters of the night. All in all, a very memorable show, but with good winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
