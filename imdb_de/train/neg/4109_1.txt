Can only be described as terrible. In the beginning it is bad and gets worse. When you start, you really have to see through it because it's impossible to believe it can get any worse - but do not worry because it does. Another poorly written screenplay for a donkey director for young talents of former movie stars. It's hard to decide if the script is worse than the drama or if the director is worse than both. As for the hero - well, he's robbing everyone, including a scene where he beats the living daylight out of everyday life by opening the closet door and slamming it against the window. And in another scene he is thrown through a window and falls 20 feet on concrete - does not even blink - then gets up immediately and remains stuck in the evil. This is a really ridiculous movie. Fortunately, it only cost me $ 1 to rent.
