This movie should take place in and around Seattle. Why is the Porteau Cove Park P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L displayed? Provincial parks are located in CANADA and not in the United States. The Inspector uses a Palm Pilot with pen to "read" that someone has hacked into the bridal shop's computer. I did not know that this was possible with a database storage device. A woman appears in the movie without introduction and is never presented. We find out halfway through the movie that this woman works in the prosecutor's office. In the PRCEDES prison, Jenks actually opens a door and keeps the offender's back !! This would NEVER happen in a true correction setting. The director has really screwed up - that does not happen in real life. The action is appropriate. The plot is good. The cinematography is good. However, the many mistakes in continuity lead to 3 out of 10 votes.
