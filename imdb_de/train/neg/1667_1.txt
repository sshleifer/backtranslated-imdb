I really liked this movie until the end. Sure, it was cheesy and unlikely, but it still caught my attention on a rainy afternoon. Until the end. What is the main character doing for her graduation from the prestigious Classical Conservatory, where she has difficulty catching up with the other classically trained students? Wow they with their understanding and execution of this at that time honored musical tradition? No. She torments and slaughters Carmen's great sensual habanera and turns it into a completely forgotten Brittany Spears wannabe pop song. My ears were bleeding! And in the highest moment of terror, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher who is not in a Spears-induced fantasy would have denied it immediately. Save time, save your ears - skip this movie!
