This is a terrible movie, and no scene has an ounce of truthful emotion. The characters are not reflected, obviously drawn, predictable and the plot is obvious and the fulfillment of a typical Hollywood desire. William Holden (so sad to see him in that role) was 55 when this movie was shot, but He plays someone in his early 40s and looks like he's in his 60s. Kay Lenz was 20 and had a script to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection. Holden's character - as old as Clint Eastwood when he filmed (not by chance) this film - is placed in front of the hippie cool with obvious 60s traps: the bachelor block, the haunting hi-fi system, lunch in Yamashiro. But the film is ridiculously uncool, a clapping gossip of old Fogies desperately wanting the free spirits they saw on Sunset and in Laurel Canyon to find her and her big Honkin cars sexy. Ugh. Youth culture has never been so desperate. And I shudder at the thought that Bill Holden was so desperate for youth that he took on this embarrassing role.
