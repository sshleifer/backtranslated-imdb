*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story sounds good and if you've read the novel you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that can provide insights into interesting and under-researched human relationships. <Br /> <br /> The script tries to do that, the director tries that, but the lead actor fails. Maria's drama is so dry that she lacks feeling, her most intense moments seem almost funny. Sometimes she seems to be nervous about the camera. Her only real emotional scene is at the end where she is dumped by her friend. Ioana looks even tighter than Maria and worse, she does not look natural at all. Maria had the attitude, even though she was artificially pushed towards the obvious, but she had it and her character got some credibility. And worse, we have no insight into her: where does she come from, how did she get involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship develop? We only get a few pieces from their parents and their relationship only seems to be there: it has a content and an end, but no beginning. Just like her partner Maria, she only once has a scene that really touches her, the scene where she dumps Maria's character Kiki. <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this movie (aside from the landlady who is doing great there) who manages to prove acting talent. He has the attitude of his character and it suits him. Only once or twice does he seem to waver (the scene when eating his parents, he tries to be obvious if it was not necessary at all). <br /> <br /> I love the story, Tudor Chirila is alright The landlady is indeed acting and Puya is delivering his two lines in style, but that does not save the movie. Too bad, the whole setting had a huge potential and the Romanian cinematography could have used a film on this topic. Strangely enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than background no-feel (well, Maria's interludes are a nice attempt in that direction) Lesbian relationship between Maria and Ioana. I am very sorry that I spent money on a ticket, I would rather have seen it from my comfortable room.
