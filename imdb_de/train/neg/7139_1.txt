Redline is a drop of Fast & Furious, without the redeeming qualities. It does not have to be a complicated plot with multiple turns and surprises, but it needs something! This is the equivalent of a pornographic film in which the plot and the dialogue are 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. Only this is worse because you will not get your money's worth. Incredibly boring, impossible race sequences and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars, which get almost negative points for the appearance in this film. Sure, she's hot, but who is so desperate for a woman on the screen? I feel like the director was sitting with a hat full of dialogue and action clippings shaking an 8-ball every time he changed scenes. No serious person racing or knowing anything about this would watch this movie and enjoy the racing scenes.
