Was there a single positive effect for this movie? Critics who did not know about video games could see the mistakes of the game. No damage, where the damage was clearly visible at the beginning. This is a prime example. <br /> <br /> And I may have missed something, but was Super Mario Bros. 3 not a game that had never played? Well, if that's the case and I did not miss anything ... how did Fred Savage's character and even the girl know so much about the game? We talk about things that some people do not know about playing the second or third game. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact and game mistakes, there is the generally poor quality of the movie. Nothing here is frankly very memorable. The boy was not even that good at playing video games in the material shown. Many of the children I knew back then were much more experienced. Moreover, acting and acting at their strongest points are only mediocre. The characters are boring and completely uninteresting. The 'Wizard' (the youngest child) is a very quiet, completely dry childish clich√© of a small child who almost never speaks because of a trauma. It's not that this is unrealistic, it's the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to even develop a conspiracy that would even exceed 30 minutes. Honestly, the only value Here is a nostalgic nature to find. If you grew up with this movie, you'll like it, whether it was good or not. It was about kids playing video games, and by the time you saw it, you were probably also obsessed with the NES. But if you did not love it as a child, there's just nothing that interests you, and very little that will prevent you from turning it off. <br /> <br /> No, sir, I did not like it.
