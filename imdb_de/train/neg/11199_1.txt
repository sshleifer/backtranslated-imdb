The turbulent pace of this movie makes us one of the shocks it might bring. There was no real tension. Most of the characters were bland. The brave Irish priest was as lame as the love interest. The interest is misleading. The girl she chose to convey the sensuality of the movie could be better. The central conflict of the main character was indissoluble. This movie is totally positive. It's like a boring exercise by someone who did not want to go to the gym that day, but did it anyway.
