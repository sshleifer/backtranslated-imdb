This movie has a very Broadway feel - the scenery, the acting, the noise - and that's all he has. Any "sense" of a Broadway without the bang. <br /> <br /> The movie is slow, the picture is incoherent, the singing jumps on you, so you are suddenly reminded that it's a musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointing: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Unbearable: Sinatra's fiancee - the pitch and accent of her voice were certainly unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Tolerable: Mr. "I remember the numbers on my dice" <br /> <br /> Delight: Brando's subtle singing (very biased!) <br /> <br /> Surprise: How much Jean Simmons looks like in her Havana scenes like Vivien Leigh. It is the bone structure! How would I have killed Miss Leigh in a role that challenges Brando again?
