"Washington Square" is a shallow, shabby adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. In fact, the novel is very good, but far from James' masterpieces. Moreover, his simple, uneventful story seems inappropriate to make a movie of it (though William Wyler's 1949 "The Heiress" was a beautiful version of the novel). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film reveals the spirit of this work of the great American writer. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, not very attractive and a little awkward, but nevertheless she is a healthy, intelligent young woman, and she is not as naive as it may seem. Her attachment to her father is dignified and respectful, with no morbid sides. In three quarters of the movie, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) seems to have been mentally retarded. In the last quarter she becomes suddenly (and unbelievably) intelligent and is aware of her dignity as a woman and all of that. <br /> <br /> The director Agnieszka Holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story. The first, when the nervous child Catherine has problems with her Vesica. The second scene, when we see in the background a kind of open-air brothel where prostitutes bring their customers behind tents and so on. Nothing could contradict the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is well known that even for the standards of the Victorian era the writer was extremely decent and reserved. I refuse anyone to find any rudeness anywhere on the thousands of pages of James's vast literary production. These two scenes have particularly annoyed me. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that a director needs some freedom in the screen adaptation of a novel. But when a director completely ignores or misunderstands the art of an author (here, Henry James), I see no point in making a bad movie with his work. <br /> <br /> Acting is appropriate for the film: poor and flat despite the talents of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely a not recommended movie.
