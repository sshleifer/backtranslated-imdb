I had a fascination for the cartoon when he was in college. It had the charm of "Get Smart". It had its mistakes, but it was pretty enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Of course I was very interested in the movie version. That was before I saw it. After the words, I wished it had never been done. <br /> <br /> Besides being around (who on earth, even though Broderick was even close to the role?), it just did not deserve the mark. The effects were reasonable and maybe the only thing I liked the movie; Watch a live action version of the gadgets in action! What was missing was a story and a treatment that made it funny or charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was a crazy cartoon with a very carefree attitude. It was fun. The movie became bleak and took itself far too seriously. If it had seriously taken a great action or gone crazy enough to make it appear like a "cartoon in the movie", it might have been pleasing the "gadget heir".
