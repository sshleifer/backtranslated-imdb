I saw this video with a friend. I'm glad I did not waste any money on it. The video cover shows a scene from the 1975 film Capricorn One. The film begins with several clips of rocket bursts, most of which are not related to the manned flight. Sibrel's Smoking Weapon is a short video clip of astronauts preparing a video broadcast. He edited in his own voice instead of hearing what the crew had to say. The video ends curiously with a screening of the Zapruder movie. His claims regarding radiation, shielding, star photography, and others make me believe that he is extremely ignorant or has some kind of ax against NASA, astronauts, or the Americans in general. His science is bad, and so is this video.
