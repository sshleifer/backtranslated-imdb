In his own way, Mr. Foe (originally and aptly titled Hallam Foe ?? I can not see how he calls his title "Mister") pays homage to good acting. Both Jamie Bell as Hallam, a physically attractive voyeur / creep, and Sophia Myles as Kate, his kinky partner in the field of sex and fantasy convince. The problem arises when you try to connect your roles to everything that happens in real life. A young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives as Hallam does is rightfully beaten to pulp. And a woman in Kate's situation would be repelled and scared - she would probably call the police. <br /> <br /> However, these things are not what happens in the movie. The poor mother of Hallam has died and his father has married a woman with whom he had an affair. Hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and lets it know. She has sex with him. Kate is a type of employee who uses Hallam for dishwashing and playing sexual games. She looks like his mother. Everything ends happily when Hallam "solves" his "problems". <br /> <br /> A few years ago, the movie "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" had an equally optimistic ending. The characters became wiser and better after they broke up. The problem is that it does not always work that way, especially if nobody really cares. In Virginia Woolf, the end is plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation. In Mr. Foe, the emotional revelation never really happens.
