This was undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only thing that's interesting in this movie is the cameo appearances of some great genre directors and King himself. The movie has a great premise, but falls apart in about 15 minutes. I really liked Madam Amick in this movie and thought she could have a very good career in the movie.
