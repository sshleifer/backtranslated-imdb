I'll say that at least the movie makes sense, but it's bad. Acting is usually not good (I think only Sky has made a promise) and you feel awkward to see it. All the scenes that make sense are really flat, as if Ng comes to her parents. There are many crazy details, like the Kanji tattoo on the shoulder of the Sky, the fridge magnets of the girls and the awful decor on the sets ... and the music ... and the clothes ... and everything. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says at some point "I'm gay, not stupid." Even unintentional Even the commentary is awful, I turned it off after Ng said she was weird when she was playing a lesbian.
