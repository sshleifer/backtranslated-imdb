Luckily I did not pay to watch this movie. I can not tell any spoilers because I volunteered after forty minutes of the movie. It was so bad. I once laughed when the Yahoo! Billboard fell on the guy and the title song came up. But that was only because I thought it was funny, but then I realized that it was another OTHER product placement. <br /> <br /> I loved the cartoon. I almost religiously saw it. (Although I missed the last episode, I heard they were showing Dr. Claw, and it was nothing but a claw, someone commented on the show page.) The cartoon had Penny and Brain much more than the movie. I hated building the whole thing, which reminds me of Robocop. Then broderick Broderick with the whole feeling of Inspector Gadget. He is not nearly as awkward as the cartoon. Another fact is that his gadgets actually work to the point I saw, apart from the oil spill. He also mixed with the sound of "Wowsers," which was in an excited tone. I was so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly. Everyone else felt that way too. Our 14- to 17-year-olds remember the cartoon lovingly, and we loved every minute. <br /> <br /> I went into the movie with an open mind and knew they messed up with the cartoon. I was surprised how reserved the film was. It relied on visual gags and stupid dialogue for humor. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to promote a children's movie. Product placement is pointless in this movie, and that shows. The wise cracking car can not crack so well. The gadgets look good, but were almost overly shiny. The cartoon looked better. The stupid scenes were crap. In the 40-45 minutes I saw the movie, not a single laugh was heard, and they laughed at the Dudley Do-Right Preview. This movie should not be seen by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment. I highly recommend "The Iron Giant" which was sad but very, very good. This film is a travesty for the entire family drama. ------------- 1
