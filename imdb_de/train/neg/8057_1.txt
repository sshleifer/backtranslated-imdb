What's up with this movie? Many, many things. The editing tries too well to look good and confuses the viewer, while at the same time receiving a severe headache. The storyline is confused and obviously prolonged by what began as a short film (story or film). The plot only makes a good story of less than ten minutes, and this is only painfully stretched until it reaches the minimum length for a feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They are getting thinner. In the end, the plot is so thin that you might even miss it if you're not careful, which is hard when you watch this movie. Acting is not even slightly impressive. The characters are poorly written and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things about this movie is that the one responsible for the film music / soundtrack did not seem to have any idea what the movie was about or what it should be (not that I did blame, I could not do it, not find out either). Therefore, half the music in the movie does not match the scenes. What about all the sexual undertones between Eliza Dushku and the main character? It was natural to attract young men, but it was just so cheap. And did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the movie? At every imaginable level? Ever? The two creepy guys did not seem to have anything to do with the movie, they were just there to have some chase scenes. I doubt anyone would really enjoy a movie that was put together so poorly, and such a shameless and horrible Hollywood-like attempt at a slightly interesting idea. But I digress. I recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who do not care about a really horrific horror thriller as long as there's sex and gore in it (though this may only apply to the killer cut I've seen). 1.10
