Impressive. I do not think I've ever seen a movie with so many great actors playing such a central role. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the only worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind Edison. His drama was PAINFUL. The story was all right and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine, with many small pieces to cut his teeth. As the director and the film company found out that Timberlake was ready for this role, there is no way to understand that. <br /> <br /> His character ruins the whole experience, because every time he appears on the screen, you're actually looking for the corrupt cops to cover his sad ass, and he's supposed to be the hero ... Me would not waste money on it in the theater or on video. Maybe if you have HBO and nothing else to do on a Saturday night at 2am and you are drunk and stoned, this may be okay. Seeing Timberlake in this role was like watching a human Kermit The frog act in a Hollywood blockbuster just did not work.
