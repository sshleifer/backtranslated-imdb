There were some funny movies about liquor from Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel in "The Bishop's Wife" (1947). The best of course were the topper films in the late 30s / early 40s. And more recently Warren Beatty's "Heaven Can Wait" (1978), a remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" (1941). They were well-written, funny, entertaining comedies about supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels. Now comes author and director Jeff Lowell, who makes his feature film debut with an unusual story. Young Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who is killed on her wedding day, then comes back to harass the young spiritualist Ashley (Lake Bell). which falls in love with Kate's fianc√©e Henry (Paul Rudd). One thing is clear at the beginning: Longoria Parker is not Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two "Topper" films), which is the standard against which all female ghosts are measured. <br /> <br /> There is a line at the beginning when Henry's sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) says to Henry, "You are not smiling." This has aptly described my situation in this film. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the movie is that the script is just not funny. But the presence of Longoria Parker always made me worse when she appeared on the screen. To begin with and add to her lack of comedic talent, she's covered in so much pancake makeup, who knows what she really looks like? Kate is killed by a falling, frozen statue in preparation for her wedding. She is so unreasonable that the angel who informs her about her life after death goes out to her (well, she is just disappearing), so Kate is on Earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is. <br /> <br /> Chloe wants Henry to pull himself out of the funk he naturally got into after Kate's death (from what I saw of Kate, he should have felt a wonderful relief). I do not know what she's doing as a spiritualist (she's also a caterer to make ends meet) to see if she can bring Henry back into contact with Kate. There are a lot of meshugaas going on. <br /> <br /> The film's emptiness is typified by a "B" story revolving around Ashley's assistant Dan (Jason Biggs). This almost ends up being thrown in, but the way Ashley handles it shows she's as brutal as Kate. Since Dan seems to be attracted to these two very flawed women, he deserves what he gets. <br /> <br /> Kate appears Ashley and the fun should begin. It does not and more is a pity, because in other hands that could have been pretty funny. So Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray and Co. have to turn around in their graves to see what their brilliance in the first two "Topper" movies is all about.
