I'm a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. Charles Butterworth (a very entertaining supporting actor) was in this film. Why did not I like it? Well, despite a good cast, this is one of the worst-written and most stereotypical "pictures" I've ever seen. Given the talent and money spent on this film, it is shocking how slippery the writing was. I knew the film would get boring if I kept predicting what was going to happen next in the movie - and I was always right! And that's not because I'm a kind of "movie-savvy" but because there's almost no imagination or effort in it. It almost seemed like the movie was just a long series of clich√©s, all strung together! I also found it a bit irritating that Fred Carole treated so badly throughout the movie, and yet she came running to him consistently. Uggh! There's even more excitement in a Lassie movie ("is it getting people to save Timmy, or is the rope he's dangling from the break?") A few positive things about the movie. It was pretty cool to see Fred look like a broken cloth at the end of the movie - it was pretty believable and he looked like he had not eaten, shaved or slept in days. Also Charles Butterworth's "rattle" provided for a few mild moments. But that was not enough to make this film look different from a "B-movie". Too bad it could have been so much better.
