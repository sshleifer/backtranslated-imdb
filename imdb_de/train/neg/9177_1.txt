The House of the Dead was the worst movie I've ever seen, between the wretched 360-angle camera shots and the cheesy acting that I fell asleep. I do not think the director and the set manager could decide whether it rains or not because it would rain on one side of the boat and not on the other. I would rate this movie 1 out of 10 (10 is the best, 1 the worst). Jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, and one wonders if they'll make up for the lost time. I ask anyone who reads this, NOT to see it. It is not worth the time.
