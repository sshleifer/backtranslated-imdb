How do I start? This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. He has no redeemable qualities. I just sat down through the movie and it was a fight that everyone would distribute this horrible movie. I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at disgusting humor. The only thing that was worth something in this movie was the soundtrack. I'm pretty sure I really wanted to see this movie wasted with that piece of crap. I will leave you with this warning. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, IT SUCKS.
