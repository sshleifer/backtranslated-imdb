This movie does not even deserve one. That was a waste of time. It was a waste of film and money. It was not offensive, but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spoiler should be read by everyone in my opinion. There is full frontal nudity and disgusting language. But not only that, there is NO plot, the actors are awful, the accents are terrible, the actors are little time and I was even EXPECTED to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I hired him was Brian van Holt (who, by the way, had only fifteen seconds). I think that this could have been a mistake in the directors and editors, but they repeated the same sections two or three times and added only one new sentence to the extremely disturbing film. There is no plot line and it is not funny. Although not trying to be funny. DO NOT LOOK AT A FILM.
