Slaughter High is in itself the emblematic 80s Slasher movie. A prank goes out of hand, a geeky guy is terribly burned. A few years later, the geeky guy returns and kills the people who hurt him. Now the story may sound intriguing and entertaining, but what sets this terrible movie apart from the other 80s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless errors and consequential errors. <br /> <br /> but not as bad as you would expect. However, it does not help that every character in the movie is so scary and unlikely. The main character, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro), is the slightest tormentor of all and she is the one for whom we are supposed to share compassion and root. Not to mention that the geeky guy is almost too geeky, and I think even stereotypical geeks themselves will be crazy and downright angry about how geeky he should be. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of unwanted laugh potential. Munro's lack of acting talent is obvious, bringing her to the same level as the rest of the terrible cast. However, the easiest way to amuse is when the movie Munro, in its mid-30s, poses badly as a teenager among a group of teenagers. And when it comes to a later life and Munro plays at her age, the rest of the cast does not go through as adults. All this goes well with a theme song that is a funny pose of heavy metal thrash, accompanied by maniacal laughter and a shrill voice: "I'll get you." Apart from that, Slaughter High is not a really good Slasher movie, but it has a poor entertainment value. Hardcore slasher fans may be a must, but do not expect any dilemma, tension or credibility. Dreadful!!!
