This movie is great, mind you - but just like it tells a very bad story. Stella is so terribly rude and never learns better. Her husband is unbelievably snobby and petulant. Nobody learns better. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her colorful manners and clothes, but can not understand that she just has to weaken everything? I do not think Stella is a GOOD woman and a very good mother. Giving up for your daughter to be associated with a bunch of bigotized snobs is disgusting. Much of what we see had been normal for that time - people who drink a beer or two, play a piano, dance - but it's considered a kind of moral inferiority. "I can not let our child live that way!" Spare me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: the unwashed working class can never aspire to the height of the upper class. And that's just a load of Hogwash.
