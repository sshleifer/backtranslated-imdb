I have to admit, I do not remember much of the characters or the story, although I'm not sure if there was one, I was so confused by the movie that it was hard for me to focus on it. How do you call a movie "Keys to Tulsa" and then film in Texas? The flat desert land around Arlington (I think that was the place) does not resemble the green hills around Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in, Tulsa or else they would notice that there was nothing in it Movie ever looked like this. Had nobody at least seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know that sounds picky, but I can not help it. I looked at it because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two fascinating actors could not liven up this meandering story, meaning the story of self-inclusive people who are NOT IN TULSA !! I'm sorry, it can not be more expensive to film in Oklahoma. What if "Living and dying in Toronto" was filmed in Toronto? Would that suck? Well, it does.
