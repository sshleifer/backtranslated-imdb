All I have to do is just in case somebody actually reads this and has not fully understood the point yet. These other reviewers are not kidding, this is really the worst color movie you'll ever see. When the movie started, I could not believe that such a thing was actually becoming visible to the world. <br /> <br /> They do not just say it when they say it looks like a home movie. It really does. Like the "director," the family hi8 camcorder (in front of DV cameras and non-linear editing through the computer) did not record any other equipment (lights, sound equipment, etc.), grabbed a few decent-looking drama students, and went out to watch a movie rotate. No script, only the refurbishment as he went on. <br /> <br /> When I looked at it, it was on my mono TV, so I only have one audio channel (to the left of the right speaker). At first I thought I had connected it wrong. The movie was silent until someone talked for a few minutes. I got up and switched to the other channel, and suddenly I heard music and sound effects but could not hear the dialogue. They recorded the sound on various bloody channels! I mean, there are films that can be funny, so bad that they are good. I'm not sure if that's one of them. I mean, I admit, I'm a little budding filmmaker. And when you see bad movies, you just want to go out and PROVE can be better, you know. But when I look at it, I'm just sorry for who did it. <br /> <br /> As bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing. I found the chick hot and was disappointed with the shortness of her bathing scene. A bit of T and A from her would have increased the score from nothing to maybe 3 or 4. But unfortunately not. If you want to make a movie, but it's crap, do some unnecessary nudity. Worked for Roger Corman.
