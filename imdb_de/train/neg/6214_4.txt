What?!?? Why do people say this is "amazing"? The end is one of the worst ends in the history of cinematography! 4 left and the whole world is over! Not to mention that character 9 was an idiot while he killed everyone. I was right all along, if he had sacrificed 9, none of this would have happened. People who live there, for a stupid thing and for what? I admit, the movie had its parts, and the whole concept was intriguing. But many of them were stereotypes after another. And did someone else feel that this is very similar to Lord of the Rings? Characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no character development, and honestly wonder if it's good to have only four guys left in the world. it is meaningless and stupid. It was one of the shortest movies I have ever seen, and thank god! How do robots turn against people in any way? It was made like a hundred times! This movie is really stupid. Watch a movie worth watching, such as Star Trek, The Hangover, or Inglorious Basterds. These were good movies!
