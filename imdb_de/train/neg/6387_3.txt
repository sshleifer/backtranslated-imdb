When I first recorded this film, I was intrigued by the basic idea and desperately wanted to see what would happen. I'm an animation fan and I love it when it's successfully merged with live action footage. However, the animation in this movie was all that I enjoyed. It must be said, however, that the performances of the actors were outstanding. The visual look - including the animation - gives the piece a wonderfully disturbing impression. However, this was the quality of the discomfort between the overdrawn images, both visually and in the script, that practically knocked you over the head. The most annoying thing was the relative lack of importance for the conspiracy. It appeared that the action was irregularly horned, causing a stuttering effect that severely affected the flow of the piece. The voice-offs of Felisberto - especially those at the end - felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping gaps in the storyline that had been ignored in favor of side issues like the whole ant thing (and even that was not properly addressed) , I'm afraid the whole thing was, at best, a "reasonable first attempt" by a teenager who read far too much DH Lawrence. Not what one expects from experienced filmmakers.
