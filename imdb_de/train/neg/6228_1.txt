This movie is incomprehensibly bad. It starts with several random explosions and then cuts to a sock puppet of a T-Rex talking to the audience (!). It goes back and forth between sock puppet and animation, probably because the filmmakers could not afford live actors. I'll spare you the long, tiring, inexorable plot that pulls this pathetic movie for a brutal 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found this very rare video somewhere in a hobby shop where he sells B-movies, and he just bought it to make fun of it, but our intervention was how it turned out not necessary. This movie makes fun of itself as we could. <br /> <br /> I thought Ed Wood's "Plan 9 from Outer Space" was the cheesiest movie ever, but let Japanamation / Lego cars / Sock dolls outdo it. If you see this movie everywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and worth many, many good laughs.
