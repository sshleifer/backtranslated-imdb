For Daniel Auteuil, 'Queen Margot' was much better. For Nastassja Kinski "Paris, Texas" was much better. The biggest disappointments were Chris Menges ("CrissCross" and "A World Apart" can not even compare with this) and Goran Bregovic for using a version of the same musical theme of "Queen Margot" for this film (Attention to the end of the Films). If it's an American pop movie, I would not be surprised. But for a European film with more independent actors and directors, a similar approach to child abuse without original insight is very simple and disappointing. There are these bad guys kidnapping and selling the underage people. There are these poor children who hate the people who sell them, waiting to be saved by someone. And finally, there's this great hero who kills all the bad guys and saves those poor kids from bad guys. Each character is represented in simple black and white terms: the good against the evil. In addition, from the beginning I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? I believe that the difficult issue of child abuse and pedophilia is much more complex than it is presented in this not very original film. I think this movie was not annoying, but very disappointing.
