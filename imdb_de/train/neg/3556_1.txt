You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes is running in a movie at half speed rather than full throttle, and "The Incubus" is a terrible scenario in which a great actor goes through the motions to pay the bills. If you look at the hammering scripts and John Hough's art 'Baroque' you can hardly blame him. The film has something to do with a series of rape murders in a small town into which much supernatural Hokum has been mixed. Somehow the director manages to draw tension and interest from each scene, and Cassavetes seems to be visibly PO. sometimes. The Incubus himself, who appears only in the last scene, is a successful creation, but it is not worth to wait. <br /> <br /> 1/10
