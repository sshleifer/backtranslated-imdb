This is the biggest amount of crap I've seen in a long time. Last time I hated a movie so much when I saw "28 days later" and "Magnolia". There's absolutely no point in watching this movie except for seeing some really sick and twisted sex / rape scenes, Gillian Anderson relieving himself at the roadside, and every single sentence of a dialogue needs to at least use the word "F" a couple of times. It has extremely cheap trade and is very cheap. My friend and I turned off the movie after about half an hour. We tried to give him a chance, but nothing could save this guy. DO NOT WATCH IT !!!
