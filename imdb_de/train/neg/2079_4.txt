I'm a big fan of Ivan Reitman - I loved evolution and who did not like Ghostbusters? From the trailer you already know that Uma's character is being unloaded by Luke. The build-up is obvious the moment she unleashes her superpowers. But the profit is just not there. The Shark-throwing made a (slight) giggle, but again everything was in the trailer. No one breathes, just like Uma and Luke are Owen's diet on his good days. If you did not sit for Riann Wilson, you would sit there with a stuffy smile until his cheeks cramp. This is a comedy, right? <br /> <br /> It's not terrible - it just sits like a stale cracker behind the fridge. This could have been such a brilliant show of superhero films and feminism, but fails on both counts. Let's see if Jason Reitman can save the family name.
