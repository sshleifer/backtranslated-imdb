I missed the beginning, but I saw most of it. A friend got it on DVD in the cheap room on FYE. <br /> <br /> The skits are all very short and yet most are still too long. The majority of them seems to have forgotten to have something funny! Quite a lot of racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor in it, stereotyped skits or skits that use racist terms for people and I'm having problems ... The logo for the Tunnel Vision Network is a lipstick-mouth with an eyeball. The mouth opens and closes like the eyelids over the eye. Somehow scary. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Most actors did better things, and it's lucky that this bomb did not hold them back.
