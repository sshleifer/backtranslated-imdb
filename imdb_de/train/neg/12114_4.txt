The strangers who live in a city go after their lives. There's the guy a guy who licks everything, a dumpster that finds a body to take home, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a guy, the girl of her bad kind In extreme cases, this black and white film setting is better without the color. The monochrome lifts the two steps away from the home movie feeling. Like in a Troma movie, this movie is fun and makes a start, but it's usually strange for strange reasons and will soon become a tumbling hole as you see the setups. You can imagine where to go - not always - but enough so it's not fun (though I did not see the cleaning coming). It's worth it if you see nothing else and wait until the next Golden Girls come from Netflix.
