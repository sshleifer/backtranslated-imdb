Nothing could have saved this movie, not even Superman. Ten years ago, the special effects would have been amazing. Better governance might have given the actors more emotion and better performances. But nothing more than feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it. Plot holes, bad lines, terrible tempo, endless repetition of the same CGI dragon stomping through the corridors ... ugh
