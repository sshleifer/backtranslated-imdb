A good cast is horribly wasted in this slower than molasses and randomly amorous comedy. Peter Ustinov is keen to bring something to life, but the result is a grumpy bore that lacks any real beats that might have made him observable. Despite the favorable comments, this movie is awful. Badly dealt Badly processed Badly traded Badly written. You have to sit through a hundred films to counter such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The muddled and treacherously treacherous plan concerns Ustinov, who interferes in an American insurance company to hack her computer and underestimate millions of pounds. How he does that is beyond lameness and credibility (he learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets and getting computer researcher Robert Morley to go to South America and stealing his identity) subplot spoiled Ustinov his comrade Maggie Smith who happens to become his secretary after getting an apartment in her building. In the end, she shares scenes of sexual undertone with Bob Newhart, who go nowhere, while Ustinov grafts the money bit by bit, trying to stay one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he marries Smith and they fly to Brazil, which is the final of the finals since almost every British caprice comedy (Nuns on the Run? A Fish Called Wanda?). <br/> is more ridiculous than anything that came before. In the end, I thought I really needed to be off my rocker to stand around like this. Even a Cameo Romero cameo did not help. One of the listless, badly played "comedies" I've ever seen, and certainly the worst caper. Do not waste your time. If you love that, you have to watch better movies.
