I am the wife of a youth pastor and we took some teenagers to watch this movie. We then spent an hour trying to explain it to them. They did not understand it and I did not enjoy it. It is based on a concept that has gone through all three major religions of the world (Bible Code, Torah Codex and Qur'an) and is so questionable that it is ridiculous. For Christians in the arts, this is not progress, for those who believe that we are testing our brains at the door.
