Woody Allen did "September" proving that even a genius can mess up. This is Mel Brooks "September". Monumentally stupid, boring and listless, I must confess that I did not see it to the end. The strip is one of the few that does not apologize (eg "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill"), which either made me sleep or forced me to "rewind" - Button to grab. And I say that sadly as an avid Mel Brooks fan. He should stick to the pure comedy and leave the social commentary alone. It's unclear to me how the same guy who did "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" was able to pull out such a dog. To avoid at all costs.
