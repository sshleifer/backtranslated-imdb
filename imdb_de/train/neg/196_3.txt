This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before him, he portrays more of the mythology of the Alamo than of history. The production is poor and gives the overall impression of a social project for many actors who otherwise had to work on Hollywood Squares. This has been the biggest mistake for me - I know the age and generalities of the real Alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of TV actors selected to portray them, and never give any impression of credibility, Texans, I am grew up with mythology. I learned more about the story later. I can accept acceptable production from both perspectives (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me the chance to enjoy it. Even the versions of John Wayne or Fess Parker had more lives than this dull chaos, but were just a little less accurate. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing - avoid it.
