The curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately I did not rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this movie is that it is not that disturbing. For reasons known only to them, the creators of this film wanted to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? The man gave the term "finger licking good" a new meaning! And with all the flashbacks and flash forwards, I had trouble following the story. All in all, Jeremy Renner's performance was not so bad. You can find him in "S.W.A.T." catch in which he plays an angry ex-policeman. Anyway, I would rate this as 1/10. She only got a 1 because of Renners so quiet performance. There are many books and TV documentaries that better expose Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this.
