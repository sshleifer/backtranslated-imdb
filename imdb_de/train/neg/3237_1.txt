Not that I rejoice at the sight of realistic bloodshed, but when I put a DVD in anticipation of a bloodbath, and what I get, is a bloody scene (the eyeball) at the tail end of asinine fake beating and turning As a desk chair I am thinking End "Well, that's 43 minutes of my life gone forever." I would not consider this or "Flower of Flesh and Blood" movies so much as a volitional exercise; to see if you can sit through them. Flower of flesh and blood had some tough spots to see. The devil's experiment did not do it. It was stupid at best and at worst ... really ... really stupid. Maybe my expectation was too high. I put the DVD thinking, "Oh man, that's gonna get sick." After seeing them about a thousand times how they faked the girl, I saw it in the fast-forward. <br /> <br /> Two types of people would be interested in this movie. 1) People looking for F-up movies just to see how F-up it really is, or 2) Horror completely. I searched for this and the other Guinea Pig movies for the latter reason, but even if I fell into the category of the former, this movie would not let my boat swim. In fact, I would imagine that this film increases the bloodlust ... as in "WOULD YOU KILL THE B * TCH ALREADY !!" In conclusion, the only reason for owning this film is the collection. If you want a slaughter that traditional horror does not offer, get yourself to death traces. Sure, that's shit, but at least you get the blood and courage you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see for someone who has praised this crap is because he feels he should. No artistic merit that I can understand, no reason for his fame, no nothing. Just a lame attempt to be shocking.
