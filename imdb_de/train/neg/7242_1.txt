The Pallbearer is a disappointment and sometimes extremely boring with a love story that sometimes does not work when Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie) works. Gwyneth Paltrow walks around the movie with a puzzled look on his face and it's hard to say what David Schwimmer even sees in her. <br /> <br /> However, The Pallbearer is sometimes especially funny, especially in the church scene and group scenes. His friends are having a laugh, but that's basically it. Just look at The Pallbearer for these scenes and do the rest. Trust me that you do not miss much.
