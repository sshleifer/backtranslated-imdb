**** SPOILER WARNING **** <br /> <br /> Absolutely one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. It is absolutely impossible to take this seriously. It would take a great novel to perform all the comedy routines. In the glory days of their program, Carol Burnett and his company, which often took movies, impaled this film in a way that was hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny, who suddenly became sick with a slight cough, and immediately the melancholy music came to light, and everyone looked around and wondered where she was from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with flowing curls and almost watched Ryan O'Neal. The only funnier thing than this is the real movie. <br /> <br /> What a death scene in the end. Jenny really looks like she's going to die ... she'd die for her make-up artist to come in and give her some color. And of course we all know how often hospitals make a loved one go to bed with them during the patient's last moments. The closing scene, in which Ryan O'Neal sits on a bench in the snow and thinks about his future in the movie business, is immediately a classic. He had much to fear. He never recovered from it.
