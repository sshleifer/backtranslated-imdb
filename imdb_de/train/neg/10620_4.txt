Despite some exciting (and daring) sequences, NBTN will never get off the ground. There are exploding boats, Hutstiftmorde, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts and all sorts of classic mystery / horror scenes, but with prolonged exposure phases are pervaded. Everyone in the movie looks bored. This is a shame as many of the sequences are considered daring at the time this was filmed. <br /> <br /> Add the "too proper" Brit characters and you feel like you've gotten yourself into a Sherlock Holmes movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinematography is very common. There are plenty of opportunities for beautiful scenery shots or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge campfire, but the whole thing is uninspired and boring. <br /> <br /> Definitely for Lee and Cushing fans only.
