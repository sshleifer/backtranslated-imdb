This film is a jumbled mish-mash of clich√©s from the last movie. There are some promising ideas, but while the director clearly aimed to cope with a hauntingly ambiguous film, it ended in a confusing mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job, but without a central theme, it seems he has not much to do. In addition, the movie is largely free of fear (though, fair enough, there are some weird moments in the midst of drudgery). <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, devilish librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by wild monkeys, Oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality and connections of criminal gangs. The only real commonality of these elements seems to be that the protagonist expresses a vague sense of confusion and dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this movie is that despite the death of the brother by monkeys that are heavily featured on the DVD cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead, director Julian Lee apparently uses stock footage of monkeys - not very scary. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Avoid this. In the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) you will find an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror story.
