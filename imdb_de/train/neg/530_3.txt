I saw this in a preview two days before the official opening and I have to say that I was extremely disappointed. I have to use the majority of these problems in the decision to occupy Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what you think about Danes, she either failed terribly, or she is so far beyond her head that she should be the early favorite for the Razzie 2007 of Worst Actress. I think we should sympathize with her. Instead, she is completely unlikely. The other "great" actresses do a good job, but by no means illuminate the screen. Among the "big" actresses in this movie I would say that Natasha Richardson did the best job. Streep is barely in the picture and only appears shortly before the end. <br /> <br /> Horrible script. It is more important that they read lines than really be in their character.
