Daniella has some problems under her attractive appearance. She begins to lose her mind when she learns of a distant relative (whom she resembles) who was burned as a werewolf. She gets a bit wild when she pearls horny men and pierces her throat. At some point she finds a man who restrains her inner beast, but when others ruin her bliss, she takes off her violent and furry revenge. <br /> <br /> 'Werewolf Woman' is not a very elaborate movie, but it does make such a good crowd movie. A fun time could be achieved by harping the bad acting / synchronization / translation and the sheer cheesiness of the production. But by itself it moves slowly, but has enough nudity to keep you awake.
