You know what movie you're in right now when the main character of the serial killer is being transported to an electric chair (in a seemingly bakery truck) just to make the jail vehicle collide (and I do not do that) up this one ) a genetic tanker. The Goo that sticks out melts it and fuses its DNA with the snow, creating our protagonist, the killer snowman. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie, however, is a shot over the shoulder. The snowman beats up a poor guy in whom his hands look suspicious like a pair of white oven mitts. <br /> <br /> Mmmmm, shut up ...
