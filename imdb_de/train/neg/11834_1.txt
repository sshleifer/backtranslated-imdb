Let's just say it in simple words, so that the creators of this film have a chance to understand this: this is a very stupid movie with a dumb script, lame animations, and a story as original as thumbnacks. Do not bother - unless you need to find a way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children. They could laugh, especially if they no longer have any medicines. There is such an insult in a movie that is so ridiculous - not just that the filmmakers seem to think that kids are mindless idiots who can be entertained with Claptrap, which costs about zero effort, but they do not even bother to break a sweat by inserting a gag here and there that an adult might enjoy. To be honest, this movie crossed me royally. Be ashamed because you are so bent down.
