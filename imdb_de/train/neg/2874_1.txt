This movie starts pretty cruelly with a woman who is tied up and psychologically tortured. There is male full nudity on the face, dead animal parts, dogs licking nipples, and the woman loses control of her bladder. Everything shot in a gray cold color. Effective, but a little too much. Then we look at the youth of the BTK killer as well as the present and its history of crime. The tension is completely psychological, and the scenes in which the killer enters and talks to the victims' homes takes a long time and is uncanny. Here we see no fancy or good pictures, it looks as if you were taken with your home camera. It does not look scary, but in a sense, it's rather unusual and frightening to see a criminal busy his victims for some time. What this movie does not have is really not a drama. Every now and then there are some scenes of the police, but there is no excitement if they find the killer. There is not much left to this story. This could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of insanity. Unfortunately, the film is filled with real slaughterhouse material. It is distributed throughout the film and keeps coming back. Sometimes you do not know it's coming and you do not have enough time to look away. And I have to reject that. I'm all for low-budget horror films, but I do not tolerate any animal suffering. It was unnecessary, exaggerated and comes without warning. I'm glad Lionsgate publishes stuff no one else does, but they should have passed this movie or cut out the animal blood. Stay away from this garbage.
