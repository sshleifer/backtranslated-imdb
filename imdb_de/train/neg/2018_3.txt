Do not get me wrong, this is a terrible, clich√©d movie, but it's a pleasure for fans of Olivia Hussey - probably the most intoxicating beauty ever shown on screen. A poster said it was unpleasant to look at her - I wonder what his ideal wife looks like - Paris Hil slut? Blockbuster really was supposed to establish a sub-genre for this kind of movie, as Fatal Attraction's plot has become its own genre. When will blockbuster take over the "Adultry" section? It'll work well with drama and action, right? This film revolves around Olivia Hussey, who spends a passionate night with an unstable yacht owner who may have murdered his ex-wife, who looks remarkably like Mrs. Hussey. This new life passes to Olivia and makes her life hell. I like Olivia Hussey, but I have no sympathy for characters in movies cheating on their spouse, so I did not really persuade Olivia to bring that stinker to life. <br /> <br /> VIOLINITY: $$ (There's a bit of violence in the movie.) Don Murray and Anthony John Denison get into a fight when Denison says he will not stop seeing Olivia, Murray's wife, because she's just too good in bed, Olivia also can handle a shooter and maybe make a round - I'll let you watch). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Olivia is the queen of short nudity and delivers a little here, she has a love scene with Anthony John Denison and also has a shower scene (filmed from afar). <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (We've seen this conspiracy before - a hundred times and often a lot better.) That's right. If you're trying to figure out why this movie was an idiot, William Riead is the man's dialogue is sophomoric and idiotic Man Has No Storytelling Skills and Can not Build Faith Human Reactions to the Act These upper-level people of society speak like middle school students - with a habit of sleeping while teaching English - I have Riead on the list of never-before-seen reps set.) <br /> <br /> RATING: $$$ (The acting was not "called", as the insiders say, but was hampered Very much about Riead's adolescent screenplay: O Livia Hussey calls Anthony Jonh Denison "crazy" and "crazy" in the face as he begins to pursue her. Hussey, who is still beautiful, delivers the best performance here, but Denison was on the same level as portraying a crazy, amorous stalker. Basically, Don Murray was just there - his character is not strong, and Edward Asner, a terrific actor, when given something of substance, is badly used in this movie.
