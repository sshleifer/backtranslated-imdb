Birthday Girl does not know what it wants to be - is it a comedy, is it a drama ... it just does not know. What could have been a very funny or moving movie ends up in no man's land. The premise is original enough to provide a script full of interesting scenarios, but it does not deliver much and ends up in the end. It's a shame to look at the cast - it's very solid all the time, but they have no chance to shine. Very disappointing.
