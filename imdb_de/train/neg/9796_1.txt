Okay, I can hardly imagine anything worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers must be GOT at the bottom of that list. Can you imagine anything more stupid than five to six teenagers (who are not even behaving like a normal teenager) dancing around in identical suits, WITH OTHER COLORS THAT YOU CAN SAY IT APART? Fans, have you ever met a real person who is thrown against a mental wall and gets up almost instantly and continues to fight without getting hurt? Power Rangers are for five year old boys, and believe me, I never liked the show myself when I was five years old. <br /> <br /> I think Dino Thunder is an exception. The teens actually behave like teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually behaves like a mentor or not a teacher. It has teenage humor, although the fighting is lame, I do not hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say Power Rangers are crap, but I would not. It would be an insult to crap. Well, five year old guys, Power Rangers is garbage.
