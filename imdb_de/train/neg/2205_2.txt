This type of plot has a lot of potential, but was slaughtered here. Honestly, at first I felt the cheese element, but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birth. Whoa, I was wrong! So the crazy scientist makes a monster, wants to brag about his old friends before he kills them, but of course they flee. After that it is really bad. I should have counted the times when the rubber gown sprang out from behind some leaves, but I would most likely have lost the count. <br /> <br /> Swing to the blood-soaked leg showing off a severed leg as the shark man finds the people. I hate to spoon-feed every aspect of a horror movie. Oh, and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark man and trampled on a jungle Esqe Island, there's nothing happier than a middle man reciting Shakespeare ... <br /> <br /> Here you are rooting for the monster ... if you can stand to see this poor excuse for a movie.
