What a horrible, horrible movie! One of the worst movies I have seen in my life. I usually like movies like these. "A man meets an eccentric woman he likes, but he is already involved with someone who is not right for him ...". I expected something predictable and I did not mind. The movies are always entertaining and mix the right amount of romance with comedy, but not these! Every single joke drops off and the "romance" makes me vomit. The title character is one of the most "please kill me" characters I've ever seen in my TV. The "eccentric woman" is not very eccentric, rather like quirky and annoying. The "other person" is the most rational, mature person in the movie, but it's just as annoying. This movie is totally crappy, there's no way around it, do not waste your time.
