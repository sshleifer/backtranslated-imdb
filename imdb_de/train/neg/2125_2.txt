If I had not been forced to look at this for work reasons, I would not have made the first 10 minutes. And even then I admit that I move fast through parts. The movie version of '63 was superior in every way. Yes, I've read that this is more true to the original, but how wise was it for the writer to change the script in '63! It's too long, it pulls, the songs that are included in this version and not in the movie version are boring and uninspired. The version of "Kids" in the '63 version was very funny and a true classic of the sarcastic parent humor. In this version, Kim is too old, the Conrad is * absolutely terrible * to watch him (when someone tore his shirt off him, I closed in disgust ... the director of this version has no idea what is sexy .). This Conrad can not dance, can not sing (he can not even stay in tune) and is simply repulsive. If Elvis Presley had really been like that, his career would have ended before the start. As far as the other actors are concerned, I always waited for Alexander's Toupet to fall off as he danced and Daly performed completely as a momma. Watch the movie's version of Stapleton's performance to see how the same role is performed by someone who understands comic timing. This TV version is nothing but a total waste of everyone's time.
