Like most people, I preferred to buy this movie because the images of the mighty Bolo Yeung were plastered everywhere and the assumption (from the above images and the title of the movie) that this movie is all about the beast The East enters the ass for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Chinese Hercules for Bolo Yeung is what No Retreat No Surrender was to Jean Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger ... um, Bolo Yeung - Maximum exposure of the video box, minimum actual screen time! Well! <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple, but it was done well - a peaceful kung fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again. He runs away to work as a worker at a pier, where he impresses his colleagues with his heavy sack-stroke ability, which they suspect to be a powerful fighter (do not know exactly how that works, but no matter). Meanwhile, the corrupt boss of the pier makes a deal with gangsters by using the pier exclusively. As a result, the workers are thrown to the ear and have to live on the beach, where they join forces against their boss, the gangster boss and his powerful stooge Bolo Yeung. While the movie was pretty good to see (mostly waiting for the next shot at Bolo), I had a few problems with it - first, the bad synchronization, but that goes without saying in old kung fu films. But the movie also tended to move between the different combat scenes. And as far as the fight scenes themselves are concerned, I found them too long, badly choreographed (apparently by Jackie Chan!), Shot badly, and sometimes executed by people who do not seem to have martial arts skills. In fact, most of the battles in this film were not "fights", only people who resisted were beaten. <br /> <br /> Finally the hero - played by Chen Hui Min. I have never seen any other films with this guy, but at no time did I look for him. Not only did he look shaky and constantly crying, but I also found his urge not to fight annoyingly! I understood his thoughts, but he could have saved a lot of pain for many people if he had done before, which we all knew he would eventually do and fight for! A bigger puzzle was why this whole community of people hoped for a guy they'd never met. <br /> <br /> The big salvation in this movie was really the presence of Bolo Yeung. Not only is he as tall and brutal as he always is, he also has great witty lines and gives the rest of the cast a master class on how to fight in the movie. The guy radiates screen presence and you can easily see how he became a star. The guy scares me of life, but I'm sure I was not the only one who saw this movie that sat for Bolo during the final battle! <br /> <br /> All in all, a below-average kung fu movie has caused some big scores because you know who. I've never met anyone who did not think Bolo Yeung was great. The man is a legend !!
