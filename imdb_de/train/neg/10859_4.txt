This is another of many B-minus films labeled as Film Noir, hoping to arouse some interest in something that is free from it. All aspects of the film - script, acting, directing - are mediocre. The effect of the three leads is wood. I think John Dall should go into the movie business, but then somebody noticed that he had little talent and ended up on TV. Lee J Cobb, who is usually great, can not rise above the bad writing and the bad direction. Jane Wyatt is said to be a femme fatale but barely convince viewers. The movie has two of the strangest looking cars I've ever seen. The one in which John Dall Lee J Cobb goes is especially strange. The DVD transmission is typical of Alpha.
