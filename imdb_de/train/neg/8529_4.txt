What nerd at MGM thought it would be a good idea to put the learned Clark Gable in the role of a Salvation Army worker? Ironically, another handsome future star, Cary Grant, played a Salvation Army bloke just two years later in the highly overrated SHE DONE HIM FALG. I think, in hindsight, it's pretty easy to see the folly of those roles, but I still wonder who the opinion is that the Salvation Army guys are "HOT" and who see these dashing men and them as a realistic representation could look at the games they played. A long time ago I was working for a Salvation Army affiliate (the Volunteers of America), and I NEVER saw any able-bodied guys working there (and unfortunately, that includes me too). Maybe I would have had to get a job at the Salvation Army instead! <br /> <br /> For the most curious, this is a good movie to watch out for, but for everyone else it's bad writing, sloppy talk and annoying moralizing make a very slow movie.
