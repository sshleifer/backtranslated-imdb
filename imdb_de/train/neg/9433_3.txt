I bought Unhinged because the bloody picture sucked me on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie, just look at the back of the box. All kills are shown, and I can honestly tell you that they look much better in the still images than in the movie. <br /> <br /> After we say that, let's take a look at the plot. A group of college girls going to a rock concert (through the deep, dark woods in one of the longest riding sequences ever caught on celluloid) slip off the road. No visible damage was done to the car, but obviously it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the movie (or maybe she read the script and was already in a coma before filming started). > <br /> The two remaining girls wake up in a big, isolated house. Incidentally, the house is fabulous and creates more drama than its actors. For some reason, this house has no roads to it. The main road can only be reached by hiking five miles through the forest. The girls spend the rest of Unhinged sitting and listening to strange conversations between an old, rich bitch (who looks like George Washington on the train) and her equally homely, sexually repressed daughter. The girls did not seem to be in any hurry to get back from this concert, as they had packed more clothes for this three-hour tour than the cast of Gilligan's Island. <br /> <br /> At the time we come to viewers The kill scenes do not bother us anymore. We want someone to kill us just to end our suffering. Finally, Unhinged ends with a rather shocking ending that deserves to be in a much better movie. It's almost as if the ending, which was a good idea in the movie, was written first, and then the authors tried to make a movie that led to this movie. <br /> <br /> improper direction and an action with more holes than a leper in a porno movie (sorry, I'm not sure where that came from). You'll get an idea of ​​how bad this movie is during the credits, if the screen goes black for about two minutes for some reason that's never explained, while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering , Do not waste your time. You just feel awkward and want your time and money back.
