If I could, I would give ZERO stars, but unfortunately I have to give one ... <br /> <br /> There is not a single scene that I could laugh about ... but the game did not make me laugh too , So if you're sick, go to your local movie theater, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some people have already done here. <br /> <br /> but for me ... in a movie kids are shot to achieve humor ... good taste goes over the edge ... this was the third time I missed my time to see a Boll movie, and it was definitely my last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I'm ashamed to be from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> PLEASE DO NOT KEEP IT TO CREATE MORE FILMS !!!!!
