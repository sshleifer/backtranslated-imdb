I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie "Burning Moon". But while this movie was pretty grim and evil, "Premutos" seems to make him laugh. It's amazing how Ittenbach made this movie in his spare time with no money (and the DVD documentary is worth seeing), but I was always fighting not to rush to the next Gore scene. Sure, there is Gore, and if that's all you want, go ahead and enjoy it. But be warned, there is an excessive amount of lame comedy and boring storytelling. Many compare this to Peter Jackson's films, especially Braindead. A look at what Jackson did with a similar budget in "Bad Taste", it is clear that Ittenbach is missing on a thing that has Jackson - talent. 3/10 (for pretty good and abundant gore effects and for the best of limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)
