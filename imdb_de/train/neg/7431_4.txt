CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it becomes clear that the series has reached a natural end. The best contributions, such as CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING, which lie between the mid and late sixties, are in themselves MATRON It's not bad, it's just that we've seen everything with a thin plot before (a series) Spivs who try to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills to sell to third world countries) surrounded by gags of a somewhat amusing but uncomplicated nature. I think that's the problem. The gags are not exactly amusing when the uncomplicated nature shows their age. Do we still need a movie in which a man is disguised as a woman in order to advance the plot? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago, and I have a problem remembering a very funny line. That's a serious problem for a comedy
