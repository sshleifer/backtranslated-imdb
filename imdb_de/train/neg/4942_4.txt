Every new fall line-up show deserves at least my "3 strikes and you're out" policy. I give a comedy 3 ways to make me laugh, ie 3 complete episodes. After episode 1, I actually said to the TV, "Morning aborted." It was so bad. I have now seen the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and still have to create a grin. No tittering, no laughter, no chuckling, in fact no facial movement. I will continue to punish myself by watching every other episode, because I am convinced that I clearly miss something in this series. I just do not "understand" it, but I think a comedy on a big prime time TV station just has to be funny; but there is NO laugh from me. It is simply impossible for ABC to play the most uncomplicated comedy of all time at 20:00. I know that there has to be an inside joke that just does not work with my brain. I have read each of the previous comments, "I" get the social aspect of it, but where are the jokes ???? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week until I have a light bulb moment and bump into my head and yell "Eureka".
