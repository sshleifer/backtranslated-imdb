I'm watching it pink now (Serbian TV station) and I have to say that's a crap. Shallow, no acting, effects too sloppy, I mean, who made this series? <br /> <br /> This was a stupid attempt by the studios to earn some extra money for the movie's success. OK. The movie was great when it came out in 1994. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see how idiotic the lines are in the language of the characters. I mean, did they actually pay someone to write this, was that someone in the studio? This is not a scifi. <br /> <br /> The movie was the bomb, the series suck.
