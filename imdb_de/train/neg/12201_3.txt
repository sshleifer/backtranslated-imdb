The summary summarizes everything. This is not nearly as good as the original. With a script that both Stallone and James Cameron have written (at the same time he also wrote aliens). Most of the action was written by Cameron, and the political aspects were written by Stallone. Sly was physically in great shape when he did this and Rocky 4, and he looks good or looks good on the eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own point of view or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo begins in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman, who asks him to take on a special mission that could bring him a pardon by the President. He finally agrees and goes to the briefing room where Charles Napier plays a Washington suit trying to pose as a former ex-military force to appease Rambo. <br /> <br /> The mission is to find out if there are any missing prisoners of war still living in Vietnam in camps. Rambo was chosen as the camp in which he had been prejudiced. He is told that it is not a rescue mission and it is only available for taking photos. <br /> <br /> After a bad parachute jump from an airplane, he loses most of his equipment and meets his contact person (who turns out to be a sweet woman) and travels down the river with pirates to the camp. <br /> <br /> He finds there are still prisoners and saves you. As the three flee from their river boat in front of half of the Vietnamese army, they are betrayed by the pirates, but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to continue the pickup point on foot after their boat was rammed and blown up by Rambo on board , <br /> <br /> Rambo is again cheated and abandoned when Napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter. It is clear how Trautman returns to the base to berate him for the fact that no survivors were expected to be found. Steven Berkoff appears as Russian Spetznatz colonel, and Rambo is tortured and finally flees to be followed only by further Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz. Many of them are killed. Rambo finally steals a helicopter and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his base. <br /> <br /> He resists the urge to kill Napier because he left, but destroys the Ops Center. <br /> <br /> A weak plot and a very weak ending when Rambo goes into the sunset as a free man.
