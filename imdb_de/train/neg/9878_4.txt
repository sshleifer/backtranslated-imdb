In Wes Anderson's "Fantastic Mr Fox" a lot of love was put, unfortunately, all the love is for itself. Granted, it took a lot of time and effort to create this self-confident, quirky universe, but if only the same amount of time and effort had been put into the script to make fun of it. The worrying thing is that I think that was the case, and that's the best thing Wes Anderson could notice. <br /> <br /> The animation is good in the close-ups of the animals, but with the camera. In the far distance everything becomes very hard for the eyes and to be honest, it seems like a mess. There was nothing special about acting. Wes decided to select his buddies and big names through more specialized speakers who could probably have made the movie better. I'm pretty sure George Clooney's Voice Act resume consists of two cameo appearances in South Park where he played a dog. <br /> <br /> The film is too complacent and tries too hard to be smart. Although the film is filmed in England, all good animals are typical of Americans who play baseball, while the bad guys stereotyped Englishmen with the most offensive English accents are. I can not stress how much waste of time this movie is. I did not even laugh.
