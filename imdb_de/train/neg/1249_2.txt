What a disappointment, especially considering the budget, the technical resources available and the talents collected. Is not it the basic rule for science fiction / drama to create the willing suspension of unbelief in the audience? The POA 2001 makes a plausible start that leaves us deeply involved, but after that, Mr. Burton forgets that his moviegoers have a brain. The exaggerated libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter's chimpanzee, the worthlessness of human captivity, the ease of her escape, her extraordinary skills of equitation (this is an astronaut and a group of people who are suddenly in full swing), the Massive Immediate Human Rebellion is too incredible. Mark Wahlberg never projects a sense of true fear, danger or compassion in this upside-down world. Compare with the original in which Chuck Heston's nudity metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events. The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his obvious sense of management and control in a naturally crazy situation, and we never really wonder about his well-being. Unlike Heston, he never really seems to be in danger. Tim Burton should have used the f / x budget for some competent script writing. After this inferior fiasco, I'm actually wondering why Hollywood's producers had ever taken care of the scriptwriters and directors making threats. Let them go. Trained monkeys could have done as well as Planet of the Apes 2001. I bet the repeated reflections on this effort will not exist. It could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step for the imagination. Another opportunity has been lost.
