Disney did it again. The company that made "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" has made another film that barely reminds of the cartoon it's based on and does not preserve the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young, and to exist for a movie of it was perhaps a dream come true. Well, since this movie exists, I was deeply disappointed, even outraged. <br /> <br /> First, we have the characters. <br /> <br /> Gadget himself has the gadgets that made him such a funny character the original cartoon (with well-made special effects) and he even has some of the naivety of the original gadget, but he is now more competent and to solve the crime itself, while Penny and Brain just watch /> <br /> Penny has little to do; While she played an important role in the cartoon that discovered and stopped crime and was occasionally captured by the MAD agents, she is now simply introduced and then forgotten, though she at least sneaks into Claw's base. Claw is the version of Dr , Claw, who was a rather scary man with a gruff voice. He wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair, his face hidden as he stroked his cat and monitored various crimes. Now he is just a man with a claw for a hand, without a secret behind the figure. <br /> <br /> Brain and Mad Cat exist in the movie, but are rather insignificant. <br /> <br /> Even small parts of the cartoon will not be spared in this battle. The famous phrase "Wowsers!" was mysteriously changed to "Wowser", and gadgets Gadgetmobile now looks different and speaks up. <br /> <br /> There are even product references. Why is "Yahoo!" advertised on a sign? Why does Gadgetmobile have buttons for M & M's or bowling? <br /> <br /> Fans of the cartoon will hate it, others will probably find the movie below average, and when all is said and done, this movie is another try to make a few bucks for another old show.
