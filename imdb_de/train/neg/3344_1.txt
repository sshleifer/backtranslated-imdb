I should start by saying that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man introduces some of the funniest action clich√©s you can imagine, and Detention is probably my personal favorite. * Spoilers * Even if there is no Dolph spoiler, because the scripts are so absurd at first: a chase scene with a disabled child carrying a gun, against a guy in a Harley with a machine gun through a high hallway of the school and the child wins? Good game, the Oscar is arrested. Dolph, if you read this, thank you for laughing, old friend. <br /> <br /> In summary: Great movie, guaranteed to make you laugh. I recommend inviting some friends and forcing them to rejoice. Hilarious
