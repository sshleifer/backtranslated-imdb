I read this piece by Thornton Wilder in eighth grade last year. I was also forced to go through this weak translation on the screen. I tell you, it's not a great game, it's easily beaten, but it deserves a much better shot. The acting was missing, the scenery honest with God looked as if it had been designed by a group of three-year-olds made of cardboard. As if it could not get any worse, the sound quality is lousy ... There's this startling "buzz" whenever an actor speaks ... and I also had to realize that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, does not exist , The actors all seem very uncomfortable. There is no music. It's in black and white, which would be OK, but it brings out the cheesiness even more. Anyway, I think if you really want to see this movie, which I can not really recommend, you should not set your hopes too high. The play, brave as it may be, is probably better.
