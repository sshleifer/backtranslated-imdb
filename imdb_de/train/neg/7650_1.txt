I know I'm in the minority, but ... Uwe Boll is about as talented as a frog. Not even a toad; just a frog He remembers about a hundred other no-talent hacks spewing out one useless dungfest after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? Is a manure party. Slater's talent is only minimally used to believe that he has other things in mind (like his failed relationship). Reid seems to have either forgotten her acting lessons, was badly hit on the head and MADE to forget her acting lessons, or has one of the worst directors in film history. I vote for the third choice, even though the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has never done anything that gave me even the slightest pleasure. Honestly, I'm satisfied he made that stinker. I looked at Bloodrayne, who was fighting for ticket sales with "Underworld: Evolution." Well, I'm confident that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean NOTHING to worry about. <br /> <br /> This is a rating of 1.0 / 10 for this chaotic, intricate dung festival out of <Fever>.
