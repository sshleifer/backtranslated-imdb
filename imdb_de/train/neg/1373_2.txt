This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually praise any movie for an aspect of its production, but the irritating behavior of more than half of the characters made it hard for me to appreciate it every part of this movie. <br /> <br /> Most often it was concluded that the man who designed the building was guilty of an avalanche that collapsed the building. He ok. <br /> <br /> Even trying to drive an avalanche style will not work. Running 10 feet in some trees will not work. Unfortunately it does here. As already mentioned, the innate dumbness and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous. In a confined space with little oxygen, a four-year-old could say that starting a fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie will self-dissolve for about 5 minutes and earns appreciation. However, if you have a bit of intelligence, you will find the bulk of this movie hard to bear. <br /> <br /> It hurts me that so many quality stories are not produced and still someone has to pay for it. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? To give you a catch, you need to constantly watch to see the latest combative avalanche techniques. Absolutely priceless.
