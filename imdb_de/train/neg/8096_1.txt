Most book customizations are bad, but this movie has omitted important parts of the storyline and changed the description and some characters. They wired the plot and combined scenes and changed the sequence. They added ridiculous things that never appeared in the book and would never happen. <br /> <br /> If I had not read the book before, it would have been an incredibly boring movie that did not interest you about the characters as they dislike them. It turns the characters into jokes. <br /> <br /> Terrible. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous. <br /> <br /> waste of two hours of my life.
