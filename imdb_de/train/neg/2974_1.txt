I'm a nice guy and like to think I'm genre-tolerant. And I mean, I'm trying to look at a movie related to the genre it's in. If not otherwise, it does not save me, as if I really say evil things about people or movies that I do not like. <br /> <br /> The plot in this one was obvious, the production values ​​are very low and put, um, simple. Acting occasionally entered the field "good for a high school game". My feeling was that this was filmed in one day - please tell me that it was. The worst part was that the sex while he was reasonably plentiful, was pretty mundane, by at least hindered in my copy of "Sound-Over," which does not match (climatic moaning and screaming with the action, while lying on a bed and a BH dissolves ???). There was definitely no "edge" - nothing distinctive or interesting, and with surprisingly fast cuts. <br /> <br /> My voice is a "1", with the following summary statement would have been better if the material for filling the filler has been expanded in the club and the rest of the film was compressed.
