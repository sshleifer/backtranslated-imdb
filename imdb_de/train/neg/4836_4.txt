Let's start with the simple lines. On the viewer's side there are some good "director details", some aspects of the movie scenes that are nice. The special effects are good enough, a good drama / good backdrop. But the story is too simple. It shows how an elite unit of Army Bomb units lives, acts and sometimes dies. It shows the drama of living in war. In my movie experience as a serious action-movie addict, I missed that click that keeps my eyes and mind on the screen. One of the things that must be present in a movie for me to approve is the ability to immerse the viewer in the reality and time of the movie. It did not happen to me. I stayed "conscious" for the whole movie. Honestly, I believe this film has gained its fame, based on the "subconscious" appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and sincere feeling, but not the adequate use as a movie fame generator , It's more than a movie about the war. As a result, it is becoming increasingly popular. <br /> <br /> A simple thought: If it's a World War II movie or a movie, would it just be a time change, where everything stayed the same, is this going to be honored? Certainly not. Why? Because there are great people raising the bar too high. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that all the prizes she won will be awarded correctly compared to her competitors at the Oscars.
