Summer Holiday is the forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness, and rightly so with the Broadway music adaptation of Take Me Along. With the exception of the Stanley Steamer song, none of the other Harry Warren Ralph Blane songs are worth a reminder, and even this one is questionable. <br /> <br /> It was right after the release of this movie that MGM let go of Mickey Rooney and I do not think it was a coincidence. The film was shot in 1946 and published in 1948. Mickey was 26 years old and played a teenager like Andy Hardy. He was just too old for the part of the 17-year-old who influenced radical ideas in the spirit of a youthful rebellion. Rooney shot four movies for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this one here, killer McCoy a remake of Robert Taylor's A Crowd Roars, Love Laughs Andy Hardy and Words and Music. In all, Rooney played an adult role. Even in the movie Andy Hardy, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy, who returned from World War II. Why he was in this Louis B. Mayer, only knows. <br /> <br /> Rooney's bad casting makes the summer vacation even worse, as the original Ah Wilderness focuses on the character of the father played by Walter Huston. And on the Broadway Show Take Me Along, which won a Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Great One played the intoxicated brother-in-law Uncle Sid, played by Frank Morgan, and this is the central character. Gloria DeHaven joins Judy Garland as Rooney's sweet and adorable girlfriend, and Marilyn Maxwell plays the showgirl giving Rooney an adult education. In the original play, O'Neill has her as a prostitute, but this was the Hollywood of the Code, so it's just that Marilyn souses the young Rooney and they do their best, but the summer vacation disappears rather quickly in a chilly autumn.
