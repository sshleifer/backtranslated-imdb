Oh, I've heard so much good about this movie. Went it with my best friend (she is female, I am male). Now allow me a different opinion from the mainstream. After the first few dozen "take off your clothes," we both felt a very strange combination of stupidity and boredom. We laughed (at the same time, not with it), we dozed (and would have stayed better in bed), we were convinced that we had spent money for free. And we had The plot was incoherent, and the characters were a group of people around whom it was impossible to be interested. A waste of money, a waste of celluloid. This movie does not even earn one in ten voices, but that's the lowest available. I'm not sure why this movie has a reputation for being excellent. I can not recommend it to anyone who has even a little taste or intelligence.
