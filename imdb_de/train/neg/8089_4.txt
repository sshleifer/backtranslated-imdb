I do not know what Donald Sutherland's acting or singing style is about, but he always seems to be behind a huge bundle of drenched Kleenex. He's just ... I do not know, dick? Somnambulistisch? On medication? Weird. <br /> <br /> That is, I saw the streak for the first time since its original release, and honestly, I can not remember that it ended anything like LIKE. A bad ending, too, because nothing is bound. What about the dead man? The annoying kid (and was called the kid?)? The Scotland Yard and military pursuer? I would have liked something to wrap things up and conclude everything dramatically, not just the big panoramic view. <br /> <br /> And what woman is sleeping with the man she knows she just killed her husband? Even if she tried to mitigate Needle's suspicions to protect her child, she could always have had a headache. At this last meeting I felt itchy and uncomfortable.
