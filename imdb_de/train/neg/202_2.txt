This is not the sound of bees, it's the effect of watching this extremely long, extremely boring, malfunctioning movie. As I have managed to get through every 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep, I will never know. The plot is simple ... 3 totally unlikely idiots talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. That's even worse if that's possible. > I really have to be a masochist if I could see the whole movie without turning it off ... or killing someone.
