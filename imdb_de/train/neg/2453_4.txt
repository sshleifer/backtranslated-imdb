I might have rated this movie higher before Peter Jackson's trilogy came out, but if you see the two of them side by side, there's no comparison. The speed of this film is fast, many important scenes from the book are left out, and there is little character development. The animation is a strange mix of traditional cartoon drawings and painted over live action scenes that I found disturbing. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and never finished. There are some good points - the fight scenes are exciting to watch and the dialogue follows the book fairly closely. Watch this video if you're in a hurry and can not watch the new trilogy for ten hours. However, if you have not read the book, you will probably be confused because there is a lot missing in this release. 4 out of 10.
