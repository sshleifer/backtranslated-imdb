I got Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was there (I loved her in American Gothic), but unfortunately she did not play a big role in this movie. It starts well and the pace is going well ... but in the end it gets a bit boring and boring. That's not to say that this is a boring movie, but it's just average and not spectacular. I did not like the "Posession" page and there were no decent Gore scenes. Besides, the main story was very confusing and the end makes no sense at all. However, I liked the story of the gothic girl and how she could avenge her tormentors. I would not recommend Mirror Mirror to horror fans - it's not something that wets you.
