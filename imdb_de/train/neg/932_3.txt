I saw this movie and hoped it would improve a bit all the time. What is so great about a man without emotions? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You never see Alex showing emotion for anyone except for his son. Yes, I know that this is the reason why his son is the only one who makes him lose his temper (if you can call it that), I understand enough time to be understood. In one scene, Sarah says that she will not fall in love, and next time we see her, will she talk about how his death really shook her because they were so close? There are many logical synapses in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's like someone saw Boogie Nights and wrote this part to imitate Little Bill. Even the scene where he "loses control" is the same as when Little Bill shoots his wife, except for the facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at portraying a man with no emotions - was already there, done - can you say, Magnolia? <br /> <br /> Not only does this film have no emotions, it lacks substance, a good script, developed characters and an action. And I certainly miss my recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
