This movie is terribly played, written, directed and produced. But it's so campy that it's actually half observable. This is SEMI Watchable. <br /> <br /> The plot (which is a little there) makes virtually no sense. The Barney drum figure is the only real comic relief in the movie that gets tired after about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many of the Canadian supporters are in TV spots. None of them did anything else that I know about. And of course, Sly Stallone's even less gifted brother is good ...: This was filmed almost exclusively in and around the small village of Claremont, Ont. (about 20 miles northeast of Toronto) I recognized many local landmarks / intersections / buildings. I think the drive-in scene was shot on the now-demolished "Oshawa Drive-in" just before it was demolished.
