Bernard Rapp died last year and was a very cultured journalist. Cinema was one of his biggest passions (he wrote a huge dictionary of world glossaries), so he had to wear a camera at least once in his life. The films he left behind found lukewarm reviews: "Tiré à Part" (1996) despite the sensational performance of Terence Stamp was very caricatured in the portrayal of the characters Giraudeau made a perverse performance, "Pas Si Grave" (2003) was a Another fallacy and "un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence" is just as oppressive as its predecessors. Its weird potential is exploited in a threadbare way. <br /> <br /> And the start idea, however, suggests a whirling, spiritual comedy. A couple, who are being held by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain, who have invited their friends, is moving in a leisurely mansion. To play with their guests, they pretend to separate in company. And things are not going as planned because the announcement of their separation does not surprise them. The two lovers begin to think about the validity of their couple. Despite lush landscapes and the promising material available to him, Rapp's undisputed directing can not fill this game with life's unexpected consequences. The plot follows a well-worn pattern of characters with certain familiar features and masks that are revealed who they really are. Verbal or sitcom effects often remain flat. A bad cut fades the film a little more with this bad habit of Rapp, to cut abruptly many sequences. Even the sincere contributions of the actors are controversial. They seem to get bored and recite their lyrics than they live, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience is soon trapped in a deep torpor. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate to say that Bernard Rapp's films have never fulfilled his intentions, as "un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence" testifies.
