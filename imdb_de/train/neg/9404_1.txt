This absolute garbage is based on the Friday of the 13th series, which is practically a carbon copy. They accept an Australian movie with people who can not act. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time a little boy was accidentally burned while filming a music video on Lake Eildon. Now, a few years later, the boy is grown and takes revenge for anyone who comes to the lake to film a music video. It's a clich√© and a waste of time and money. Just look it out of curiosity or if you're an aspiring actor trying to learn how to NOT (not be able to act) act. Alan Dale starred in the television soap opera Neighbors, but ended in The X Files - how did that happen?
