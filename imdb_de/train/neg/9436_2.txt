Unhinged follows the typical storyline of the slasher trends of the early 80's. Pretty young girl in danger. I have to give it up for the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the early road trip shots. "Unhinged" was like watching an amateur acting class go through their warm-up program. Some of the most uncomfortable, poorly lit, overlong scenes are played with a Valium overdose. I wondered why they did not just put the cue cards in front of the camera so the actresses did not have to constantly change their gaze. The two main girls were obviously selected for their T & A factor rather than for their talent. Laurel Munson as head chick Terry is as exciting as drying the paint. Two nude scenes provide a thrill. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as a crazy / scary daughter and mother, with whom the chicks are stranded, compete for Worst Acting Ever. Long breaks, strange expressions, emphasis on the wrong word, everything is there and is a pleasure for those of us who love bad movies. The scenes suddenly shift with long blackouts that could drive you through a Mack truck. A cartoon flash crashes over the recordings without looking at the sky. Eighties eyeshadow attacks the viewer. But you know, it worked on me. I was sorry. I wanted to hug it, kiss it, and do it better. The end does not make up for the damage, but I still grinned. I have my own theories about all the "forbidden" hype and I hope that anyone watching this movie will do so with substantial substance abuse and humor. Otherwise pass.
