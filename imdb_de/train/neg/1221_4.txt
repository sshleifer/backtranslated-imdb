I remember the days when Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty face adorning films with typical characters of dumb blondie, romantic interest or girls in danger. But everything changed when she received an Oscar for her role in the Best Supporting Actress category, the excellent film LA Confidential, and I think I was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance. However, her career did not follow the ideal path after that moment. Sure, the prestige she gained from this film made her a good figure to take part in moderately prestigious films (like People I Know or The Door in the Floor), but we never saw her again in a significant character. The movie While She Was Out does nothing to get her into this situation; And it's not just that her character is not too tasty, but also that the movie is really crappy. The script from this movie could not be holier and more basic. However, Basinger brings some conviction to her character, and that makes her poor movie to win a few points. This movie is full of clich√©s and generic villains. The work of director Susan Montford is catastrophic for many reasons, but most of all because the film never gets a good rhythm and tone. The end of this movie is extremely ridiculous. Although I do not recommend that she was even outside. This movie commits the main sin of being boring.
