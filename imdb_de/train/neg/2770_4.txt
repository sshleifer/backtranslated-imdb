The Hollywood Hotel was the last movie musical that Busby Berkeley filmed for Warner Bros. His directorial style had changed or developed to the extent that this film does not contain his typical overhead footage or huge production numbers with thousands of extras. In the last years of the thirties swing bigbands recorded the biggest popular hits of the year. The Swing Era, also called Big Band Era, was dated differently between 1935 and 1944 or 1939-1949. Although it is impossible to pinpoint the moment in which the Swing Era began, Benny Goodman's involvement in the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California The late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the first signs that swing into consciousness the youth of America. When Goodman introduced his swing repertoire and not the social dance music that his band had played, the youth in the audience became wild. That was the beginning, but since radio, live concerts, and word of mouth were the main ways to spread the phenomena, it took some time for Swing to make enough to produce big hits that pop up in the pop charts. At the Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and his orchestra, as well as Raymond Paige and his orchestra in the film, suggests that the film industry was ready to use the shift in musical taste (the film was in production for only a year and a half) after Goodman's Palomar -Ballsaal commitment). There are a few interesting musical moments at the Hollywood Hotel, but apart from Benny Goodman and His Orchestra's Sing, Sing, Sing, there is not much to recommend. Apart from that, the most interesting musical sequences are the opening parade "Hooray for Hollywood" and the production number "Let's be a lesson" at the drive-in cinema. The film is very interesting to see and hear as Benny Goodman and his orchestra play and sing Dick Powell and Frances Langford.
