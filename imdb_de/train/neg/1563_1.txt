I saw this movie at Sundance in 2005 and was amazed at how bad it was, although I felt excited about the catalog description. Allegedly it is a "mockumentary" of two high school students documenting a documentary about high school life. It was characterized by bad acting, bad governance, total lack of dedicated characters, and everything is a total bust. I love good movies about high school and this is not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and self-confident "cool," even though they should be outcasts. They have the overall impression of a group of people sitting around making a deliberately bad movie to show their friends, but somehow Sundance arrived. Enigmatic
