I rarely comment on movies, but I've read the other comments and can not believe that there are people who applaud this celluloid garbage. I know that there are certain people who have their own agenda, but we want to see it as a merit. badly played, badly shot, and the story felt as the director worked it out. I will not focus on the sexual aspect of the movie with young children because the creators of the movie obviously knew what they wanted and what the audience wanted. All I can say is that it's a horrible movie, the content is bad and offensive, the production is amateurish and I'm glad they could not make a movie like this legal today
