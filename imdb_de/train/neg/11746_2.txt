Well, this movie certainly had a lot of hype. From the excitement of the Toronto Film Festival to the loud reviews on CBC Radio. Apparently a refreshing, crazy, hilarious indie movie. I have been looking forward to it for months. <br /> <br /> How can I just say that? It sucked a lot. An exercise in cinematic lameness that makes Adam Sandler look like a funny genius. <br /> <br /> It was a bit amusing at best and a coma at worst. An Amerterish script that was misdirected and put into a dilapidated mess. <br /> <br /> And what if the music was 500 dB louder than the rest of the soundtrack? That was about the strangest thing about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really funny, bizarre alien movie, try Repoman. There is no comparison!
