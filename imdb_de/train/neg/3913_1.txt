This movie is a good example of how you can ruin a book in 109 minutes. Apart from the names of the characters, the film has little resemblance to the book. A book full of strong Latin American characters, mostly represented by non-Latinos. There is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. And erasing a complete generation is inexcusable. Isabel Allende has written a strong book and the book should be read!
