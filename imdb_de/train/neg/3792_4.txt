I have seen many, many Nutcracker productions. Maybe I saw this movie from the corrupt perspective of a theater director, but I was disappointed. I am sure that the people in ballet choreography find this production impressive, but from a purely theatrical perspective, I found everything from design to choreography to be inconclusive and unsatisfactory for a "film". None of the traditionally "weird" and impressive costumes looked like what they should be (ie, the sweets did not look like sweets, the rats did not look like rats, but rather like chocolate kisses), toned down too much for the screen, and the Choreography just did not do anything for me. This makes the entire show (at best) very satisfying, as if it should not stand out from any other production. But remember, this is from the artistic perspective of a theater director, not a dancer or a choreographer, but a direct male theater director.
