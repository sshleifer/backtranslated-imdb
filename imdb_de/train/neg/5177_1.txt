That's so bad, so very bad. Acting is the biggest joke in history. It does not bother me, I did it after 20 minutes and in the end it was just as disappointing as in the beginning ... I really do not understand people's tastes, I'm a horror movie fan and I'm not demanding, but I have one Border! Maybe it was a quarter better than the beginning of The Hoast, but that's about it. So I recommend that you do not waste the 15 minutes that you can see. I mean, the acting is better done by monkeys. And the big brother with the parental role is just terrible. Do not you pay in C movies? No, I have to say, this is not the first time that I think a horror movie is bad, but he is absolutely one of my ten films and gets portrayed as a vampire, Cabin by the lake, The Hoast!
