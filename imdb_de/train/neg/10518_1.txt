Oh boy, where do I go with this? Herding drama, faint action, stupid deaths, pointless nudity ... <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment ... that's hell. <br /> <br /> To hell. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money, your time or your life in this pit of evil. <br /> <br /> It's just ... God damn, this movie is awful! Tom Savini, WHY ?! Why are you wasting your life with this crap? This movie is not worth it. I'd rather shit, crack and smash my head against a wall than THAT ... to see that sinful act again! <br /> <br /> Please follow my advice and stay away from this elephant war movie. No, you know something? I should not have to call that thing a movie! Just stay away!
