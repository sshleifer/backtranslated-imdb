This movie is not very good. It's boring and not much blood for a horror movie. The plot only trots along, if not much happens. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters, as it shows that she has lights like reflexes. But when she has one of them, she only takes her time, and something always happens where she does not bite. No wonder this led directly to the cable. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Not nearly as good as the first vampire movie. You're a SUCKER if you waste your time with it.
