Why else would he do this to me? <br /> <br /> Not that I expect Dean Cain to produce hit movies. Or even decent movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I know exactly how ... "good" Dean Cain is. <br /> <br /> Obviously it will be a cheese snippet, and every cheese snip has its own special way you scratch your head. I will not name these spoilers because you can not really spoil this movie anymore than it already is. <br /> <br /> First of all ... why is this a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> <br /> How is it that a scientist comes from Chicago and the other scientist is from LA and no one could be East European if he had tried? How hard would it have been to either get an American actor or just change the lame status the movie offers us to say these people are not Americans? Why are there two occasions when the movie appears? gives us a snail? We get a helicopter landing day and later a mess. And then that's who, who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who took care of it when they mentioned it, but I think that's not important. <br /> <br /> Will a movie really be better if you can see it on multiple screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> The dragon can run safely through the hall ... over ... and over ... and over ... and over ... and over ... <br /> <br / > Who in the world was responsible for one of the worst ends of film history? It was right out of Scooby Doo. Oh, the dragon is dead now ... tell me, do you want dinner? Sure, but not in any Chinese place ... with Dragon in the name !! AH HA HA HA !! HAHAHA !! HAHAHA! I used to be Superman! AHA HA HA! HAHA! <br /> <br /> Fade to black <br /> <br /> My God, it frightened me, it was so stupid. <br /> <br /> But do not worry ... it does not matter if the whole building exploded ... and nobody was alive ... for some reason there is a second untouched, unmanned lab that has survived pretty well, so they can do a sequel. Hurray for us all. <br /> <br />
