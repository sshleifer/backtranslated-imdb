I can not believe that this show still has 9 out of 10 points. I could see if those voices were in the first two seasons, but what would someone own who values ​​it high? I was a big fan in season one. I was addicted - all the mystery, the tension, the inexplicable events. They never knew what would happen next. I still watched faithfully in the second season, but I was a bit frustrated that some basic things still needed to be explained. And instead of giving you more answers, there seemed to be more questions. I LOVE Suspense, but you have to throw people a bone from time to time to keep them watching. Now I can not remember what finally rejected me, but somewhere in Season Two had enough. I'm not a big fan of dates, and of course you can not miss an episode to stay up to date. So it was not worth the effort. <br /> <br /> It's a shame they could not have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it looks like ABC has become greedy and decided to see how long they can extend this show. Do not you know that in the end you will lose more fans than you could possibly win?
