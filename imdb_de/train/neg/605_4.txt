I'll be brief because a movie like this does not deserve a full review. <br /> <br /> Given the scenery, this movie could be something really special. It could have been others "28 days later" or even a "Blair Witch Project". <br /> <br /> I was really excited about the first 20 minutes of the movie. The director did a good job of cinematography and excitement. However, I do not believe that he has managed to capture the true eeriness of an empty London subway. The characters were a big disappointment. Our "heroine" in this movie is a worthless crap, and you really do not care if she dies or not. As many people have said, I chose the homeless and the black man who managed to give me one or two giggles (whether intentionally by the authors or not). <br /> <br /> is kept in the dark in the first half of the movie, but when it's revealed, I was really disappointed. I will not spoil it, but let's just say my 10 year old sister could probably defeat him in a wrestling match simple Hollywood formula. This movie had a lot of potential, but failed really at the finish. <br /> <br /> To clarify how lame this movie was, the characters in this movie had at least five times to kill the main villain. Instead, they run away.
