First of all, I would like to point out that I only know the show because my younger sister has always watched it. I think it's the most annoying program on TV. There is nothing funny about one of the 'jokes' and the laughter out of the can is unbearable. The show would work much better if filmed before a live audience. That way, the laughter would show how "unsteady" the show is. However, I appreciate the acting talent of the young cast. However, it makes me sick to think that in the future they will look back on the show and see how bad their first TV show was. The show goes well with the overall annoying voices and style of CBBC presenters. I do not care why the youth of today have to be yelled at so much. That's all.
