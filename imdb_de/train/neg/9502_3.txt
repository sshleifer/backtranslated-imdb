This movie was bizarre, totally inexplicable and hysterical, to see with friends in a big empty house. I love the opening material where Lisa wanders around in a beautiful city. I want to be a beautiful stranger who has lost himself in an exotic European area, though not in a cheap horror movie. In any case, get the end where there are the strangely non-sexual sex scenes that were cut out (in my DVD copy anyway). Do not try to understand it, just keep going and watch out for the crazy parts ... which is all. Do not look at it if you really want action or characterization or anything to make sense. Very nice, even though you may just give it up and decide to watch a real horror movie like Dead Alive.
