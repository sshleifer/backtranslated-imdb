When I bought this DVD, I thought, "It seems to be a nice, light comedy about love and relationships that was made in Portuguese standards, I was totally wrong! What a disappointing movie! First, it's not a comedy; a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it is even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Second, the plot is so boring and leads nowhere it has no structure, it just flows like the wind in one direction or the other? The production is also bad! The sound mix is ​​horrible because sometimes the voices are separated.I remembered old portuguese movies from the 80s.The drama should have been better too.Together, it can be said that portuguese cinema is not like movies In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I have seen in recent years! Bad argument, sc bad spectacle, bad production? I had no big hopes for this movie, but it was much worse than I ever imagined! Forget it!
