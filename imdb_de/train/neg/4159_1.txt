In this strangely modest apocalypse, the world suffers from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but in this Grade Z movie, which bears less resemblance to Sheridan Le Fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna, no-one seems to care about the recipe. Bored staff still operate gas stations and doctors still make home visits, and helpful police officers still show up with coolant if you need them. The plot, and I use that term loosely, refers to a father and a daughter trying to meet with the "general" whose daughter is missing in a church to kill a vampire who is very comfortable with the father and on the way is daughter. I must confess that one or two moments of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor. The film also offers just enough nudity to interest a fourteen-year-old boy. Who is older, beware.
