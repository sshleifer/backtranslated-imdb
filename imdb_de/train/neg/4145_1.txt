Okay, I've seen this movie twice now, I researched it extensively on the net, I asked some people for their opinion. I even read the Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla', a book on which this movie is based. I think the best way to review this movie is to describe a game you play while watching. Since the plot of the film seems to make no sense at all, here follows the plot of the book. Laura lives with her father, Mr. De Lafontaine, in a castle in Syberia. They continue their lives happily and peacefully. One day they receive a letter from the general, a man who has made it his mission to avenge his daughters. He claims that supernatural powers are at work and declares that he will visit them soon. A chance encounter with a strange woman causes the Lafontaines to look after their daughter Carmilla for a few months. Soon, Laura begins to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and falls ill with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And what does she have to do with Laura's condition and the general? <br /> <br /> I invented this game and I want as many people as possible to play it and let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name and a jingle, but that does not bother me. It's called the game "This movie does not make sense". <br /> <br /> All you have to do while watching the movie is trying to work out a complete storyline that explains what's going on. I mean completely, all questions have been answered, everything is meaningful, completely complete. <br /> <br /> Questions like ... <br /> <br /> * Why can vampires walk around during the day? Light? <br /> <br /> * Why are they all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why is a girl named Bob? and why is she shooting herself? <br /> <br /> * When is the movie a dream and when is it really? <br /> <br /> * Why does killing zombies seem like an accepted part of life? does not anyone make a lid? <br /> <br /> * Why does Travis Fontaine discover and run down a zombie without slowing down while driving, when facing a woman with an obvious hostage in the back your car, accept the excuse that she is also a zombie is? <br /> <br /> * And then why does he let a girl he reveals openly later that he is the head vampire drive with him in his car? <br /> <br /> * And then let her go, alone with his daughter in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What is the asylum scene about? <br /> <br /> * What the hell is the green cow? <br /> <br /> * Why is the main vampire suddenly dressing like a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why do vampires never fight? Zombies? <br /> <br /> * What is the significance of the necklace? what is it made of? Why is it killing vampires? and how does Jenna know that? <br /> <br /> In fact, it's just as much fun trying to come up with so many questions about this movie. <br /> <br /> I have my story, and I have to admit that it is not quite there, but it's a pretty good effort. <br /> <br /> In summary <br /> <br /> 'Vampires vs Zombies' has no moment in it, there are actually vampires fighting zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what's going on, but he does not seem to like the audience. And somehow it's based on a classic horror novel of the 19th century. As? Why? What the hell is going on?
