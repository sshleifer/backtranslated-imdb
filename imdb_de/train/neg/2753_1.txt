First of all, I would like to point out that Sam Niel is nowhere to be seen in this film. What is a movie without Sam Niel. Has anyone seen Event Horizon? D-Wars has potentially had a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers, sounds cool, but it's not. No, no Sam Niel, not a good movie. I recommend taking the five dollars to rent D-Wars and add 10 to the five and buy a Sam Niel movie - apparently, to submit this movie, I have to have ten lines of text, so here's a list the recommended by me Sam Niel movies <br /> <br /> -Jurassic Park - stay calm - chase the red October - event horizon - no Jurassic Park three <br /> <br /> in total are the D-Wars a heap
