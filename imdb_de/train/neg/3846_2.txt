W. Somerset Maughams Of Human Bondage is said to be a classic in English. If so, then in the movie version much must have been missing. The attraction of Phillip (Leslie Howard) for Mildred (Bette Davis) is so inexplicable that the scenario seems like retelling a relationship from the man's point of view. As a family lawyer, I have heard many such reports. The man presents himself as noble and always correct, and the woman is a hell who had no other goal than to exploit the man. In fact, unless you're ready to laugh about the man's social assumptions about filmmaking, this is an uncomfortable movie. Phillip even begrudges Mildred for bringing a baby of indefinite paternity, but the real highlight is that Phillip Mildred - angry and now dubious sanity - allows the free flow of his home with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but this period did not occur here. In fact, at the end of the movie, she looks very much like the Baby Jane character she would play thirty years later. <br /> <br /> I find that Howard's character is always immaculately dressed and cared for. It tells me that Phillip demands the respectability of the middle class. Someone like this could not run fast enough from a cockney-accented woman. Phillip is a student for most of the film; Such a person would have been more credible if she had been younger and had the ragged look that suggests the low income and low self esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov as she pleases. And that balanced by giving Mildred a bit of charm.
