No wonder Pamela Springsteen has given up acting to become a full-time photographer. It's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of you. Although this film is not without its interesting elements (mullet from hell, etc.), but is compensated by deficiencies. For one thing, Angela, the homicidal counselor, seems to be about the same age as the campers. An older, more threatening camp leader would have done a lot for the film. And then you have the murder scenes. The budget was apparently too low to properly perform most of them (no pun intended), although someone's drowning in a toilet toilet is certainly original. But overall, there are a lot of movies that are more timid and more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching.
