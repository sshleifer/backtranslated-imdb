A disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> The story established our protagonist as Chrissy, a "young" rather disgruntled man who does not do much. Actually, she does very little to advance the narrative, so it did not surprise me to see how the focus shifted to her relatives. However, it is a pity that Chrissy is an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and sometimes felt quite well worded. So the question is, when will we see the Campions, Jackson's and Tamahori's with exciting, cinematic tales that will inspire instead of talking for two hours? > Technically a disgusting movie.
