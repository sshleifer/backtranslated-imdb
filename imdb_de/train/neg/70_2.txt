This movie never made it to the cinemas in our area, and when it was available on DVD, I was one of the first to hire it. For once, I should listen to the critics and pass them on. Despite the outstanding cast of the actors, the film was very disappointing. I can now see why it went straight to the video. <br /> <br /> I thought it could have some value with Bloom, Ledger and Rush. Everyone has done a wonderful job in the past. <br /> <br /> The movie moved slowly and never pulled me in. I could not develop a great empathy for the characters and had to face the urge to fast forward just to come to an end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, even if you remember to rent it for "Eye Candy" purposes only. It will not even satisfy that.
