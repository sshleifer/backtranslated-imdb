"Mojo" is a fifties story in London, a world of up-and-coming rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. "Mojo" uses a technique for filming the fifties, which is often seen in films, highlighting the physical differences in our time, but also exaggerating the dialogue (which is due to the way in which how language was portrayed in films from this period). I have no idea if people outside the movies really did speak that way, but no films shot today or in the present day use such stylized language. It is as if the stilty discourse of the screenwriters of the fifties is a common abbreviation for a past that seems to be a very distant country as a result. and therefore emphasizes what is special and not universal in history. "Mojo" shows a strong performance from Ian Hart and annoying Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, with the latter still having trouble building a career after "trainspotting"; but it feels like a piece of temporary work, a modern film that is unintelligibly structured in an outdated way of expression. Actually rather boring.
