KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, I remember rating BOMB) was my introduction to the work of cult director Honda. this is not necessarily better? I just learned to be more tolerant of such a low price! <br /> <br /> Here we actually get two kongs for the price of one: an ugly and gloomy giant monkey and a robot version of it that looks even worse! The Simian creature lives on the island of Mondo (!)? showing how he fights against a few other monsters and makes friends with a trio of people. Of course it falls to the blond (and threadbare) heroine; In fact, is a Femme Fatale in Cahoots more interesting with the movie's vicious crazy genius? exclaimed Dr. Who wears the anemic look and cape normally associated with a vampire. He kidnaps King Kong and hypnotizes it to retrieve the element X trapped in the icy deserts of the river North Pole; Apparently, the giant monkey is more radiopaque than its mechanical counterpart (and to ensure its full cooperation, who even captures its three "companions")! The agent then has a heart change, helps the hero (one of whom is usually a nondescript American) and is killed by Who. Kong finally escapes and comes to Tokyo, where there is a final showdown with the robot. The doctor escapes from the ensuing chaos in his lower house? which at the request of Kongs Dreamgirl is devastated by the giant monkey for a short time.
