It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but Hostel is definitely a lot worse. This movie is funnier and more ridiculous than scary. I mostly laughed when I saw it. Low quality effects (if you see it, you'll understand what I'm talking about, and HOW LOW quality is that), bad actors (I'll hear from them for the first time) and it seems they're shot by an amateur camcorder (so see rather like a TV show than a movie). But at least I had the patience to see it through to the end. Like comedies? Look at it. Do you want horror? Take a look at Ju-On: The Grudge or another good horror movie. <br /> <br /> When I talk about the legend of Diablo, I do not even know if I can classify it into a horror genre. Just a little low-budget crap. <br /> <br /> I rate it with 3 out of 10 points
