Wow, I can not believe people think this is a 'good' movie. Now I have seen much worse, but there are much more romantic / funny comedies with John Cusack. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre film at best. While acting was not terrible, but not great for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There were many loose ends that did not show up or were not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters appear as complete cowards. They do not know each other well enough to realize that they do not love the people they are working with. How do we know they are not in love? Due to the complete lack of remorse both characters have to leave their finances. I can imagine a few more romantic things than the constant escape from the commitment shown by these two. <br /> <br /> The movie does not even end with a wedding scene, most likely both will get cold feet and each will drop others like hot potatoes as soon as a commitment approaches. This film is really about two people who can not commit to anything, unlike Cusack's earlier characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.) /> The biggest failure of this film was the total absence of any twists or anything of interest. When the movie was over I felt like they had not climaxed into the story, which basically fits the movie: boring. No excitement about whether the two will come together, no joy in doing so, no consequences for their actions. It is sad that people are so blind to the shabbiness of this movie that they simply rebut criticism of "Everyone is too cynical!" Criticizing this film is not cynicism, but an unbiased examination. There are many other better romantic comedies, even with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is great, try these movies out and your hearts will explode, Big Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Keeping the Faith, Charade, Rear Window, North by Northwest or There Something about Mary (which is a good exploration of the idealized romance towards today's society).
