The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars is not one she had to tackle on screen. Rather, the puzzle is why this everlasting rating disappointment is still in the air. This week marked a low point for Veronica Mars: She was 146th out of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be Big 5). Yes, you've read that correctly. Veronica Mars was beaten by every show of the now deceased WB and every show on UPN. It was defeated by all shows on Fox and of course all shows on ABC, CBS and NBC. <br /> <br /> Now the Hip-Hypesters will say: But that was a re-run. But everything on TV this week was pretty much a re-run! It baffles the minds why CW would disappoint these proven ratings as it was one of the few shows saved by UPN. Favors are exchanged and influenced. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? The line "Veronica Mars has potential" is clearly dead after having two years to establish itself and failed. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's Joel Silber's influence and influence, but honestly I'm at a loss Why should someone choose to spend his punch on a bad show that does not see an audience? <br /> <br /> A big mystery and a very unfavorable debut for CW.
