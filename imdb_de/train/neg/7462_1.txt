Direction must be the problem here. I've recently heard John Cleese talk about a sketch for Fawlty Towers. He should attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too weak and not funny. The second branch was too stiff to be funny. The third was only weak enough to be funny. This attention to detail is missing in "Corky Romano". No matter how awkward a cartoon piece was, it was not repaired and left on the tailoring floor. The only value I can find in this film is the study of a very flawed film that somehow got into distribution without being repaired. <br /> <br /> I've scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews that praise this absolute waste of time reinforces my suspicion that some people are being paid to promote titles. I can not understand how anyone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than a 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can not imagine that anyone, even if he earns money, even rated only average. <br /> <br /> This makes my list of the 10 worst movies ever. And hey, I like the Three Stooges and can even tolerate Ed Wood!
