When many people say it's the "worst movie I've ever seen," they tend to say that about virtually any movie they did not like. Of the nearly 700 films I can ever remember, it's one in two that I no longer personally feel insulted and angry. By the way, this is my first movie critic, and I signed up with IMDb just to get excited about the viciousness of this movie. I saw it when it was in the theaters (me and my two buddies were three out of five people), and after 15 years I can not remember many peculiarities, but my attitude on leaving the theater is still clear. <br /> <br /> --- spoiler warning --- <br /> <br /> Oh my god, where should I start? The fat loser stays at the altar, goes on a ski weekend, meets a blonde bomb who cares about him, takes him home to meet the family, they are all cannibals and he's the main gang, pathetic attempt at a dramatic one Escape, all kicking their asses and running away with their brother's girlfriend, they live happily ever after. Kotzen. First, the gags are so bad that I took a while to understand that they were trying to be FUNNY and that this was a COMEDY. The few special effects look like 15 years ago. The big dramatic ending was so hokey and badly played that it was almost unbearable to watch (he hits the entire cannibal family with Harken lying on the lawn Tom and Jerry notice when they step on it). I am sure that there is much, much more, but I do not intend to see it as a refresher.
