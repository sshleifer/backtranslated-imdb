If you do not know how pathetic the whole thing is, this movie will not mean much to you. An attempt was made to bring a bit of humanity into a cold and gloomy time that is consumed by alcohol and drugs - it does not work. <br /> <br /> When Salma Hayak plays her big disco number, her voice is so obvious You could say it's pathetic - the producers could at least have had someone who sounded like them from a distance. <br /> <br /> The documentary that has recently been televised is far superior and gives a much closer look at this time our story. <br /> <br /> Nobody, with the exception of Mikey Myers, could be accused of acting; However, he does incredible work.
