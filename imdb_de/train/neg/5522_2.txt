I searched for the right words to describe this movie. Initially, I tended to skip over to more important things, as the movie does not rise to a level worthy of comment. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I stopped being puzzled about how to describe it and being intrigued by the challenge of asking, "What can one say about such a movie?" Rubbish? No, it's not trash, garbage can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gas? No, it's not a greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help plants to grow big and healthy. <br /> <br /> Finally, with "Not even bad", I proposed a revision of the term "distress even wrong", which is sometimes used in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worth the correction is. That's it then, Georgia Rule: Not bad.
