This is only the second time I felt compelled to comment on imdb's movie. The first time was probably the best movie I've ever seen, and that was for Memento. Seeing Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst movie I've ever seen had the misfortune to see. Apart from the two scenes in which naked women are, there's nothing in this movie that could lift him out of the garbage heap he's in. <br /> <br /> Let's see if there are effects, clich√© script, bad drama and also about 90 minutes long. My wife and I laughed the biggest part in disbelief at how bad it was. Amazingly, I've seen it to the end, how I did that, what I do not know! AVOID!!!
