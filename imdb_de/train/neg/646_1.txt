I saw this movie by accident and this movie was a coincidence ... well, it must have been. Blond women are persecuted, the villain appears and then disappears by the minute, disappears and reappears. He was not even a superhero, so I do not know how he did it cat and that's not hard to do. <br /> <br /> the old "mirror in the bathroom" is just not scary anymore, in fact it has stopped being scary years. They had the cop on the rogue's track, another clich√© (played by Idris Elba with a very convincing American accent, he's from London) "what a COMEDY look was scary - pathetic!
