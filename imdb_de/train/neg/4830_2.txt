REALLY? REALLY???? If you shoot a political war movie, you'll notice, but this movie was just garbage. Terrible in every way. In many ways terribly inaccurate. I find it easier to believe the President of the United States that he agrees, flies a jet fighter, and shoots aliens. It's easier to pay attention to the few things that were right. My chin clicked when I saw someone saying that this movie was the best in the last 25 years. It was dubbed, seemingly meaningless action redirections, and sometimes had questionable cinematography. <br /> <br /> X-Box, YouTube, ACUPAT Utilities? Has anyone checked that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like you have to do a lot of research, it was only five years before this movie came out. I am an Iraq war veteran and if you spent a day with an infantry platoon or an EOD squad, you would see how B.S. This movie is. To compare this with Platoon or Saving Private, Ryan is ridiculous. Why do not you just throw Commando and Red Dawn in there? I think that could be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If for any reason you can see past the incredible conspiracy, the historical and actual disagreements, this movie may be fine. Nothing more. If you keep hearing "Oscar Buzz" and add your own pompous review, continue. I write to the director to see if I can get my 131 minutes back.
