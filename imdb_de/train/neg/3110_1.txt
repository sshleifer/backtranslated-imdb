I usually come to this website before going to the cinema because I like to see what other people think about the movie. I've read a lot of reviews that say, "Thriller, not a horror movie." This caused me to try this movie. I really have to deal with these "thriller / horror" statements as it was not! I almost left and reclaimed my money, and if you have enjoyed the trash of many reviewers ... Well, you must be happy! At the end of the movie, people behind me said loudly, "What a waste of time," and I turned to them and replied, "I could not have summed it up any better." I've always been waiting for something to happen ... but it did not. There was the potential for a lot of good fear (or thrill, if you like), but nothing happened. Williams played the role pretty well, but I felt he was missing out on a bad script that was going around and nowhere to go. Save your money, this is a turkey that will soon be seen in a "bargain box" near a DVD store!
