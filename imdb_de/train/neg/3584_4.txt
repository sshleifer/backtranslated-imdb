Interestingly enough, Rene Russo's eyes and his mouth - not Buddy the Gorillas - are the focus of "Buddy," a production of Jim Henson Pictures by Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope. Somehow, countless close-ups of Russo's face have passed in the post-production phase, and she literally fills the screen so often that the poor apes are eclipsed. Unintentionally funny, true story after Gertrude "Trudy" Davies Lints memoir about the wife of a wealthy doctor who turns her villa into a menagerie for pets and wild life. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it drips with serious sincerity. The film never sparkles with the kind of "family movie" magic he needed, and for too long both humans and animals seem to be clearly programmed (it does not feel right here). About ten minutes later, two chimpanzees throw around in Russo's kitchen and toss a butcher's knife (Alan Cumming's head is missing by inches); However, no eyebrows are raised because it's all fun. However, when the adult gorilla buddy goes crazy during a thunderstorm, the cops are called - and everyone stares at Buddy through the window as he whirls up the living room furniture. The furniture should be the least concern for anyone in this brilliant, to-good failure. But at least we know that Russo was in good hands: whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up shot, she gives Rene another extreme close-up. I wonder what the lipstick budget was on this picture? ** from ****
