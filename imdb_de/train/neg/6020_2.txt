I like end-of-day movies. I like B-movies. I was hoping that I would like this movie. <br /> <br /> I could ignore the bad effects, the often cruel music and the convulsive lines. I could ignore the unexplainable events, and the fact that the movie is constantly based on Deus ex machina is excusable given the subject. I could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to achieve world peace are the bad guys. None of these things kill the movie. What kills this movie is that it's easy and boring. Nothing really happens. Almost all the scenes in the film are designed so that viewers raise the morale of filmmakers, at the expense of a truly coherent story or any type of tension entertaining B-movie, looking elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
