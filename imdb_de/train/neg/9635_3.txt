IMPRESSIVE! Pretty awful stuff. The Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and meets with Arty director Joseph Losey to witness this unusually ill-conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow who keeps her henchman on an island fort on an island where she dictates her memoirs very loudly to an incredibly patient secretary. When the rogue Burton claims to be a poet and an old friend, Taylor realizes that her time has run out. Ludicrious at the extreme - it's hard to tell if Taylor and Burton are doing bad OR Williams's intention was to make their characters so unappetizing. If that's the case, then the show is brilliant! Burton murmurs his lines several times, including the word BOOM while Taylor yells at her. She is really terrible. So Noel Coward is Taylor's clever confidant, the "Witch of Capri". <br /> <br /> BOOM is probably about how volatile time is and how fast life moves - two standard Williams themes, but it's so wrong of Losey that Taylor and Burton are not for it In their mostly inane monologues, every substance in the film would have been completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has a stunning photography - the camera would have been out of focus to mess up the beauty of Sardinia! In the side cast are Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's imaginative doctor, and Michael Dunn as a malicious dwarf guard. Both he and his dogs make a series of Burton!
