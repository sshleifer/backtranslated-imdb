Not so bad, since it is credited (Hooper is much worse)? more disappointing for me. Such an imaginative concept that Hooper's economic focus never really claims, and even less in the smoky (apology) of wordplay. It's so scary and exaggerated in a deadly serious tone, it gets ridiculous and unfocused and easily telegraphs all the pessimistic mystery / conspiracy theory to end up on something completely abrupt. That's why the tempo is pretty sluggish and Brad Dourif (cool to see him in a lead role) seems to be struggling with an unbalanced performance, though he blends a slightly confused bizarre intensity into his off-color character. Although it is cheap, there is a competent technical attitude to it. However, it does not seem to be unusual with his idea, and instead he wants to cover with unpleasant bumps (some of which work) and strikingly steaming special effects (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper shows stylish frenetic images (even more towards the latter end), and the camera work is quickly maneuvered and the beaming score is stunning. Performances are everywhere in the shop with performances by William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Even Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small but amusing cameos. especially Landis. Nothing surprising, but it is passable.
