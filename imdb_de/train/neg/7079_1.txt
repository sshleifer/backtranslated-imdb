No reason to rent this strip. From the credits I knew that I was in trouble. <br /> <br /> It was filmed as if it were a soft porn movie, but there is really nothing erotic about it. Looking into the world of sex addiction is fascinating, but only to a point. Boring sex scenes, bad acts and cameos by Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to save this movie.
