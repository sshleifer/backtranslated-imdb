No wonder this DVD was released directly on DVD here in Australia, no redeeming features. The dialogue was hokey, the acting, awful and the script crappy !! Whoever thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or successor to the far superior 1980s John Badham Wargames, well, they had to be on something because it was a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was good at it, the eyewear / love interest, while Matt Lanter was good as the other leading actor - that's all. I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code to anyone, check out Hackers or the original Wargames movie - both are better than this crap!
