In the first it was mainly rats, but there were also some wasps and a huge chicken. However, this is just a gigantic rat period, well gigantic rats and a really small boy. This is about this growing boy and a scientist trying to help him so he accidentally builds huge killer rats ... you know what it's like. This movie has a few kills and its moments, but I think it's equivalent to the original. I just prefer a little variety in my huge creature movies. Well, that's not true ... I really like "Empire of the Ants", maybe giant rodents just do not interest me. All in all a pretty shabby movie, though he has a pretty weird twist of events in this one really bizarre dream sequence. I just can not recommend it.
