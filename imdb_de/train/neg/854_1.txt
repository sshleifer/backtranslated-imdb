Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, Please do not be fooled by "A Stanley Kubrick" trailer. This is a very bad movie that has unfortunately been hailed as one of the deadliest horror movies ever made. People should shake their hearts out while thinking about a real horror movie. There is no real horror in Shining at all. Instead, we find only a naive, foolish attempt to create shattering horror when they are different from reality. All that's good in the movie is the view of the icy valley. The hotel, where most of the actors were housed, seems to be good. A word about the actor Jack Nicholson looks like a lost, lazy soul that's never really sure what to do. There is not much to say about a bald guy, a colorful actor who is usually busy pampering a little actor. There is no need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy. It can not be avoided because the movie was made and poor Kubrick does not make any changes.
