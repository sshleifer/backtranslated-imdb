The movie was OK. Not bad, not good, just OK. If there was anything else in the theater, this would be skipped by far. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 also stunk, but I see that better than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for Harrison Ford or this other young punk, this will be a "sweet" movie for you. I personally would wait for HBO or blockbuster.
