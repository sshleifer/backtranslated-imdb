This movie sounded like a good one: 9 people were afraid of winning a million dollars. Unfortunately, it was not a good movie. There are several scenes that are far too long and really pointless like the dance scene. Some scenes are just an excuse to aim the camera at female parts of the body. The spectacle is bad, but some of the lines are amusing in their horror. What's really strange is that at the end of the movie, it's turning like a 5-minute western, and in the end, the turmoil, of which there were several, make no sense to the rest of the movie. It seemed the director was just adding stuff because he thought it would look cool, while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point. It just did not make sense. The only scary thing was the old people dancing down the hall, but that does not nearly make up for the rest of the mess.
