When I saw that IMDb users rated the movie with the bottom 250 films, I thought it was too hard, but I did not know that the low rating was absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved her Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were outdated. Of course, the joke is about Marlon Wayans playing an adult dwarf who was recently released from prison. He and his partner Tracy Morgan steal a diamond for a gangster. Things go awry and the smallest one has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple of Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. To get the diamond back, the dwarf pretends to be a retired baby, left in front of the unsuspecting couple at the front door. Of course, it is recorded and the drama begins in search of the diamond. <br /> <br /> The film features some Saturday Night Live actors and actresses including Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as In Living Color. All these talents, however, can not help the poor script and the jokes. <br /> <br /> The special effects that made Marlon Wayans look like a dwarf were fine. I mean, it was not 100% believable, but it was alright ... nothing great. I just wish the Wayans brothers had gone out of their way to develop a script with good jokes, rather than trying to shore up their bad script with cameos of their famous comedians and actresses. <br /> <br /> Waiting for cable or TV. It really is not worth anything.
