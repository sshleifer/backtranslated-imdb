The eighties were not very friendly to the former great star Charles Bronson. Bronson's scriptwriters started with "Death Wish II" in 1982 and ended up with this really gruesome movie from '89. "D.W. II" left little to the imagination in the portrayal of the rape and suicide of Bronson's daughter (a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in hideous details). "10 to Midnight" was a kind of horrible movie that made you want to take a bath afterwards. Nothing redeeming it. Other films such as "The Evil Men Do" and the other "Death Wish" films from that period were all about their brutal depictions of brutality and revenge between High Camp and High Barf. I am not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) had the impetus to show a tired-looking Bronson who is old enough to beat punks young enough to be his grandchildren, or whatever, but the inferior craftsmanship (and horrible scripts) of which movies usually destroy how little energy they have produced. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these films - is pretty well done, but really does take the movie with it in filminess. In this movie Bronson: sodomized a perverted John; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; allows a male prisoner to be raped by another prisoner; makes incredibly xenophobic remarks, among other things, I thankfully forgot. Also portrayed is the gang rape of a young Japanese woman (fortunately, this was outside the screens, though quite implied). <br /> <br /> What did the people think when they made this movie? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these terrible movies? Anyone interested in his best films can watch most of his films in the '60s and' 70s, including The Mechanic, Death Wish, From Noon to Three, Once Upon a Time in the West. , "Red Sun", "The Great Escape", "The Magnificent Seven", "Rider on the Rain" etc. etc.
