While most of the film is very amateurish, the kosher slaughter scene is played, but not untrue. Kosher law states that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches its skin. The scene of kosher slaughter is just as anyone knows who has seen one or the Peta movie has shown a kosher slaughter that cuts the animal's neck and cuts the gullet while it is still alive and obviously suffers. We must remember that the story is written by the victors. Is it even allowed to think that the Nazis were right? <br /> <br /> Does not say anything that the Nazis have banned this cruel religious carnage, and the Jews still practice it today?
