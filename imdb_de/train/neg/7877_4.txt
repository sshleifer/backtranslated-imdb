The creators of this film have created a future where not only are abortion and birth control illegal in every state, but that women are prosecuted for murder and sent to long prison terms. In other words, this movie is the worst nightmare for any liberal! The political agenda here is so stubborn and the style of the film is so modest that it loses steam fairly quickly. Regardless of which side of the fence you are on, I would recommend skipping it.
