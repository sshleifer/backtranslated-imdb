I've just realized that through the movie, I've lost valuable, valuable moments in my life and will never come back. This movie is not only paltry. It reminded me of any stereotypical black sitcom ever made. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia says it's a racial issue, apparently "white" people do not like it because it has no white actors. Buddy, I think you'll find the reason why no one liked it because watching dry paint is far more entertaining and funnier than this bunch of Drivel. <br /> <br /> Please stop creating crap films
