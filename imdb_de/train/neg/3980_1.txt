No, I'm not kidding. If they ever suggest a movie idea, they should be thrown out of the studio. I'm serious. Their films are the same in every movie, and all they do is travel to strange places, have a problem that they easily solve, hope to be popular, and make new friends. Think about it. If you have ever seen a movie with another plot, contact me and give me the name. These "movies" are bad excuses for being on TV and going to other countries. There is a reason why the movies never go to the cinemas. I'm sure that when they were very young, O.K. For movies, a studio boss has acquired all of his rights for 15 years, or something, so he can now, anywhere, make 17 films in other countries whenever he wants, with the studio's money. Get away from MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY! IT IS YOUR BEST!
